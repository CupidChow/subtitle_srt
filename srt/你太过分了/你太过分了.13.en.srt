1
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:07,862
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:16,435
Didn't you lower your value to sign a
contract with me in order to help me?

3
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:22,026
That's why all you need to do
is gratefully accept my help.

4
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:24,410
Only take what I give you.

5
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:28,574
I have another schedule,
so I should go now.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,726
Did you come to...

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,979
love another person again?

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,375
Is there something that you want again?

9
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:49,265
Then you'd do anything else again.

10
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,479
What is it you're trying to say?

11
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,298
What I'm trying to say is...

12
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,306
to get what you want and
to do what you want,

13
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:03,015
you'd even abandon your own child...

14
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:05,434
Ms. Yoo Ji-na...

15
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:14,278
Who said he's my son?

16
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:16,249
Then shall I reveal it?

17
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:18,844
Go ahead.

18
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,376
Go ahead and reveal it all you want.

19
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:31,421
That will be the end for you, too, Jung
Hae-dang, I mean, my imitator Yoo G-na.

20
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:38,492
If I become someone despicable to the public,
then what good will that do for you?

21
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:43,614
If the public found out that I abandoned
my child in order to live well on my own,

22
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,715
they won't even want to think of my face.

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,979
They won't even want to
think of me, so what

24
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:56,372
makes you think they'll
want to see my imitator?

25
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:04,268
That means your worth on stage
will fall, fall, and fall.

26
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:11,272
Even though the entire world would want
to expose my past, you can't do it.

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,560
Rather, you'd have to do your best to
cover it up in order for you to live.

28
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,357
That's the fate of Yoo Ji-na's
imitator singer Yoo G-na.

29
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:30,796
That's the fate you must live as my shadow.

30
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,016
Welcome.

31
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:15,954
I won't be able to appear on TV.

32
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:20,515
Is that so?

33
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:23,608
I practiced so hard.

34
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:27,500
It's fine. You'll have
another chance next time.

35
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:35,241
Whatever I do, I don't think I'll
ever be able to break away from it.

36
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,353
I don't think I'll be able to change.

37
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,351
Is that why you look like
it's the end of the world?

38
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:11,368
- You're disappointed, huh?
- I told you to come to me at times like this.

39
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,671
You're very disappointed, aren't you?

40
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:23,335
No, I'm not.

41
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:29,320
If it worked out perfectly in one shot,
then anyone can go on TV, even me.

42
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:32,281
Please comfort Hae-dang a lot.

43
00:04:32,843 --> 00:04:35,070
Did you come all the way
just to tell me this?

44
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,642
I'm sure Hae-dang is upset,
too, but when I thought

45
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:41,857
about how you'd be disappointed,
I became heartbroken.

46
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:45,075
I'm fine. I'm fine.

47
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:51,107
I'll do everything I can to
get her another opportunity.

48
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:53,537
Okay.

49
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,263
You should lift up your
head and look at me.

50
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,344
I might end as just a nightclub singer.

51
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,029
So what?

52
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:37,440
Will you really be by my side then?

53
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:40,993
Should we leave to the countryside?

54
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:45,073
I can teach piano to the kids
in the neighborhood, and when

55
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:49,103
the sun falls, we can hold hands
and walk along the beach.

56
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,479
How will we able to survive off of that?

57
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:56,732
We'll survive if we have money. If we
don't have it, we can just starve.

58
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:04,336
My benefactor left me enough
money to live off of.

59
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,896
We can get an oven that makes bread.

60
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:13,225
The neighborhood kids will learn piano
because they want to eat the bread.

61
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:19,033
The kids who are dressed up nicely
and have their hairs tied up neatly

62
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:22,935
by their mothers will be giggling
as they run around the piano.

63
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:29,739
Just thinking about it
makes me feel at peace.

64
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:36,910
When it's sunset, we could sit side by side
in the yard and drink aromatic coffee...

65
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,333
while we talk about our
tired, disappointing youth.

66
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,146
Will such a day really come?

67
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,771
All you have to do is stay by my side.

68
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,849
You'll still be really young then.

69
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,372
I'm going to live this
lifetime just for you.

70
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:18,105
Eat it with rice, too.

71
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,809
What are you doing here?

72
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:26,528
Your father told me to
eat ramen before I go.

73
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:30,005
Welcome, my daughter.

74
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,079
It's okay. It's okay.

75
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:46,458
You came here on purpose because you
thought my dad would be disappointed?

76
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,037
It's not even good news anyways.

77
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,744
I thought you'd have a hard
time telling him yourself.

78
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:54,276
What are you looking at?

79
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:56,591
It is really nice to have an agency.

80
00:07:56,912 --> 00:08:01,052
Why would you bring that up now?
If you're grateful, just say so.

81
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:05,950
Or you can just admit you were touched.

82
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,161
If you hadn't said that, I
would've been really touched.

83
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:10,748
Go inside.

84
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,066
You have a warm heart.

85
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:16,884
- I'm not nice to just anyone.
- Then why are you being nice to me?

86
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,992
Stop fishing for compliments.

87
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,466
Thank you.

88
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:26,998
Don't think about anything and just get a
good rest. I'll take care of everything.

89
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:14,412
You.

90
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,208
Come out.

91
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,716
I feel apologetic towards you,
since the rookie celebrity

92
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:32,941
you're making such an effort
on can't go on TV anymore.

93
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:38,619
Instead, should I buy you a drink
at a place with a nice atmosphere?

94
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,529
- What?
- This is all your fault.

95
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:46,208
This is too low.

96
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,278
- She dared come to argue with me.
- "Dared?"

97
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:52,609
You ruined Jung Hae-dang's manners.

98
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:54,568
So you're blaming me?

99
00:09:54,904 --> 00:10:00,733
Do you remember what you did to me in
your office in order to lift her spirits?

100
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:04,793
You should take out your anger on me. Why
would you block the future of a weak person?

101
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,746
No matter how much you try to lift
her spirits, in the entertainment

102
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:11,793
world, she'll have to crawl
on the floor in front of me.

103
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:13,364
"Crawl on the floor?"

104
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:17,802
If you truly care for her, don't
side with her in front of me.

105
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,989
Every time you offend me, I'll
stomp on her just for fun.

106
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:24,826
"For fun?"

107
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:30,669
Since you're showing your true
colors, you're really worth seeing.

108
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,622
What is it you want from me?

109
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,021
What do you want from me?

110
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:40,779
Is this what you want?

111
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:50,372
Fine. If you really want it
that much, I'll just do it.

112
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:58,013
You're really cruel.

113
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:01,810
How could you do this to
the woman who likes you?

114
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:10,380
What are you two doing in my yard?

115
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:12,709
She was begging earnestly
to me, but since she

116
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:14,477
didn't get things done her way, she stomped

117
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:19,125
on my weak rookie celebrity I've worked so
hard on like she was nothing but a bug.

118
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:22,706
- It's a misunderstanding.
- What?

119
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:25,354
The PD in charge cut her off
because she didn't make the

120
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:28,125
auditions, but Hyun-joon
misunderstood it as my fault.

121
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,296
Do you really want to die in my hands?

122
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:33,446
Go inside.

123
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,191
Since you bring out your true colors,

124
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:42,266
not only are you worth seeing, but
you're also a very frightening woman.

125
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:48,492
Oh, my head hurts. I won't be
able to eat dinner tonight.

126
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:53,524
Didn't you hear me tell you to go inside?

127
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:04,786
Did the PD really cut her off?

128
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:14,877
That rascal may be a mess, but he's not
someone to misjudge the situation.

129
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:22,125
You must have more trust in your
son that I thought you had.

130
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:26,785
The only thing I don't like
is the fact that he hates

131
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,860
me and how he's acting
arrogantly to annoy me.

132
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,594
He's my son, so why wouldn't
I know what he's like?

133
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:43,522
According to Park Hyun-joon,
is good at judging

134
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,712
the situation, these are my true colors.

135
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,930
How do you feel seeing them?

136
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:52,875
Were you disappointed?

137
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:56,242
Why did you block the success
of that rookie singer?

138
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,727
Was it a way of protesting because
Hyun-joon won't give you the time of day?

139
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,430
Do you want to stoop that
low to get his attention?

140
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:11,563
I don't want...

141
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,571
the world to see her.

142
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:19,743
Why not?

143
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:24,431
Because she'll make them think of my youth.

144
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:30,531
Because they'll realize I'm getting old.

145
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:34,953
The love from the public
is like a passing breeze.

146
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:38,972
How can you still think of
grabbing something so ephemeral?

147
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,552
Do you know what I threw away...

148
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,721
to grab something so ephemeral?

149
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,774
I did it because I was afraid I would
lose the love from the public.

150
00:13:56,977 --> 00:14:01,383
I even broke the promise
of going back to get him.

151
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:03,157
To get who?

152
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:14,703
I can't let the public realize I'm getting
old just because of a mere imitator singer.

153
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:38,242
Don't help the singer
Ji-na is trying to block.

154
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:42,047
- What?
- Don't let her appear on TV.

155
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:46,367
Look here, Mr. Park Sung-hwan.
Do you think that makes sense?

156
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:49,180
If you're my son, just listen to me once!

157
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:51,149
I told you I don't think
of you as my father!

158
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:57,578
Now do you realize what kind
of horrible woman she is?

159
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,258
Even though I do, it's too late.

160
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:07,024
In any situation, I'm on her side.

161
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:09,219
In any situation?

162
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,774
So don't use her to pull
any funny tricks on me.

163
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:20,266
She was asking for it when she
stomped on an innocent person!

164
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:23,536
Now I realize...

165
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,086
that you two suit each other.

166
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,639
I wondered why you, someone who
will bleed blue blood when

167
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,946
pricked by a needle, would be
so hung up over one woman.

168
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,305
You two are very alike.

169
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:42,469
That must be why you love her.

170
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:48,281
Yes. That's why I love her. Are you happy?

171
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,774
She's not worth your love.

172
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:53,985
I don't love a woman in
order to respect her.

173
00:15:55,462 --> 00:16:00,524
There are plenty of woman
in this world to respect.

174
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:03,805
Yet why do I love her?

175
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:07,063
Because she won't be
able to live without me.

176
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:11,446
Because something might happen
to her if I leave her alone.

177
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,214
Because my heart breaks.
Because she haunts me!

178
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,758
Because I can't hate her no
matter how much I try to!

179
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:27,173
How can you say that in front of me
when I'm heartbroken over dead mom?

180
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:31,766
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

181
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:42,969
Find out the boy in this photo.

182
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,227
It's not easy to find
out what happened after

183
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,428
she ran away in the middle of the night.

184
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,950
I can't even found out
where she had run away to.

185
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:53,977
So how can I find out
what happened after that?

186
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,786
- That's why I'm asking you.
- I'm sorry.

187
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,810
Do whatever you need to in order
to find out about this boy.

188
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,692
Find out what happened to him after
that, where he is right now, and

189
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:06,521
what he's doing at the moment, even
if you have to pour money into it.

190
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Yes, sir.

191
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:16,489
(The woman in the picture is Yoo Ji-na...
Who is the little boy with her?)

192
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,927
What did you do with my ring?
Are you keeping it safely?

193
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:31,973
I need to sell it to
supplement for the deficit.

194
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:34,403
We lost money because of
Bong-sun's dentist treatment.

195
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:40,927
- Leave the car at home tomorrow.
- The car?

196
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:44,893
I need to learn how to drive. My
driver's license would be a waste.

197
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,028
You're at an age where people stop
driving, so why would you do that?

198
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:50,647
Because I want to go for a
drive whenever I feel stuffy.

199
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:54,175
If you get into an accident, the
insurance will rise. That's all money.

200
00:17:55,912 --> 00:18:00,833
Hey, do Bong-sun and I look like
money-eating machines to you?

201
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,471
I'm done eating.

202
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,396
Is there anyone who will
teach you to drive?

203
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:14,263
Of course. There's your father-in-law.

204
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,302
Even couples get into a fight when
they're teaching how to drive.

205
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:20,833
My friend almost got a divorce because she
learned how to drive from her husband.

206
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:23,036
That's because she's a fool.

207
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,989
Goodness.

208
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:35,496
Why are you driving like this? The car
isn't even budging. Step on it, will you?

209
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:39,170
- Don't talk to me.
- The sun is going to set.

210
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:41,919
Fine. I'll speed it up.

211
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,177
Stop! Stop! Stop!

212
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:49,458
How can you speed up at a red light?

213
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:51,341
Why are you yelling at me?

214
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,810
It's red! Can't you see the red light?

215
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:57,583
My feet are shaking right now.

216
00:18:58,045 --> 00:19:00,872
If you yell at me, I might
crash into something.

217
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,849
Gosh.

218
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:06,539
The signal changed. Go.

219
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,177
Can't you hear the cars
behind you are honking?

220
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,193
Go.

221
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,591
That damn fool! Why does he keep
following me and honking at me?

222
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,747
Handle. Handle. Handle.

223
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:25,336
There's nothing in front of you,
so why are you moving to the side?

224
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:28,841
Didn't you see that car?

225
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:31,441
Jung Kang-sik, don't you dare yell at me!

226
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,833
Am I your wife? Why are you yelling at me?

227
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,044
Look to the front! Brake! Brake!

228
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:48,864
I've never seen someone with such
awful motor nerves like you.

229
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:55,028
This won't do. Just take a taxi.

230
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,302
I don't have the money to take a taxi.

231
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:59,419
Then just walk.

232
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:05,645
Look at the other woman. Can't
you see how well they drive?

233
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:08,331
Stop nagging and just teach me the way.

234
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,872
Where do I go? Left or right?

235
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:13,802
Left or right?

236
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,513
Just get out. I'll drive us home.

237
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:19,979
Park over there.

238
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:24,888
- Turn signals!
- Turn signals?

239
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,528
What's this? What's this?

240
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,411
How can you let go of the steering wheel?

241
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:42,159
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Okay. Calm down.

242
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:46,685
- Turn signals.
- Turn signals.

243
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:48,005
Now. Now.

244
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,122
Now. Now.

245
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,396
No, it's too late!

246
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:55,599
You can't even switch lanes?

247
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,130
I can't do it with you scolding me!

248
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,677
- Now. Now.
- Now? Now?

249
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:05,919
- Yes. Hurry up and go in.
- I'll do it!

250
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:09,818
Today is my funeral day!

251
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,208
Park! Park! Park!

252
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:15,638
Brake!

253
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:22,223
Get out!

254
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:25,536
Hurry up and get out!

255
00:21:30,045 --> 00:21:32,185
I said get out!

256
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:38,036
How dare you drop the honorifics!

257
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:40,872
Do you think I can keep the honorifics
with you in this situation?

258
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:56,880
Excuse me. You didn't do anything
to deserve being mad at me.

259
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,443
Is there anyone who knew how to
drive ever since they were born?

260
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:07,677
If I'm scared, but you yell at me,
do you think I'll be able to drive?

261
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:11,106
You should thank me for
risking my life to teach you

262
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:14,196
to drive, so why are you
yelling at me, Mrs. Baek?

263
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,783
Goodness. See one, and
you've seen them all.

264
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,294
You're a man with zero tolerance.

265
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:22,380
What? "Tolerance?"

266
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:25,146
You treat me like I'm stupid
just because I can't drive.

267
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:27,662
All you need to do is grab
the steering wheel and

268
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,913
put your feet on and take
your feet off the pedal.

269
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:34,357
It's much easier than riding a bicycle,
so why can't you do it, Mrs. Baek?

270
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:38,269
Goodness! You must get
an award for not knowing

271
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:41,451
how to do anything but drive, Mr. Jung!

272
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:43,575
How dare you!

273
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:47,151
I know the real you now. You conned us into

274
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:50,974
thinking you were a generous man!
It's just a show!

275
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:55,521
Goodness! I'm speechless!
Are you done talking?

276
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,028
Are you my husband? How
dare you yell at me!

277
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,966
Goodness. You're all bark and no bite.

278
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:04,791
You're good at talking, so why
are you so bad at driving?

279
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:12,497
Hey!

280
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:22,972
She'll stomp on her just for fun?
Why, that woman...

281
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:30,388
- I have good news.
- Good news?

282
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,832
- A PD of another program contacted me.
- Really? What program?

283
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:38,677
It's called "Star King of the King."

284
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:42,521
It's a show where people with
special talent go out on.

285
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:45,528
What do I do on the show?

286
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:47,739
You'll imitate the singing of Yoo Ji-na.

287
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:52,537
It's a show where all you have to do
is amuse people with your talent.

288
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:57,044
You need to do whatever you can
to show yourself to the world.

289
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:00,521
- I'll do it.
- Really?

290
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,950
It's not a music show, but I'm not in
the position to be picky right now.

291
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:07,504
I like variety shows more.

292
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:10,927
I'm really good on stage, you know?

293
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:13,996
I'll do whatever I can to amuse them.

294
00:24:14,732 --> 00:24:17,280
You can't make those comments
you make in a nightclub.

295
00:24:18,302 --> 00:24:20,974
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- As expected, you're brave.

296
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:26,107
You're pretty good at what you do. How
did you manage to get this chance?

297
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:29,261
The PD from the other
show felt bad about your

298
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:32,170
cancellation, so he suggested
you to another PD.

299
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:36,310
Really? I'm so grateful.

300
00:24:36,537 --> 00:24:39,294
So all your hard work
wasn't useless, after all.

301
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:44,614
You're right. The entertainment
world is just another neighborhood.

302
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:49,161
Of course. If you work
hard, there will be a way.

303
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:51,896
Okay! Let's go!

304
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:58,206
- Stop it.
- How can I stop it?

305
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:03,677
Who is in charge of that program? There
should be someone higher-up than the PD.

306
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:05,629
What are you trying to do?

307
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:09,872
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

308
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,707
You weren't like this before.
What's happening to you?

309
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:21,739
Stop being arrogant and just do as I say.
Don't you understand what I said?

310
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:25,130
The time has come for me to quit.

311
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,120
What are you so uneasy and doubtful that

312
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:30,217
you're going crazy over
a mere imitator singer?

313
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:34,585
I don't want her to be a part of my life.

314
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:41,302
I have a bad feeling that she'll
be in every alley I go to.

315
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:45,927
I hope you can keep your dignity as a
senior in the entertainment industry.

316
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,958
I don't want to, so stop it.

317
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:57,355
Whether you meet the PD, one in charge,
or the entertainment director, stop it.

318
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:58,841
Just stop it!

319
00:26:07,638 --> 00:26:10,203
Can you call my parents every afternoon?

320
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:13,011
- I didn't even do it during our newlywed phase.
- I just

321
00:26:13,628 --> 00:26:16,677
thought they would feel reassured
if they heard your voice.

322
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:19,008
I don't have time for that.

323
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:45,382
(Yoo-jin)

324
00:26:46,498 --> 00:26:47,986
Lunch was delicious today.

325
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:51,749
While we ate together, it
felt like all the years

326
00:26:51,774 --> 00:26:54,717
had vanished and we were
back in the States.

327
00:26:55,506 --> 00:26:57,172
Call me. I'll be waiting.

328
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:06,081
(The message will be deleted)

329
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:28,267
Why are you staggering? You're young, but
you don't have any strength in your legs.

330
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:32,446
Why? Is something wrong?

331
00:27:33,282 --> 00:27:35,891
Of course not. It's nothing.

332
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:39,415
Hyun-sung ate lunch with Yoo-jun.

333
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:42,399
Did you hear that from Yoon-hee?

334
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:45,254
He talks on the phone with
Yoo-jin once per day.

335
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:54,972
Come and eat dinner.

336
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:01,298
- Who did you eat lunch with?
- The employees.

337
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:03,985
Honey. Park Hyun-sung.

338
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Never mind.

339
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:17,522
- Why do you need your phone during dinner?
- I might get an urgent call.

340
00:28:27,814 --> 00:28:30,282
I do all the hard work and
somebody gets all the credit.

341
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:32,180
What kind of hard work did you do?

342
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,430
Please don't let that woman meet Hyun-sung.

343
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:40,798
How can I do that?

344
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,673
Just tell her I'm pregnant.

345
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:44,320
You want me to lie?

346
00:28:44,475 --> 00:28:48,415
Make up any excuse you can so she won't
get any funny ideas about Hyun-sung.

347
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:53,587
- What if you get caught?
- I'll just say I got a miscarriage then.

348
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,641
Then how about you lie
directly to grandmother?

349
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:00,407
Then she'd drag me to the
hospital to confirm it at once.

350
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:03,194
She was the first one who
lied to Yoo-jin that

351
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,556
you and Hyun-sung were
using separate rooms.

352
00:29:06,673 --> 00:29:10,606
- What did you say?
- She's using any means to get Yoo-jin.

353
00:29:11,907 --> 00:29:16,264
How can she do that when
I'm alive and well?

354
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:19,313
Hwangsung Group's second
daughter-in-law was

355
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:21,913
kicked out even though
she bore two children.

356
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:25,296
Do you think grandmother cares about you?

357
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:28,865
She'll make Hyun-sung get married
like he was never married at all.

358
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,600
Yoon-hee, please help me.
You're the only who can.

359
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:36,694
- Is that so?
- Of course.

360
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:40,162
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

361
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,444
Then how dare you cause a rift
between Hyun-joon and his father!

362
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,217
Did you hear?

363
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:58,341
How much did you hear?

364
00:29:58,748 --> 00:30:01,389
I heard that you made
Hyun-joon and his father

365
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:03,997
to be on irreversible terms.
Is that not true?

366
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:11,153
Yet, you dare tell me I'm the
only one who can help you?

367
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
You did well.

368
00:30:14,123 --> 00:30:18,479
Park Hyun-sung will inherit the company,
and Jo Yoo-jin will become his wife.

369
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:21,649
You've made an effort with
that shallow brain of yours

370
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,411
to do all the work and give
the credit to someone else.

371
00:30:26,787 --> 00:30:29,489
This is why one's origin is so important.

372
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:32,521
How can you be so fearless?

373
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,721
No need to get up. Just
do what you were doing.

374
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:54,763
- Hello.
- You come here often.

375
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:57,716
Mrs. Sung wanted to arrange flowers.

376
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:00,513
You don't need to answer her.

377
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:06,879
What do you want to eat for dinner?

378
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:13,330
She can make everything. Tell he what you
want, and let's have a delicious dinner.

379
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,646
Would boiled sea bream in
soy sauce be possible?

380
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:23,776
Of course! I spent so much money to make
her learn cooking from all kinds of chefs.

381
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:29,521
What are you just standing there for?
Boil it sweetly.

382
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:35,107
Foods boiled in soy sauce must taste sweet.

383
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:37,263
I'll go change and come back.

384
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:41,919
When she first came to this house, she
couldn't even get the seasoning right.

385
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:45,193
People who eat the food can cook it.

386
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:48,954
But what could she have
eaten from her home?

387
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:19,763
Just let them be. She can clean it.
I'm going to put this in my room.

388
00:32:27,724 --> 00:32:28,724
Can we talk?

389
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:34,435
Why do you keep showing up
at our house like this?

390
00:32:35,935 --> 00:32:37,871
Mrs. Sung invites me.

391
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:40,989
Please refrain from doing so. It's not
polite of you to keep coming here.

392
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,782
If we're talking about
politeness here, you're the one

393
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:48,536
who got between Hyun-sung and me, Ms.
Ko Na-kyung.

394
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:50,021
Between Hyun-sung and you?

395
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:54,372
Na-kyung, how much do you
know about Hyun-sung?

396
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:56,232
I'm his lawful wife.

397
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,489
I know. That's why I'm going easy on you.

398
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,972
How dare you drop the honorifics.

399
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,802
The decision is up to Hyun-sung.

400
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,310
I should go. Mrs. Sung
will be looking for me.

401
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:28,529
I don't like her, so make sure she
can't come to our house anymore.

402
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:30,384
That's not something I can do.

403
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,669
- Are you secretly liking this?
- What?

404
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:37,350
Are you innocent then?

405
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,911
You're not only shallow. You're
presumptuous, too, aren't you?

406
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:43,524
Why would you mention innocence here?

407
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:46,438
Why would you eat lunch with her?
Why would you lie?

408
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:48,232
Are you digging through my phone now?

409
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,013
Were you happy meeting up with her?

410
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,880
So are you going to meet her again?

411
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:55,716
Don't you know I'm doing this
because I'm indebted to her?

412
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:58,419
She trusted me but got struck
by a bolt out of the blue.

413
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:02,700
- Don't you know my breakup with her was like ripping off flesh?
- Ripping off flesh?

414
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:07,857
If you love her so much, you should've ran
away with her. Why did you marry me then?

415
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:11,566
Do you think my father and grandmother are
the same people as they were back then?

416
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:16,233
They teamed up to make my
mom into a mental patient,

417
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:19,450
and it seemed like they were after me, too.

418
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:24,372
I married you because I was
naive and wanted to survive.

419
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:27,575
Then that should be done with.
What are you doing now?

420
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:30,303
You were the one who married me
after signing a contract that

421
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:32,701
you would only accept three
million dollars if we divorced.

422
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,646
Do you think that's a marriage?
It's a deal.

423
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:46,393
I'm sorry, but even when I look at your
eyes now, I have terrified thoughts.

424
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:05,815
Do you still have nothing to say to me?

425
00:35:06,627 --> 00:35:08,284
What do you want to hear from me?

426
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:12,268
I told Hyun-sung about the contract.
Did he tell you that?

427
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,290
Why did you tell hm that?

428
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:17,464
Isn't it obvious? Because I detest you.

429
00:35:49,331 --> 00:35:53,089
You scared me. I thought
you were Ko Na-kyung.

430
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:56,753
- How long will you stay here?-
Why are you curious about that?

431
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:59,558
- Don't you have any pride?
- Pride?

432
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:04,933
Are you staying here because Hyun-joon
won't look at you otherwise?

433
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:09,089
That's not something for
you to be so angry about.

434
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:10,847
Why not?

435
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:16,557
If you want to get angry, get angry at Park
Hyun-joon and move aside, so I can leave.

436
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:20,901
Why are you sticking around him
when you know he hates you?

437
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:27,042
You know he hates me, so why are you
afraid of me sticking around him?

438
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:35,003
The one with the least pride in
this family is you, Hong Yoon-hee.

439
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:41,097
- What?
- Both Mrs. Sung Kyung-ja and Ko Na-kyung have their points and opinions.

440
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:46,909
Yet, you're hiding behind Mrs. Sung and
acting like a foolish woman without a point.

441
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:48,536
A foolish woman?

442
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:51,745
Do you think I'm the one Park
Hyun-joon is crazy about?

443
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:54,472
What do you mean?

444
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:56,836
You're barking up the wrong tree.

445
00:36:57,175 --> 00:37:00,079
If you have nothing to say, all you
do is nitpick people's origins.

446
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:05,143
Are we in North Korea? Why do you
keep nitpicking people's origin?

447
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:07,636
Move.

448
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:20,378
Who exactly are you crazy about?

449
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:26,995
- What are you talking about?
- Yoo Ji-na told me I'm barking up the wrong tree.

450
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:29,034
Do you believe the things she say?

451
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,219
So who is it, if it's not Yoo Ji-na?

452
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:34,378
Do you think it works if I'm
the only one crazy about her?

453
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:37,011
Don't worry, and do what you always do.

454
00:37:37,113 --> 00:37:42,112
So you're admitting you're
crazy about someone, right?

455
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:47,073
Who is she? Should I find her?

456
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:49,295
Don't think of doing something stupid.

457
00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:08,972
You said your audition
had gone well last time.

458
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:11,370
Why did your appearance
suddenly get canceled?

459
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,808
Yoo Ji-na said she would only appear
on the show if I didn't come out.

460
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:26,393
Why would she do that?

461
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:30,907
Hae-soo told me you two
had been close until

462
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:33,243
you two had become distant
about one year ago.

463
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,073
Did something happen between you two?

464
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:42,112
You don't need to know that.

465
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:55,995
(Popular singer Yoo Ji-na dating
and living with wealthy CEO)

466
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:02,258
You abandoned your child and
went out into the world,

467
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,774
yet you block the success of a weak person?

468
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,354
I got better than last time, didn't I?

469
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,815
You practiced a lot.

470
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:36,143
I practiced so much to
get complimented by you.

471
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,956
Good job. Let's call it a day.

472
00:39:41,808 --> 00:39:44,175
You didn't forget about our
lunch date today, right?

473
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:54,964
- Should I turn on music for you?
- You can do whatever you want.

474
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:07,097
- Can I ask you something, madam?
- "Madam?" I don't like that.

475
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:10,456
- Then how should I address you?
- I'm not sure.

476
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:15,831
- I can't call you Ji-na when you're my mom's age.
- That's true.

477
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,972
Still, I don't like madam.

478
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:23,698
- Why not?
- It's not a mannerly way to address a single woman.

479
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,650
How did you live before you debuted?

480
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:31,339
Why do you ask?

481
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:33,308
Because I'm curious.

482
00:40:34,316 --> 00:40:38,104
I guess you have a right to be.
No one is born a star.

483
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:41,894
I'll tell you later when I have the chance.

484
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,900
We're almost here. We'll
be getting out soon.

485
00:40:50,683 --> 00:40:52,542
All you have to do is
walk straight forward.

486
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,257
Let me hold onto your elbow.

487
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:00,581
Like this?

488
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:13,331
It's not bad walking like this.

489
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:19,086
Won't people stare at you if you come to
places like this with someone like me?

490
00:41:20,894 --> 00:41:23,615
Who cares if they stare? Why
would you worry about that?

491
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:43,386
I was worried you would be uncomfortable,
but I worried for nothing.

492
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,104
Why don't you appear on talk shows?

493
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:50,222
In order to give off a mysterious image.

494
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,396
Nothing good comes from top singers revealing
their personal life to the public.

495
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:00,333
That's why there isn't
any information about

496
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:02,818
the days before you
debuted, so I'm curious.

497
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:05,176
I told you that I would tell you later.

498
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,834
- Do I not deserve to be curious?
- That's not what I meant.

499
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:14,433
All I can do is listen to what
someone else tells me anyways.

500
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:20,870
It's not just you. It's because I
haven't told anyone that story yet.

501
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:26,347
- Do you have a real name?
- Real name?

502
00:42:26,988 --> 00:42:32,448
When I think about your age, I don't
think Ji-na seems like your real name.

503
00:42:35,464 --> 00:42:36,573
It's not my real name.

504
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:40,500
- Then what is it?
- I don't want to tell you.

505
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,761
Come on. A name isn't that big of a secret.

506
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:48,792
It's dowdy and ridiculous. That's
why I don't want to tell you.

507
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:53,322
How do you expect to get close to me if
you don't even tell me your real name?

508
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:58,339
Of course, I really like you.

509
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,018
Can you feel that I like you?

510
00:43:02,988 --> 00:43:03,988
Yes, I do.

511
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:10,206
An amazing woman like you bought
clothes for a blind guy like me.

512
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:19,568
That's why it made me wonder if you have
any of your family members are blind, too.

513
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:26,628
Or else, you wouldn't have a reason
to be nice to someone like me.

514
00:43:31,331 --> 00:43:33,847
That's just what I felt.

515
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:50,655
Do you have any new information?

516
00:43:51,074 --> 00:43:54,339
The name of the little boy in
the photo is Lee Kyung-soo.

517
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,565
Lee Kyung-soo?

518
00:43:56,995 --> 00:44:03,511
The townspeople say that they saw the
little boy after Yoo Ji-na came back.

519
00:44:04,628 --> 00:44:07,498
Then where had she been before then?

520
00:44:07,933 --> 00:44:11,526
She had gone to the city to look for work.

521
00:44:11,855 --> 00:44:17,409
Then she showed up in her hometown
when the boy appeared as well?

522
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:18,956
Yes.

523
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:23,504
There's something I found
out from contacting all

524
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:27,594
the people Yoo Ji-na, I
mean Kim Hae-jung knows.

525
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:30,658
What is it?

526
00:44:30,683 --> 00:44:35,423
She has a friend who is a nurse
who works in another city.

527
00:44:36,017 --> 00:44:41,626
Yoo Ji-na had gone to her hospital with
the boy who had gotten into an accident.

528
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:46,665
Then something had
happened to the boy then?

529
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:52,399
The accident didn't end his
life, but he lost his vision.

530
00:44:58,353 --> 00:45:01,806
I'll let you know as soon as I
find out something new about her.

531
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:27,540
How could she do that to a blind child...?

532
00:45:29,502 --> 00:45:31,614
A blind child...

533
00:45:59,111 --> 00:46:00,837
What are you looking at and not eating?

534
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:06,915
I don't have an appetite tonight.
I'll excuse myself first.

535
00:46:08,158 --> 00:46:10,220
Why? The hot pot is delicious.

536
00:46:11,025 --> 00:46:12,025
Eat a lot.

537
00:46:18,158 --> 00:46:22,001
- Did something happen at work?
- Not something he would get upset over.

538
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:49,196
Did something offensive
happen outside of work?

539
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:51,837
I'm sorry, but I want to drink alone.

540
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:53,968
Are you telling me to leave?

541
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:56,743
I need to think about something.

542
00:47:00,494 --> 00:47:03,157
All right then. I'll go.

543
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:37,564
It seemed like you didn't eat much during
dinner, so I prepared cheese for you.

544
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:41,425
I'm going to go to the vacation
home and rest for a few days.

545
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,873
Let Hyun-sung know.

546
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:49,735
The vacation home? Is there
a problem with Yoo Ji-na?

547
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,070
I'll pack your things for you.

548
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:23,791
I'm sure of it. There is definitely
a problem between those two.

549
00:48:25,548 --> 00:48:26,548
Is that so?

550
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:31,212
If Yoo Ji-na leaves our house,
you'll forgive me, won't you?

551
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:34,930
What if that wicked woman has
completely fallen for Hyun-joon?

552
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,648
If father turns his back to her,
Hyun-joon won't ever look at her again.

553
00:48:40,008 --> 00:48:43,851
I really hope I won't
have to see her anymore.

554
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:45,733
I'll have good news for you soon.

555
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:50,992
- If you don't?
- If I don't, I'll have to add to it.

556
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:54,242
- Add to it?
- I'll find out what's wrong.

557
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:57,883
Then I'll add to it to make
him disgusted with her.

558
00:49:00,227 --> 00:49:04,633
Even after you suffered that much, you still
dare think about being smart with us?

559
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:23,833
I'm busy, so why are you
telling me to come all

560
00:49:23,858 --> 00:49:25,743
the way here? You should
just tell me in Seoul.

561
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:30,094
Is there something on my face?

562
00:49:30,907 --> 00:49:33,273
- Retire immediately.
- What?

563
00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:36,782
Just retire and live quietly by my side.

564
00:49:39,758 --> 00:49:44,083
- Why are you laughing?
- Because it's funny. Do you think you're making any sense?

565
00:49:44,406 --> 00:49:49,078
- Just listen to me.
- Why would I listen to you, out of all people?

566
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:53,617
How can you be that way?

567
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:56,141
I need to go before traffic hits.

568
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,367
Next time, if you don't have a good reason,
don't tell me to come out this far.

569
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:04,953
Do you think it's time for you to
bet your all to get Hyun-joon?

570
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:11,328
Don't think of messing with him.

571
00:50:12,454 --> 00:50:15,789
- What?
- I may despise him, but he's still my son.

572
00:50:16,586 --> 00:50:23,125
- What do you mean?
- I mean you don't deserve to be near him.

573
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:29,055
What's this? Am I supposed to say
this is a tear-jerking moment?

574
00:50:29,774 --> 00:50:33,195
Are you worrying about
your son's life right now?

575
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:39,847
Didn't you say so yourself that he's
the only humane one in my family?

576
00:50:40,985 --> 00:50:43,398
How dare you?

577
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:45,625
How dare I?

578
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:48,016
I'm the right one for you.

579
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,633
Since I'm full of sins, I'll
think of repaying for them.

580
00:50:54,649 --> 00:50:58,289
Retire and stay quietly by my side.

581
00:50:59,313 --> 00:51:00,406
I'm sorry.

582
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:06,734
I didn't have much interest
in you from the beginning.

583
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:08,875
What?

584
00:51:09,868 --> 00:51:14,250
Do you really want a taste
of this cruel world?

585
00:51:20,586 --> 00:51:21,901
Please come to your senses.

586
00:51:24,899 --> 00:51:26,699
Please come to your senses!

587
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:54,633
Must you really show your face on TV?

588
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,773
Give it up...

589
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:00,586
for my sake.

590
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:07,672
- Why are you so scared of me?
- I'm not scared of you. I'm just annoyed.

591
00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:12,633
I need to practice, so get out.

592
00:52:12,844 --> 00:52:16,281
What will you benefit from infuriating me?

593
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:20,273
How about we just get moderately close?

594
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,937
We can go back to the days
we first met each other.

595
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,391
"Moderately?"

596
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:30,555
By only accepting what you give me?

597
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:34,633
Do you think you'll turn into the real
thing by appearing on TV just once?

598
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:38,687
You should know your place
before you infuriate me.

599
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:50,367
What are you doing here?

600
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:56,023
You must have nothing else to do.
Don't you have any workers?

601
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:59,047
Get out. Get out at once!

602
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,789
This is exactly why her
manners are worsening.

603
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:06,944
Jung Hae-dang, agencies treat you
well at first, but once they

604
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:10,648
think you lost your worth, they
don't even glance your way.

605
00:53:11,662 --> 00:53:12,865
Don't misunderstand.

606
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:14,357
How dare you.

607
00:53:19,646 --> 00:53:21,388
You better not come here again.

608
00:53:21,646 --> 00:53:24,825
Do you remember me saying I
would stomp on Jung Hae-dang

609
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,694
for fun every time you
defended her in front of me?

610
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,201
Go ahead. Go ahead and stomp on her!

611
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:34,135
You may be the son of a
wealthy CEO, but this

612
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,051
industry doesn't work just
because you have money.

613
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:39,744
The entertainment world is my area.

614
00:53:40,647 --> 00:53:43,287
My area where I spent my youth!

615
00:53:44,631 --> 00:53:46,238
Do you think this is your yard?

616
00:53:47,569 --> 00:53:49,599
How dare you try to go against me.

617
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:24,023
What brings you here?

618
00:54:25,123 --> 00:54:29,357
- Have you been well, Mr. Jung?
- Yes, thanks to you. How long has it been?

619
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:31,176
It's been a long time.

620
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,927
What are you doing here without
calling us ahead of time?

621
00:54:34,162 --> 00:54:38,076
I had business in this area, so I decided
to drop by and say hello to Mr. Jung.

622
00:54:38,295 --> 00:54:40,849
Oh, yes. Thank you. Please come in.

623
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:47,177
Should I call Hae-dang?

624
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,927
Why did she show up here out of the blue?

625
00:54:52,061 --> 00:54:54,349
I came to ask you for a favor.

626
00:54:54,881 --> 00:54:57,068
What favor can you possibly
ask from someone like me?

627
00:54:57,444 --> 00:55:03,195
Do you know Hae-dang is
preparing to go on a show?

628
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:07,920
Yes. One show got canceled, but
she's preparing for another one.

629
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,154
Please stop her.

630
00:55:13,225 --> 00:55:16,818
- Pardon?
- It's troublesome for me.

631
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:20,201
Is that so?

632
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:27,435
Before, you said your family was
able to live because of me, right?

633
00:55:27,662 --> 00:55:30,576
Of course. Yes, that's true.

634
00:55:30,897 --> 00:55:34,564
Hae-dang doing this is
awfully troublesome to me.

635
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:37,733
If you can give us a legit
reason how and why she'll become

636
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:40,427
troublesome for you, I'll stop
her with my own bare hands.

637
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:43,029
How can you speak that way to Ms.
Yoo Ji-na?

638
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:45,405
Why are you getting so angry at me?

639
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:49,935
Aren't you the one who answered Jo
Sung-taek's phone on the night he died?

640
00:55:56,459 --> 00:55:58,537
No matter how much I think
of it, it's your voice.

641
00:55:59,373 --> 00:56:03,662
Don't you remember that me calling?
If it wasn't you, then say so.

642
00:56:05,842 --> 00:56:07,584
If it wasn't you, then say so!

643
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:11,865
Didn't you two become
distant ever since then?

644
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:15,115
It's not something you should meddle in.

645
00:56:15,537 --> 00:56:18,537
Why not? It has to do with my sister.

646
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,177
Hae-dang has always lived with the mentality
that she would die for her sisters.

647
00:56:24,771 --> 00:56:26,740
Yet, you tell me not to
meddle into her business?

648
00:56:27,779 --> 00:56:31,412
How can you say something so rude, Ms.
Popular-singer-yoo-ji-na?

649
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:34,670
How dare you show up here.

650
00:56:36,045 --> 00:56:38,670
Stop her from coming out on TV
because it's troublesome for you?

651
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:41,458
Do you want to die by my hands?

652
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:43,419
Take her to her room.

653
00:56:43,444 --> 00:56:46,060
She has people on her side, too!

654
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,561
Do you want me to spread
the fact that you stole

655
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:51,067
your imitator singer's boyfriend
all over the internet?

656
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:57,747
I'm sorry, but I think
you should leave now.

657
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:22,505
What do I do?

658
00:57:26,224 --> 00:57:27,778
I'm too offended to eat these.

659
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:33,247
Should I throw them away? I
can't throw away food though...

660
00:57:33,498 --> 00:57:38,412
Go upstairs and give it to them. Don't
tell them where you got this from.

661
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:41,357
Mrs. Baek.

662
00:57:44,638 --> 00:57:46,864
- What's this?
- Fruits.

663
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:48,958
Where did you get this from?

664
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:52,396
I forgot and bought two baskets.

665
00:57:53,654 --> 00:57:56,411
Didn't you hear I don't have
the living expenses anymore?

666
00:57:56,794 --> 00:58:00,169
- I did.
- So why did you forget again?

667
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:03,208
Anyways, enjoy!

668
00:58:07,787 --> 00:58:10,763
I'll have to hurry up and put these
in the fridge. Oh my goodness!

669
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:13,739
These are expensive fruits!

670
00:58:17,138 --> 00:58:18,138
What's this?

671
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:26,224
- She must have given you pocket money.
- Who? Who would give me pocket money?

672
00:58:26,364 --> 00:58:27,536
How much is this?

673
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:33,606
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten
thousand, hundred thousand...

674
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:40,139
Five hundred thousand dollars?
Five hundred thousand dollars!

675
00:58:40,326 --> 00:58:45,060
What? You can't even count anymore.

676
00:58:45,935 --> 00:58:49,950
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten
thousand, hundred thousand...

677
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,560
What does this money mean?

678
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:03,942
She asked me to stop Hae-dang
from appearing on TV.

679
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:10,177
Yet, she would give you such a big amount?
She has a big hand.

680
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:11,771
I'll go change.

681
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,278
She must be returning it to her.

682
00:59:19,303 --> 00:59:20,653
Of course she should.

683
00:59:21,623 --> 00:59:23,872
Let me look at it one last
time before she returns it.

684
00:59:24,162 --> 00:59:29,427
Wow. This is the first I see a
check with hundred thousand in it.

685
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:31,850
I've never seen a thousand
one before either.

686
00:59:31,876 --> 00:59:34,380
Should I take a picture? We can
look at it from time to time.

687
00:59:34,653 --> 00:59:35,685
Goodness!

688
00:59:46,669 --> 00:59:48,817
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

689
00:59:53,193 --> 00:59:56,786
Maybe that woman canceled her
TV appearance last time, too.

690
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:59,806
Oh, you're right, seeing
that she gave such a huge

691
00:59:59,831 --> 01:00:02,345
amount to stop Hae-dang from
appearing on TV this time.

692
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,396
I think she stole
Hae-dang's boyfriend, too.

693
01:00:04,692 --> 01:00:06,208
What do you mean?

694
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:10,169
Hae-sung asked, but Ji-na didn't deny it.

695
01:00:10,576 --> 01:00:13,880
What? What a horrid woman!

696
01:00:14,334 --> 01:00:17,013
If I had known, I would've
ripped out her hair!

697
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:19,411
Gosh! How dare she do that to Hae-dang.

698
01:00:19,646 --> 01:00:23,286
- I'm going to spread this on the internet!
- Just stay still.

699
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:30,481
Right? I should just stay still
and not cause trouble, right?

700
01:00:31,974 --> 01:00:35,216
You really don't know celebrities
by just looking at them.

701
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:38,044
She pretended to help out, but
she stole Hae-dang's boyfriend?

702
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:40,356
Gosh. What a scary woman.

703
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:47,153
I'm wondering if Hae-dang is suffering
a heartache just to go on TV once.

704
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,896
The entertainment world is frightening.

705
01:00:50,004 --> 01:00:54,466
We have Mr. Park. He'll protect her.

706
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,911
What would we have done without him?

707
01:00:57,209 --> 01:00:58,911
My goodness.

708
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:05,466
Where are you right now?
I'll come where you are.

709
01:01:06,294 --> 01:01:07,505
What is it?

710
01:01:07,974 --> 01:01:11,771
You're famous, so how
could you act so rudely?

711
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:17,448
I'll go wherever you are, so
tell me where you are right now.

712
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:21,896
Will you be able to come
find me if I tell you?

713
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:25,825
I'll use my navigator,
so tell me right now!

714
01:01:57,388 --> 01:01:58,388
What's this?

715
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:02,856
I thought you wouldn't take it, so
I gave it to your father instead.

716
01:02:03,138 --> 01:02:06,138
Did you think he would accept this?

717
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:11,060
He'll be more sorry about the
money thank you think he is.

718
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:14,028
- What?
- He doesn't have a retirement plan.

719
01:02:14,053 --> 01:02:19,028
He'll become more and more miserable
living off his daughters.

720
01:02:19,412 --> 01:02:22,747
Do you really want to be scolded by me?

721
01:02:22,935 --> 01:02:25,981
How much do you make at
the nightclub in a month?

722
01:02:27,185 --> 01:02:34,419
Give this money to your impoverished
family and be free from them.

723
01:02:35,302 --> 01:02:38,349
Don't talk about my family.

724
01:02:38,584 --> 01:02:44,477
All you have to boast about is the fact
that you suffered for your family.

725
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:49,891
You suffered for your siblings while
others abandon their children.

726
01:02:53,279 --> 01:02:57,864
- Did you use that to seduce Park Hyun-joon?
- What did you say?

727
01:02:58,193 --> 01:03:02,771
All you do is live off of singing my
songs, but I hate the way you look at me.

728
01:03:04,677 --> 01:03:07,750
You're pointing out that I'm a woman
who abandoned my child, aren't you?

729
01:03:12,693 --> 01:03:18,153
I don't need the tearful money you
made from abandoning your son.

730
01:03:18,904 --> 01:03:22,255
If five hundred thousand dollars aren't
enough, I can give you a million dollars.

731
01:03:26,091 --> 01:03:30,106
Even if you give me a million dollars,
I won't live as your shadow anymore.

732
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:35,380
Even if I have to beg for food,
I won't live as your shadow!

733
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:43,403
You said if you go under,
I'd die with you, right?

734
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,435
Fine. I'm glad you brought that up.

735
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:52,388
Even if we die together,

736
01:03:55,044 --> 01:04:01,302
I have no intention of living as your shadow
anymore, Ms. Popular-singer-yoo-ji-na.

737
01:04:30,326 --> 01:04:31,326
Hyun-joon...

738
01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:35,294
Hae-dang, what are you
doing here at this hour?

739
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:15,067
(You Are Too Much)

740
01:05:15,092 --> 01:05:17,815
She'll come running when I tell her to.

741
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,760
Am I crazy? Why would I like her?

742
01:05:19,852 --> 01:05:20,852
Just date me.

743
01:05:20,877 --> 01:05:23,130
Hyun-joon broke up with you?

744
01:05:23,155 --> 01:05:25,247
If you're curious, sit
in that room and listen.

745
01:05:25,272 --> 01:05:28,271
I'm so happy. I didn't know
such a day would come for me.

746
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:34,276
I didn't have the slightest will to live,
but now I feel like I want to live.

747
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:35,550
Just trust me.

748
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,878
Did you do this? It seems as if
you're searching for something.

749
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:43,022
Something is unusual, isn't it? Father
must have heard something shocking.

750
01:05:43,129 --> 01:05:46,612
I had a close friend named Lee Kyung-soo.
