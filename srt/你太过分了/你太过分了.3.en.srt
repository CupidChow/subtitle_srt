<i>[Episode 3]</i>

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,809
Sung Taek!

4
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,449
Sung Taek!

5
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,603
Hae Dang.

6
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:46,612
Did you see the person who just
went in? Wasn't that Sung Taek?

7
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,658
Jung Hae Dang.

8
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:49,726
Yes?

9
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:54,985
What will it take for you
to break up with Jo Sung Taek?

10
00:00:57,615 --> 00:00:59,015
What?

11
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:01,106
Give him...

12
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:03,481
to me.

13
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,233
Yoo Ji Na.

14
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:09,945
I think I have to live with him.

15
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,846
So...

16
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,522
let me have him.

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:23,093
Hae Dang, you still have lots of
opportunities to meet new people.

18
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:25,751
But I don't think I can
live without that man.

19
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:29,787
I need someone who won't see me
for what I am on the outside

20
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:32,644
but see me simply as a woman

21
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:35,617
who needs to be taken care of.

22
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,134
Didn't you...

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,480
say you would come to like me?

24
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,118
I know you like me a lot.

25
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,042
If you know, how could you?

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,646
Do you... not care about someone like me?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,885
If I say no, are you going
to give him back?

28
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:18,441
Why'd you ask then?

29
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:23,382
I was not the one who made a move
first if that's what you're thinking.

30
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:30,179
It's only going to hurt you
the longer you hold on to him.

31
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,759
It's been 10 years.

32
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,978
You said we were like a married couple.
We didn't have a wedding...

33
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,400
but we're practically a married couple.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,258
Do you think it's unfair?

35
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:46,793
Yoo Ji Na.

36
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,467
If you think this is unfair

37
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:52,467
then think of this as a way of paying
your debt to me and forget about him.

38
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:57,800
Do you know how hard
it is to make one hit song?

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,790
Countless hours of
hard work and investment.

40
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,854
And you sang my hit
song like it was yours

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,650
without permission.

42
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,025
If you think of it as the price
that paid for your heat and food

43
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:18,349
in exchange for the blood
and tears I spilled for my success

44
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:20,681
then you won't
think this is so unfair.

45
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:29,086
So, think of this as a way to pay
your debt and forget about him.

46
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,209
You're here early.

47
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:28,557
I was planning on having
a beer and taking a nap.

48
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:42,471
Was your schedule tough? You look tired.

49
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:46,675
You're confident that you're going
to stay with me until the end, right?

50
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:57,858
I thought you were already
sick of me. You scared me.

51
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,451
I bet everything on this.

52
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:02,096
I can't do anything.

53
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,819
I almost got into a car accident.

54
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:12,052
I couldn't get the sound of your breath
going in and out out of my head.

55
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:15,547
I didn't know being in love

56
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:20,007
meant that my body would shake all over.

57
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:23,029
Even if my singing career ends

58
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:26,435
even if people throw rocks at me

59
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:28,541
you're going to stay by my side, right?

60
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,524
When I think about you as my woman

61
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:34,968
I feel like my heart is going to burst.

62
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,827
Hug me.

63
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:14,555
<i>It's colder than I thought.</i>

64
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,538
I told you to dress warm,
but you didn't listen.

65
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:19,281
I didn't know it would be this cold.

66
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:21,791
I'm okay! Don't worry!

67
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:28,853
I said I was okay.

68
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:33,142
Isn't this weird?
I don't think it matches...

69
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:38,067
It doesn't match.

70
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:40,608
Who are you trying to impress?

71
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,867
<i>Is the meat cooked well?</i>

72
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:56,915
You'll know after you eat.

73
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:59,067
Why are you staring at me like that?

74
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:01,694
You said to look at
you when I talk to you.

75
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,663
<i>I think my life as a woman is over.</i>

76
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:19,689
Is that really determined by one person?

77
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,995
<i>Hae Dang.</i>

78
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:32,076
That man... is no good.

79
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,677
Break up.

80
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,468
Should I?

81
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,774
He's going to give you trouble later.

82
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:44,288
No. No.

83
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,406
It doesn't feel good.

84
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:52,314
I don't know what it is,
but something doesn't feel good.

85
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,740
- Be careful. Be careful.
- That hurt.

86
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,543
It's all the same when old women drink.

87
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:02,343
You think that's going to work?
She's going to hurt her arm and neck.

88
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:07,117
What is this? Wait.

89
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:10,230
Be careful. Be careful!

90
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:17,355
<i>This is so good. It's so crunchy.</i>

91
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:20,290
Why aren't you eating? It's good.

92
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:25,439
Why aren't you eating?

93
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:54,455
I'm sorry, but the store is closed.

94
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:03,559
Can I just sit for a little bit?

95
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,274
Our employee left so
we can't make you coffee.

96
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:12,354
I'll just drink some
hot water and then leave.

97
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:14,256
Please find a comfortable spot.

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,231
I'm sorry, but please come and take this.

99
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,923
I can't see.

100
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:44,533
Oh really? I'm sorry.

101
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:22,167
Is the piano going to be too noisy?

102
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:28,573
It doesn't matter to me. Don't worry.

103
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:47,511
<i>I was not the one who made a move
first if that's what you're thinking.</i>

104
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:54,585
<i>It's only going to hurt you
the longer you hold on to him.</i>

105
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:25,927
What time should I leave?

106
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:30,052
Don't worry. You can leave
when you feel comfortable.

107
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:57,462
I didn't know a person
could feel this warm.

108
00:11:57,462 --> 00:12:01,904
If you fall asleep, just go
to sleep. I'll move you.

109
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:04,808
Should I retire?

110
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,581
If you want.

111
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,495
Then I would be a plain old lady.

112
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:15,797
It'd be better for me
since I'd get to see you more.

113
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,791
Why does it make me so happy
to hear such obvious things?

114
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:28,129
Did you

115
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:32,534
say the same words to Hae Dang?

116
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:36,561
I told you not to mention Hae Dang.

117
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:37,923
How can I not?

118
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,443
Don't say anything about
her unless I bring it up first.

119
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,331
When are you going to say it first?

120
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,355
<i>Let's get married.</i>

121
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:05,865
<i>Let's say that your second
sister is busy with her life.</i>

122
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:08,572
<i>Don't you think your second
sister's salary will be enough?</i>

123
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:13,190
<i>Is your family the only
thing you think about?</i>

124
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:45,580
<i>Seol Wa... She's my daughter, right?</i>

125
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:49,380
I knew it. I knew this
was going to happen!

126
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,684
See? I was right! It was her daughter!

127
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:57,471
Are they trying to play
around with the viewers?

128
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:01,275
Don't watch it. Don't watch it.
Why are you getting mad as you watch?

129
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:05,259
How can I not watch?
I have to watch her suffer.

130
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:08,128
Raise your standards.

131
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:12,297
- What are you doing, Mom?
- I'm reading a book.

132
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:14,082
What book?

133
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:18,442
"100 Years of Solitude?"

134
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,842
The title was so beautiful
that I had to buy it.

135
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:24,437
What's it about?

136
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:29,431
What kind of book is...
I have no idea what it's saying.

137
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:33,364
I'm guessing it's about
100 years of solitude.

138
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:35,296
Why are you reading that?

139
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:41,203
"100 Years of Solitude..."
The title itself is solitude.

140
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:45,032
Mom. Do you know even
know what solitude means?

141
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:46,388
Why wouldn't I?

142
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:49,518
Just bring your standards down
to my level and watch this with me.

143
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:54,092
I have more than 12 regrets in my life

144
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,841
but my biggest regret is
not being able to study.

145
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:01,682
Saying that at your age... What were you
doing when everyone else was studying?

146
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:04,279
I was raising a fine daughter like you.

147
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:07,866
You worked hard.

148
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:14,607
You're late.

149
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:15,897
You didn't go to sleep yet?

150
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:19,725
Why are you coming home now?
You didn't even have work today.

151
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,097
You just got here?

152
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,789
- You didn't go to sleep?
- I was reading.

153
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,375
Dad, if you're not tired, then should
we open up a can of whelk?

154
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,397
Just go to sleep.

155
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:32,522
Using me as an excuse
because you want to have some.

156
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:35,232
That's going to become a habit
for someone who's still single.

157
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,144
Okay. Then, good night.

158
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:42,085
Wait! Aren't there some
cockles left over from dinner?

159
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:44,294
If we leave them in the fridge,
they won't taste good.

160
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:47,628
Let's finish that
with half a bottle of soju.

161
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:49,072
Just half a bottle, okay?

162
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:52,005
Goodness me.

163
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:02,779
You want a drink too?

164
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,407
Do you want to talk after
you give that to Dad?

165
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:07,989
Talk?

166
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:30,025
Of course, I should do that.

167
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:31,427
Are you confident?

168
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:34,264
You did it, so I should do it too.

169
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:37,293
If you think it's going to be too hard,
it's okay to say you can't do it.

170
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:39,466
I should do it if I'm told.

171
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,666
Wasn't it hard for you too?

172
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,650
But I...

173
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,590
can't live the way you do.

174
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:55,139
I can't tie myself down to our family
and live like my life doesn't exist.

175
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:59,797
Give me a set deadline
for how long it will take.

176
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:02,893
After that, there is
something I want to do.

177
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:08,345
If Hae Jin hadn't insisted on
standing in front of a podium

178
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:11,136
I wouldn't have thought
of being a teacher.

179
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:16,229
Even if everyone wants to be
a teacher, teaching is not my style.

180
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,167
To be honest, in our family situation

181
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,472
how can Hae Jin think
of being a professor?

182
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:25,530
How can we stop her when she
says she has the skills to do it?

183
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,469
Are you talking about me?

184
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:30,505
- What brings you here?
- I ran out of coffee.

185
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,493
Hae Sung.

186
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:41,030
If you have something to say, say it
to me instead of saying it someone else.

187
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,977
Sometimes if you
hear something you don't like

188
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,923
you should pretend you didn't hear it.

189
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:47,423
Honestly, I'm more cautious
around you than our older sister.

190
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:49,990
Oh really? This is how you act
when you're being cautious?

191
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,991
- Jung Hae Sung!
- Be quiet!

192
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:53,696
Dad's going to hear us.

193
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,986
Go ahead and live however you want!

194
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:04,027
She said to be quiet.

195
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:07,762
You're right. I'm living off of Hae Dang
and it should have been me next

196
00:18:07,762 --> 00:18:09,849
but I'm sorry I skipped my
turn and it became yours.

197
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:12,586
But do you have to brag because you
provide a small income to our family?

198
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:14,546
- Brag?
- What do you call it then?

199
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:16,579
That disgusted look you have
when you look at me!

200
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,432
Disgusted?

201
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,143
You want me to actually brag?

202
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,599
Quit your studies now!

203
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,713
- Hae Sung.
- She's going to get married.

204
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:29,949
From now on, we have
to live off of my salary!

205
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,063
I'm going to rent the upstairs
to pay off the loan

206
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:38,234
so you'd better clean it out right now!

207
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:40,041
What are you saying to your sister?

208
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,330
If you wanted to study, then you
shouldn't have decided to get married.

209
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,478
If you wanted to get married, then you
should've married someone with skills.

210
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:49,615
You do everything you want,
so why are you always complaining?

211
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:53,815
What did you do that makes
you think you're so right?

212
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:56,583
I'll... leave the house.

213
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,167
See, see?

214
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:02,278
You can't stand to hear a word you don't
want to hear because you're so proud.

215
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:06,531
Make sure you leave the house.
Or else! Do it now!

216
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,452
Are you done?

217
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:11,304
What are you guys doing in front of Dad?

218
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:14,151
I should't have even brought it up.

219
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,849
Dad, please go to sleep.

220
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:19,798
Please don't fight. Don't fight.

221
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:23,711
My heart races when you guys fight.

222
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:28,030
Even if we die from hunger, don't fight.

223
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:40,407
Everything she said was so bitchy.

224
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,344
You want a beer?

225
00:19:44,344 --> 00:19:48,010
You deserve a drink after letting
out your temper like that.

226
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:57,550
It is true that what Hae Jin says is over
the top, but you also fire back at her.

227
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,132
Are you taking sides?

228
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:02,950
Why would you tell her to get out?
You know her situation perfectly.

229
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,414
Oh my gosh... I am
surrounded masters to serve.

230
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,409
Didn't you see Dad's face turn
white because he was so scared?

231
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:34,829
You scared me!

232
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:40,029
Why aren't you sleeping? Why are you
staring me down like a ghost?

233
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:42,826
- Let's get a divorce.
- What?

234
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,467
This is as far as can I go.
There is no other way.

235
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:48,288
- Let's get a divorce.
- No! I'm not doing it!

236
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:55,198
- They need us to empty the second floor!
- Really?

237
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:57,300
She's going to rent it out
to pay back the loan.

238
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:02,157
Hae Dang must be struggling a lot.

239
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:03,935
She's getting married.

240
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:05,624
Really?

241
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,881
We should start preparing too then.

242
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,924
You should stop drinking and go to sleep.

243
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:29,461
Those rotten kids...

244
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:33,190
How dare they... in front of you.

245
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,121
I feel like they won't even
pay any attention to you

246
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,996
when you get old.

247
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,881
Who cares?

248
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:45,393
As long as they live happily.

249
00:21:45,393 --> 00:21:47,459
There is nothing more
for you to pay attention to.

250
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:52,192
Stop doing this and go your own way.

251
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:54,742
Where would I go?

252
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:58,108
I just said it for the heck of it.

253
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,136
Bring him to our house.

254
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:03,648
Just do it this spring.

255
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:07,582
If you date for too long,
it's not good either.

256
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:13,777
You can just have a small
ceremony and start a life.

257
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:16,490
Is there much to life?

258
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:26,578
You're just eating them like that?

259
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,978
They're fine like this.0

260
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,209
If Mom were here...

261
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:37,993
you would feel much less lonely.

262
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:40,388
What do you mean lonely?

263
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:43,305
I'm fine living with you guys like this.

264
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:22,654
<i>If you think of it as the price
that paid for your heat and food</i>

265
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:25,654
<i>in exchange for the blood
and tears I spilled for my success...</i>

266
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:30,661
<i>then you won't think this is so unfair.</i>

267
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:33,165
<i>So...</i>

268
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:36,265
<i>think of this as a way to pay
your debt and forget about him.</i>

269
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,438
Really?

270
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:49,979
That's great news!

271
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:53,817
After everything she went through,
she is finally getting married.

272
00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:55,404
It's great news?

273
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,827
Of course!

274
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:01,940
Your mother can finally breathe
and be at ease up there.

275
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,834
So, we have to move now.

276
00:24:06,073 --> 00:24:08,193
Move? Why?

277
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:10,496
Since we have to live off of
only Hae Sung's income now

278
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,071
we have to rent this place
to at least pay off the loan.

279
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:19,160
You guys really don't even
have that much money?

280
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,554
Then we'll have to find a smaller place.

281
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,663
We'll have to adjust.

282
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:29,313
I'm sure we can find a place where
the five of us can live together.

283
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:32,419
- It's not five, Mother.
- Then what?

284
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,099
The three of us are going
to find a two bedroom place.

285
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,200
Then what about me and her?

286
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:46,412
What did you do with
all the money you earned?

287
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:49,124
How can you not even afford
a decent place to live?

288
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:51,108
You're asking me that right now?

289
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:54,071
Who should I ask then?

290
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:57,644
If you really want to know, then ask him.

291
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,897
But hey... Why do you have
to be so rude about it?

292
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:12,130
All of your sisters are nice.
What's the matter with you?

293
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,454
You're going to lose
your blessings that way.

294
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:16,536
I'm sorry to hear that.

295
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:23,767
"I'm sorry to hear that?"
Listen to the way she talks.

296
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:28,144
Her mother wasn't like that.
Who did she learn it from?

297
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:32,931
You're not in any position to worry
about who she's like right now.

298
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:37,484
- What?
- We can barely afford a place for us.

299
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:39,078
What are you and Bong Seon going to do?

300
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:42,440
You don't even pay rent.
What did you do with the money?

301
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,047
I lost it all
in the stock market last year.

302
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:49,788
You lost it on what?

303
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:52,355
Everyone downstairs knows!

304
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:56,086
Great job! Great job!

305
00:25:56,086 --> 00:26:00,438
I know that you're my son now!

306
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:06,013
Both of you are troublemakers!

307
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:14,814
- Are you going to school?
- Where else would I go?

308
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:18,282
It must be hard dealing with kids

309
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:20,881
that don't even listen
to their parents, right?

310
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:24,203
It's not high school. I don't have
to deal with kids that don't listen.

311
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:25,866
It's their loss.

312
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,218
You're right.

313
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:33,848
Our daughter-in-law is always
so right about everything.

314
00:26:33,848 --> 00:26:37,053
She is so smart.

315
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:39,731
Hoon, I'll see you later.

316
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,561
Bye, Mom!

317
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:43,576
Let's go together!

318
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,755
- I'll be going.
- Okay.

319
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:47,807
Have a good day.

320
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:52,102
Our mom is really desperate.

321
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:55,868
You think this is funny?

322
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:57,511
Mom!

323
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,762
Your stocking is ripped.

324
00:27:38,762 --> 00:27:40,502
Really?

325
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:43,501
I'm already late... Where?

326
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:45,596
How do you fall for it every time?

327
00:27:49,483 --> 00:27:52,069
You talked to me first!

328
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:15,915
<i>Mom.</i>

329
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:18,082
<i>Don't worry.</i>

330
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,498
<i>I'm going to live happily.</i>

331
00:28:52,685 --> 00:28:55,553
Is it bland or salty?

332
00:28:57,522 --> 00:28:59,123
I don't know.

333
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:06,435
<i>[Madam]</i>

334
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:17,196
<i>The number you are trying to call
cannot be reached. Please leave...</i>

335
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:32,836
We slept in so late that we're
having breakfast during lunch time.

336
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:35,193
Wow. What is all this?

337
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:36,942
It doesn't taste that good though.

338
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,442
That's not good.
I have to eat it as if it's good.

339
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,191
It tastes weird, right?

340
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:53,156
Don't eat it. Don't eat it.

341
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:55,525
You're even good at cooking.

342
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:57,001
Really?

343
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,327
You scared me!

344
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,423
This isn't a big deal,
so why does it make me so happy?

345
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:13,221
I told them not to schedule any jobs.

346
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:15,423
First, I want to take cooking classes.

347
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:17,788
Only good things await.

348
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:20,300
Do you know why I thought
of cooking classes?

349
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:25,240
I want to be better at
cooking than Hae Dang.

350
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,065
10 years is plenty of time for you
to have gotten used to each other.

351
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:32,287
I'm going to change
your eating habits first.

352
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:35,288
It's not like we officially
settled down and lived together.

353
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:36,836
You had a call.

354
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:40,438
- Who?
- Madam.

355
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,339
I'll erase it.

356
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:45,022
What did you tell her?

357
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:48,276
I said that a friend needed
help with work in a rural area.

358
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:51,382
I told her not to call

359
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,529
because I was staying with my friend.

360
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:56,376
When are you going to tell her the truth?

361
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,676
- I will.
- When?

362
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:02,356
- Soon.
- When is soon?

363
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,121
I can't handle it if you do this.

364
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:10,873
Can't handle it? What do you mean?

365
00:31:10,873 --> 00:31:13,451
You don't think this is hard for me?

366
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:17,597
Like I said, I don't even
know my parents' faces.

367
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:20,195
I lived my life only looking at her.

368
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:23,711
Then why did you choose me?

369
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:33,137
Okay. Sorry. Let's eat.

370
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,267
Are you going to call her?

371
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:50,836
Why are you so worried?

372
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:52,865
You're younger than me.

373
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:56,919
That's enough to make me worry.

374
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:01,916
I understand that it's caused by pain

375
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:07,522
and I understand that you
want to be honest with me

376
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:11,912
but Hae Dang causes me pain.

377
00:32:15,722 --> 00:32:17,915
I'm going to need time.

378
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,823
<i>[Jung Hae Dang]</i>

379
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,012
Hello?

380
00:32:39,012 --> 00:32:40,709
<i>It's me.</i>

381
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,807
<i>Sung Taek is not answering his phone.</i>

382
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:47,135
Please let me see him once.

383
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:48,992
Why?

384
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:54,913
You two have no reason
to see each other anymore.

385
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:56,913
You guys weren't even married.

386
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:02,009
Just please let me see him once.

387
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:06,140
I didn't tell him that I saw
you in front of my house.

388
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,664
You understand what I'm saying, right?

389
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:13,246
Don't worry. It won't take long.

390
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,307
Hey, it's me.

391
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:48,791
You have to eventually see her
at least once to talk to her.

392
00:33:53,403 --> 00:33:58,461
<i>While I was playing</i>

393
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:09,983
<i>the green leaf boat I left...</i>

394
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:19,835
<i>When I'm back with my mom</i>

395
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:23,018
<i>lying down...</i>

396
00:34:25,222 --> 00:34:31,643
<i>I remember.</i>

397
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:57,032
Excuse me... I have to pay but I think
your worker went somewhere.

398
00:34:58,101 --> 00:34:59,913
You can just leave it on the table.

399
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:01,936
Should I?

400
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:06,202
You're the one who
came here late last time

401
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:09,202
and left after drinking
only hot water, right?

402
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:15,143
How did you...

403
00:35:15,143 --> 00:35:19,668
People like us are great at
remembering people's voices.

404
00:35:21,264 --> 00:35:26,242
Your voice is similar
to someone I know.

405
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:29,724
So similar...

406
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:33,199
to when the person was younger.

407
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,898
Especially...

408
00:35:37,297 --> 00:35:39,536
when you sing.

409
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:53,228
Did you have to bring
me to a place like this?

410
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,632
Aren't you sick of hearing rumors
about our engagement breaking off?

411
00:35:56,632 --> 00:36:00,302
A decent number of people
who know us will be here.

412
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:02,213
Should we care?

413
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:04,827
I care.

414
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:06,978
Make sure you try to smile naturally.

415
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:11,911
I guess I'm expecting too much.

416
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:27,197
Oh my gosh. I didn't think
I would see her here.

417
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:30,556
- That's her.
- What do you mean?

418
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,903
She's the woman your father
has been head over heels for.

419
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:38,748
She's...

420
00:36:38,748 --> 00:36:40,557
Yoo Ji Na?

421
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:52,865
You must like this artwork.

422
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:56,550
Hello.

423
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,150
Hello.

424
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,164
I didn't think I would see you here.

425
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:04,880
Thank you for your introductory gesture,
but I'm looking at the artwork right now.

426
00:37:06,922 --> 00:37:08,958
I'm sorry.

427
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:13,753
I wanted to introduce myself because
I believe I will see you again soon.

428
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:16,976
I'm sorry if I was distracting you.

429
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:19,465
Who are you?

430
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:23,402
Chairman Park Sung Hwan is
going to be my father-in-law soon.

431
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:27,289
Ah, is that so?

432
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,791
Let's acknowledge each
other next time we meet.

433
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,054
I don't think there is a need to do that.

434
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:37,552
- Is that so?
- I'm going to look at some other art.

435
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:49,807
She didn't fail my expectations.

436
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:54,809
- She didn't?
- She's just as shallow as I expected.

437
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,614
Really?

438
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:05,311
I see something different.

439
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:08,414
Why do men always
fall for women like that?

440
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:10,706
You suffered the same way before.

441
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:17,532
Anyway, is your father
the only one who's in love?

442
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:19,989
She said she has no
reason to see him again.

443
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:21,467
Really?

444
00:38:33,402 --> 00:38:36,114
I know this was a hard
decision to make. Thanks.

445
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:40,130
You said to push my way in first
whether I'm tortured or served.

446
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:44,030
You can't back out easily. Think about
your mother who passed away.

447
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:53,867
Welcome.

448
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,405
Grandmother! Hyun Joon is here.

449
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:05,260
It's not time for her afternoon
nap yet... I wonder if she's sleeping.

450
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:13,943
Are you really happy?

451
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:17,753
Of course. Our entire family
can live together now.

452
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:20,664
We will know if you really are later.

453
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:37,052
Since you're here, try not to
make trouble in the house.

454
00:39:37,052 --> 00:39:39,083
We will keep that in mind.

455
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:44,393
Anyway, isn't it about time
that we start our search?

456
00:39:44,393 --> 00:39:48,387
We can't leave that
spot empty for too long.

457
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,192
Are you serious?

458
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:52,016
It hasn't even been
that long since Mom left.

459
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:55,326
Did I say I want us to have
the wedding right now?

460
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,726
I'm saying let's slowly
start to choose someone.

461
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:10,048
Your grandmother
and father are still eating.

462
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:25,190
They said to go downstairs for tea.

463
00:40:28,222 --> 00:40:31,438
Grandmother is amazing.

464
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:34,614
It's as if she was waiting
for her to pass away.

465
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:39,927
She even resents
her dead daughter-in-law.

466
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:43,420
The relationship between a mother-in-law
and a daughter-in-law sure is scary.

467
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,523
Hyun Joon won't let that happen.
Don't you know his personality?

468
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,523
No need for you to
get angry about it too.

469
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:56,996
Then, should we leave your father
single when he's still so young?

470
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,713
He looks young to you.

471
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:03,853
He can focus on his company
when the family is stable.

472
00:41:03,853 --> 00:41:07,052
I think he already has
someone he's focusing on.

473
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:10,146
Do you...

474
00:41:10,146 --> 00:41:12,425
know the singer Yoo Ji Na?

475
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:16,661
- Just drink your tea.
- Singer?

476
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:18,869
Unacceptable!

477
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:21,831
I am choosing this time, no matter what!

478
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:29,222
You probably worked really hard
to keep the reporters' mouths shut

479
00:41:29,222 --> 00:41:31,989
but what do you know?
I think the word is already out.

480
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,596
Now you're keeping
an eye on your own father?

481
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:39,275
Where did you hear this nonsense?

482
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:41,855
Na Kyung told us about it.

483
00:41:41,855 --> 00:41:47,728
I think she is very concerned about
people gossiping about you.

484
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:52,126
Hyun Sung, let me see you for a second.

485
00:42:10,222 --> 00:42:13,115
What's wrong with you?

486
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:14,318
I'm sorry.

487
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,996
Sometimes I feel like you
are worse than your brother.

488
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:20,882
At least with him, everything
I see is all there is to it.

489
00:42:20,882 --> 00:42:22,157
I'm sorry.

490
00:42:22,157 --> 00:42:26,235
I don't trust people
who always apologize.

491
00:42:26,235 --> 00:42:30,942
How pathetic are you that you can't
even control your wife's mouth?

492
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:42,228
- Why are you in here?
- Don't mind me.

493
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:43,666
I do mind. Get out.

494
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:45,181
I have something I want to discuss.

495
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:46,849
I don't discuss anything with you.

496
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:49,389
- There is something I want to do.
- I don't care.

497
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:51,663
Even if you don't care, help me out.

498
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:55,351
I'm thinking about starting
an entertainment business.

499
00:42:57,385 --> 00:43:00,123
Starting what?

500
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:02,889
There are a lot of companies that
invest in this industry these days.

501
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:05,815
This is ridiculous...

502
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:10,155
You want to set up a company
to drag in Yoo Ji Na?

503
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:13,766
So that you can irritate me?

504
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:16,760
Is that the meaning behind your warning?

505
00:43:18,246 --> 00:43:23,824
Both of you, listen carefully.
Don't bring her name up mindlessly.

506
00:43:23,824 --> 00:43:26,369
This is my warning.

507
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:29,688
You didn't seem like you would be,
but you're surprisingly emotional.

508
00:43:34,472 --> 00:43:37,563
Warning... Whatever.
You spent your energy for no reason.

509
00:43:37,563 --> 00:43:39,831
She didn't seem that interested.

510
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:44,190
- You met her?
- She came to the art gallery.

511
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,547
- What did you say?
- You are always overflowing with energy.

512
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:53,351
Even at my age, I would think it would be
too exhausting to have a one-sided crush.

513
00:43:55,427 --> 00:44:00,548
Have you changed your tactic now?
To be sneaky?

514
00:44:00,548 --> 00:44:03,815
Try it and see if it works on me.

515
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:10,338
How are we so alike from head to toe?

516
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:14,114
You and I are both unfortunate.

517
00:44:21,623 --> 00:44:24,420
If you want to start
an entertainment business, then do it.

518
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,144
Don't tell father that
I supported you.

519
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:29,376
What are you trying to say?

520
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:33,032
Are you saying you want
me to take care of Yoo Ji Na

521
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:35,617
or you don't want to go
anywhere near the company?

522
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:37,563
You can think whatever you want.

523
00:44:38,722 --> 00:44:41,304
You need to make up your
mind which side you're on!

524
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:50,422
Are you going to be careless
about what you say?

525
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:57,990
Grandmother brought you into this family
to aggravate my mother.

526
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:04,541
She ignored all other women from nice,
proper households to embarrass my mother.

527
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:06,346
But my mom died.

528
00:45:06,346 --> 00:45:09,014
And Grandmother? She is done using you.

529
00:45:09,014 --> 00:45:12,346
She will show no mercy once
she doesn't need you anymore.

530
00:45:12,346 --> 00:45:14,588
How dare you act out?

531
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:23,844
Do you understand now?

532
00:45:23,844 --> 00:45:28,016
If you act recklessly,
we won't hold back either.

533
00:45:34,947 --> 00:45:38,045
Hey you two! Why would you spit?

534
00:45:38,045 --> 00:45:41,336
- What is she saying?
- So what?

535
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:43,568
You want me to take off my
clothes and wipe it down?

536
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:48,146
You should say, "I'm sorry.
I won't do it again."

537
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,425
Hey. This lady is being cute.

538
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:53,492
Hey, do you want to die? Huh?

539
00:45:53,492 --> 00:45:55,516
Hey!

540
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:57,086
What are you guys doing?

541
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:58,882
Are you hitting an adult?

542
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,126
And what is this?

543
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:04,255
You two, what school, grade,
and class are you in?

544
00:46:04,255 --> 00:46:06,713
What decade are you in to ask
about a grade and class?

545
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:10,233
You little punks...
Are you glaring at me?

546
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:14,110
You guys really want to get dragged
into school and get punished!

547
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,371
Damn...

548
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:18,726
Damn?

549
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:22,135
What were you going
to say after damn just now?

550
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:25,349
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

551
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,869
What are they going to grow up to be
if they are acting this way at this age?

552
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,434
What is the school teaching these days to
let out you bastards out into the world?

553
00:46:32,434 --> 00:46:35,422
- Bastards?
- Let's just go. She's crazy.

554
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:37,512
Cr... Crazy?

555
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:41,257
Crazy? Why you...

556
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,003
Hey! Hey!

557
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:46,144
- Let's go!
- If I see you guys again...!

558
00:46:46,144 --> 00:46:48,202
You have no manners or respect!

559
00:46:48,202 --> 00:46:51,010
- Get them!
- That old lady!

560
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,606
Run! Run!

561
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:02,931
You're crazy!

562
00:47:02,931 --> 00:47:04,811
Why would you hit them on the head?

563
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:07,643
You didn't seem like the brave one,
but you got brave out of nowhere!

564
00:47:07,643 --> 00:47:09,628
They came after us.

565
00:47:09,628 --> 00:47:12,594
Kids these days aren't
afraid of anything.

566
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:14,668
We did that and ran away!

567
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:18,246
Hey, I was actually really scared.

568
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:20,563
What's so funny?

569
00:47:20,563 --> 00:47:22,097
We're back.

570
00:47:22,097 --> 00:47:24,721
I heard you two got into a fight.

571
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:25,849
We can fight with each other

572
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:28,893
but we won't stand by and watch one
of us get in a fight with someone else.

573
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:30,782
You guys were in a fight? With whom?

574
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:32,193
It just happened.

575
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:34,588
Are you guys okay now?

576
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:36,737
She talked to me first so we're okay now.

577
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:38,300
When did I talk to you first?

578
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,494
You talked to me first. The stocking.

579
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:43,150
I was talking to myself.

580
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,786
"Where? Where?"
Who was the one who talked first?

581
00:47:46,786 --> 00:47:51,871
How is that me talking to you first?
Be specific! Jung Hae Sung!

582
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:55,818
They just fought...
They act like chicks sometimes!

583
00:47:55,818 --> 00:48:01,489
They play with each other one minute,
then they're pecking each other.

584
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:03,389
That's the fun part of raising daughters.

585
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:06,722
I know.

586
00:48:09,478 --> 00:48:12,487
Did your friend's store settle down?

587
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:16,253
- Yeah.
- It feels stuffy to be there, right?

588
00:48:16,253 --> 00:48:19,108
It's whatever.

589
00:48:19,108 --> 00:48:21,197
What's up with your clothes?

590
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:22,653
Let's go buy you a new outfit.

591
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:24,311
It's okay. I don't need it.

592
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:26,623
Don't be that way. Get up.

593
00:48:32,487 --> 00:48:34,704
It's pretty. You look nice.

594
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:38,536
He's going wear that, but please
wrap this and this in the bag.

595
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:40,610
Yes, ma'am.

596
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,409
I said it's fine.

597
00:48:44,264 --> 00:48:46,476
You look so nice wearing this...

598
00:48:46,476 --> 00:48:50,545
Should we also buy a pair of socks
to match? What shoes are you wearing?

599
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:51,806
I said stop.

600
00:48:51,806 --> 00:48:54,472
You said you're staying
at your friend's studio.

601
00:48:54,472 --> 00:48:57,021
If you live with someone,
they'll find out about everything.

602
00:48:57,021 --> 00:49:00,922
Your friend might think
you're in trouble.

603
00:49:00,922 --> 00:49:05,327
Please don't wrap those. I'm going
to change out of this too. I'm sorry.

604
00:49:05,327 --> 00:49:07,146
Okay, sir.

605
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:17,813
I have an event to go to,
so I can't stay long.

606
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:21,737
Oh yeah...

607
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,094
I haven't been paying you...

608
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,317
as if I was using you.

609
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:35,409
It's not much, but it should be enough
for you to spend it for some time.

610
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:37,255
Are you crazy?

611
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:40,027
I was going to treat you really
well when we got married.

612
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:42,929
I never even bought you nice clothes.

613
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:48,693
I feel like I just used you...
I feel bad.

614
00:49:48,693 --> 00:49:50,568
You heard something, didn't you?

615
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:54,934
Did you see her?

616
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,135
When did you see her?

617
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,617
I know she is going
to take care of you...

618
00:50:08,322 --> 00:50:15,233
How is a man supposed to move
into a woman's house with just a bag?

619
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:16,603
So if you need to spend money...

620
00:50:16,603 --> 00:50:18,608
When did you find out?

621
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:22,092
Sweetheart.

622
00:50:22,092 --> 00:50:24,077
Let's talk later.

623
00:50:24,077 --> 00:50:25,797
You know that...

624
00:50:25,797 --> 00:50:28,559
I love you, right?

625
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,360
I said let's talk later.

626
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,856
It's not because I didn't love you
that I was only taking care of my family.

627
00:50:37,393 --> 00:50:41,438
You treated me so well

628
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,853
that I think I was only
thinking about myself.

629
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:51,072
I didn't introduce you

630
00:50:51,072 --> 00:50:54,043
to my family because I thought

631
00:50:54,123 --> 00:50:56,612
they would feel bad
about not letting me go.

632
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:02,592
You lived your life around me

633
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:10,646
and I treated you however I wanted.

634
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:17,476
You would stay there
if I told you to stay there...

635
00:51:19,503 --> 00:51:23,692
You would wait here
if I told you to wait here.

636
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:27,393
You did anything I asked
and I did that because

637
00:51:27,393 --> 00:51:32,177
you felt like part of my family...
Actually more than family...

638
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,523
Because it felt like you were me

639
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:39,922
and I was you.

640
00:51:41,742 --> 00:51:45,333
I thought to myself,
"I'll treat him well later."

641
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,670
"I'll be good to him
when we get married."

642
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:54,731
But it's all over if
we are breaking up like this...

643
00:51:54,731 --> 00:51:56,333
If we are breaking up like this...

644
00:51:58,074 --> 00:52:00,896
then I won't be able to see you again.

645
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:06,152
I'm so sorry.

646
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:11,271
Why are you doing this?

647
00:52:11,271 --> 00:52:13,161
Do you want to see someone go crazy?

648
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:15,188
Just swear at me!

649
00:52:15,188 --> 00:52:16,771
Sung Taek.

650
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:19,068
What did you and that person talk about?

651
00:52:21,773 --> 00:52:23,750
Let's talk later.

652
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:41,405
<i>Everything changed.</i>

653
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:44,780
<i>You knew there was an end.</i>

654
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:53,003
<i>It's okay. I'm thankful for the time
when our love was beautiful.</i>

655
00:52:53,003 --> 00:53:01,172
<i>Before you show me your tears,
get far away from me.</i>

656
00:53:01,172 --> 00:53:05,576
<i>I don't know if I'll hold onto you,
or if I will beg.</i>

657
00:53:05,576 --> 00:53:08,965
<i>Honestly, what I'm afraid of most is...</i>

658
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:13,610
<i>Give me a last kiss.
Hold me.</i>

659
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,030
<i>I'll wait for you forever.</i>

660
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,422
<i>Even if you're far away,
I can still feel your presence.</i>

661
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:25,742
<i>You are the only one
I will love forever.</i>

662
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,056
How am I supposed to dance wearing these?

663
00:53:37,056 --> 00:53:39,275
Do you want me to twist my ankle?

664
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,338
Why am I so off rhythm today?

665
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:47,126
Because your mind is
thinking about something else.

666
00:53:48,422 --> 00:53:50,168
Are you serious?

667
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:52,530
You want to act like a teacher now?

668
00:53:56,755 --> 00:54:00,494
<i>Don't worry. It won't take long.</i>

669
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:07,750
<i>[Sung Taek]</i>

670
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:10,427
Hello?

671
00:54:10,427 --> 00:54:13,019
Yeah. I can leave in 10 minutes.

672
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:16,253
What's wrong with your voice?

673
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:20,224
Why didn't you tell me?

674
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:22,887
Because I knew you
would be mad at me.

675
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:25,945
I told you I was going to tell her.

676
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:28,081
She found out that day.

677
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:31,510
She saw you walking into my house.

678
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,849
Then you should've told me!

679
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:36,501
Are you yelling at me?

680
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:38,148
What did you say?

681
00:54:38,148 --> 00:54:40,474
I was a little...

682
00:54:40,474 --> 00:54:42,887
- taken back.
- What did you say to her?

683
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:46,740
I told her to think of this as paying
her debt and to step back. Why?

684
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,141
What?

685
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,668
What did she do wrong?

686
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,927
Did she get dumped
because she did something wrong?

687
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:56,476
Does a woman have to do
something wrong to get dumped?

688
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:59,280
Do you know what kind
of person she is to me?

689
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,391
I told you I was going to tell her!

690
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,887
How can you break up without
hurting the person?

691
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:11,927
You already dumped her,
so just forget about her!

692
00:55:11,927 --> 00:55:13,771
As soon as you entered my house

693
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:17,077
it became impossible for you two
to go back to the way it was.

694
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:20,527
You told her to think
of this as paying her debt...

695
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,461
Hae Dang is a human being too!

696
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:23,789
Keep your voice down.

697
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:28,454
She said when she copied
your voice, your looks, your tone...

698
00:55:28,454 --> 00:55:32,134
She felt like her life was fake too!

699
00:55:32,134 --> 00:55:34,644
To someone like that...

700
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:37,474
You told her to think of it as
paying her debt and to forget me

701
00:55:37,474 --> 00:55:39,992
because she lived a fake life?

702
00:55:39,992 --> 00:55:43,835
Is this who you really are?

703
00:55:43,835 --> 00:55:45,621
I get it, so stop.

704
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:52,471
My head feels dizzy because
I'm so jealous right now.

705
00:55:52,471 --> 00:55:54,713
So stop it.

706
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,202
I must really like you.

707
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:03,467
To still want to be with you even
when you're being this way.

708
00:56:22,023 --> 00:56:25,101
This is the last time I'll let you off.

709
00:56:25,101 --> 00:56:29,588
From now on, don't care about
another woman in front of me.

710
00:56:41,947 --> 00:56:44,568
I'll be responsible for Jung Hae Dang!

711
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:48,431
She'll be impersonating me
all her life at a cheap cabaret.

712
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:51,621
And what can you do for her?

713
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:55,876
If you really love her,
then you shouldn't be like this.

714
00:56:55,876 --> 00:57:00,090
The person who can
save her is not you, but me.

715
00:57:01,396 --> 00:57:04,021
This is enough...

716
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,869
Calm down.

717
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:31,173
<i>Let's talk later.</i>

718
00:57:31,173 --> 00:57:33,179
<i>I said let's talk later!</i>

719
00:57:36,648 --> 00:57:39,240
What are you doing?
You're up soon. Hurry up.

720
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,048
Ah... Okay. I'm coming.

721
00:57:54,822 --> 00:57:58,853
Thank you! Thank you!

722
00:57:58,853 --> 00:58:02,487
While I was singing,
I forgot some lyrics.

723
00:58:02,487 --> 00:58:04,719
- It's okay! It's okay!
- It's okay! It's okay!

724
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:09,347
Even though I do this every year, all
year long, I still have days like today.

725
00:58:09,347 --> 00:58:17,273
I'm sorry. But I'll make sure to show
you a sexier performance next!

726
00:58:19,603 --> 00:58:21,824
And you know I keep my word, right?

727
00:58:21,824 --> 00:58:23,860
Get ready!

728
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:34,884
<i>In order to best myself,
I sit here, left all alone.</i>

729
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:42,608
<i>Why do I entertain people
and lose a part of myself?</i>

730
00:58:43,804 --> 00:58:47,344
<i>I don't shout.</i>

731
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:49,507
<i>Out of the darkness...</i>

732
00:58:56,137 --> 00:59:00,289
<i>Like you.</i>

733
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:08,934
<i>I'll forget it all, the tears,
our love, and our memories.</i>

734
00:59:08,934 --> 00:59:16,213
<i>There was never a single moment
when our relationship brought me joy.</i>

735
00:59:27,248 --> 00:59:30,144
We can walk around comfortably
because nobody will recognize me

736
00:59:30,144 --> 00:59:32,505
once we leave the country.

737
00:59:34,206 --> 00:59:36,650
Why did you schedule
the flight at this hour?

738
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,327
- What time is it right now?
- It's a little after four.

739
00:59:43,072 --> 00:59:45,092
Who's calling at this hour?

740
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,438
Who is it?

741
00:59:48,438 --> 00:59:50,637
<i>[Madam]</i>

742
00:59:50,637 --> 00:59:52,836
You left it the way it was?

743
00:59:55,148 --> 00:59:57,108
Don't answer.

744
00:59:57,108 --> 01:00:01,333
Do you secretly call each
other at night? Is that it?

745
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:03,159
I wonder why she's calling at this hour.

746
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,414
- Jung Hae Dang.
<i>- This is Jung Hae Dang's sister.</i>

747
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,132
What happened?

748
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:19,532
- Hello?
<i>- She fainted!</i>

749
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:22,846
- Seriously?
<i>- I thought I should call.</i>

750
01:00:25,023 --> 01:00:26,971
Stop the car.

751
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:28,965
I said stop the car!

752
01:00:39,947 --> 01:00:42,150
- Where are you going?
- She said she fainted!

753
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:43,951
You're going to leave
because she fainted?

754
01:00:43,951 --> 01:00:46,918
People faint sometimes
because of busy schedules.

755
01:00:46,918 --> 01:00:48,885
Are you going run to her
every time she faints?

756
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:51,244
- I went yesterday!
- Where?

757
01:00:51,244 --> 01:00:53,447
She saw me when she was on stage.

758
01:00:53,447 --> 01:00:56,849
Even after you told her
to pay her debt and step away

759
01:00:56,849 --> 01:00:59,547
she was still impersonating
you and singing.

760
01:01:00,608 --> 01:01:03,753
How do you think she was feeling?

761
01:01:03,753 --> 01:01:06,510
How do you think she was
feeling when she saw me?

762
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:09,637
I said that so that she can
move on without any regrets!

763
01:01:09,637 --> 01:01:13,327
I said cruel things so
that she could move on!

764
01:01:13,327 --> 01:01:14,827
I have to go.

765
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,856
Don't go.

766
01:01:17,856 --> 01:01:20,043
If you go right now

767
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,681
you won't see me ever again.

768
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:24,239
Don't you get it?

769
01:01:28,704 --> 01:01:30,728
I told you I'll take
responsibility for her!

770
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:34,009
I don't think that's what she needs!

771
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:36,172
Taxi! Taxi!

772
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:03,295
Sung Taek! Sung Taek!

773
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:06,224
Wake up! No! No!

774
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:08,108
No! Wait!

775
01:02:08,108 --> 01:02:10,469
Sung Taek! Let go! Let go!

776
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:12,777
Wait! Sung Taek! Wait!

777
01:02:12,777 --> 01:02:16,422
No! Sung Taek! Wait!

778
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:18,411
No!

779
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:20,210
Sung Taek!

780
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:22,626
No!

781
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,289
Sung Taek.

782
01:02:56,003 --> 01:02:57,802
Sung Taek.

783
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,621
Because he was a good person...

784
01:03:36,373 --> 01:03:38,501
I'm sure...

785
01:03:38,501 --> 01:03:40,208
he went to a good place.

786
01:03:42,623 --> 01:03:44,594
I...

787
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:48,655
told him I'd be responsible
for you and stopped him.

788
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,875
But he still said
he had to go and ran off.

789
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:01,164
Jo Sung Taek

790
01:04:01,164 --> 01:04:03,364
was still your man...

791
01:04:04,947 --> 01:04:07,847
until the end.

792
01:04:16,608 --> 01:04:19,204
Goodbye, Sung Taek.

793
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:23,710
Goodbye, Sung Taek.

794
01:04:27,773 --> 01:04:30,106
We'll meet again in our next life.

795
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:34,313
Let's get married.

796
01:04:35,773 --> 01:04:39,130
Forget family...

797
01:04:41,327 --> 01:04:43,027
Let's...

798
01:04:46,452 --> 01:04:49,250
get married and live together.

799
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:55,914
My poor Sung Taek...

800
01:04:57,248 --> 01:05:00,387
Our poor Sung Taek!

801
01:05:04,293 --> 01:05:06,449
I'm so sorry, Sung Taek...

802
01:05:07,733 --> 01:05:10,181
I'm so sorry, Sung Taek!

803
01:05:10,181 --> 01:05:12,623
I'm sorry...

804
01:05:12,623 --> 01:05:15,181
Sung Taek, I'm sorry!

805
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:16,956
I'm sorry...

806
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:19,568
I'm sorry, Sung Taek...

807
01:05:19,568 --> 01:05:22,505
I'm sorry, Sung Taek!

808
01:05:23,742 --> 01:05:25,393
I'm sorry!

809
01:05:38,637 --> 01:05:40,422
I'm sorry!

810
01:05:40,422 --> 01:05:43,025
Hae Dang, I'm...

811
01:05:45,172 --> 01:05:47,422
I'm sorry!

812
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:50,114
I'm sorry, Hae Dang!

813
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:52,255
I...

814
01:05:52,255 --> 01:05:55,916
I'm sorry...
