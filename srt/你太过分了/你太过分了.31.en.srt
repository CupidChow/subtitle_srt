00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,665
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,136
This is the best thing to eat
in the summer when you don't

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,384
have an appetite. You can't
buy this is in the market.

4
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:24,325
Tell them to make seasoning with green
onions, put sesame oil in it, and eat it.

5
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:27,750
Don't you thin salty pickled
cucumbers is a bit too much though?

6
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:31,071
Yeah. It stinks. It smells awful!

7
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:33,898
You know it's properly made when
there's an unpleasant smell to it.

8
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,148
I'll take it to them. Thank you.

9
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:41,788
What if they say "what do you
take us for" and throw it?

10
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:45,523
All right. Fine.

11
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,063
Welcome.

12
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:56,781
Grandmother, Hae-dang is here!

13
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:02,515
- What do you have there?
- Oh, this is...

14
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,875
Oh, the smell! What is this?

15
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:24,679
- They're pickled cucumbers.
- Who eats these nowadays?

16
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,757
- Where do we put this?
- Where else? Dispose it in the garbage disposal.

17
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:37,062
Get rid of it this instant. What
kind of awful smell is this?

18
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,703
Did you expect us to eat this?

19
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:44,007
Still, she brought it for us. Do you
want me to dispose it right away?

20
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:49,030
Jung Hae-dang, you shouldn't give any
kind of food as gifts to someone.

21
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:52,092
Every family has different
classes of eating, and

22
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:54,200
it's bothersome to get
rid of the food waste.

23
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:58,422
What's that?

24
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:03,296
- They're pickled cucumbers.
- Oh, I love those!

25
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,312
Did your family make
this themselves at home?

26
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,617
My goodness. Tell them
we'll enjoy eating them.

27
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:12,891
Okay.

28
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,985
You don't need to make
anything else for lunch.

29
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,096
Slice the pickled cucumbers,
add a spoon of red pepper

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,813
paste and some sesame oil,
and mix it with rice.

31
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:25,796
It seems like we'll have a delicious
lunch, thanks to Hae-dang.

32
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:31,148
My goodness.

33
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:48,726
Oh my goodness. This makes me think of the
old days where I used to mix rice and

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,456
vegetables like this and eat it under
the blazing sun during the summertime.

35
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:54,750
Does it suit your taste?

36
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,921
Now that I'm getting older,
I just love these things.

37
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,604
I really want to eat the things
I used to eat a long time ago.

38
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:05,093
You can't even see these in the
malls and Korean restaurants.

39
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,264
My family made it by putting the cucumbers

40
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,234
in a crock and pressing
it with a huge rock.

41
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:14,750
That's right! A long time ago, every family
used to have a crock of pickled cucumbers!

42
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:21,179
Hey. Tell your family that we
gratefully enjoyed eating them.

43
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:22,945
I will.

44
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,250
It's more delicious than I thought
it would be. It's very refreshing.

45
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:34,976
Make me a bowl of noodles.

46
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:37,961
Right now?

47
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,007
Hey, you should make it for yourself.

48
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:44,796
It sounds easy to make, but it's not.

49
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,523
You need to make the broth, too.
It takes a lot of work.

50
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,427
Don't listen to her. Keep eating.

51
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:57,812
Mother, how can you teach your
underlings such terrible manners?

52
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:01,803
Can't a mother-in-law tell her
daughter-in-law to make some noodles?

53
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,476
Then get up, slice up the pickled
cucumbers, and make cold soup.

54
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,813
- What?
- You said you were my daughter-in-law.

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,445
Aren't you just dying to
be my daughter-in-law?

56
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,968
Let's hurry up and eat.

57
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:22,562
It's more delicious than I thought
it would be. I feel so refreshed.

58
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:38,273
I'll do it.

59
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,789
Oh, no. You'll be doing this
a lot when you get married.

60
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:44,031
There's no need to trouble
yourself already.

61
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:56,093
- Why is your name Hae-dang? Did your father name you?
- Yes.

62
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,608
He named me Hae-dang so I
could live brightly like the

63
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,009
shining sun in the middle
of a beach during a summer.

64
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,351
That's a very warm name.

65
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,171
Why are you laughing?

66
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,458
I wasn't laughing.

67
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:19,500
To be honest, isn't her name a bit
tacky for a young woman like her?

68
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,052
What's tacky about her name?
It's a sturdy name.

69
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,679
It's a hundred times
better than Ko Na-kyung.

70
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:30,585
I'm starting to become jealous
because you adore Hae-dang so much.

71
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,468
You should address her
as your sister-in-law.

72
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:38,492
I'll start addressing her that way
later after she gets married.

73
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:42,078
- Is that okay?
- Of course.

74
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:48,806
- Hold on. Hae-dang, wear this.
- No, Mrs. Sung.

75
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,156
Goodness. I'm giving it to
you because I like you.

76
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:54,164
It's the price I'm paying for those
delicious pickled cucumbers.

77
00:05:57,594 --> 00:05:59,421
This is too precious...

78
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:02,998
I bought so many of them that
I'm starting to lose my mind.

79
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:08,084
I don't have many days left. I'll give you
one every time you do something sweet.

80
00:06:09,156 --> 00:06:10,369
What about me, grandmother?

81
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,500
- You can wear this one.
- Thank you!

82
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,175
That looks prettier though.

83
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:26,007
- Mother, what about me?
- Excuse me?

84
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,906
I'm your daughter-in-law.

85
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:31,835
It doesn't even suit your looks.

86
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:35,531
Goodness. You don't even
deserve to be jealous.

87
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:37,265
Try it on.

88
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,078
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

89
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:52,117
I heard you persuaded your parents.

90
00:06:52,898 --> 00:06:55,140
Thank you for stopping them
from damaging my company.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,195
I was able to escape embarrassment at the
wedding because of your grandmother.

92
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:07,202
The guests thought the wedding was postponed
because your grandmother had collapsed.

93
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,307
This whole thing has ended with me breaking

94
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:12,289
up with you because I
don't love you anymore.

95
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:15,289
Are you going to America to study?

96
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,546
- I hope you'll be happy.
- You, too.

97
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,421
Being happy would be the last
gift I can give you, correct?

98
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,640
- I'm sorry, Yoon-hee.
- I was sorry, too.

99
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:39,734
Later on when I meet a man who will
love me, I'll become grateful to you.

100
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,097
You'll definitely meet him.

101
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,316
- Oh, dear! I'll do them.
- I'm just about done.

102
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:58,515
But is singing all you do at the cabaret?

103
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:00,305
I dance, too.

104
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,085
So is singing and dancing all you do there?

105
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,484
I don't understand where
you're going with this...

106
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,546
I was wondering if you sat
with the customers, too.

107
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Sorry?

108
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:18,281
No, I don't.

109
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:23,812
I've never gone to a cabaret before.

110
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,820
Do such places exist these days?

111
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,179
That's why I sing there.

112
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,617
- Are you offended?
- No.

113
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:43,312
It's difficult being here, isn't it?
You're not used to the atmosphere either.

114
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,242
Not yet.

115
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:51,062
You don't have to be so uncomfortable.
Humans live here, too.

116
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:54,225
Please teach me a lot.

117
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:58,539
How could I teach you when I'm
your younger sister-in-law?

118
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,992
- Exactly how old are you this year?
- I'm 33.

119
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:08,937
Oh, yes. That's what I heard. Then,
you're two years younger than me.

120
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:10,906
Is that so?

121
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,617
Can I just call you Hae-dang
when it's just us two?

122
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:17,804
Do as you wish.

123
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:24,523
If there are things I should keep in
mind, please let me know ahead of time.

124
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,091
I don't know much.

125
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:27,726
There isn't much.

126
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:31,273
First of all, you must be unchanging.

127
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:35,679
You must act the same way, whether
you're with the family or not.

128
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:40,800
It would be flustering if you acted
docile in front of the family

129
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:45,968
and then dug out your claws when
they're not around, wouldn't it?

130
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:53,062
The most important thing
is to keep one's place.

131
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:58,921
What I mean is that you shouldn't
try to compete against anyone.

132
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,960
Okay. I'll keep those in mind.

133
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:07,867
Jung Hae-dang, I need to talk to you.

134
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:23,140
What is it that you want? It's not
like you actually love Park Hyun-joon.

135
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:26,421
Would I not want to be a conglomerate
family's daughter-in-law then?

136
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:31,726
So are you really going to live
with me as my daughter-in-law?

137
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:33,470
I told you I would.

138
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,078
If you loved Kyung-soo, you
wouldn't be able to do this.

139
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,201
You'll become Kyung-soo's sister-in-law.

140
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,968
Haven't you ever thought
about how cruel that is?

141
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:45,961
Isn't it cruel that my sister had
to die at such an early age?

142
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:50,039
Isn't it cruel that Sung-taek
had to die so pitifully?

143
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:53,359
- Those were just accidents.
- Accidents that happened because of you.

144
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:57,360
Just because of the reason that their
deaths were accidents, you're too free.

145
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,023
That's what I can't forgive.

146
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:06,769
You would've felt much guiltier if you
had caused the deaths of strangers.

147
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:09,579
So?

148
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:13,710
The reason why your conscience
doesn't feel guilty of their deaths

149
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:18,150
is because I'm a trivial existence
in your unconscious mind!

150
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,533
That's exactly what I can't forgive.

151
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:26,330
What will you do if you can't forgive me?
Get revenge?

152
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,244
Do you think getting revenge is so simple?

153
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,455
And, do you think I'll do nothing
and just watch you get revenge?

154
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,681
What I want is to show you
that I'm not trivial at all.

155
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:46,877
- You can do whatever you want, but we can't live under the same roof.
- I know.

156
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:52,486
That means one of us
should leave this house.

157
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,830
What?

158
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,056
So you, Jung Hae-dang, will
chase me out of this house?

159
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:18,424
- I heard your mother passed away early. Then is your father single?
- Yes.

160
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:21,416
He must be lonely.

161
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:24,788
He's holding back for the
sake of his children, unlike

162
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,878
someone who's trying to ruin
their children's future.

163
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:39,073
- Tell your father we should have dinner together sometime.
- Okay. I'll tell him.

164
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:43,869
The dinner table is at peace because
Hyun-joon isn't scowling anymore.

165
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,264
Oh, grandmother.

166
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:48,150
I should've let you be with
the woman you loved sooner.

167
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,988
Before Hae-dang came along, there
was no other woman in my life.

168
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:55,127
Anyhow, it's nice for me
to see you like this, too.

169
00:12:55,651 --> 00:13:01,111
You always seemed to be unsteady,
but now, you look stable.

170
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:05,377
He can't do as he pleases because he has
someone to take responsibility of now.

171
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,549
I'm telling you this as a
compliment, Hyun-joon.

172
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:10,721
I'll take it as one.

173
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:16,408
My wife isn't generous, but I
hope you'll be good to her.

174
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,361
It's fine. I have a lot to learn from her.

175
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:24,041
Strangely enough, I have a feeling
that you and I will get along.

176
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,244
That was my first impression of her.

177
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:32,256
She seemed like she was going to get
along with her family-to-be and be

178
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:36,483
patient with them, so I knew she was
going to become part of my family.

179
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:38,478
Is that why you chased her out?

180
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:42,002
Do you think I chased her out
because she was worse than you?

181
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:50,205
Eat a variety of foods. This is delicious.
Eat this one.

182
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:02,595
Stop them. If she really
gets married into this

183
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:04,651
family, I really won't
be able to live here!

184
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:08,399
- You won't be able to live here?
- I can't stand her, so stop them!

185
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:12,344
- Why can't you stand her?
- I just can't stand her!

186
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,791
So why?

187
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:19,309
Didn't you see Hyun-joon
has become relaxed?

188
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:24,221
Did you forget how much of a
nuisance he was in my life?

189
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,906
My life will become so much more comfortable
as long as he doesn't try to provoke me.

190
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:32,330
I like Hae-dang, especially
because of that reason.

191
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:39,150
You might become comfortable, but if I have
to see her every day, I might just go mad!

192
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:43,402
- Don't you care?
- Enough. You're embarrassing.

193
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:47,001
Don't you think I saw
the way you glared at.

194
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:49,886
Hae-dang when Hyun-joon
got side dishes for her?

195
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,892
Are you going to keep
saying foolish things?

196
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,009
There was something you told
me when we fought before

197
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,935
we got married when you thought
it was over between us.

198
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,252
What did I say?

199
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,514
You said the only thing you
regret is that you couldn't

200
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,833
do anything with Park Hyun-joon
before it all ended.

201
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:09,314
I said it because I had nothing to
lose and I wanted to upset you!

202
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,150
- Are you sure?
- You're really...

203
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:34,362
Why didn't you eat dinner with us?
Is it because of Hae-dang?

204
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:39,917
No, I had something to do. I was
on my way to eat right now.

205
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:45,026
It's not like you won't be seeing her.
You should just eat with us.

206
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:50,815
Oh, no. I forgot my car keys.

207
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,948
- Are you okay?
- What about you? What are you doing the entire day?

208
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:04,807
Don't worry about me.

209
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:11,745
I'm used to experiencing the
passing time without any thoughts.

210
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:36,800
Did you really forget
your car keys earlier?

211
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:43,761
Let's go inside. I'm going to drink some
cool beer with your father before I go.

212
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,425
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

213
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,081
So in the end, Hyun-joon is
becoming my brother-in-law.

214
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:07,620
- Congratulations, Yeon Bong-soo!
- Goodness. It's not like you're getting married.

215
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:12,120
Even if I did get married, I wouldn't
be feeling as happy as I am now.

216
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:15,370
- Congratulations, father.
- Thank you.

217
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,110
Mom, what's wrong?

218
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:26,534
She suffered so much, and it was all to get
married to a good man. I'm just so happy.

219
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:32,425
I guess your grandmother isn't
a scary person, after all.

220
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,307
No, she's really strict and scary,

221
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:39,589
but for some reason, she's
easily warming up to Hae-dang.

222
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,578
Are you sure it's not because
she gave up on you easily?

223
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,307
You're absolutely right.
You really are clever.

224
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:51,339
She let Hae-dang have a nuisance like me.

225
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:55,729
You shouldn't drink so much
when you're driving home.

226
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,604
I can just sleep over.
Is that uncomfortable?

227
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:01,167
Of course not. Just sleep here.

228
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:04,456
Yes, just sleep here!
You can sleep with me.

229
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:06,737
Thank you.

230
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:11,636
I want to sleep with my father-in-law, too.
I'm about to get jealous.

231
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:15,456
Don't say that! Hyun-joon won't
be able to sleep at all!

232
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,823
He snores a lot!

233
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:22,065
Oh, come on, father. Why
are you being like this?

234
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:24,870
The entire house shakes.

235
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:37,065
Pick a decent one.

236
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:40,455
They're all really shabby.

237
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,820
We have no choice.

238
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:47,676
We'll have to give him underwear,
but all Bong-soo wears are

239
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,363
old-fashioned boxers. Would he
even wear something like this?

240
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,065
Well, we have no choice.

241
00:18:55,807 --> 00:19:01,382
Gosh! There's no privacy here! My
pride is about to be ruined here.

242
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,722
He's part of the family now anyways.

243
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:20,659
Bong-soo applies this on his face.
You should, too.

244
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:22,792
Thank you.

245
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,112
The bathroom is uncomfortable, isn't it?

246
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,987
No, I feel better now that I've washed up.

247
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,589
Um... isn't your underwear uncomfortable?

248
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,386
Oh, no. It's fine.

249
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,253
You came out of the blue, so...

250
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:47,215
Even if it's uncomfortable, try
to bear with it for one night.

251
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,972
It feels cool and nice, actually.

252
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:51,269
That's good.

253
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:57,839
- Is this conversation uncomfortable?
- No, you're like my mom.

254
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:03,401
Mom? Oh, yes! Just think of me as your mom.

255
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,722
Now that we're one family,
please treat me comfortably.

256
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:12,737
Really? Of course we're one family!

257
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,878
What soup should I make
for you tomorrow morning?

258
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:19,729
- Cabbage and beef bone soup?
- Beef bone?

259
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:22,487
Oh, it's so sudden...

260
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:27,386
- I was joking.
- Oh my goodness! You scared me!

261
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,761
- It seems like you're my mother-in-law.
- Mother-in-law?

262
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:35,323
I was sad that I wouldn't have a
mother-in-law, but you're like one.

263
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:40,861
Oh, really? Then next time, I
should catch a brood hen for you.

264
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:58,175
I had no idea my mom had such
a soft spot for rich people.

265
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:01,589
- He's very good-natured, isn't he?
- Trustworthy, too.

266
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:06,534
- I think Hae-soo gave us a big present.
- I know.

267
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,839
Gosh, stop eating that!
It's for tomorrow's soup!

268
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:14,926
Now that this family is
getting a wealthy son-in-law,

269
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,762
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.

270
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:20,495
Earlier, you were petting your own
head and celebrating yourself.

271
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:24,551
I was doing that to lighten the mood.
Don't you think I have feelings, too?

272
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,901
You don't even deserve
to be jealous of him.

273
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:33,151
You were walking on eggshells
even before Hyun-joon came along.

274
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:35,769
Bong-sun!

275
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,386
His sleeping face looks like a baby's.

276
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,199
Goodness. You go and sleep, too.

277
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:49,472
Dad...

278
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:53,739
Kyung-soo is living in that house.

279
00:21:55,565 --> 00:22:00,993
Really? So in the end, he went to his mom.

280
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:05,556
I feel sorry to Kyung-soo...

281
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,220
and I feel sorry for Hyun-joon, too.

282
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:18,517
Anyhow, Yoo Ji-na will
become your mother-in-law.

283
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:21,493
Do you have confidence to do this?

284
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:34,126
If Ji-na was his real mother, at least
she would hold back for her son's sake,

285
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,548
But he's not her biological son.

286
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:45,989
I'm worried about what will happen
if she gives Hae-dang a hard time.

287
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:53,673
You're right. The worst person to deal with
in this world is a step-mother-in-law.

288
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,896
However, how could she be
picky about everything now?

289
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:02,031
Why are you staring into empty space?

290
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,368
These were Hae-soo's favorite flowers.

291
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:15,415
- Do you want to go to the market?
- Why would I go to the market?

292
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:19,939
It's better than staying home and
thinking about Hae-soo. Let's go out.

293
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,103
- Hello.
- Welcome.

294
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:28,314
- Please give me some peppers.
- Peppers?

295
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:30,612
- Please give us a lot.
- Of course.

296
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:33,046
- Three carrots, too.
- Okay.

297
00:23:35,252 --> 00:23:36,252
Do you need onions?

298
00:23:37,356 --> 00:23:38,837
- Please give me this one.
- Okay.

299
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,001
Thank you.

300
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,384
- You feel less stuffy now that you're outside, right?
- Yeah.

301
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:05,699
What do you want to eat for dinner?

302
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:08,579
Anything is fine.

303
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:12,056
Here. You eat one, too.

304
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:22,845
Goodness. You and I have
a long history together.

305
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:28,352
We've known each other since we were in
elementary school, so it's been many years.

306
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,416
We have a longer history than couples who get
married to each other in their twenties.

307
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,728
That's true.

308
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,853
We used to call each other
Mi-sook and Kang-sik.

309
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:43,876
When Hae-jin first told
me she was going to marry.

310
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:48,073
Bong-soo, I mean my son-in-law,
I was really surprised!

311
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:52,767
I wondered what kind of luck I had to get
such a smart daughter-in-law like her.

312
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:54,634
You did?

313
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:06,080
My goodness! What was I thinking? I
should've carried those for you!

314
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,869
Sheesh, you're early.

315
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:11,401
You should've said something earlier.

316
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,366
- Let's sit here for a bit.
- Sure.

317
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,681
Goodness.

318
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:20,931
The weather has gotten hotter now.

319
00:25:22,517 --> 00:25:25,634
Why are you gasping for air?
We haven't walked much.

320
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,071
That's because I'm old now.

321
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:33,142
When did Baek Mi-sook get so old?

322
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:38,704
I'm already 61 years old now.

323
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:44,071
Nowadays, I'm sick and tired of life.

324
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:46,287
Everyone is talking about
how we'll live until

325
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,956
we're a 100. What are you talking about?

326
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,728
It's not that. I want to live for a long time,
but I'm just sick and tired of my life.

327
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:56,041
Since when did you live for fun?

328
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,564
- Get up. It's hot.
- Okay.

329
00:26:01,174 --> 00:26:04,595
- I'll carry them.
- No way. I'm still a man.

330
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,720
Goodness. These were really heavy.

331
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:22,982
Now that Hyun-joon's matters
are almost figured out,

332
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,814
what are you planning to do
with your life, Kyung-soo?

333
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:33,048
If you want to work at my company, you
should start studying for it now.

334
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,400
I would like to keep pursuing music.

335
00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:40,493
What for? This is your father's company.

336
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:43,423
You should study the related
subjects for it now.

337
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,793
- I like music.
- You can play music as a hobby and start studying for the company.

338
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,565
He said he doesn't want to, so
what are you nagging him for?

339
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:54,454
Just send him abroad to study music.

340
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:59,071
It'd be great if he could
perform all his life.

341
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:02,172
Not anyone can help him
pursue his musical studies.

342
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:05,814
- Mother.
- He said he wants to do it.

343
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:10,064
If a child says nonsense, you
should scold him, not egg him on.

344
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:17,704
My first impression of him wasn't bad,
so I'm letting him sit and eat with us.

345
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:19,970
- You're letting him?
- Of course.

346
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:26,327
If I was considering you, I shouldn't
even let him come near the main house.

347
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:27,767
Mother.

348
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:31,298
Why would he work for the company?
What does he have to do with it?

349
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,080
Until when will you argue that
he has nothing to do with it?

350
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:36,853
Until I'm dead. Do you even have to ask?

351
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:43,314
All I learned is the piano. The only thing
I want to do is play the piano, too.

352
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,780
Did you hear that?

353
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:58,970
Kyung-soo is behaving that way because
your mother is dampening his spirits.

354
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:06,907
Take favor of him in front of Hyun-joon and
Hyun-sung. That way, he'll be encouraged.

355
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:09,853
How could I act so bluntly?

356
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:14,900
Do it for my sake. I'm begging you.

357
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:21,269
There's something I told Kyung-soo,
too, so I'll think of something.

358
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:25,486
I'm sure Kyung-soo will
be good to you later on.

359
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:31,495
It's obvious Hyun-joon and Hyun-sung won't
even glance your way when you're old

360
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,539
and powerless because of their resentment
for what happened to their dead mom.

361
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:39,925
However, Kyung-soo is
kind and warm-hearted,

362
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:42,296
so he'll be good to you
out of gratefulness.

363
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:45,834
I understand, so stop.

364
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:48,339
When you think about your
future years, you need

365
00:28:48,363 --> 00:28:50,460
at least one of your
sons to be on your side.

366
00:28:50,874 --> 00:28:52,975
Or else, you won't be
able to age out of fear.

367
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,960
We don't need any marriage expenses.

368
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:06,593
Just bring yourself. We'll
take care of everything.

369
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,412
Thank you, grandmother.

370
00:29:11,272 --> 00:29:13,920
I can't believe he's thanking me.

371
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:17,967
I'm very appreciative.

372
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:23,889
This is why you need a good
person to come into the family.

373
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:28,069
Our house seems much more humane,
thanks to you, Hae-dang.

374
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:33,210
Now that things have already come this far,
let's hurry up and get this over with.

375
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:36,326
Hyun-joon, you can prepare the
new furniture in your bedroom.

376
00:29:37,654 --> 00:29:39,709
His room is very spacious and nice.

377
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:43,983
When they move out, you can use the
entire second floor by yourself.

378
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:48,826
Tell your family to choose
an official wedding date.

379
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,639
I said they can't get married!

380
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:54,654
What right do you have to interfere?

381
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:59,576
Don't you two have anything
to say to the family?

382
00:30:01,272 --> 00:30:03,733
Jung Hae-dang, aren't you scared?

383
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:08,201
- Why would she be scared?
- Because she's hiding something. That's why.

384
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:13,168
Do you think Hae-dang is you?
What would she hide?

385
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,917
Jung Hae-dang...

386
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:20,533
had once considered
marrying my son Kyung-soo.

387
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,921
She was dumped by Kyung-soo, so
she approached Hyun-joon to get

388
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:35,889
revenge, and Hyun-joon was foolish
enough to fall for her trap.

389
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:40,569
- Is that not true, Hae-dang?
- What is this all about?

390
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:43,983
Get up.

391
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,764
How dare you talk
informally to your mother?

392
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:51,701
Mother, why are you letting
him speak informally to me?

393
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:55,162
If other people heard him, what
would they think of our family?

394
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:59,201
Is that true? Is what she said true?

395
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:04,803
Why can't you answer me? If
it's not true, say it isn't so!

396
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:12,662
It's true that I used to date Kyung-soo.

397
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:16,897
But you're sitting here right now
to get married to Hyun-joon?

398
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:23,803
- Did you know about this?
- I did. So what? Is Kyung-soo my brother?

399
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,527
Why does this become a problem?

400
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:30,553
You knew, and yet, you called
off the wedding with Yoon-hee?

401
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:32,787
Because this is the woman I love!

402
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,171
All of you, get up!

403
00:31:37,835 --> 00:31:39,772
There's no need to deal with this anymore!

404
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:42,623
You're more devious than you look!

405
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:57,309
What's going on? Everything
was going great...

406
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:00,576
Let's go up.

407
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:17,139
The melon is delicious today.

408
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:21,529
I wonder why everyone just got
up when it's so delicious.

409
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:27,115
- I'm glad you brought this up.
- Of course. You should be.

410
00:32:28,122 --> 00:32:29,595
Did you think I wouldn't be able to?

411
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:34,805
My son is in this house, so
how dare you bring her here?

412
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:37,279
Then your son can leave this house.

413
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,936
Don't be ridiculous.

414
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,420
Even though I hated you, I
didn't really hate him.

415
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:46,750
That's why I didn't chase him out

416
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:49,545
of here when he wanted
to live with his mother.

417
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,904
Your joke is going overboard.

418
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:57,608
Do you even have the
power to chase him out?

419
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:01,201
You should be the one who
worries about being chased out.

420
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,365
Once your grandmother dies, I'm going
to mercilessly chase you out of here.

421
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:09,788
What?

422
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:26,670
Now do you understand why I was so
against those two being together?

423
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:32,459
You feel sorry for
misunderstanding me, don't you?

424
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:37,444
It won't be easy for Hyun-joon to
settle down without that young lady.

425
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:40,069
It's important for your eldest
son to settle down, but

426
00:33:40,524 --> 00:33:43,039
you don't care if my son
will be heartbroken forever?

427
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:47,194
I'm very disappointed.

428
00:33:57,382 --> 00:34:00,951
She's probably not in the mood to say bye
to you, so what are you standing there for?

429
00:34:03,147 --> 00:34:07,803
You don't need to say hi to my husband either.
He doesn't want to see you ever again.

430
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:13,202
Wait.

431
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,162
I should say my last good-bye
to you, shouldn't I?

432
00:34:21,788 --> 00:34:24,904
Good-bye forever, Jung Hae-dang.

433
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:29,998
How dare you try to get revenge on me?

434
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:00,874
What is it?

435
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:04,328
Your so-called mom told
my father and grandmother

436
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,882
about how you and Hae-dang used to date.

437
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,865
- Are you serious?
- She got in the way of Hae-dang's future once again.

438
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:31,569
It's too bad. She was totally
easy and just perfect.

439
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,152
It doesn't matter since Hyun-joon is okay
with it, right? He didn't seem to mind.

440
00:35:37,504 --> 00:35:41,861
She was exactly my style.

441
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:50,686
I really must be getting old.
I was almost fooled by her.

442
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,914
I thought she was some kind
of treasure and put my

443
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:57,421
everything into making
her part of this family.

444
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:02,170
Still, she's perfect to
use to upset Yoo Ji-na.

445
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:04,524
Do you think that needs
to be the only criteria?

446
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,011
I was thoughtless.

447
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:11,108
Why on earth did you tell them that?

448
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:13,276
If Jung Hae-dang becomes
your sister-in-law,

449
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:15,227
how will you be able to live in this house?

450
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:17,483
I said I'll endure it,
so why does that matter?

451
00:36:17,694 --> 00:36:19,606
You'll endure it? Why should you?

452
00:36:20,038 --> 00:36:23,615
Should I disappear? Then there
shouldn't be any problem.

453
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,117
Are you kidding me?

454
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:29,694
If you want to live in the same house as
me, then please leave Hae-dang alone.

455
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:32,061
I can't leave her alone anymore.

456
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:38,381
We've come too far that neither of us can
leave each other alone. Don't you know that?

457
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:42,914
How will I be able to
see her get married to.

458
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:45,522
Park Hyun-joon and become
my daughter-in-law?

459
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:49,096
When I accepted the fact that I had no
choice but to break up with Hae-dang,

460
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:52,210
I went back to living as the
breathing plant I was before.

461
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:55,990
- If not, I wouldn't even have followed you into this house.
- What?

462
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:59,420
If I had thought about doing
all different kinds of things,

463
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:02,332
how could I have dared come live
in this house as Mr. Park's

464
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:04,827
son when I shouldn't have for late Mrs.
Choi Kyung-ae's sake?

465
00:37:05,952 --> 00:37:09,924
When I broke up with Hae-dang, I didn't care
about where and how I lived because all I

466
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:13,735
was going to do was breathe mindlessly
anyways. That's why I moved into this house.

467
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:17,773
All I can do is see. I'm back to being
in the vegetative state I once was in.

468
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,859
Why would you just breathe mindlessly
like you're in a vegetative state?

469
00:37:20,883 --> 00:37:25,431
Who are you doing this for? For Jung
Hae-dang? For just that one girl?

470
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:30,709
This is why I can't leave her alone.

471
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:34,889
If you want to live as Mr.
Park's wife, go ahead.

472
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,701
I'll keep playing your son like this.

473
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:45,545
So don't stop Hae-dang and
Hyun-joon's marriage.

474
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:47,428
I told you I can't do that!

475
00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:55,003
The moment she came into this
house holding Hyun-joon's

476
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:58,225
hand, she and I boarded
on unstoppable trains.

477
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:05,827
We won't be able to stop
until one of us is ruined.

478
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,194
Now do you realize?

479
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:26,725
The moment where you have to choose either.

480
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:31,169
Hae-dang or your mother
Ji-na is getting closer.

481
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:37,520
If you're going to choose
Hae-dang, give me that letter,

482
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,479
regardless of what happens to Mr.
Park's wife Ji-na.

483
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,698
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- What?

484
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:09,871
Never mind. This isn't
something I should tell

485
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:11,847
the person directly
involved in this matter.

486
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:14,284
The person directly involved?

487
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:17,971
Huh? Oh, there's just
something like that...

488
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:24,901
- Hey, come here.
- What? Why?

489
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:29,080
- What is it?
- Hurry up and come with me.

490
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:34,541
What? That's impossible! How...?

491
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:38,432
No one said it's possible, but that's
what the rumors are saying these days.

492
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:39,721
Who said that?

493
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,900
I went to the hair salon to get a
trim, and the owner said that.

494
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:49,877
You can't see what's right under your nose.
We're the only ones who didn't know.

495
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:55,307
But how could such a rumor circulate...?

496
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:56,979
Should I tell mom?

497
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:04,432
What a ludicrous rumor!

498
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:08,033
- It's ludicrous, isn't it?
- It's ridiculous.

499
00:40:10,604 --> 00:40:13,424
"The two in-laws living together
have started to like each other."

500
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:17,408
- Does this even make sense?
- I really hate this!

501
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:22,877
- This is ridiculous!
- I think so, too.

502
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,002
Why did such a rumor come about?

503
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:31,479
Your father is feeling very lonely
because of what happened to Hae-soo.

504
00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:37,346
So my mom kept taking him out.
That's why such a rumor came about.

505
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,362
Oh my gosh. No way.

506
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,463
What were you two talking about?

507
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:48,791
- It's nothing.
- What is it?

508
00:40:55,643 --> 00:40:56,644
What is it?

509
00:40:56,668 --> 00:41:01,666
- Gosh. I said it's nothing.
- So what exactly is that "nothing?"

510
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:03,518
Ignorance is bliss.

511
00:41:03,823 --> 00:41:08,057
If I told you, with your
temper, you would wreak havoc.

512
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:13,369
- So it's not "nothing" after all.
- Oh, I don't know!

513
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:30,291
Mr. Jung, my mom wants you
to come up for dinner.

514
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:34,252
I just need to have a simple dinner here.

515
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:39,487
Your daughters are coming late from
work, so why would you eat by yourself?

516
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:42,002
Oh, gosh.

517
00:41:43,354 --> 00:41:45,687
- Welcome. Have a seat.
- Goodness.

518
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:57,033
- What's wrong with you?
- Huh? Oh, it's nothing. Please eat.

519
00:41:57,245 --> 00:42:01,432
Why are you sneaking glances at my face?
Do I have something on my face?

520
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:05,002
N-no. Please eat.

521
00:42:09,823 --> 00:42:11,096
What's wrong with you?

522
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:14,078
What's going on?

523
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:17,823
It's hairtail!

524
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:27,401
Goodness. How could you eat fish that way?
You'd be wasting half at that rate.

525
00:42:28,386 --> 00:42:31,710
You seemed to not be eating well lately,
so I mustered up courage to buy this.

526
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:34,432
Here. I'll do it for you.

527
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:46,518
Go ahead and eat. You've lost so much
weight after since Hae-soo's incident.

528
00:42:47,846 --> 00:42:49,338
I'll eat on my own.

529
00:42:55,463 --> 00:42:56,463
Eat up.

530
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,167
It's delicious.

531
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:20,225
- Die! We should die together!
- No!

532
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:22,151
Hae-dang!

533
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:37,533
Don't be too lonely... for my sake.

534
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:42,591
I put condolence money in an envelope.
It's $100,000.

535
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:49,057
I'm going to slowly watch
you lose your mind.

536
00:43:50,846 --> 00:43:53,823
I'm going to become Park Hyun-joon's woman

537
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:57,846
and become your daughter-in-law
no matter what.

538
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:04,642
Accept me as your woman. Protect me
so that no one can disrespect me.

539
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,338
Don't let anyone look down on my family.

540
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:17,073
I'll do that. Use me to pay back Yoo
Ji-na for all the pain you got from her.

541
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:21,619
Jung Hae-dang had once considered
marrying my son Kyung-soo.

542
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:23,565
What is this all about?

543
00:44:23,714 --> 00:44:27,479
You knew, and yet, you called
off the wedding with Yoon-hee?

544
00:44:27,721 --> 00:44:29,698
Because this is the woman I love!

545
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:54,526
This is all for the better.

546
00:44:56,284 --> 00:44:58,006
Even if you do get married,

547
00:44:59,628 --> 00:45:02,526
you wouldn't be able to live in peace
because of that woman anyways.

548
00:45:04,378 --> 00:45:06,010
I can't back away now.

549
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:10,315
This isn't something you
should do for Hae-soo's death.

550
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:13,425
I'm doing this because
I feel like I'm going

551
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:16,932
to crumble if I don't
move anywhere right now.

552
00:45:18,573 --> 00:45:21,761
I'm doing this because if I don't
move anywhere, I'll keep being

553
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:25,865
sucked into the mud and won't
be able to come out anymore.

554
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:29,735
You've lived so far accepting
things much worse than this.

555
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:33,494
I'm not just going to
accept things anymore.

556
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:38,682
I feel like I've become
what I am today because

557
00:45:40,893 --> 00:45:43,026
I've just been accepting
things so naturally.

558
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:45,464
Hae-dang.

559
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:22,948
What brings you here? I thought we
wouldn't have to see each other again.

560
00:46:25,862 --> 00:46:27,268
Please forgive me.

561
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:34,916
I had no idea Kyung-soo was going to
become Hyun-joon's younger brother.

562
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:42,643
While Yoo Ji-na was stopping
my marriage with Kyung-soo,

563
00:46:45,471 --> 00:46:47,315
my sister died in a car accident.

564
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:50,237
What?

565
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:54,877
Long time ago, the man whom I had
once considered as my husband...

566
00:46:57,026 --> 00:46:59,276
died in a car accident because of her, too.

567
00:47:00,307 --> 00:47:01,307
What?

568
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:05,307
However, she did not apologize to me.

569
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:10,002
That's because I had
lived off of her songs.

570
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:18,643
I wanted to do whatever I
could to get her apology.

571
00:47:21,776 --> 00:47:25,963
That's why I told her to use me.
This isn't her fault.

572
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:33,383
If you allow us to get married,
I'll live differently than before.

573
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:41,674
I believe you'll give us an
opportunity to live that way.

574
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:04,048
Even if my grandmother doesn't give us
permission, I'm going to marry Hae-dang.

575
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,776
Go ahead. Marry her and
then get kicked out.

576
00:48:07,736 --> 00:48:08,908
That will be good for me.

577
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:13,510
Wouldn't it be easier for me if
one of you gets kicked out first?

578
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,448
I can't believe there's a time when Jung
Hae-dang is actually helpful in my life.

579
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:26,440
Yoo Ji-na is an awful woman.

580
00:48:28,448 --> 00:48:30,698
She caused the deaths of two people.

581
00:48:31,964 --> 00:48:36,948
She's not just annoying.
She's full of hatred.

582
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:43,885
If she wasn't such a spiteful woman, how
could she have abandoned her blind son?

583
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:47,893
If I was in Hae-dang's shoes, I
would've wanted to get revenge, too.

584
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:51,250
Because such a vulgar thing has
taken position as the lady of

585
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:54,213
the household like she's a
venomous snake coiling itself up,

586
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:58,940
I'm afraid of what will
happen in the future.

587
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:03,198
At least when I'm alive,
I can keep her down,

588
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:06,949
but I'm worried what will happen
after I'm long dead and gone.

589
00:49:16,846 --> 00:49:21,510
What on earth have you
done to Jung Hae-dang?

590
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,830
Why are you curious?

591
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:28,494
I'm curious how far a vulgar
creature like you can go.

592
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:34,143
Don't worry. As long as you're
alive, I'll be holding it in.

593
00:49:34,815 --> 00:49:39,385
- What?
- I'm not completely a rude person.

594
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:42,635
I'm not someone who can't
keep her place either.

595
00:49:43,776 --> 00:49:47,057
While you're alive, you can do as you wish.

596
00:49:48,206 --> 00:49:53,042
After you're gone, won't
everything be up to me anyways?

597
00:49:53,439 --> 00:49:57,455
You'll definitely be destroyed because
of that personality of yours.

598
00:49:59,893 --> 00:50:05,948
In the end, you don't allow anyone to remain
by your side. You can't live that way.

599
00:50:06,815 --> 00:50:09,943
I don't think you're the one
who can lecture me about that.

600
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,172
You're right. That's what I
learned from my experiences.

601
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:18,494
I'm suffering with a
daughter-in-law like you,

602
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,167
so I can't say I've been living correctly.

603
00:50:23,557 --> 00:50:27,502
Then you should accept
me and take my side now.

604
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:32,706
No. You're going to be abandoned by my son.

605
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:38,323
That will never happen,
so put your mind at ease.

606
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:40,573
I'm going to make sure that happens!

607
00:50:44,284 --> 00:50:49,710
Still, we should tell them. That way, they'll
be careful so that the rumor dies down.

608
00:50:50,104 --> 00:50:55,041
The moment you tell them, they're
going to be on awkward terms.

609
00:50:55,471 --> 00:50:57,971
They won't be able to get along
comfortably like they do now.

610
00:50:58,237 --> 00:51:00,854
The entire neighborhood
is already gossiping.

611
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:03,824
If they're the only ones who don't
know, then they'll become fools.

612
00:51:03,848 --> 00:51:08,432
But shouldn't we clearly find out
if it's a rumor or the truth?

613
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:11,455
- What?
- Of course it's a rumor!

614
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:13,914
- What if it isn't?- If it isn't...

615
00:51:17,565 --> 00:51:21,471
- I'm going to leave home.
- Hey! Calm down! Are you a teenager?

616
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:24,955
- We must move away at once!
- Do you have the money?

617
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:29,096
We should get a lease and move out.

618
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:33,612
Do you have the money to afford
a house for all five of us?

619
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,370
Just pay back the credit line you owe.

620
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,057
Gosh. Why did this have to
happen when we need every penny?

621
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:46,049
First, we must find out the truth.

622
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:49,487
What truth? We live with them,
so we know the truth already.

623
00:51:50,128 --> 00:51:53,794
- Don't they say you can't see right under your nose?
- Yeah, right!

624
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:57,721
- Stop saying ridiculous things, Hae-sung!
- What's ridiculous?

625
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,760
Hi.

626
00:52:03,728 --> 00:52:08,987
- Where are you coming from?
- The yard. Why?

627
00:52:11,237 --> 00:52:15,526
- W-Who were you with?
- What do you mean?

628
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:18,713
Why are you looking at me that way?

629
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,994
Even though you're my
father-in-law, I can't forgive you!

630
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,682
What's wrong with him?

631
00:52:31,362 --> 00:52:36,291
- It's nothing.
- Good night, Mr. Jung.

632
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:37,417
Good night.

633
00:52:39,885 --> 00:52:43,323
Why won't anyone make eye-contact with me?

634
00:52:44,846 --> 00:52:50,112
- Dad, do you have anything to tell me?
- No, I don't.

635
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:53,721
- You really don't?
- I don't.

636
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,979
I'm an aspiring writer, you know.

637
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:03,424
I think anything is possible in life.

638
00:53:04,464 --> 00:53:06,158
Think hard then.

639
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,190
If you can't sleep, fold
the laundry with me.

640
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:26,143
- I'm so frustrated.
- About what?

641
00:53:28,057 --> 00:53:34,010
I'm about to lose my mind because
there's something I can't tell you.

642
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,635
So what is it that you can't tell me?

643
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:44,416
- Mom, have you heard anything in the rumor mill these days?
- What rumor?

644
00:53:44,815 --> 00:53:46,369
A rumor about you.

645
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:51,658
A rumor about me? Why? Is there
a rumor that I'm a scrapper?

646
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:54,143
Oh, I see.

647
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:59,013
I went to throw trash away, and some
old hag was throwing away cans in the

648
00:53:59,037 --> 00:54:03,025
plastic bottle area, so I got into a
fight with her to teach her a lesson.

649
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:08,554
Who would make a rumor about that? They would
just be like, "live and die like that."

650
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,217
Then what rumor is it?

651
00:54:10,828 --> 00:54:17,633
Mom, have you heard about a rumor
that concerns you and Mr. Jung?

652
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:19,469
No.

653
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:24,804
- Mom, are you lonely?
- Of course not.

654
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:29,445
My children who are about to enter their
forties is constantly worrying me.

655
00:54:30,438 --> 00:54:32,969
I can't afford the luxury to feel lonely.

656
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:36,195
Gosh! I'm so frustrated that
I'm about to lose my mind!

657
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,469
Mom, are you dating Mr. Jung?

658
00:54:43,696 --> 00:54:46,773
- What?
- That's what the rumor is saying!

659
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:53,039
What wench said that? What rotten
wench dared to spout such nonsense?

660
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:55,876
Gosh! Why are you yelling
in the middle of the night?

661
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:01,203
Oh my gosh! Those wicked things!
How dare they!

662
00:55:01,344 --> 00:55:03,187
I feel so wronged! I feel so wronged!

663
00:55:04,899 --> 00:55:08,554
- Are you sure you feel 100% wronged?
- What did you say?

664
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:14,048
If it's a yes, you should just say so.
What are you hitting me for? Ouch!

665
00:55:14,072 --> 00:55:16,843
I can't even flip my heart
inside out to show you!

666
00:55:18,688 --> 00:55:20,821
Why did your face become so red?

667
00:55:21,813 --> 00:55:22,813
What?

668
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:27,008
My face gets hot and red for no
reason because of menopause!

669
00:55:27,305 --> 00:55:32,070
Oh, that's right. I bought this for you.

670
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:34,007
(HweraminQ)

671
00:55:36,016 --> 00:55:39,015
You need this for your age,
so make sure you eat it.

672
00:55:41,531 --> 00:55:44,609
You're the only one who thinks of me.

673
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:51,594
But what? I'm dating Jung Kang-sik?

674
00:55:52,664 --> 00:55:53,864
Goodness gracious!

675
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,680
You're not?

676
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:58,961
- You little...!
- Okay, okay!

677
00:56:01,766 --> 00:56:04,265
Of course I know they aren't
as close as they used to be.

678
00:56:05,086 --> 00:56:10,429
- However, father won't be able to easily leave her side.
- Why not?

679
00:56:10,874 --> 00:56:17,768
Her son has the crucial letter that
could be a clue to mom's death.

680
00:56:18,437 --> 00:56:21,445
- Are you serious?
- Father knows that.

681
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:27,140
That's why, in the end, he'll
take Yoo Ji-na's side.

682
00:56:27,727 --> 00:56:29,476
Darn it!

683
00:56:31,813 --> 00:56:35,463
Kyung-soo is a conscientious
person, but it won't

684
00:56:35,487 --> 00:56:38,844
be easy for him to bring
destruction upon his own mom.

685
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:48,703
Hyun-joon, go ahead and
marry Jung Hae-dang.

686
00:56:51,938 --> 00:56:55,336
- Grandmother.
- Get married to her and then go learn work in the company.

687
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,711
- That can't happen.
- Why not?

688
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,907
Think about it from
Kyung-soo's point-of-view.

689
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:03,062
His ex-girlfriend will become
his sister-in-law then.

690
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,933
I don't consider him as
a son of this family.

691
00:57:06,547 --> 00:57:09,898
He's not part of our family, so
she won't be his sister-in-law.

692
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:14,544
- Mother.
- Hyun-joon and Hyun-sung, come to my room when you're done eating.

693
00:57:21,414 --> 00:57:22,414
Mother.

694
00:57:24,586 --> 00:57:25,586
What?

695
00:57:26,429 --> 00:57:29,238
It's not that I don't like Hae-dang.

696
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,125
- But?
- But please consider Kyung-soo.

697
00:57:33,571 --> 00:57:35,851
You can consider Kyung-soo all you want.

698
00:57:36,532 --> 00:57:42,578
I'm going to make Hyun-joon into a decent
man and make him enter the company.

699
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:47,133
- You can't do that.
- I don't need your permission anymore.

700
00:57:48,305 --> 00:57:52,015
You dare ignore your sons' lives
in order to hide your own sins?

701
00:57:53,992 --> 00:57:58,242
Stop trying to hold onto your petty life
and go to the police station yourself.

702
00:57:58,891 --> 00:58:01,836
How dare you ruin your sons'
lives to survive on your own!

703
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,164
I'll be frank with you.

704
00:58:05,383 --> 00:58:09,211
I would like to take care
of my sons' lives, too.

705
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:15,922
- But?
- But I can't give up my life for them.

706
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,047
This is my conclusion.

707
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:24,344
That's why you're living
with that vulgar thing.

708
00:58:24,899 --> 00:58:26,832
Because you two are the same.

709
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:31,023
Because you two are selfish ones who
only care about your own lives.

710
00:58:31,485 --> 00:58:33,882
Because you two are no matter than beasts!

711
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,570
Mother!

712
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:44,078
Can you two take care of the company
without fighting amongst yourselves?

713
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:48,273
- Hyun-sung, answer me.
- Yes.

714
00:58:49,461 --> 00:58:53,134
Your brother is a novice
with company work because

715
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:56,828
he wasted years away rebelling
against your father.

716
00:58:58,578 --> 00:58:59,640
I know.

717
00:58:59,664 --> 00:59:04,898
- You can help him and take care of the company, can't you?
- Yes.

718
00:59:05,594 --> 00:59:07,200
Hyun-joon, answer me, too.

719
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:11,094
Hyun-sung may be your younger brother
but in the company, he's your superior.

720
00:59:11,774 --> 00:59:16,396
- You can follow him and learn from him, can't you?
- Yes.

721
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:20,013
Because there's a vulgar
snake in the house, we must

722
00:59:20,037 --> 00:59:22,919
team up, or we won't be
able to win against her.

723
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:30,547
We must unite in order to win
against someone like your father.

724
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:37,617
So what does grandmother mean?

725
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:42,136
She wants you to team up
with Hyun-joon against Yoo

726
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,493
Ji-na, protect the company, and
surrender the company to him.

727
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:51,375
But why did you easily
say you would do that?

728
00:59:52,711 --> 00:59:55,328
Is winning against my brother
all you can think of right now?

729
00:59:55,523 --> 00:59:58,540
- Then what else would I be thinking about?
- Ko Na-kyung!

730
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,117
I may be worthless to your grandmother,

731
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:07,664
but I can't stand and watch that
Jung Hae-dang woman be above me!

732
01:00:07,992 --> 01:00:11,259
- Honey.
- I didn't work as a kitchen slave for this family for that!

733
01:00:11,283 --> 01:00:13,102
Please stop it! It's chaotic enough!

734
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:18,650
- If you're really going to do this, I'm going to side with Yoo Ji-na.
- What?

735
01:00:19,134 --> 01:00:24,408
I'm going to side with Ji-na and make sure
Hae-dang and Hyun-joon can't get married.

736
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:26,009
Are you out of your mind?

737
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:31,197
If not for Hae-dang, Hyun-joon
would never come to his senses.

738
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,905
All he'll think about is getting
revenge on your father.

739
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,993
If you do this, I'll end you first.

740
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:40,533
What?

741
01:00:41,252 --> 01:00:45,118
All I can think about right now is
getting revenge on my father, too.

742
01:00:45,688 --> 01:00:46,977
Do whatever you want!

743
01:00:47,954 --> 01:00:53,767
I have nothing to lose now. I'm
going to do whatever I want.

744
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:56,939
Then let's get a divorce.

745
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:05,048
If I tell my grandmother
what you just said, we're

746
01:01:06,004 --> 01:01:08,400
going to end up getting
a divorce at the spot.

747
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:09,954
Park Hyun-sung.

748
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,559
Aren't you the one who signed the
contract about getting a divorce whenever

749
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:16,658
my family wanted with nothing but
three million dollars as an alimony?

750
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:19,009
Are you done talking?

751
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:28,009
Fine. It seems like it's time for
everyone to play their final cards.

752
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,580
I need to properly align myself.

753
01:01:34,883 --> 01:01:40,790
What I want is to move Hyun-joon aside
and make my husband into the successor.

754
01:01:41,213 --> 01:01:44,697
I don't need anything else but that.

755
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,103
You heard what your
mother said, didn't you?

756
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:01,992
She's never going to accept
Kyung-soo as her grandson.

757
01:02:02,814 --> 01:02:06,009
Isn't that why she's going to allow
Hae-dang and Hyun-joon to get married?

758
01:02:07,658 --> 01:02:11,408
Don't worry. I'm not going
to abandon your son.

759
01:02:14,017 --> 01:02:16,876
You'll protect Kyung-soo
until the end, won't you?

760
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:34,128
Kyung-soo, listen to me carefully.

761
01:02:36,588 --> 01:02:38,970
Give me that letter now.

762
01:02:41,088 --> 01:02:45,093
- What letter?
- Now is the time for you to give me that letter.

763
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:48,017
I lost it.

764
01:02:50,126 --> 01:02:54,236
- You lost it?
- Yes. I lost it.

765
01:02:55,626 --> 01:02:59,009
Then will you be okay if your mom
gets kicked out of this house?

766
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:04,204
Yoo Ji-na's singing career
is completely over.

767
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:10,814
She's been branded as a woman who
had abandoned her blind child.

768
01:03:12,774 --> 01:03:14,525
If I kick her out, it's the end for her.

769
01:03:15,118 --> 01:03:20,282
Will you be okay if I brush her
off like she's some kind of bug?

770
01:03:20,649 --> 01:03:25,198
Is that why you had revealed
I was her son at the

771
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:29,587
press conference when she
had denied it herself?

772
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:35,703
So that you could ruin her until
she had nowhere to run away

773
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:40,215
so that you could use that as
a weakness to get the letter?

774
01:03:40,596 --> 01:03:43,908
My life is at stake on that letter.

775
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:53,306
If Yoo Ji-na, your mom, gets
dumped by me in this situation,

776
01:03:53,689 --> 01:03:58,654
she might overdose on pills and take her
own life. What do you think about that?

777
01:03:58,678 --> 01:04:00,588
So this is the kind of person you are.

778
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:06,572
If you realize that, give
that letter to me now.

779
01:04:39,911 --> 01:04:42,566
("You Are Too Much")

780
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,374
I already told you that I lost it!

781
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:46,772
Then it's over for Yoo Ji-na.

782
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:51,337
I don't want to be pestered by such an
immoral, irresponsible woman anymore.

783
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,501
He has big expectations for you.

784
01:04:53,738 --> 01:04:55,763
One day, he'll dump you!

785
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,997
He might come to love me
again because of you.

786
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:04,165
If you decided to accept Hyun-joon's
love, get the letter from Kyung-soo.

787
01:05:04,189 --> 01:05:07,723
Thanks to your son, I now
have your fate in my hands.

788
01:05:07,747 --> 01:05:10,385
- Are you done talking?
- Lower your eyes at once!

789
01:05:10,516 --> 01:05:15,380
I'm going to make a trap. A trap
she won't be able to get out of.

790
01:05:15,404 --> 01:05:18,767
You should cool off. Would you like
to go shopping with me tomorrow?
