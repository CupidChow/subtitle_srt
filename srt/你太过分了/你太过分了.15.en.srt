<i>[Episode 15]</i>

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,390
No way...

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,080
Your friend, Lee Kyung Soo...

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:30,940
said that... my voice
is similar to his mom's?

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,980
That's right.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,490
Do you... want to meet him?

8
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,950
No.

9
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,450
Then...

10
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,240
Is there anything
you want to know about him?

11
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,620
No... No.

12
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,430
Then...

13
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,030
Why did you come here?

14
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,070
I was passing by...

15
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,950
Is it okay...

16
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,380
if I tell my friend...

17
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:49,090
that I am...
giving piano lessons to Yoo Ji Na?

18
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,400
No.

19
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:03,730
You can't tell your friend
that you know me at all.

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,050
Please don't.

21
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,450
You won't tell him, will you?

22
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,900
Tell me that you won't.

23
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,500
Okay...

24
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,200
I won't tell him.

25
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,770
One more.

26
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,310
You've had enough.

27
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,030
How arrogant...

28
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,060
One more.

29
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,530
Other customers have recognized
you and they keep staring at you.

30
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,690
One more!

31
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,370
Give it to me!

32
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,650
One more.

33
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:23,800
- Why don't you call your manager?
- Stop talking and give it to me.

34
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,060
Why are you calling me at this hour?

35
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,240
Take me...

36
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,440
back to the house.

37
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,050
What?

38
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,640
Please come...

39
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,380
here right now.

40
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,370
You should call Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

41
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,190
No...

42
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,680
I want you to come.

43
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,180
I want you... to come.

44
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
She's not picking up?

45
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,220
What kind of manager are you?

46
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,590
She's probably at one of her usual bars.

47
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,190
You checked and she's not there?

48
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,430
What if she's drunk and she passed out?

49
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,090
Are you just getting home now?

50
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,520
- What happened?
- What does it look like?

51
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,780
- Were you two drinking together?
- Why?

52
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,160
We can't drink together?

53
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,060
She called me, drunk, from the hotel bar.

54
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,220
- Hotel bar?
- She didn't want to leave the bar.

55
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,690
It was so hard to drag her out of there.

56
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,570
Leave her here and go inside.

57
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,670
Why are you crying?

58
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,510
Because...

59
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:56,160
I have a reason to cry.

60
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,230
Kyung Soo...

61
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,350
Kyung Soo!

62
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,220
I'll have you join the future strategic
office if you marry Yoon Hee right now.

63
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,760
Did you just say you'll let me
in the future strategic office?

64
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,380
The only condition is that you
marry Yoon Hee within two months.

65
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,410
Why are you out here?

66
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,180
I heard a loud noise, so I
came out to find out what was going on.

67
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,010
I don't have anything to lose anymore.

68
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,090
I am going all in.

69
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,180
Get married to Yoon Hee now.

70
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,290
What are you talking about?

71
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,430
If Hyun Joon takes over the company
and he marries Yoon Hee

72
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,080
I don't want to live anymore.

73
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,400
He said that just now in the hallway?

74
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,300
This is all because of Yoo Ji Na.

75
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,220
This is all because of her.

76
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,430
So why did you bring her into the house?

77
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,150
This is everyone?

78
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,390
Is your father not coming?

79
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,740
What? Was he drinking again?

80
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,110
- He left for work.
- Without eating?

81
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,130
I'm going to go too.

82
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,480
What's going on? What happened
that I don't know about?

83
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,240
You can hear it from Father.

84
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,890
Tell me now!

85
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,400
If Hyun Joon marries Yoon Hee

86
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,130
I think Father's going to pass
the future strategic office to him.

87
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,140
He can't give that up yet.

88
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,960
- That's what I'm saying.
- What nonsense is this?

89
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,260
Everyone is busy. It's just
my screenwriter and me cleaning.

90
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,770
I'm not a screenwriter...

91
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,000
If you're writing a screenplay,
you're a screenwriter.

92
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,390
Do you have to make money
to be called a screenwriter?

93
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,700
I'll call you a screenwriter,
just between you and me.

94
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,490
It's not like we're paying taxes on it.

95
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,670
You should stop cleaning.
Go inside and write.

96
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,450
Hae Dang told me to quit my
delivery job and focus on my writing

97
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,340
but I would feel too bad.

98
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,080
- I...
- You didn't go to work today?

99
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,220
I'm taking a day off
because my back hurts.

100
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,190
Work must be hard.

101
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,280
You don't have to cook dinner today.

102
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,140
Have dinner with us outside.

103
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,240
What's the occasion?

104
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,690
That's okay. Just go with your
family and have a good time.

105
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,830
And this is for you.

106
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,550
What is this?

107
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,950
- Socks.
- What for?

108
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,490
I didn't buy any
for the other family members.

109
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,880
You didn't have to get any for me.

110
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,430
You must be so happy, Dad!

111
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,810
If I run out of socks, we can share!

112
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,840
You worked so hard to earn the money...

113
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,140
Thank you so much for always
taking care of me like a father.

114
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,670
Well...

115
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,730
These are so precious.
How could I wear them?

116
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,620
I'm buying today,
so eat whatever you want.

117
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,050
Aren't you spending everything
you earned the past few days?

118
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,100
Don't worry. I'm still saving.

119
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,020
I don't know if I'll be able to swallow.

120
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,580
After you worked so hard
to make this money...

121
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,830
Again with that?

122
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,870
You said your back was hurting
this morning. Are you okay?

123
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,590
We'll see. Who knew I'd
buy dinner for my family?

124
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,500
Thank you.

125
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,020
Eat up.

126
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,460
Mom, here.

127
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,700
Bong Seon, thanks!

128
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,860
Yeah. Eat this and eat some more, okay?

129
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,630
Make sure you eat a lot!

130
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,710
You're okay since we're
just with family, right?

131
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,500
Of course. I'm going to eat
my money's worth today.

132
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,040
Does the owner give you a hard time?

133
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,620
It's not like that these days.

134
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,990
She has very good manners.

135
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,040
- Does she work?
- She gives lectures at a university.

136
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,510
Is she strict?

137
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,480
I asked her which university she works at

138
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,450
and it's the same one has Hae Jin's.

139
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,620
I bragged about how my sister-in-law
also lectures at the university.

140
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,510
She knows you.

141
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,210
You told her my name?

142
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,920
- Why?
- Why would you tell her?

143
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,150
I can't tell her?

144
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,680
Hoon and I... will eat later.

145
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,860
Hoon, come on.

146
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,940
Come on.

147
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,490
H... Honey...

148
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,640
- What's wrong with her?
- Why did you mention her to your boss?

149
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,450
She asked me what my husband
does for a living, so I told her

150
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,250
I'm divorced and live with my in-laws.
Then, she looked at me funny.

151
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,000
So I told her that.
What's wrong with that?

152
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,270
Still, why would you mention her name?

153
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,630
She didn't believe me. I was
trying to prove that I wasn't lying.

154
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,930
Don't you know that
she's sensitive about this?

155
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,570
Honey...

156
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,830
I'll take care of Hoon.
Go back to the table and eat.

157
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,940
Go eat yourself.

158
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,520
Look! I already ate so much!

159
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,630
Come on, let's go. Hurry up and go eat!

160
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,370
Let go!

161
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,700
Go ahead and eat!

162
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,780
Am I going to die if
I don't eat one meal?

163
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,680
But it's a waste if you don't eat.

164
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,890
You go ahead and eat.

165
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,080
If I eat right now,
I'm going to get indigestion.

166
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,150
Don't worry about her, let's just eat.

167
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,110
You!

168
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,960
- Let's talk.
- About what?

169
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,740
How do you act like there
is no one above you?

170
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,260
If you go to work,
you should just work.

171
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,770
Why would you talk about me like
lecturing is anything to brag about?

172
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,590
Can't family members
say good things like that?

173
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:02,390
I'm sure she wanted to assure her boss
she has someone who worries about her

174
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,990
and lives a normal life like everyone
else. You think she said that to brag?

175
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,720
I wouldn't have.

176
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,640
You wouldn't have
because you're arrogant!

177
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,350
- Mother.
- You said it's not embarrassing!

178
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,110
You said all jobs are honorable.

179
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,320
- Stop.
- Get a divorce then!

180
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,690
You want to divorce him.

181
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,430
If you hate it and you're
that embarrassed, you should divorce him.

182
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,060
If we keep this up, you and
I are both going to get sick!

183
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,110
Mom...

184
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,370
Hae Jin...

185
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,650
This is going to last a couple of days!

186
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,670
<i>I have nothing to lose anymore.</i>

187
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,150
<i>I'm going all in.</i>

188
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,940
<i>Get married to Yoon Hee now.</i>

189
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,170
<i>I... really love him.</i>

190
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,320
Are you going to the office?

191
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,500
Wait.

192
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,200
I have something to say.

193
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,240
What is it?

194
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,070
Do you remember
that I said I would tell you

195
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,960
the next part of the story
if you kept your promise?

196
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,480
I did not tell anyone
that I heard it from you.

197
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
- I know.
- What's the next part of the story?

198
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,240
It's about the will.

199
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,870
The will?

200
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,390
What are you thinking about so deeply?

201
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,150
I was thinking about my
guardian who passed away.

202
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,380
There are people
who are willing to ignore

203
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,410
their child for their own selfishness.

204
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:22,130
But I wonder how she was able to think
about me even as she was dying.

205
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,250
I know.

206
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,160
She could have died unfairly...

207
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,530
You're worried that the will was lost?

208
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,250
That day...

209
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,230
when I was walked in here...

210
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,690
Father was talking
to someone about a will

211
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,310
and then abruptly hung up.

212
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,060
When I asked him who he was
talking to he said not to worry about it.

213
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,970
I thought it had to be Mother...

214
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:08,130
so I asked her and she said she
had just spoken to Father on the phone.

215
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,410
I kept thinking about the will.
It was mentioned out of the blue.

216
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:21,270
The next time your father
went to the vacation house

217
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,700
your mother jumped off the cliff
and committed suicide.

218
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,750
In the end, it's because of the will
that she committed suicide.

219
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,480
The only thing credible is the will.

220
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,510
Don't you think it's strange
that your father and mother

221
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,770
talked about it on the phone
before the incident?

222
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,970
Perhaps...

223
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,680
the will is lost?

224
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,990
Did you tell the police about this?

225
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,310
No.

226
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,510
I was too scared of your father.

227
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,530
I still don't plan on
saying anything about it.

228
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,870
When I send you to
the future strategy office

229
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,670
it means that I've started
the process to make you the CEO.

230
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:48,100
You can think of it as
giving you authority over the company.

231
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,840
I was able to achieve this success

232
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,210
by devoting my time and energy.

233
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,160
I'm trying to solve this
matter by going all in.

234
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:07,450
If you understand this, then I hope
you will stop rebelling against me

235
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,110
and get yourself together.

236
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:14,040
You love that woman, Yoo Ji Na,
that much? Is that it?

237
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,420
That's right. I love her.

238
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,990
- You have to tell me this first.
- What?

239
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,860
You don't have anything to say to me
about the will Mom wrote before she died?

240
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,680
Your eyes are uncertain.

241
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,980
I asked if you have anything
to say about the will!

242
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,130
I already said everything to the police.

243
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,510
Murderer.

244
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,180
What did you say?

245
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,900
I said no. No. No! No!

246
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,660
No. Never!

247
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,610
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

248
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,320
She has a schedule!
What are you doing?

249
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,650
Yoo Ji Na!

250
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,180
Yoo Ji Na! Yoo Ji Na!

251
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,050
Follow him! Follow him!

252
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,720
Hurry!

253
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,050
Step on it.
Step on it!

254
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,620
We lost them.

255
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,000
Everyone is crazy. Everyone is crazy!

256
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,860
Where are we going?

257
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,300
Are you fighting
with Chairman Park again?

258
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,640
I still have work to do.

259
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,670
Go if you want to go.

260
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,890
You're being too reckless with me.

261
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,270
Shouldn't you at least
tell me what's going on?

262
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,650
I said to go if you want to.

263
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,660
He forced her into the car
in front of everyone.

264
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,470
That's kidnapping!

265
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,580
Did she just sit there
when he pushed her into the car?

266
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,880
That's why she's not in her right mind.

267
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,300
- Call her.
- I have her phone.

268
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,440
I was going to give it to her
when we got in the car.

269
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,380
If you get call from them,
I want to be the first to know.

270
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Yes.

271
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,720
When can I use the practice room?

272
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,040
It's empty right now.
You can use it until 2 o' clock.

273
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,630
Did you hear anything from
the broadcasting station?

274
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,010
- What do you mean?
- I was wondering

275
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,880
if Yoo Ji Na did anything to stop me.

276
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,970
Nothing has happened, so don't
worry about it. Just go practice.

277
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
Is the president not here today?

278
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,240
He's taking the day off.

279
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,730
- Is he sick?
- I don't think so.

280
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,950
Then why didn't he show up to work?

281
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:18,840
<i>But what use is it to ask? There’s
only the typical answer, “Cheer up!”</i>

282
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:27,720
<i>I... really love him.</i>

283
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,500
Don't say that in front of me!

284
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,170
- I'm here!
- Hi.

285
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,480
You still seem really down.

286
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,740
It's stuffy in here. Do you want
to get some fresh air?

287
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,060
I wonder if I recovered
my eyesight to see her.

288
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,210
You met her?

289
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,060
I couldn't tell her I was her son.
I told her I was his friend.

290
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,140
Just in case... she didn't
want to meet me.

291
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,230
But I guess I was still hoping.

292
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,650
Even when she was crying
in front of me...

293
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:36,780
she didn't want to know
more about her son.

294
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,830
So that means you got to see your mom.

295
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,990
Is she well?

296
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,900
That alone is already enough
to be grateful for.

297
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,260
Should I be thinking about it that way?

298
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,280
You said she cried.

299
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,290
Without any noise, she was weeping.

300
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,210
They say there are people you should meet

301
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:19,740
and people you should not meet.

302
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,240
Now that you know how your mom is doing

303
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,300
you should just watch her
and pray for her.

304
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,310
Just do that.

305
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:41,150
That is your relationship
with your mother.

306
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,690
Accept that in your heart.

307
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,790
Just like how...

308
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,260
you decided to live

309
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,390
as Yoo Ji Na's impersonator?

310
00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:01,490
There is a senior impersonator
singer who recently passed away.

311
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,330
Almost everyone knows her
because she was so successful.

312
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,520
On her tombstone

313
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,790
instead of the referencing the countless
songs she covered in her lifetime

314
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:26,300
written on it are the lyrics to
the one and only song that she released

315
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,600
using the money her parents borrowed

316
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,670
that ultimately led her
to her career as an impersonator.

317
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,220
At the end of her life, she returned to
her own name and then left this world.

318
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,350
We all have

319
00:27:52,350 --> 00:28:00,310
our own burdens that we
must carry through our lives.

320
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,090
Hae Dang.

321
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,830
If I didn't have you...

322
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,480
how would I be able to
get through this moment?

323
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:22,160
To be honest, I'm in pain
seeing you in so much pain.

324
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,480
You must have wanted to see her so badly.

325
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,360
You must have had
so many things to share.

326
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,740
Questions you wanted to ask...

327
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,200
Things you wanted to hear from her.

328
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,900
I thought my head was going to explode.

329
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,120
I'm getting some fresh air
at the beach thanks to you.

330
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,430
People say thing so casually.

331
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,840
"Empty your heart."
Have you heard them say that?

332
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,910
Don't you think it's such
a terrible thing to say?

333
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,410
What are you talking about?

334
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,390
Everyone has something
that they hold on to dearly.

335
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,680
Whether people around you
tell you it's meaningful or not

336
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,650
there is something
that you hold on to dearly.

337
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,410
You're telling the person
to give that up.

338
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,730
By choice.

339
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,260
What were you holding
on to this whole time?

340
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,980
Success.

341
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:22,030
The kind of success that was self-made
and no one could ignore me.

342
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,200
You already succeeded.

343
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,680
I did succeed.

344
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,670
Then, what more do you want?

345
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,750
There is no success without any pain.

346
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,230
Then, what kind of pain did you go
through for your heartbreaking success?

347
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,700
There are two kinds
of people in this world.

348
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,750
People who take in the pain
for success by themselves

349
00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:00,500
and people who inflict pain on others
and pretend that they're in pain.

350
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,420
You have to start heading back if
we want to get back to Seoul tonight.

351
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,790
I'm not going back to Seoul tonight.

352
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,880
- We're not?
- We're not going.

353
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,030
That little bastard!

354
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,110
S... Sir.

355
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,180
Where is Hae Jin? Tell her to come out.

356
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,800
What? I... Oh! Your father...

357
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,870
Okay fine! Get a divorce!

358
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,310
But even if you get a divorce,
don't come downstairs!

359
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,500
- Dad...
- After your divorce, leave this house!

360
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,020
Make your own money, get your own house

361
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,040
and take care of your
own needs by yourself!

362
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,360
How dare you look down on and
be embarrassed of your own family?

363
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm embarrassed that I raised you
this way! I can't even look at myself!

364
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,680
You're the one doing the most harm
out of this entire family. You know that!

365
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,880
Dad!

366
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,800
You live in your family's house,
you live off of your husband's paycheck

367
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,700
and your mother-in-law
does all the housework!

368
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,530
All you do is sit and study. What
are you doing worth bragging about?

369
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,730
Fine. I'll get a divorce.

370
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,610
Bong Soo! Starting next month,
don't give her your paycheck!

371
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,590
Give 500,000 won to Hae Dang for rent,
but give the rest to your mother!

372
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,010
And then live your own life!

373
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,430
I spoiled you, thinking it was
okay because you're smart.

374
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:01,540
You had to show your temper
just because your pride was hurt

375
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,270
after she took you out for dinner
with the money that injured her back?

376
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,850
You little bastard... My goodness!

377
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Why did you tell him?

378
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,870
I was just venting.

379
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,000
Who knew he was going to come up
and make such a scene?

380
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,310
Mom, you were so angry that you
needed to vent to somebody?

381
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,160
Your temper is pretty bad too.

382
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,630
I don't hate Hoon's mom.

383
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,700
Is there anyone that you hate?

384
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,620
If I were just a little more thoughtful,
then I wouldn't have mentioned her name.

385
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,890
With her kind of temper and pride,
it makes sense for her to get angry.

386
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:04,280
Both my kids are so thoughtful.

387
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,590
That's why you ended up doing good
deeds for everyone else but got divorced!

388
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,990
That is the kind of person you are, Mom.

389
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,410
You think anyone can take care of you?
And especially live with you?

390
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,530
How are you so simplistic?

391
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,880
There have to be people like me too.

392
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,020
If everyone was strict like you,
or smart like Hae Jin

393
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,600
how could anyone breathe in this world?

394
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,510
I know you're my daughter, but
you have such a good personality.

395
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,060
Are you being sarcastic?

396
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,510
Of course!

397
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,850
Mom.

398
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,550
Even as a little girl

399
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,120
when my neighbors saw me

400
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:53,400
they would tell me that I looked
like a doll, or that I was so pretty.

401
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,330
I guess

402
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:05,550
what celebrity didn't hear people
say that when they were growing up?

403
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,800
Plus, when I sang

404
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,430
people would say, "You have a face
of a doll, and you sing like an angel."

405
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:23,720
Starting in high school,
I went to a music cafe

406
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,220
to sing and play my guitar
without letting my teachers know.

407
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,880
With heavy makeup on.

408
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,270
That's when your life
became full of ups and downs.

409
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,260
In the end, they found out about it.

410
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,870
Luckily, I didn't get kicked
out of school but...

411
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,380
I couldn't stop.

412
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,370
- What?
- The way people looked at me

413
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,790
when I sang...

414
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,920
People screaming and cheering for me.

415
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,280
It's not like there were that
many people in the cafe.

416
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,030
That wasn't important.

417
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:09,430
I got a taste of what it's
like to stand on a stage.

418
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,020
It's like a drug.

419
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,380
Singers who retire

420
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,910
when they see a car's
headlights beaming at them

421
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,450
their hearts start to beat fast because
it reminds them of stage spotlights.

422
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:32,340
That's why I boldly decided
to advance to the next city.

423
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,890
This time, I even lied about my age.

424
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,660
After that

425
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,390
that's when my life turned upside down.

426
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:52,240
I couldn't handle my own life anymore.

427
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,100
And I was so young back then...

428
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,690
Did you tell...

429
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,290
this story to Chairman Park Sung Hwan?

430
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,240
- No.
- Why are you telling me?

431
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,270
Because I want to.

432
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,200
My makeup became thicker and thicker

433
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,710
the spotlights became more glamorous...

434
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,360
and my life rotted away.

435
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,240
To a girl with no money or power

436
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,990
beauty can be a strong weapon

437
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:45,170
as well as a poison
that can rot your life away.

438
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,170
Let's get up now.

439
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,490
Get up and then what?

440
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,050
We go to sleep in the room.

441
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,560
- Here?
- Where else would we go?

442
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,800
You want to go with me right now?

443
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,100
Then, should I go by myself?

444
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,870
Go ahead up. Did you
forget that I'm a celebrity?

445
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,950
You're thinking about that right now?

446
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,800
You think people won't notice you
if you're wearing sunglasses?

447
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,170
I made a reservation earlier this
afternoon. Park Hyun Joon.

448
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,510
Here you go.

449
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,300
You only got one key?

450
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,490
Why would I get two?
That would be a waste of money.

451
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,760
What are you doing? Get in.

452
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,160
Excuse me, Park Hyun Joon.

453
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,250
What are you trying to do right now?

454
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,520
Do we need to talk about this right now?

455
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,560
What are you doing? Get out.

456
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,370
Do you know what Yoo Ji Na's
biggest tragedy is?

457
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,890
What is it?

458
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,620
That you're clever but reckless.

459
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,890
You can save your sad stories
for Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

460
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,180
Why do you think it works to push away
Chairman Park Sung Hwan

461
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:35,600
but to act pitiful in front of me?

462
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,970
If you really hate him, then
just get out of the house.

463
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,250
You think you have nothing to lose

464
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,850
so you let the man who is
desperate for you, hang on to you

465
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,910
while you play tricks on his son?

466
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,050
Are you saying you have
the best of both worlds?

467
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,000
You brought me here to tell me that?

468
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,810
You disgust me.

469
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,890
- I disgust you?
- Other men might find it

470
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:09,480
captivating or sensuous

471
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,900
but all I feel is disgust.

472
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,550
The raw kind of disgust
that makes your skin crawl.

473
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,010
Just say that I'm a cruel person.

474
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,450
Why are you going around
in a circle to tell me that?

475
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:28,170
The way you push yourself on me
is offensive and disgusting.

476
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:36,530
So are you trying to decide what
to do with me since I'm so disgusting?

477
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,710
You bastard.

478
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,220
Not really.

479
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,620
Rest well. I'll see you back in Seoul.

480
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,580
Wait.

481
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,250
You didn't bring me here because
you thought I couldn't find the room.

482
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,880
Did you have someone take
pictures of us going into the room?

483
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,110
You entered this world
before you turned 20.

484
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,650
And you fought against it with no power.

485
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:16,550
Who would have taught you how to love?

486
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,340
You probably just learned how
to growl to get what you want.

487
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,630
Like an animal.

488
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,900
What did you say?

489
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,200
<i>[Yoo Jui Na]</i>

490
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,450
<i>[Yoo Jui Na]</i>

491
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:10,850
<i>[Hae Dang]</i>

492
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,810
<i>[Save Contact]</i>

493
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:20,000
<i>[Hae Dang]</i>

494
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:27,340
<i>I... really love him.</i>

495
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,880
Don't tell me that!

496
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,190
Did Hyun Joon not come home yesterday?

497
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,760
I sent him to the Japanese
headquarters to run an errand.

498
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,700
Yoo Ji Na didn't come home either.

499
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,500
She told me she had a concert.
That's probably where she is.

500
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:01,320
- Go ahead and eat.
- Let me see you.

501
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,960
I'm eating.

502
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,800
You can eat right now?

503
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,540
What are you worried about, Mother?

504
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,450
What?

505
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,680
Nothing happened.

506
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,530
What?

507
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,540
Welcome.

508
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,090
Did something happen?

509
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:37,680
Yoo Ji Na and Hyun Joon
did not come home last night.

510
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,170
- So?
- What?

511
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,280
The one Hyun Joon is
interested in is not Yoo Ji Na.

512
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,000
What do you mean?

513
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,640
Judging by my son's expression,
they definitely disappeared together.

514
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,980
- There's no way...
- Would his face

515
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,820
have turned purple like that if it was
something he wasn't sure about?

516
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,460
Then, what's going on?

517
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:05,460
How can you not even know exactly
who Hyun Joon is interested in?

518
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,610
Are you getting mad at me now?

519
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:11,080
Geez.

520
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,750
<i>Her family background is good,
but what an idiot!</i>

521
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,980
<i>Even if we had 30 of you, you wouldn't
be able to go up against that one!</i>

522
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:30,240
Is there another woman
Hyun Joon is interested in?

523
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,150
Who is it?

524
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,210
What does she do?
What's her family background?

525
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,390
There's too much going on
right now, so just be quiet.

526
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,640
Did you sleep at a hotel?

527
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,040
Where else would I have slept?

528
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,920
I made an excuse that
you went to the hospital

529
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,600
for the meeting you missed yesterday.

530
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,990
When you meet them, don't act too normal.

531
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,580
Nobody called you,
but Yoon Sung Ha texted you.

532
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,420
- What did he say?
- He sent you music for your lessons.

533
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,190
He said if you don't like it,
he will change it to something else.

534
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,330
He didn't say anything else?

535
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,430
What else would he say?

536
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,720
<i>Tears again even when I’m in love.
Goodbye to those nothing memories.</i>

537
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,940
<i>I’ll forget them all.</i>

538
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,600
You scared me!

539
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,520
Why didn't you come out yesterday?

540
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,660
Why are you staring at me like that?

541
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,900
- Because it's so ridiculous.
- What's so ridiculous?

542
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,010
I've never been the one
who falls for someone first

543
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,900
but now I find out
she loves someone else.

544
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,050
The more I think about it,
the more ridiculous it is to me.

545
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,800
Let's go for some tea.
Wash up and come outside.

546
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,550
It's a weird situation
for me to say I'm sorry...

547
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,280
but I'm sorry.

548
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,660
Why?

549
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:38,640
Thanks for being so thoughtful.

550
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,100
Again!

551
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,310
I'm not joking. I really love him.

552
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:47,610
I already told you to not
say that in front of me.

553
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:51,550
I'm just worried that things might
get uncomfortable between us.

554
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,040
Nothing you can do about that.

555
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,490
If you love someone else and
you're not uncomfortable

556
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,090
that's too unfair for me.

557
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:05,290
Now you sound more like
the Park Hyun Joon I know.

558
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,100
Let's meet him.

559
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,600
Who?

560
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,230
- That guy.
- Are you crazy?

561
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,710
It's part of the management process
as your agency president.

562
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,970
You don't need to go
that far to manage me.

563
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,690
Is he nothing special?

564
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,670
What kind of ridiculous
thing is that to say?

565
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,090
He's so much younger than me,
super nice, and so handsome...

566
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,340
Did you fall for his looks?

567
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,630
Let's stop talking about this.

568
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,280
I'm going to find him.

569
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,390
- You don't even know where he is.
- I'm sure he's somewhere.

570
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,820
Stop it.

571
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,680
He's delicate and soft-hearted.
If you do that, he might get hurt.

572
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,630
I'm going to do whatever
it takes to find him.

573
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,170
This conversation ends here!

574
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,750
Says who?

575
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:00,500
I didn't see you for one day, and all
day, I couldn't get you out of my head.

576
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,710
- Stop it!
- Why are you yelling?

577
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,170
From now on, you can't think
about me when I'm not here!

578
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,050
Why do you care who
I think about in my head?

579
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,180
If you keep doing this,
I'm going to leave the agency.

580
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,990
If you have money,
pay the contract fee and leave.

581
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,900
I'll bring a check tomorrow!

582
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,890
You must have earned a lot of money.

583
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,990
The termination fee is three
times the original amount.

584
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,200
- R... Really?
- You didn't even read the contract?

585
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,910
If you cancel the contract
without any agreement

586
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,300
the compensation is three times the fee.

587
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,050
- Did it say that?
- I'm fine now that I've seen your face.

588
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,370
I have to go home and rest. I'm tired.

589
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:47,790
I just stopped here to see you.

590
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,440
I'll be going now. I'll see you later.

591
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:04,150
Are you just getting in now?

592
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,480
Where did you sleep last night?

593
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:12,400
Please let me know if you're
not coming home next time.

594
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,280
If people I'm expecting
don't come home

595
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,080
I can't sleep at night
because I'm worried.

596
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,400
Do you like the music
I sent for the lessons?

597
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,430
If you're not busy,
can you come tomorrow?

598
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:36,220
We have no lesson tomorrow. What for?

599
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,510
- Are you busy?
- No.

600
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,920
I don't have much going on.

601
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,350
I have something to say.

602
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,060
If it's something important,
I can go over today.

603
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,410
I'm too tired today.
Can you come tomorrow?

604
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:58,410
Yoo Ji Na just came home.

605
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,780
I called because I thought
you might be worried.

606
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,320
Okay.

607
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,780
Make it quick. I'm tired.

608
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,540
If you can't stop, it's sometimes
best to just jump recklessly.

609
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,280
Does everything always work out
the way you want it to?

610
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,530
Then, why don't you jump first?

611
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,550
I can force you to jump.

612
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:33,250
- You can try if you want to.
- I'm not joking.

613
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,860
I'm tired.

614
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,170
Where were you guys
and what were you doing?

615
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,570
What are you asking me right now?

616
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,360
Where were you guys
and what were you doing?

617
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,100
Wow... Ridiculous.

618
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,690
I asked you what you guys did!

619
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:52,360
Not too long ago, you looked at me
like I was a wife who cheated on you.

620
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,260
Today, you seem like
a mad, jealous husband.

621
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,930
Are you my husband?

622
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:03,040
How dare you ask me questions like that?

623
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,600
You think I'm your wife or something
because you gave me a place to stay?

624
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,810
Who do you think I am to ask
me that kind of question?

625
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,810
How rude.

626
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,080
My home doesn't feel like my home.

627
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,810
Why do you think that?

628
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:28,280
I just feel like... I'm wandering around
with my belongings in a wagon.

629
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,050
I feel unsettled and have
no connection to this place.

630
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:36,440
I don't feel like they are my family.

631
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,910
The plates in the kitchen
don't feel like mine

632
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:44,890
and the washing machine in the bathroom
feels like it belongs to the laundromat.

633
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,730
I feel like I should go somewhere.

634
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:51,140
I feel like I'm just standing
in the middle of the street.

635
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,950
I understand what you're saying.

636
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,280
But this was your choice.

637
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,780
Was there anyone who
told you to get married?

638
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,430
That's what's driving me more insane!

639
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:04,320
Why are you taking your
anger out on your family?

640
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,870
My mother-in-law always looks like

641
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:10,630
she's going to attack
me to prove her worth.

642
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,890
My sister-in-law, I wouldn't talk to her
at all if she weren't Hoon's aunt.

643
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:17,440
She the kind of person I hate the most!

644
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,330
I would rather have
a mean sister-in-law instead.

645
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,510
The world doesn't go the way
you want it to. That's life.

646
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:29,840
If you think you really can't do it

647
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,430
get a divorce. If you do, what
are you going to do with Hoon?

648
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:37,430
Is that even a question?
Of course I'm going to raise him.

649
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:40,480
Then, quit school and raise him.

650
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,410
- Hae Dang.
- You say that you're going to raise him.

651
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,710
Who are you expecting to raise him?

652
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:49,530
Who has the time to raise your kid?

653
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:56,680
How many people do you think
live happily ever after

654
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,370
and get to live the life they want?

655
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,730
You think people put up with you because
they are not as smart as you are?

656
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,420
I didn't think you would be this way.

657
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,120
Who was the one who said you
were going to support me until the end?

658
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,670
You're right. It was me.

659
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,570
But I changed my mind.

660
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:19,850
I'm sorry I changed my mind,
but if you want to continue your studies

661
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,490
you have tolerate
a sister-in-law you hate

662
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,620
and a mother-in-law
who gets on your nerves!

663
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,590
If you can't handle that, get a divorce

664
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,130
and do your best to raise your own kid.

665
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,150
I'll feed you.

666
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,940
Let's get a divorce.

667
00:55:55,690 --> 00:56:00,960
I'm going to raise Hoon even
if I have to quit school and tutoring.

668
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,840
Fine. Let's do it.

669
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,450
I'm sorry for hurting
you this whole time.

670
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:17,890
Get the documents ready. I'll sign them.

671
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:22,220
And from now on,
I'm going to sleep in the other room.

672
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:27,000
Bring Hoon and sleep here with him.

673
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,020
I'll finally let you have a divorce.

674
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,450
I'll let you because
you're being so cheap!

675
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,360
I have something to say.

676
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,110
What is it?

677
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:58,470
We decided to get a divorce.

678
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,830
She said she's going to raise Hoon.

679
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,090
- Wait...
- When we get a divorce

680
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:13,820
I'll give you the money that we have
been saving up to leave this house.

681
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,830
You and Bong Seon,
take good care of yourselves.

682
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:19,630
What are you going to do?

683
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:23,900
- Don't ask me.
- What are you going to do?

684
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:29,270
I'm going to go somewhere far, far away.

685
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,030
I'm going to leave and go far, far away.

686
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,700
Whether I go to the temple
and shave my head

687
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,890
or clean a stone under a linden tree

688
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:52,010
I'm going to live my life however I want,
so don't look for me. Just be happy.

689
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,530
I'm going to be like a bird and...

690
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:02,570
fly, fly, fly away.

691
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,370
<i>- I'm flying like a bird.</i>
- Oh my goodness.

692
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:11,210
Bong Soo. Wake up. Wake up!
What's wrong with him?

693
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:12,940
<i>- I'm a bird!</i>
- Hey, Bong Soo!

694
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,990
What is it that you want to tell me?

695
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,690
Thank you for all your hard work.

696
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:27,990
I included two months
of payments and a little more.

697
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:29,920
You don't need to do that.

698
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,640
It's my way of expressing my heart

699
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,990
so please don't feel
burdened by it, just take it.

700
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,850
And I have one request.

701
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:42,520
The conversations we had
about Lee Kyung Soo...

702
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,150
please don't tell others about it.

703
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:51,730
Are you giving me more to stay quiet?

704
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:56,910
The amount will be a lot
more than you would expect.

705
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:00,760
If that's what you're worried about,
then you don't have to give it to me.

706
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:06,700
No... This is a promise to each other.

707
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,710
I don't need the two months
of payments either.

708
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:15,160
I didn't even teach for one full month,
and you gave me a lot of gifts.

709
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:23,680
I want you to forget that I was
ever interested in Lee Kyung Soo.

710
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,690
This is very important to me.

711
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:33,930
Are you quitting the lessons...

712
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,260
because of Lee Kyung Soo?

713
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,390
Unfortunately.

714
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:46,580
I wanted to spend a lot of time with you.

715
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,510
Get home safe.

716
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,930
I won't go far.

717
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:40,560
- What is that?
- Some man asked me to give this to you.

718
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,800
Would you like us to
see what's inside first?

719
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,290
No. You can just leave it here.

720
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,270
Set up a press conference tomorrow
and announce that you're engaged.

721
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,050
- Do what?
- An engagement announcement.

722
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:36,580
- To whom?
- Me. Park Sung Hwan.

723
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:39,930
Calm down, Chairman Park Sung Hwan.

724
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,760
<i>[Who is the boy pictured in
pop singer Yoo Ji Na's locket?]</i>

725
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,800
I'll ask again.

726
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,890
Invite the reporters and
announce our engagement.

727
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,240
Who is the child in the photograph?

728
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,950
Who is this Lee Kyung Soo child?

729
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,550
I mean, he's probably
not a child anymore.

730
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:18,920
Who is Lee Kyung Soo? He's blind?

731
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:28,390
If you don't want the public to find out

732
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:32,000
about popular singer, Yoo Ji Na's, past

733
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,970
then come to the press conference
tomorrow to announce our engagement.

734
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,010
Announce it officially.
