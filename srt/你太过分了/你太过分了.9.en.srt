<i>[Episode 9]</i>

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,530
Be careful!

4
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,480
Get up. Are you okay?

5
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,470
Who are you?

6
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,600
I am the pianist for the party.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,970
Oh, really?

8
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,680
But...

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,080
I feel like I've seen you before.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,380
Your face looks familiar.

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,820
Oh, that's right!

12
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,880
The cafe in Hae Dang's neighborhood!

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,470
Do you know Jung Hae Dang?

14
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,210
Her younger sister worked at that cafe.

15
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,150
Yes.

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,530
That's where I saw you.

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,750
I thought your piano skills were amazing.

18
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,150
Thank you.

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,720
Then...

20
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,760
<i>He can't see.</i>

21
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,810
Would you like me to help you?

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,360
I don't need help.

23
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,100
Excuse me.

24
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,040
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,720
Why?

26
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,500
Nothing.

27
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,520
Is Grandmother's birthday party
happening at the house?

28
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,700
She told me to prepare
it as a garden party.

29
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,500
It looks like a pianist was
hired to play as well.

30
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,560
That's how we've been doing it.

31
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,820
I want to see you.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,110
You don't have anything to say to me?

33
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,400
If you have something
to say, tell me now.

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,790
Did you hear me that day?

35
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,430
I did.

36
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,430
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,760
If you're sorry

38
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,130
then leave this house on your own!

39
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,800
- Grandmother.
- If you leave on your own

40
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,740
I'll give you one building to keep.

41
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,860
You deserve that much after
serving food for the family.

42
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,020
Please forgive me. I'm sorry!

43
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,320
Who's going to take your side?

44
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,620
Your father-in-law? Your husband?

45
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,020
I won't let that happen ever again!

46
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,890
Do you really feel
sorry for what you did?

47
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,290
Of course!

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,250
Then...

49
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,440
I want you to kick
Yoo Ji Na out of this house.

50
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,830
How... How could I?

51
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,860
Why not?

52
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,020
You seem more than capable
of doing that in my opinion.

53
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,950
That's my request.

54
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:23,120
<i>Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!</i>

55
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,380
<i>Happy birthday, dear Kyung Soo!</i>

56
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,920
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

57
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Blow it out!

58
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,880
Happy birthday Kyung Soo!

59
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,770
Happy birthday!

60
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,160
Mom, do you like that I'm your kid?

61
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,520
Of course!

62
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,380
Me too. I really really
like that you're my mom!

63
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,070
You're so cute!

64
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,020
<i>Mom, is it day or night?</i>

65
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,240
It's night.

66
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,280
Mom, I'm scared because
I can't see anything.

67
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,760
Come here.

68
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,030
Let's go to sleep.

69
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,110
Mom, sing me a song.

70
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,910
Okay.

71
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,090
<i>Playing during the day.</i>

72
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,690
<i>I left it behind.</i>

73
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,860
<i>The tree leaf boat.</i>

74
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Grandmother, I'm home.

75
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,020
You just got home?

76
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,010
You worked hard. Wash up and eat.

77
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,510
By the way

78
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,950
The granddaughter of Samon Group's
Chairman Jo came back to Korea.

79
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,900
As soon as she landed,
she asked about you.

80
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,390
She asked if you
would have dinner with her

81
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,880
so I told her I'd try to set up a time.

82
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,840
You'll go, right?

83
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,590
Are you really... going to see her?

84
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,160
How can I go against Grandmother?

85
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,560
- You and that girl dated.
- Why would you bring up the past?

86
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,840
We got married because
Grandmother separated you two.

87
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,100
If it weren't for me

88
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,380
wouldn't you have married her?

89
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,940
Probably.

90
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,950
Do you... miss her?

91
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,780
I guess she's back in Korea.

92
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,680
You don't have anything better
to do on a Sunday morning?

93
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,130
What should I be doing?

94
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,920
Take her out to lunch.

95
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,320
If I go out with her now,
I'm going to get punched in the face.

96
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,210
Tell her you're going
to take her to the mall.

97
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,690
All women love going to the mall.

98
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,350
I just want to sit here and
laze around in front of the TV.

99
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,450
For the sake of family peace,
get up right now!

100
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,760
Hurry up! Hurry!

101
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,250
Get up!

102
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,180
Okay, okay! Okay!

103
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,690
Go!

104
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,700
Hey... What are you doing?

105
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,260
You don't have anything to study for?

106
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,670
I study 12 months of the year.

107
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,150
Is something bad going to happen
if I don't study for one day?

108
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,150
Then, let's go to the mall.

109
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,780
- No.
- I'll buy you a spring outfit!

110
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,990
Is money growing on trees?

111
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,980
- I'm too lazy to do anything.
- Get up! Get up!

112
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,640
If you laze around, you'll get old.

113
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,450
Are you scared of me getting old?

114
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,440
I wish I would just age quickly,
so there wouldn't be any regrets!

115
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,590
Oh you clever little thing.

116
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,480
I don't want to!

117
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,310
Oh! Come over here!

118
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,300
This would look great on you!

119
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,360
Doesn't this look nice?

120
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,030
Should I... try it on?

121
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,050
Yeah. Try it on. I'm going
to use the bathroom.

122
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,550
Okay?

123
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,520
Oh my gosh! Aren't you Jung Hae Jin?

124
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,410
Oh my gosh... Who are you?

125
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,620
Isn't this the first time since
high school graduation?

126
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,750
So nice to see you.

127
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,290
How have you been? Are you married?

128
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,280
- Yeah.
- Are you doing anything?

129
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,090
I lecture at a university.

130
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,050
I see. You were always first
in school. That's awesome.

131
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,640
It's not that great.

132
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,940
Honey, say hi. This is my
high school friend.

133
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,360
Hello.

134
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,720
You succeeded. He's handsome.

135
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,570
He's six years younger.

136
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,030
Right? I thought so.

137
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,790
If you need anything,
call me. He's a lawyer.

138
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,910
- I see.
- What does your husband do?

139
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,700
Oh... He's a salary man.

140
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,250
That must be nice.

141
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,230
There's something better
over there. Let's go.

142
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,380
Is he your husband?

143
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,150
No.

144
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,590
Then, who is he?

145
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,450
- He's my youngest uncle.
- You're out with your uncle!

146
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,990
Hello. I'm Hae Jin's friend.

147
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,990
I... I see.

148
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,030
Why are you mad about that?

149
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,730
- I was joking.
- Joking?

150
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,320
You're being so petty about nothing!

151
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,250
Why are you back already?
Did you buy anything?

152
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,580
What's wrong with him?

153
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,250
What's wrong? Are you two fighting again?

154
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,910
- I think she's embarrassed of me.
- Embarrassed?

155
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,690
She saw her friend and introduced
me as her youngest uncle.

156
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,600
What?

157
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,680
What did I tell you?

158
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,070
What is this? So outdated!

159
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,850
A man in his 60s would wear this!

160
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,390
I don't know!

161
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,520
Still, how could she call me
her youngest uncle?

162
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,410
At least call me a cousin or something.

163
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,990
Be happy she didn't
call you her oldest uncle!

164
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,780
- At least she called you youngest.
- Mom!

165
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,360
Does it taste good?

166
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,380
What made you decide to talk to me?

167
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,510
Do you know the granddaughter
of Samon Group's Chairman Jo?

168
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,120
Of course I know her.
How could I not know her?

169
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,980
When we studied in America,
we hung out together.

170
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,970
She's not married yet, right?

171
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,240
I would've heard the news if she were.

172
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,620
Why is she not married yet?

173
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,200
How am I supposed to know that?

174
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,090
You know that my husband
used to date her, right?

175
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,000
They didn't just date.

176
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,480
They lived together when they
were studying in America.

177
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,970
They... lived together?

178
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,690
After they broke up, her family
tried to set up another marriage

179
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,730
but I heard she was resisting it because
she couldn't forget about Hyun Sung.

180
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,330
Why?

181
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,470
Nothing.

182
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,320
<i>You trusted my father of all people?</i>

183
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,410
<i>He will support and use
you when he needs you</i>

184
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,720
<i>until the situation changes and then
he will act as if he doesn't know you.</i>

185
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,120
So... Have you been thinking about it?

186
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,280
I understand what you said.

187
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,700
Good. I know you are quick to understand

188
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,600
so I have nothing to worry about.
I will just wait then.

189
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,250
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

190
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,270
Hyun Sung is eating dinner with the
board of directors, so he will be late.

191
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,770
Okay.

192
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,770
Father.

193
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,660
I have something to say.

194
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,780
What is it that you have to tell me?

195
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,380
It might displease you.

196
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,750
- Go ahead.
- Please do not lose your temper.

197
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,450
I'm saying this because
I think you should know.

198
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,540
So, go ahead.

199
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,350
I don't think...

200
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,940
you should keep Yoo Ji Na here.

201
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
Why?

202
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,150
Is it too difficult with Grandmother
watching over you?

203
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,320
If it were just me,
then I wouldn't say anything.

204
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,610
- Then?
- The way she interacts with Hyun Joon...

205
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,450
is unsettling.

206
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,340
That's a misunderstanding.

207
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,310
She has a lot more compassion
than you might think.

208
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,990
She's concerned about him
because he's wandering around.

209
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,240
That's how you are interpreting it?

210
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,590
I'm grateful for your concern

211
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,540
but your presumptuous concern
can do more harm than good.

212
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,150
Do you understand what I'm saying?

213
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,780
I don't think it's a good idea for
you to stay here any longer.

214
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,260
Okay. I understand. I'll leave.

215
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,210
I'll find you a place that you will like.

216
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,560
Why would I move into a place
Chairman Park finds for me?

217
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,320
Once I leave here, you have
no reason to see me anymore.

218
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,790
What are you saying?

219
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,890
I'm only staying here because
you said friends stay over here often.

220
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,440
Why would you find a place for me
when you and I are nothing?

221
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,450
Are you trying to find me a place,
so that you can come visit me?

222
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,900
Do you realize that you are
acting more cold towards me

223
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,190
ever since you met Hyun Joon?

224
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,360
You are cruel.

225
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,750
I get cruel at the most crucial moments.
That's my specialty.

226
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,480
What are you doing?

227
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,330
You said you don't get hurt.

228
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,480
You said it's not simply
because you want me!

229
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,430
Do you understand now?

230
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,140
How hard it is to love one person?

231
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,430
Acting like this after getting
your pride hurt by your family...

232
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:33,480
What? You won't deny me
no matter what happens?

233
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,810
You would be the first person to run away
after you find out everything about me!

234
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,640
I understand, so please stop.

235
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,180
This is why even if you say
you will give me the world,

236
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,480
I could never trust your love!

237
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,040
You think this is a problem of trust?

238
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,990
If you thought of me as more
than just a piece of tissue

239
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,380
how could you interact with him?

240
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,260
By the way, what happened
with the benefactor's issue?

241
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,030
By coincidence, I have the opportunity
to perform at their house.

242
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,260
Really?

243
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,610
Normally, I wouldn't perform

244
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,320
but I decided to go because I think
I'll be to find out about something.

245
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,060
But...

246
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,900
I met someone unexpected at the house.

247
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,380
Who?

248
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,580
I'll tell you later.

249
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,910
I'm going to go home now.

250
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,430
Okay.

251
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,850
I have something to say.

252
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,540
I'm going to stop coming here.

253
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,880
Your situation is different now

254
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,910
and you and Hae Soo
can take care of this place.

255
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,840
Are you uncomfortable with the new me?

256
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,420
To be honest... there is that too.

257
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,870
Why?

258
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,990
Before, only I could see you.
But now, you can see me too.

259
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,860
It's a little awkward.

260
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,660
Of all the things to be awkward about...

261
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,010
Kyung Soo.

262
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:01,580
You are now a young, talented pianist.

263
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,210
I'm...

264
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:10,760
an old nightclub singer who
can become worthless anytime.

265
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,240
Is that so?

266
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,250
You have to start playing piano more

267
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,400
and do things you haven't done yet.

268
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,720
- And?
- You have lots of places to visit.

269
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,440
- And?
- You have to meet a young, pretty girl

270
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,040
and fall in love.

271
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,900
And?

272
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,200
The point is, I shouldn't
stand in the way.

273
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,700
Don't you know that all those
things are meaningless without you?

274
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,660
You have to try them first before you
decide if they mean something or not.

275
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,030
Nope. I'm not going to try
anything without you.

276
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,980
- Kyung Soo.
- Other than the fact that I can see now

277
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,910
nothing has changed.

278
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,800
Things will change. Starting now.

279
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,960
You're a scaredy cat.

280
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,390
You will start to see me.

281
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,160
I already saw you.

282
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,620
It was an amazing experience.

283
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,100
- What was?
- I mean...

284
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,960
It was a comfortable experience.

285
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,230
I was able to talk to someone
who couldn't see me

286
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,040
and tell you the things
I only wanted to share...

287
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,910
as I looked at you.

288
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,010
Sounds like I was fooled this whole time.

289
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,840
- Do you think it's unfair?
- I do.

290
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,930
Then, come watch me sing tonight.

291
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:55,010
Come to the nightclub and see
what clothes I wear and how I dance.

292
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:00,280
See for yourself what I say
to the drunk men in front of me

293
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,590
to make money.

294
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,870
You're worried about that?

295
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,760
You probably can't even imagine it.

296
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,960
I'll come tonight.

297
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,260
I mean... Don't come.

298
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,390
What are you worried about?

299
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,340
Not a day has gone by
that I didn't think about you

300
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,840
after that day you took me outside.

301
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,530
My heart is so anxious to do all
the things I couldn't do for you before.

302
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,410
Why are you trying to run away from me?

303
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,650
From now on, I'll watch over you.

304
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,690
I'll pray for you.

305
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,580
Let me watch you live
a good life from a distance.

306
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,340
No.

307
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,760
I won't let that happen.

308
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,110
Because I won't be happy without you.

309
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,500
Get yourself together!

310
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,680
I didn't think I would see this.

311
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,020
I'm seeing a lot of things
I haven't seen before.

312
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,910
You were someone who used to measure
how much you drank to limit yourself.

313
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,450
Get out.

314
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,820
I don't want to see you right now.

315
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,480
Don't worry. I'll drink in
the corner as if I'm not here.

316
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,120
You've met your match.

317
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:10,730
She is the kind of woman
who will burn you to the ground.

318
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,310
Especially the men who like her.

319
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,180
Shut your mouth.

320
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,390
She's the type of woman that's best

321
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,690
to care for a little bit and then
let her go once you get sick of her.

322
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,910
Stop blabbering if you don't know
what you're talking about.

323
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,310
You know what singer
impersonators are, right?

324
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:34,490
- What?
- She told a woman who impersonates her

325
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,870
to give her her man in exchange for
making a living off of her songs.

326
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,390
What are you talking about?

327
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,930
That's the real Ji Na.

328
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,560
Even if she wraps
herself in luxury brands

329
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,630
and covers herself with strong perfume

330
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,920
she will always smell
rotten from her very core.

331
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:09,710
<i>Once you find out everything about me,
you won't be able to handle me.</i>

332
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,380
Are you going to end your
life because of a woman?

333
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,510
Why are you drinking so much?

334
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,870
Isn't that your wish?

335
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,550
Whether I die from drinking too much

336
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,260
or get hit by lightning on the street

337
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,110
you wish for me to end
my life in front of you.

338
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,670
You must feel very empty inside

339
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,390
to be making jokes
I've never heard before.

340
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,060
Let me ask you one favor.

341
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,300
You really are drunk.

342
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,350
Put her in your entertainment agency.

343
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,320
- What?
- Just do it.

344
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,820
How can you make such a fun deal

345
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,740
so nonchalantly while you're drunk?

346
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,260
Let's talk about it again
when you're sober.

347
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,000
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

348
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,480
<i>How hard it is to love one person?</i>

349
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,180
What are you doing here at this hour?

350
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,800
No matter what I do, I can't hate you.

351
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,830
No matter what I think...

352
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,770
I can't hate you.

353
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,350
So, do something.

354
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,240
Do something, please.

355
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,740
Get up.
Get up.

356
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,400
Do... do...

357
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,110
Hold on.

358
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,480
Do something...

359
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,990
- Are you crazy?
- Come outside.

360
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,390
How dare you come here wearing that?

361
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,650
Chairman Park passed out in the yard.

362
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,450
- Why are you telling me?
- Then who do I wake up at this hour?

363
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,230
Should I let him sleep outside?

364
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,760
I'm seeing all kinds of things today.

365
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,310
Wake up. Wake up!

366
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,540
Let me ask you one question.

367
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,080
Why do you hate me so much?

368
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,270
You're crazy to the core...

369
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,930
You shouldn't judge someone based
on what one person has told you.

370
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,600
Who is that one person
you are referring to?

371
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,220
Hae Dang?

372
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,550
What did Jung Hae Dang say about me?

373
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,950
What kind of person
do you think you are?

374
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,340
Or should I ask you this way?

375
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,640
You and Jung Hae Dang

376
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,330
can't be with the same agency.

377
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,880
Who should I sign a contract with?

378
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:34,090
Just like you said, no one is asking
Jung Hae Dang for a contract except me.

379
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,430
What should I do?

380
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,200
Why can't you answer?

381
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,320
You made it sound like you would
do anything to help Jung Hae Dang.

382
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,420
Why are you hesitating?

383
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:54,620
Is it because you feel sorry for Hae Dang
because of that man's death?

384
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,450
Do you understand now?
What kind of person you are?

385
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,010
You...

386
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,450
can't let go of anything
that's valuable to you.

387
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,060
Don't think and pretend to be nice

388
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,530
because you're giving out things
that mean nothing to you.

389
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,400
I never pretended to be nice.

390
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,900
Regardless of who seduced whom

391
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,930
if you really liked Jung Hae Dang

392
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,300
then you shouldn't have accepted
him under any circumstance!

393
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,800
Even if you mess with
every man in this world

394
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:33,400
you should never mess with the man of
someone who is living off of your songs!

395
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,140
You didn't just kill that man.

396
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,690
Jung Hae Dang

397
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,360
also died that day.

398
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,590
Because of your words.

399
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:53,800
This is not something that should
get you worked up like this.

400
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,650
Do you like Jung Hae Dang?

401
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,670
That's the kind of person you are.

402
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,350
For the sake of what you want to do...

403
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:10,110
you will throw away something
that should never be thrown away.

404
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,240
Then after a while

405
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,140
you will act as if you
are the nicest person

406
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,490
and feel sorry for yourself.

407
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,950
I said I never acted like a nice
person or felt sorry for myself.

408
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,700
Do you know what's more important?

409
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:32,360
When a similar moment comes again,
you will do the same thing.

410
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,920
- How are you so sure?
- Because that's who you are.

411
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,620
In the end

412
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,510
that's who you will be.

413
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,630
<i>Playing during the day. I left it behind.</i>

414
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:12,650
<i>The tree leaf boat.</i>

415
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:18,460
<i>By my mom's side. Lying beside her.</i>

416
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:24,050
<i>I remember her.</i>

417
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,810
<i>Oh, really?</i>

418
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,680
But... I feel like I've seen you before.

419
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,350
Your face looks familiar.

420
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,580
<i>That's the kind of person you are.</i>

421
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,540
<i>For the sake of what you want to do</i>

422
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,980
<i>you will throw away something
that should never be thrown away.</i>

423
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,450
<i>That's the kind of person you are.</i>

424
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,270
<i>In the end, that's who you will be.</i>

425
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,310
Wake up!

426
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,280
I never thought I would be
doing this in my lifetime.

427
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,250
My gosh! Just get on my back.

428
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,270
Why are you out here and not sleeping?

429
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,500
I heard something earlier and woke up.

430
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,960
What were you two
talking about for so long?

431
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,440
If you're curious, go to
Yoo Ji Na and ask her directly.

432
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,170
You two are close, no?

433
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,690
I made pollack soup because I think
you drank a lot last night. How is it?

434
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,700
It's refreshing.

435
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,010
Let Hyun Sung know that I will
be joining the afternoon meeting.

436
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,480
- Yes.
- I'm going to eat slowly, so you can go.

437
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,300
Father.

438
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,620
Last night

439
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,600
the two of them were
talking for a very long time.

440
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,340
All he needed to do
was carry you back inside.

441
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,050
- You were you watching the whole time?
- What?

442
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,710
What were you hoping and expecting to see

443
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,040
that you were watching the whole time?

444
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,130
Do I look easy to you?

445
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,050
- Of course not.
- From now on

446
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,230
don't mention her. You got it?

447
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,230
What are you doing?

448
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,950
I... I was giving her a warning.

449
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,820
If there's a warning that
needs to be told, tell me!

450
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:59,330
How dare you raise your
voice to your daughter-in-law?

451
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,180
Get out!

452
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,880
Yes.

453
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,510
You are a mess because of this one woman!

454
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:18,870
My goodness. My goodness.

455
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,250
Are you working diligently?

456
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,910
Hurry up. We don't have time.

457
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,250
Yes?

458
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,970
What brings you here?

459
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,140
I stopped by after shopping.

460
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,730
You probably didn't come
here to just say hi.

461
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:06,210
I came here to tell you
something quite disturbing.

462
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,910
- Really?
- I'd be so embarrassed if this got out.

463
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,170
Yoo Ji Na will only cause trouble
if she stays at the house.

464
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,760
What's going on?

465
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,790
Don't be shocked.

466
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:25,290
I think Yoo Ji Na has feelings for
Hyun Joon rather than for Father.

467
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,640
- Why should I worry about that?
- What?

468
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,740
You're not scared that something
might happen between them?

469
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,190
Hyun Joon sees her as an insect.

470
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,560
What would ever happen
between the two of them?

471
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,900
The person who's going to
cause trouble is not her but you.

472
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,310
What were you thinking bringing her in?

473
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:51,330
I heard you encouraged
Father to bring her in.

474
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,900
Did you hear that from Grandmother?

475
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,460
And you dare to try to pull me in?

476
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,140
Should I tell Father what you
told me here today or not?

477
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,070
You can't. You definitely can't.

478
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,730
For someone who can
only measure up to this much...

479
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,260
How is Hae Dang doing?

480
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,420
I haven't seen her in so long.

481
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,150
She's been sick.

482
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,370
Is it bad?

483
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,700
Don't worry about it.
She will get better.

484
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,850
To be honest, something happened at home.

485
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:57,160
Hae Sung quit her job at school,
and I think the news shocked her.

486
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:03,060
Hae Dang was really proud of
Hae Sung being a high school teacher.

487
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,140
I see...

488
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,110
In the end, our sister,
who is like our rock, got sick.

489
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:46,070
<i>The number you are
trying to reach is unavailable.</i>

490
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,810
Goodbye! Please come back soon!

491
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,300
Hello... Oh!

492
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,470
Welcome, welcome!

493
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,490
- Hello!
- Hi! Of course.

494
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,610
Have you been well?

495
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,480
Is Hae Dang really sick?

496
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,180
The club said that she won't be
coming out for several days.

497
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,390
She's just sick.

498
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,890
- I stopped by because I was worried.
- You were worried?

499
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,640
Good thing you came.

500
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,410
- Are you busy?
- No.

501
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,590
Then, do you want to eat dinner with me?

502
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,840
Sure, it will be my treat!
What would you like to eat?

503
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,610
I mean... Let's go eat at my house.

504
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,470
But if I go last minute, it will be rude.

505
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,330
Of course not!

506
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,510
I feel terrible for sending
you home like that last time.

507
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,130
Okay? Just wait a little longer.
I'm almost done.

508
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,570
Okay.

509
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,630
Who's coming that he
wants us to set up dinner?

510
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,210
- Can you taste this?
- Add a little more soy sauce.

511
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,920
You can tell by just looking?

512
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,560
You're a pro.

513
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,750
We don't have time. Hurry up.

514
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,940
We have to hurry or else
nothing is going to be finished.

515
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,010
Our house is overflowing with women.
What are you so worried about?

516
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,350
If all the women in this house teamed up

517
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,010
we would be able to catch a cow.

518
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,730
You're right.

519
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,540
Check to see if the water kimchi
has ripened and the soup is good.

520
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,100
Yes. I'll check.

521
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,770
Wow.

522
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,480
It's not even a holiday,
what is all this for?

523
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,580
Your father said a guest is
coming that will make history.

524
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,490
- Dad's guest?
- Sick person, get out.

525
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,490
We're super busy.

526
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,290
Who is Dad's guest?

527
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,670
Why did you buy so much?

528
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,900
I came over last time unexpectedly,
so I came empty-handed.

529
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,630
Who cares if you come empty-handed?

530
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,710
Seeing you with all this stuff feels like

531
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:14,230
you're coming here to introduce
yourself to your fiance's family.

532
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,440
I hope I'm not causing trouble,
especially since Hae Dang is sick.

533
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,480
No, no. I insist that you're my guest.

534
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,420
- Okay. Will do.
- Let's go in.

535
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,730
- Is it heavy?
- This? No, it's okay.

536
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,610
You're an astronaut!

537
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,040
Everyone, come out! Our guest is here!

538
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,630
Welcome!

539
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,960
Nice to meet you.

540
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,550
Oh! He's a young gentleman! Who are you?

541
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,570
Hello!

542
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:49,860
- You know him?
- Hello. You came back.

543
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,770
Today, he is here as
Hae Dang's official guest!

544
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,440
Your first daughter?

545
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,690
My name is Park Hyun Joon.

546
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,610
- You came again?
- I came to check up on you.

547
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,900
Who comes to visit a person with a cold?

548
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,680
I wish you a fast recovery.

549
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,610
It's not like I'm dying.

550
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,810
Why did you buy so much stuff?

551
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,010
Have a seat. Have a seat.

552
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,760
Here. Here.

553
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,710
Why did you prepare so much?
This was last minute.

554
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:39,230
We prepared what we normally prepare.

555
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:42,680
We just added another place setting.

556
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,230
There's a saying when families who don't
have much give everything they have.

557
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,730
We just pulled out
everything we own and...

558
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:56,460
Whatever family you are from,
you are very handsome.

559
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,680
- Thank you.
- Cute too.

560
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,320
How old are you?

561
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,190
- 37.
- What?

562
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,370
Bong Soo, how old are you this year?

563
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:11,650
You are a little bit older.

564
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:16,700
Really? People might think
that you're older than him!

565
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,950
Father-in-law, I am very sensitive
to that topic these days.

566
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,190
Are you really younger than me?

567
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:27,920
Yes. It's because I worked
so hard when I was younger.

568
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,810
Please be kind.

569
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:36,060
Anyway, I never thought I would see
the oldest daughter bring her boyfriend.

570
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,030
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Then is he your girlfriend?

571
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,900
We're not friends.

572
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,010
- Then, you two are lovers!
- No!

573
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,400
We should ask him if it's true or not!

574
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,890
What is your relationship with Hae Dang?

575
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,370
It's hard to say because
I'm scared to tell you the truth.

576
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,340
The truth? You have to tell us the truth.

577
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,000
This is the moment to tell the truth.

578
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,180
I hope that he becomes
our sister's husband!

579
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,340
So... that I can show off to my friends.

580
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,420
Hae Soo, say that while
you're thinking about me.

581
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,520
Be quiet! We have to
hear what he has to say.

582
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,800
What's your relationship?

583
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,810
We're just looking at each other.

584
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,720
We've only been looking
at each other so far.

585
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,330
That's an old-fashioned way to say it.

586
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,870
When we were younger and
someone asked what they were

587
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,480
they said, "We're looking at each other."

588
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,000
Let's eat!

589
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,210
Okay, okay! Father,
go ahead and start drinking.

590
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,720
I'll pour.

591
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,180
Really? Good. Good.

592
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,910
Goodness.

593
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:01,870
Everything feels like it's going
according to the way it should.

594
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:06,940
Yeah! Say no more and just call
each other Father and Son-in-law!

595
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,550
Mrs. Baek!

596
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,670
Everyone, cheers!

597
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,410
You might be our
brother-in-law, so cheers!

598
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:17,420
- Me too, me too! Cheers!
- I might have a brother-in-law too!

599
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,300
- You guys are getting more excited!
- Me too. Cheers!

600
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,530
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

601
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,740
- Thank you. Congrats!
- What do you mean congrats?

602
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:44,960
Why did you come in here? You should
just talk with the others more.

603
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,960
Your family members are the ones
who pushed me in here to talk to you.

604
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,470
So you just came in?

605
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,510
What was I supposed to do?

606
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,790
Here we are again, Yoo Ji Na.

607
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,270
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

608
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,290
Don't worry.

609
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,950
Sit down.

610
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:14,110
Why would you just listen to my
sisters call you Brother-in-law?

611
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,780
You wanted me to just ruin the mood?
That would have been weirder.

612
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,640
Why did you come visit me when
I just have a cold? I'm so embarrassed!

613
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,310
It's not embarrassing.

614
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,470
Are you feeling better?

615
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:29,250
- As you can see.
- You need to eat well.

616
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,930
How could I eat better?

617
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:34,030
That's true...

618
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,770
I told you not to push!

619
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,470
What are you guys doing?
Were you guys eavesdropping?

620
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,220
I mean...

621
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,160
Let's sit close.

622
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,130
Don't worry about us. Keep talking.

623
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:56,750
Just pretend we're not here and continue.

624
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,900
You three... Get out. Get out!

625
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,510
- Why?
- Why would you do that?

626
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,740
I don't have younger sisters,
so I kind of like this.

627
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,280
Right? We'll be even better
about being extra cute to you.

628
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,170
Did you get in another fight
after that day?

629
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,920
Why do you want to talk about that again?

630
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,670
I was seriously so surprised that day.

631
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,140
Stop it!

632
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,980
Even when we were kids,
it was just us girls.

633
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,050
When we got in a fight with
the boys in our neighborhood

634
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,640
our Hae Sung was the one
who taught them a lesson.

635
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,150
No wonder... You had a lot of practice.

636
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,860
- You were the best.
- Yeah.

637
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,590
He seems like such a good person.

638
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,150
What does his family do?

639
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:49,350
You think our family
can be picky about that?

640
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,410
If his family were to ask me what I do

641
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,970
I would have to say,
"Oh, I work at the gas station."

642
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,560
You're right.

643
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,480
I think his dad sells
clothes at the market.

644
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,710
His family income is
probably not that great.

645
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,280
Who cares about that?

646
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,160
It's better to get married to people
who have a similar background.

647
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,650
Are they really dating?

648
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,590
I... don't think so.

649
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,630
- No?
- No.

650
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,300
Then why did you set up this dinner?

651
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:24,720
I went above and beyond because
I want to make him my son-in-law.

652
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,000
But from what I observed, it doesn't
look like they dislike each other.

653
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,330
- Right?
- So, what is their relationship exactly?

654
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,810
That's...

655
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,020
- what I don't know.
- What?

656
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:45,040
Before I die, I'm going to make
it my duty to get them together.

657
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,910
I'm going to get them together
even if I have to make a fool of myself.

658
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,990
Just don't get in the way.
You'll ruin everything.

659
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,820
Hey!

660
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,580
- Yes?
- She's right.

661
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,830
You should stay quiet. That will
be your way of helping them.

662
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,270
Are you done talking?

663
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:09,150
What? What I meant was...

664
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:13,220
For someone who aged
so fast for his actual age...

665
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,590
Why are you insulting my son's looks?

666
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,360
One time, the grandma who lives in
the house with the blue door over there

667
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:25,400
looked at him and said, "Eh! Is your
son-in-law from Saudi Arabia?"

668
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:31,260
Is she daft or something?
How dare she say that about my son?

669
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,350
Saudi Arabia...

670
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,890
- Hey!
- That hurt!

671
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,090
Don't mess with me... Here!

672
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,410
Grandmother, happy birthday.

673
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,230
Thank you.

674
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,310
Ma'am, you look extra glamorous today.

675
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,370
Thank you.

676
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,450
I don't know if it's because of age

677
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:58,840
but I decided to have a simple,
quiet party at the house.

678
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,400
I hope people won't tease me about it.

679
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,150
Of course not.

680
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,820
Yoon Hee, introduce yourself.

681
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,370
She is going to be our
oldest daughter-in-law.

682
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:13,460
I saw her at a party one time.

683
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,550
Thank you for remembering me.

684
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:19,580
It feels like this entire party is
brightening up because of your beauty.

685
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,960
- Right?
- Yes.

686
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,050
Grandmother, you should
also introduce Na Kyung.

687
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,780
Oh my goodness! Who is this?

688
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,040
- You're Yoo Jin, right?
- Happy birthday, Grandmother.

689
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,580
How many years has it been?

690
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,410
Yoon Hee, introduce yourself.

691
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,760
This is the granddaughter
of Samon Group's Chairman Jo's.

692
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,270
We met often in America.
Long time no see.

693
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,080
- Yes.
- Where is Hyun Sung?

694
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:54,380
He is conversing with
the guests over there.

695
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,830
- Tell him to come over.
- Yes.

696
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,850
Ah! Yoo Jin, say hello.
This is Go Na Kyung...

697
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:05,700
No need to say hello.
Tell Hyun Sung to come here

698
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,580
and see if there are any dishes
that need to be refilled.

699
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,400
Yes.

700
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:21,630
Isn't that singer Yoo Ji Na?

701
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,190
Don't worry about that. Have some food!

702
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:26,930
Okay.

703
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,430
I'm honored to meet you here.

704
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,120
I am as well.

705
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,950
You look more beautiful in person.

706
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,410
Thank you.

707
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,210
You are great together.

708
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:45,250
Chairman Park, you look 10 years
younger standing next to her.

709
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,250
Not at all.

710
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,560
Thank you for taking the time
out of your busy schedule to come.

711
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,090
According to the rumors, Park Hyun Joon

712
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,940
will be joining the company as well.

713
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,440
- My father is still inspecting.
- Is that so?

714
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,090
- Grandmother is looking for you.
- Really?

715
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:13,500
Chairman Jo's granddaughter is here.

716
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,840
What are you doing here alone?

717
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,950
He's so happy, he's dying.

718
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,460
How can he be so shameless?

719
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,540
He's introducing her
to everyone like she's his wife.

720
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,240
Yoo Ji Na?

721
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,580
Let's go.

722
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:14,960
I think Chairman Park
is going to marry her.

723
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,930
They're already living in the same house.

724
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,860
Already?

725
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,580
It would look bad if
they have a wedding now

726
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,580
since it's only been
a year since his wife died.

727
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,170
They're living together, I see...

728
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,480
We meet again.

729
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,780
Who... are you?

730
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,060
I saw you at the cafe when
I went to see Hae Dang

731
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:00,140
and I met you in front
of the house on the yard.

732
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,840
- Do you remember my voice?
- Ah.

733
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,470
Hello.

734
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,200
You're really great at playing piano.

735
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,850
Thank you.

736
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:13,080
Who suggested you learn
how to play the piano?

737
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:17,420
My mother.

738
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:20,240
I see.

739
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,700
Your mother made a good decision for you.

740
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,270
Thank you.

741
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,800
If you don't mind me asking

742
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,020
what is your name?

743
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,900
Yoon Sung Ha.

744
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,870
Yoon Sung Ha...

745
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,440
Your name...

746
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,310
has a nice ring to it.

747
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,490
Thank you.

748
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,470
My name is Yoo Ji Na.

749
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,510
Do you know the singer Yoo Ji Na?

750
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,810
Can you give me your phone number?

751
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:03,520
A lot of artists need a pianist for
recordings. I'll introduce you to them.

752
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,700
No. I don't need that.

753
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,270
Ah... Is that so?

754
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,400
I have to get back to playing.

755
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,420
Sorry.

756
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,430
You're really going to bring
Hyun Joon to the planning office?

757
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:19,180
Don't worry about that.
Just focus on your own work.

758
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,380
The entire company knows!

759
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,850
It probably came from Yoon Hee's side.

760
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,400
To bring him into the company.

761
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,190
You think she didn't tell her family?

762
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:35,560
If that's what it takes to get
them married, then I have to do it.

763
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,180
Then what about me?

764
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:41,410
Every single one of you...

765
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:44,340
Is that all the pride you have as a man?

766
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,570
If it were me, I wouldn't even say
that for the sake of my pride.

767
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:52,970
What are you doing?
This conversation is over, so go.

768
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,520
Hyun Sung and that family's granddaughter

769
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,380
really loved each other
more than you might think.

770
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,070
I heard from Yoon Hee.

771
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:14,450
I worked off a sweat separating them

772
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,780
and sending him to marry you.

773
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,770
I am grateful for what you did.

774
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:23,220
Is that how you show your gratitude?

775
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,440
I'm sorry.

776
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,070
All I need is for you
to get out of this house.

777
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,900
Then everything will get better.

778
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,680
I can see one more granddaughter-in-law

779
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,060
and Hyun Sung can have kids
with the woman he loves.

780
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:41,940
I will do whatever it takes
to get Yoo Ji Na to move out.

781
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,580
Please give me more time!

782
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,560
You disgusting wench...

783
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,880
How dare you try to outsmart me?

784
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,240
It was also your idea

785
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,600
for him to put Hyun Sung in charge of
the company and have him retire, right?

786
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,860
No?

787
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,010
I asked you a question!

788
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,350
I committed a grave sin, Grandmother.

789
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:15,590
You... You... you lowlife!
You disgusting piece of trash!

790
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,670
What am I to do with you...

791
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:46,990
I called the secretary and was told
you didn't have any official meetings.

792
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:50,550
- Why were you late?
- I met up with a friend and had drinks.

793
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:52,930
What friend?

794
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,780
It wasn't Chairman Jo's
granddaughter, was it?

795
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,360
You are just...

796
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,060
Why can't you say no?

797
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,160
If I say no, are you going to believe me?

798
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,190
People at the company are
already treating me differently.

799
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,820
What are you talking about?

800
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:13,140
- People are whispering everywhere I go.
- About what?

801
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,560
Probably saying how it serves me
right after ignoring my brother

802
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,990
and devoting myself to Father.

803
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:21,270
Father seriously...

804
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,280
How can he make me
the laughing stock of the company?

805
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,150
- Honey.
- Don't talk.

806
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:30,810
If I completely ruin the relationship
between Hyun Joon and Father

807
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:35,020
will you protect me?

808
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:38,360
- What?
- There are two sons.

809
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,580
It's one or two. What more is there?

810
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,820
- What are you talking about?
- Promise me.

811
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:48,900
Promise me that you will protect me
no matter what happens.

812
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:14,160
Hyun Joon, I have something to say.

813
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,510
- To me?
- It's very important.

814
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,720
What are you saying?

815
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,000
Your father was with your mother
when she committed suicide.

816
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,830
That's what I mean...
What are you saying?

817
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:39,700
You know that your mother
jumped off a cliff, right?

818
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:46,920
Father was with her
when she was up on that cliff.

819
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,770
Hyun Joon.

820
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,850
You didn't know because
you were in the States.

821
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,230
No way...

822
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:00,650
If you say that you heard it from me

823
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,720
I can't tell you the next
part of the story.

824
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,310
What's the next part of the story?

825
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:13,260
I will tell you another time after
I see that you have kept your promise.

826
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:16,750
- What?
- I have to survive too.

827
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,780
What are you doing?
You didn't even knock.

828
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,000
You were with Mother
when she fell off the cliff.

829
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:56,210
Is that really true?

830
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,450
Yes. I was with her.

831
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:00,520
Excuse me, Chairman Park!

832
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,460
What are you imagining right now?

833
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:07,640
- How could you do that?
- How could I do what?

834
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,150
In the note, it is clearly written
that she committed suicide.

835
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:13,150
That is your mother's handwriting.

836
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:17,070
You think the police are more foolish
than you and concluded it was a suicide?

837
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:20,100
- The police?
- Get out. I have to work.

838
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,840
You think that makes sense right now?

839
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,790
Who would commit suicide
when they weren't alone?

840
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:27,690
Does that make sense to you?

841
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:31,210
How dare you? As my son...

842
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:36,130
It is true that I didn't love your mother

843
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,150
but we raised children together.

844
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:41,670
What are you imagining inside your head?

845
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:47,140
You are capable of doing anything
if you really want to.

846
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:50,240
- What?
- Chairman Park.

847
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:54,730
From this moment on

848
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:56,610
you are no longer my father.

849
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:01,450
Did you ever think of me as your father?

850
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:06,170
You!

851
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,400
Are not my father anymore!

852
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:15,960
You think I'm scared?

853
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:29,330
