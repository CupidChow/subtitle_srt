00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,554
(Episode 35)

2
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:17,143
Good work, grandmother.

3
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:18,734
You.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,719
Listen to me carefully.

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,723
I can deal with you acting up at home.

6
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:35,696
However, I cannot allow you to act
disrespectful in public. Do you understand?

7
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:40,562
Take it easy and back off. The
lady of this household is me now.

8
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,835
It hasn't been long since
you came into this family!

9
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:47,081
That doesn't matter. I'm Mr.
Park Sung-hwan's legal wife.

10
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,062
Then go ahead and act as
his wife at the court.

11
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,475
Don't you dare act up in front of me.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,351
In my heart, you were never
a daughter-in-law to me!

13
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:05,022
No matter how much you insist, the
lady of this household is me now.

14
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,234
If you want to be treated as the lady
of the household, then act like one.

15
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:10,804
Not you, too.

16
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:13,733
Do you think this family is a joke?

17
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,965
Practically everyone knows
this family is a mess.

18
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:20,561
- And whose fault is that?
- What?

19
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,053
This family might have been
brutal, but before you

20
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:25,257
came into this family, we
weren't considered a mess.

21
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,085
If you're grateful I still accepted
you after making our family into a

22
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,852
mess, then you should at least keep
your dignity in front of others.

23
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,658
- Do you understand?
- Honey.

24
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:36,533
I'm the one who allowed this marriage!

25
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:41,611
How dare you disrespect me and my
mother in front of our future in-laws?

26
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,986
Then please rest, father.

27
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:16,330
I'm too scared to live with you.

28
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:19,853
What? You're too scared to live with me?

29
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:23,369
You're eighteen years older
than me, and you yell at me.

30
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,463
So I'm too scared to live with you.

31
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:29,752
Stop uttering nonsense and go change.

32
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:34,389
If you say that this family became
a mess because of me in front

33
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:37,588
of Na-kyung and Hyun-sung, how
will I be able to face them now?

34
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,916
- Is that the only thing you're embarrassed to them about?
- What?

35
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:47,718
You've shamelessly ignored far more
embarrassing things than this.

36
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:53,338
- It's not like you to act like a baby.
- It's not like me to act like a baby?

37
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:00,580
You really don't find me
attractive as a woman anymore.

38
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:14,518
(Im Cheol-woo)

39
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:34,197
Tomorrow is Sunday, so I'm going to go
take photos. Do you want to come with me?

40
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,971
If you come with me, I'll take
many beautiful photos of you.

41
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:55,953
It's Sunday, so all of my family
will be home. How could I leave?

42
00:03:58,073 --> 00:03:59,073
I can't.

43
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:07,517
What are you doing here?

44
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:13,822
- What about you?
- Is there a problem?

45
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,580
Of course not.

46
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:19,676
- By the way, can you do a favor for me?
- A favor?

47
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,545
I want to go see my family
tomorrow, but grandmother

48
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:26,212
doesn't like it when I go see them often.

49
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:29,802
Can you pretend to go shopping
with me, spend time somewhere

50
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:32,627
else, and meet up with me
later to come home together?

51
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:34,838
Me?

52
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:37,221
That's a big favor, isn't it?

53
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:40,729
Well...

54
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:46,425
It's not like you want to go anywhere else.
You want go see your family.

55
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,471
As a woman, I can't ignore that.

56
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,682
Will you really do this for me?

57
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:54,463
Sure.

58
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:24,025
Beautiful. Smile a little bit more.

59
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:31,034
Smile more.

60
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:39,736
The view is nice, and so is the model.

61
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,095
We planned to meet here and go home.

62
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,879
I'll call you again if I
have time in the week.

63
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:06,518
You can't.

64
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:08,978
You want me to go a week
without seeing you?

65
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:12,171
Why are you whining when
you're not a child?

66
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,986
I don't want to say bye.

67
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:23,221
- What if Na-kyung sees you? Hurry up and get in your car.
- All right.

68
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,119
I'll text you tonight.

69
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:17,455
What did you do the whole day?

70
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:22,791
I met up with a friend
to shop and eat dinner.

71
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,721
Do you even have friends?

72
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:31,080
I just feel like you
won't have any friends.

73
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,947
- Why?
- People who have a lot of secrets usually don't have friends.

74
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,140
I did you a favor, but
you're done using me now?

75
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:47,075
No. What I mean is that
celebrities hide a lot

76
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,827
of things by habit. That's why I said that.

77
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,303
Not all celebrities are like that.

78
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:56,936
Did you get another massage?
You put on perfume.

79
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:00,874
Just focus on your driving.

80
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:20,231
- Honey, help me with something.
- Help you with that?

81
00:08:30,497 --> 00:08:33,049
My friend will be coming
over tomorrow night.

82
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:35,465
- Friend?
- What friend?

83
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,340
He's a lawyer.

84
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:41,153
Sure. Bring him. Do you want us to
prepare something special for him?

85
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,246
No. You don't have to be
especially concerned.

86
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:55,096
What would our neighbors say if
in-laws got married to each other?

87
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:59,760
- I have a great idea! They can move.
- Move?

88
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:03,526
They can move and live as if they were
married couple from the beginning.

89
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,393
Who would know if they were in-laws before?

90
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:11,557
- Still, how can they move away from home?
- Then what do we call them?

91
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:16,018
Do I have to call Mr. Jung... "father?"

92
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,776
Do I have to call you "big sister?"

93
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,791
This is too complicated. I can't do it.

94
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:26,609
It usually becomes complicated when you
become in-laws with the same person twice.

95
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,693
That's kind of what will happen now.

96
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:33,479
- Big sis.
- I'm the big sis here...

97
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:36,002
Then big, big sis.

98
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,752
Just call me big sister.

99
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,394
- Big sister...
- Yes, little sister?

100
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,447
This is awfully strange.

101
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:51,518
The strangest thing is that I have
to call Bong-soo "big brother."

102
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:53,940
That's really funny!

103
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:59,291
Big brother! Why isn't big brother
coming home from work yet?

104
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:04,565
Gosh, you guys! Now isn't
the time for joking!

105
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,369
Rumors are spreading all
throughout the neighborhood.

106
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:12,408
It might be better to just
declare they're getting married.

107
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:14,359
If you leave those rumors
alone, they have a

108
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:16,205
characteristic of getting more scandalous.

109
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:21,369
People really have nothing to do. Why are
they so interested in other people's lives?

110
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:25,721
They need a scapegoat because they
can't deal with their stressful lives.

111
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:27,776
Father-oh!

112
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:30,907
- Hi.
- You're here? Hi.

113
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,299
Big brother, are you
coming home from work now?

114
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,690
Big...

115
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,393
Hae-sung, are you sick?

116
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:41,604
- I was just practicing.
- Practicing for what?

117
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:46,215
- If my father and Mrs. Baek get married...
- Don't be ridiculous!

118
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,777
Why did you come down here
without even changing?

119
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,283
Oh. Where's your father?

120
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:54,002
- He didn't come home yet.
- What?

121
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,127
What's this?

122
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:04,761
I'm going to make my father-in-law
go on a blind date.

123
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:07,010
A blind date? What blind date?

124
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:11,465
We have to get Hae-dang married, so why
would he suddenly go on a blind date?

125
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,643
This is more urgent to me.

126
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:16,385
How do you know her?

127
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,799
- She's the cleaning lady at my company.
- What?

128
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:24,559
She became single at an early age.
She educated

129
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,671
all her children and sent
them off to marriage.

130
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:31,752
After that, she diligently gathered money.
She's a woman full of substance!

131
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,652
Really?

132
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:36,460
When my co-workers had
their cards blocked at the

133
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:39,541
end of the month, they would get a
daily installment loan from her.

134
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,840
A daily installment loan? That
doesn't sound refreshing.

135
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:47,377
Try to find anything refreshing
on my father-in-law's face.

136
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,440
Let me see the photo.

137
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:55,619
She looks just like a woman who
gives out daily installment loans.

138
00:11:56,221 --> 00:12:01,311
Oh, come on. She does not. She
looks smart and determined.

139
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:05,161
Long time ago, if you had eyes with ends
that pointed upwards, you were seen as a

140
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:08,970
woman who would kill your husband, so most
good families wouldn't have accepted her.

141
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:12,222
Oddly enough, I can't warm up to her.

142
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:16,783
Why does that matter? Your
father just has to like her.

143
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,565
- My dad is home.
- Really?

144
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:23,596
Yes!

145
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:33,049
Father, take a look at this photo.

146
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:38,049
- What's this?
- Take a look at it first.

147
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,596
I saw it.

148
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,422
What do you think? The
corners of her eyes are

149
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,925
slightly up. She's a
typical beauty, isn't she?

150
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,963
What does her being a
beauty have to do with me?

151
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:54,916
Would you like to meet her?

152
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,861
Oh, come on. She's not my style.

153
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:02,923
Gosh! How can you know
that just through a photo?

154
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:07,752
It will be different if you meet her.
She has a tender voice.

155
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:11,300
The best quality about
a woman is her voice!

156
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,346
Are you telling me to go on a blind date?

157
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:18,688
Not exactly. I just want you
to have a cup of tea with her.

158
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:21,119
That's embarrassing.

159
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:24,231
I don't want to. I'm not interested.

160
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,346
Then don't think of it as a blind date.

161
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:33,486
Think of it as getting a cup of tea with
a new neighbor. Don't feel burdened.

162
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:38,541
Why would I drink tea with a new neighbor?
That's even stranger.

163
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:43,143
Oh, come on. Are you going to be so picky?
Just have a cup of tea with her.

164
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:48,941
She looks too strong.

165
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:55,971
She must be strong! Women must be strong!

166
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:00,049
That way, even if her husband is
incapable, you guys won't starve!

167
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:05,596
My dream is to marry the strongest woman
in the world when I am born again.

168
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,393
Get out. I'm tired.

169
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:11,916
Well, I already promised you
would see her on Friday.

170
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:16,042
- Who said you could do that?
- If you don't go out, I'll be making a huge mistake!

171
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:17,322
How dare you!

172
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,447
- Welcome, Cheol!
- Welcome.

173
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:30,002
Welcome. I heard you're Hyun-sung's friend.

174
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,096
I met him recently through Na-kyung.

175
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,322
Oh, really?

176
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:36,666
He's been friends with her since college.

177
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:40,033
- I'm Im Cheol-woo.
- I'm Park Sung-hwan.

178
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:48,635
Why are you acting like you
don't know him, mother?

179
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,877
- Welcome.
- Have you been well?

180
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:57,846
What's this? You've met before?

181
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,440
The three of us had lunch
together last time.

182
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,527
Say hello. She's my grandmother-in-law.

183
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:05,940
It's nice to meet you. I'm Im Cheol-woo.

184
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:11,713
Welcome. You have a great smile.
You're very manly.

185
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,537
You guys should have
dinner among yourselves.

186
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,786
It's no fun for an elder to get in the way.

187
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,127
- Bring my dinner to my room.
- Okay.

188
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,299
I don't have any serious legal issues.

189
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:29,040
I just needed a personal
lawyer, and Na-kyung

190
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:31,449
said it would be better
to hire someone we knew.

191
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,705
We met for work, but we got along,
so we decided to be friends.

192
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:40,026
That's good. A man's wealth is his friends.

193
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,463
- Please eat.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:58,690
Is this the first time you see a celebrity?
Why do you keep staring at her?

195
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:03,916
It's not their first time.
They even ate together.

196
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:07,500
I just thought he was staring
at her out of amazement.

197
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:15,392
Cheol's hobby is taking photos.
He has amazing skills.

198
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,666
Kyung-soo, it must be stuffy to stay home
all day. Do you want to learn photography?

199
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:22,182
Photography?

200
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:27,785
Yes. If you want to take photos, you'll
have to go to places with good scenery.

201
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:31,042
Try learning it. I think
it will be a good hobby.

202
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,885
- I'll think about it.
- Why would you even think about it?

203
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:38,658
There's no point in learning such a thing.

204
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:41,517
Honey, that's rude in front of our guest.

205
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:48,306
I'm sorry. She's a bit sensitive
when it comes to her child.

206
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:52,025
- It's fine.
- Eat up.

207
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,689
Na-kyung, come see me.

208
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:19,087
You should've discussed with me
before you invited Cheol-woo here.

209
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,056
Why do I need to discuss with you
about Hyun-sung's friend coming over?

210
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:24,840
Because I know him, too.

211
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:27,023
All you guys had was lunch together.
Is there

212
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,447
something about him that
makes you uncomfortable?

213
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,049
I thought you'd be happy to see him.

214
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:43,603
Father, you should go golfing with
him one time. He's great at it.

215
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,010
Oh, really? How well do you play?

216
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,471
It's different from time to time, but
I usually range in the mid-seventies.

217
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:52,033
Then you're a single golfer.

218
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,236
His long drive is amazing.

219
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,556
Then you should teach golf to
Kyung-soo instead of photography.

220
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:03,814
I was thinking about getting
a pro to teach him anyways.

221
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,369
What would he do with golfing?

222
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:11,455
Don't you know we have a golfing outerwear?
Of course he should learn how to play.

223
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:18,197
That's great. You guys can play golf
together and tell him about the world.

224
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:21,681
You're a lawyer, so you should have
enough experiences with society.

225
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:27,681
I should bring more wine.
Which one should I bring?

226
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,423
- Do you like wine?
- Yes.

227
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:33,971
Then go and pick out a
good wine at the bar.

228
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:37,853
- Can I?
- Of course.

229
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:40,713
- It's that way.
- Okay.

230
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,939
- He's great, isn't he?
- He's a well-rounded person.

231
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,846
He was very popular among the
girls during our college days.

232
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:58,244
I could tell. He has a very charming smile.

233
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,369
We should change the wine glasses.

234
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,507
I'll bring them.

235
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:08,806
Could you? You just have to bring them.
They're out already.

236
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:28,969
How could you come here?

237
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:31,916
Na-kyung's husband invited me.

238
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,705
Thanks to him, we get to
see each other again.

239
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,330
Just go. Don't stay for too long.

240
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,205
W-What are you doing?

241
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:54,142
We saw each other, so I should
at least hold you once.

242
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:55,955
Move.

243
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,478
Knowing that your husband is in the
living room, my body gets hotter.

244
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Are you crazy?

245
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,939
My husband wanted to drink beer.

246
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,806
Did you two do something?

247
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,900
What would we do? What are
you asking right now?

248
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,135
Make it a bit more obvious.

249
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:45,670
If you want to golf well, it's
better to play short games

250
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:48,088
in green surroundings rather
than focus on the long drives.

251
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,135
If we have a chance in the future,
I'll show you how to approach them.

252
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:58,931
Thank you. The cold taste of golf is
actually putting and approaching.

253
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,744
Wow. This cheese is delicious. Try it.

254
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:12,588
What are you doing? Our guest
is offering it to you.

255
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,385
Oh, I used to be a big fan of her.

256
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:34,846
Oh, you were?

257
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:37,985
You know, it's like that feeling
when you meet celebrities on the

258
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:41,248
streets and it seems like you
know them so you have to say hi.

259
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,353
I feel like I have to take
care of her like I know her.

260
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,119
That's understandable. You
have a good personality.

261
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:55,228
Na-kyung, I need something.

262
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:57,455
Oh, you do?

263
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:02,580
- Here.
- Okay.

264
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,425
This wine is great.

265
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:21,721
- What's going on with those two?
- What do you mean?

266
00:22:21,877 --> 00:22:27,424
This is definitely a joke you'd play. You
even made Hyun-sung participate in it.

267
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:30,119
What are you talking about?

268
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,947
Are you trying to fool me right now?

269
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,494
There's no reason for me to fool you.

270
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:46,252
Oh, so you're saying you're the only
who who should know her weakness?

271
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:50,799
I have no idea what you're saying.

272
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:03,291
Seeing that Hyun-sung invited you home,

273
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:07,955
it seems like he wants to be
friends with you for a long time.

274
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,267
- Come over often.
- Thank you.

275
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,666
It seems like you're about to get
closer to him than Hyun-sung is.

276
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:20,517
It'd be great if all of us got along.

277
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:25,165
I know someone who had an
affair with his friend's wife.

278
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:28,658
The funny thing is, he's
close with the friend, too.

279
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:32,947
The three of them drank together and
even invited him to their house.

280
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,853
The friend became the fool.

281
00:23:37,197 --> 00:23:40,306
How could you say such a dirty
thing in front of our guest?

282
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:42,392
I'll be getting up first.

283
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,603
- See you next time.
- Sure.

284
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,994
- I'll be going, too.
- See you next time.

285
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:56,659
Sure.

286
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:05,056
- I'll be going home now.
- Are you sure?

287
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,056
Thanks for coming to my house.

288
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,563
My father-in-law seems to like you, too.

289
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:19,838
You have a refreshing personality,
so I think we'll get along, too.

290
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:39,128
- Why did you ask to see me?
- What relationship do you have with that man?

291
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:42,487
What do you mean?

292
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:49,183
- We just had lunch once with Na-kyung.
- Are you sure?

293
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:51,292
Of course I am.

294
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:57,862
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Because I can't believe you.

295
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,753
Can't believe me about what?

296
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:22,503
Mother, why were you so quiet?
You made the atmosphere awkward.

297
00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:24,901
Don't invite him ever again.

298
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:28,925
Why not? What are you
so uncomfortable about?

299
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:33,917
I didn't invite him though. Hyun-sung did.

300
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:38,237
- Even though Hyun-sung wants to invite him, stop him.
- Stop him?

301
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:45,464
- Do you have feelings for Cheol?
- What?

302
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,441
- You're just acting so oddly.
- What's so odd?

303
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:57,713
You should just be honest. How can anyone
help you if you're keeping secrets?

304
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:00,284
Who's keeping secrets?

305
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:05,503
Fine. I have nothing to
be sad about anyways.

306
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,050
What do you mean by that?

307
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,128
I just mean I'll stop
Hyun-sung from inviting him.

308
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:33,605
Don't get along with him.

309
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:42,925
He's Hyun-sung's friend, so what does it
matter if I get along with him or not?

310
00:26:43,363 --> 00:26:44,696
He's too rude to me.

311
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:47,854
Who is he to give me cheese?

312
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:52,128
It's understandable. He
said he was your fan.

313
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,886
Why are you making a fuss? You're
creating a strange atmosphere.

314
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,597
So are you going to golf with him?

315
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,378
What's the problem with that?
On top of that, he's a lawyer.

316
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,581
No harm will come from knowing him.

317
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:24,597
Your father acts so smart, but at
times like this, he's so dim-witted.

318
00:27:25,183 --> 00:27:27,628
How could he imagine that when
I say Cheol-woo is my friend?

319
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,988
Cheol-woo and your father
met now, so we'll have

320
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:32,127
to see if she goes running
out to meet him again.

321
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,054
When Mr. Park finds out he has become the

322
00:27:36,078 --> 00:27:38,759
fool, with that pride
of his, he'll go crazy.

323
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,003
- Is he really a lawyer?
- He's a golf pro.

324
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:47,342
In Gangnam, he gives golf
lessons to older women.

325
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:51,363
- So he must be a good golf player.
- He has an amazing drive.

326
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:55,651
- How do you know him?
- What?

327
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,560
Seemed like all the ladies
would be charmed by him.

328
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,308
My friend took me to her field lesson.

329
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:11,948
When you guys go golfing, and your father
mentions anything related to law, stop him.

330
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,566
Okay.

331
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,730
Tomorrow is the day he's
going on a blind date.

332
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:22,738
She's so scary.

333
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:25,948
Oh, come on. Who cares?

334
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:29,746
Honey, you should consider my dad's life.

335
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,894
Who cares if she's a bit scary?

336
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,269
Did she see my dad's photo?

337
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:39,097
Yes. I showed her one of his
photos from our wedding album.

338
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:41,184
That's from such a long time ago!

339
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,399
I told her he didn't
change much since then.

340
00:28:43,774 --> 00:28:46,433
If I told her the truth, why would
she come out? He has nothing.

341
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:50,284
Of course he does. Just say he's
in-laws with a conglomerate family.

342
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:53,573
That's right! Why didn't
I think of that sooner?

343
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,917
I should call her right
away and tell her that!

344
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,792
I don't like this woman. I feel
like she's going to nag my dad.

345
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,690
It's okay if your father is nagged a bit.

346
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,065
I don't like her either.

347
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,381
The fact that she gives daily installment
loans to your co-workers bugs me.

348
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,615
How could you wish for anything more?

349
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:15,777
Look at your father's face and see
how much more you can wish for.

350
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:20,514
Although Mrs. Baek is old,
she's bright and cute.

351
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:22,511
How dare you covet my mom?

352
00:29:22,902 --> 00:29:26,050
This is over. It's over.
This woman is over.

353
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:30,690
What do you mean it's over? Do you know
how difficult it was to arrange this?

354
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:32,668
Father.

355
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:35,050
Take your seats.

356
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:36,644
Are you going to the gas station?

357
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:39,487
- Do you have work today?
- No. I'll see you later.

358
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,011
Okay. I'll see you later.

359
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:44,534
Father, finally it's tomorrow.

360
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:50,776
That's right! He made plans already,
so I have no choice but to go out!

361
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:55,276
- Gosh, how bothersome.
- If it's bothersome, don't go...

362
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:01,769
Bye, father. I'll bring
snacks for you later.

363
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:05,437
- Sure. See you then.
- Bye.

364
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,722
It seems like Mr. Jung is going
on his blind date after all.

365
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:15,362
Who cares? Tel him to go.

366
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:20,636
It seemed like he didn't really mind.

367
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:26,222
That's great. There are many people
who marry later on and live well.

368
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:29,305
Do you actually mean that or not?

369
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,550
So what if he's going on a blind date?
What does that have to do with me?

370
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:38,451
- Why are you shoving the plates?
- I did not.

371
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,396
The edges will break.

372
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:45,276
He'll learn his lesson once he marries
a strange woman during his old age.

373
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:50,386
Goodness. Is he that thrilled to be
going on a blind date at his age?

374
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:54,448
- Are you cursing him?
- Of course not!

375
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:57,784
That woman has an awful impression.

376
00:30:58,098 --> 00:31:02,425
- She looks like she'll outlive three husbands.
- Three?

377
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:12,768
There are some fates who are destined
to marry three or four times.

378
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:14,901
Three or four times?

379
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:18,636
You added one more. Earlier,
you said it was three.

380
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,581
She looks like a shaman.

381
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:25,534
- A shaman?
- What exactly entails looking like a shaman?

382
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,401
There are some women who look
like they ought to be shamans.

383
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,909
They have these remarkable eyes.

384
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,313
What if a year after they're
married, she says she was

385
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:37,746
possessed by spirits and
wants to become a shaman?

386
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:39,151
My goodness.

387
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:42,448
- Mrs. Baek.
- What?

388
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:47,628
- Are you jealous?
- O-Of course not...

389
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:50,339
You're intensely opposing her right now.

390
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:53,269
Was I a bit too intense?

391
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:57,440
Aren't shamans usually pretty?

392
00:31:57,925 --> 00:31:59,611
There aren't many shamans out there.

393
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,206
You need to be charismatic
and beautiful so that people

394
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,565
will accept you even though
you speak informally to them.

395
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,773
Have you ever seen a shaman speak formally?

396
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:11,774
So, in conclusion, this woman is
someone who will become a shaman.

397
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:14,538
Hae-sung, are you kidding me?

398
00:32:15,776 --> 00:32:18,469
I feel like a bit regretful that
my dad is going on the date.

399
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:24,800
He likes anything in a skirt.
He's low class.

400
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:29,105
Mom, where are you going?

401
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,745
- That's clearly jealousy, isn't it?
- Yup.

402
00:32:34,824 --> 00:32:37,724
Mr. Jung is happy to be going on a date.

403
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:42,411
What if my mom realizes her
feelings too late and regrets it?

404
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:44,943
- Then we should help her.
- What?

405
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:50,239
We should hold candles and protest that we
can't accept a shaman as our future mother.

406
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,153
- At Gwanghwamun?
- No. At the front gate.

407
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,700
Are you kidding me? At times like this,
you're good at speaking gibberish.

408
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,270
My goodness.

409
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:14,551
My grandmother-in-law likes
to eat rice cakes for snack.

410
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:18,239
Then I should learn this, too.

411
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:23,379
- Did you hear about it?
- Hear about what?

412
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,231
Last time, Kyung-soo was
almost hit by Hyun-joon.

413
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:30,364
Really? Why?

414
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:32,950
You shouldn't make such an
expression, should you?

415
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:35,934
It makes it seem like you
still have feelings for him.

416
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,423
Since you heard he almost got
hit, are you worried about him?

417
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:41,004
- Na-kyung.
- Yes?

418
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:43,958
Of course, I'll put up
with whatever I have to.

419
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,614
However, please be careful of what you say.

420
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:53,090
Do you think you'll be able
to beat Yoo Ji-na without me?

421
00:33:55,067 --> 00:34:01,494
My father-in-law even said he might
give up his shares to Kyung-soo.

422
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:05,504
- Really?
- That's why Kyung-soo almost got hit.

423
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:09,078
If my father-in-law's
shares go to him, then

424
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:12,291
Kyung-soo becomes the greatest shareholder.

425
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,958
In fact, he'll become the
owner of the company.

426
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:21,278
That means Hyun-joon and Hyun-sung
will have nothing left.

427
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:26,882
I'm making so much of an effort
to get rid of Yoo Ji-na...

428
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,454
yet, you can't even thank me, but you're
telling me to be careful of what I say?

429
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:44,895
Hyun-sung's wife isn't an easy woman.

430
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:49,434
However, if you use her well, she'll
make things comfortable for you.

431
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:53,950
Mrs. Sung, I'm not good at such things.

432
00:34:54,388 --> 00:34:58,304
If you want to become the eldest
daughter-in-law of this family, you

433
00:34:58,328 --> 00:35:02,412
need to be able to at least defend
yourself, whether you like it or not.

434
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:09,085
My son even said he's going
to transfer his shares.

435
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,116
I heard it from Na-kyung.

436
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:14,015
That can't happen.

437
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:18,405
If Kyung-soo becomes the
owner of the company,

438
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:23,022
that means the vulgar thing from the
annex is going to be the owner's mother.

439
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:30,460
It will be all over for Hyun-joon,
Hyun-sung, Na-kyung, and you.

440
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,772
Do you think Ji-na will
leave you guys alone?

441
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:37,483
You must stop this. Do
you know what I mean?

442
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:40,335
Yes, I do.

443
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:43,322
Na-kyung isn't the type
of woman to just stand by

444
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:46,027
when there's a talk of a
transferring of the shares.

445
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,530
First, make her take the lead.

446
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:51,976
Okay.

447
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:56,718
Goodness. I'm embarrassed to say this to
you when you haven't gotten married yet,

448
00:35:57,578 --> 00:36:03,319
but it's not that great to get
married into this kind of family.

449
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:09,499
I'll accept whatever I can and try
my best to get along with Na-kyung.

450
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:12,467
Good. Thank you.

451
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:22,124
I'm going to take this to the annex.

452
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:25,397
- I'll go.
- I'd be grateful if you do.

453
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:56,640
- Hae-dang.
- I'm here.

454
00:36:58,812 --> 00:36:59,812
Take a seat.

455
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:16,179
- I heard you go exercising with Mr. Park.
- More like being dragged around.

456
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,874
Are you going to keep being dragged around?

457
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:25,612
Why do you ask? Did someone
tell you to do this?

458
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:33,093
Kyung-soo, I'm about to
get married to Hyun-joon.

459
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:40,616
It won't help you if my
actions aren't clear.

460
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:42,773
Right?

461
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,304
I want to ask you what you're
going to do in the future.

462
00:37:49,906 --> 00:37:51,288
Of course you must ask.

463
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:58,960
I'm going to become Mr. Park's son.

464
00:38:02,788 --> 00:38:03,788
Were you surprised?

465
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:10,312
Is that what you decided to do?

466
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:17,272
If not me, he'll take someone
else to go against his two sons.

467
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:21,826
It's better if that's me.

468
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:28,262
Mr. Park and his sons are already
in an irreparable relationship.

469
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:34,866
At this rate, Hyun-joon won't even
have the ability to protect you.

470
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:37,781
Is that so?

471
00:38:39,515 --> 00:38:43,796
Of course, the story can change
if I give that letter to him.

472
00:38:45,218 --> 00:38:51,280
However, I can't bear to give that
letter to Hyun-joon with my own hands.

473
00:38:52,953 --> 00:38:57,905
If I do, Yoo Ji-na will abandon
this world without any thought.

474
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:04,069
Let me ask you a last question.

475
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:09,960
What exactly do you mean
it's better if that's you?

476
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:24,022
- Did Hae-dang leave?
- She should be in the master bedroom.

477
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,289
Really?

478
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:45,421
- Weren't you in the master bedroom?
- I was at the annex.

479
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:49,687
- Why?
- What are you curious about?

480
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:05,468
Why did you go to the annex? Were you trying
to be petty and ask him for the letter?

481
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:13,226
Now do you realize? My
son can't abandon me.

482
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:17,218
You lost to me.

483
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,522
Did you think someone like you could
cut off ties between me and my son?

484
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:32,251
Eventually, Kyung-soo will become Mr. Park's
son. And he'll inherit all the shares.

485
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:36,608
Do you have the power to stop that?

486
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:43,687
If you were Hong Yoon-hee, you might have
been able to stop Mr. Park with power...

487
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:46,568
because he would have
been shaken if you had

488
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,601
said you will blown his company to pieces.

489
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,305
Looks like Park Hyun-joon
will have everything

490
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:56,929
taken away from him just
because he loves you.

491
00:40:58,898 --> 00:41:04,319
Just as I had expected, you were born
to cause troubles for those around you.

492
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:11,405
Stop ruining innocent Hyun-joon's
life and back away now.

493
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:17,226
- I have no intention to do that.
- Fine. Endure it.

494
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,499
You don't think you're already married to
him just because the families met, do you?

495
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:28,062
- I said I'll become your daughter-in-law no matter what.
- You're tenacious.

496
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:31,026
I'm going to become the eldest
daughter-in-law of this

497
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,720
family, and I'll do everything
I can to protect this family.

498
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:41,102
Fine. Go ahead and try if you can.

499
00:41:42,187 --> 00:41:48,203
Mrs. Choi Kyung-ae was always in fear of being
murdered, so she had installed cameras.

500
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,999
So does it make sense that
she committed suicide?

501
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:59,492
The will was lost and the clue to find
it was hidden somewhere in this house.

502
00:42:02,195 --> 00:42:06,671
- How do you know that?
- Because Kyung-soo told me.

503
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:11,142
Then what do you think that means?

504
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:14,523
It means that although he
has read the letter, he

505
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:16,819
won't be able to find the
clue with just that.

506
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:23,726
Then that means only Hyun-joon
will be able to find that clue.

507
00:42:26,156 --> 00:42:27,819
So, shall we think about it?

508
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:31,994
If you have something to
give your son without anyone

509
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:34,984
else knowing about it,
where would you hide it?

510
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:39,242
Of course, in a place where only
you and your son know about.

511
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:44,499
You don't think Hyun-joon and I
will be able to find that clue?

512
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:51,960
We're going to find it. We're going to find
it and make you into a murderer's wife.

513
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:56,861
So just you wait. Do you understand?

514
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,835
Did Jung Hae-dang really say that?

515
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:10,054
Back when Kyung-soo had been
dating her, he must have told

516
00:43:10,078 --> 00:43:12,590
her because he didn't have
anyone else to discuss it with.

517
00:43:15,031 --> 00:43:20,124
So there had been cameras
installed at the vacation house?

518
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:26,343
Why do you look like that? Did you do
something that was caught on there?

519
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:32,335
It's in a place where only your
ex-wife and Hyun-joon know about.

520
00:43:32,717 --> 00:43:34,814
Isn't it only a matter of
time before they find it?

521
00:43:36,803 --> 00:43:38,273
Hyun-joon hasn't come home yet.

522
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:43,163
You must stop her from telling him.

523
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:52,601
Mr. Park wants to see you.

524
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:57,218
- Who?
- Who else? It's Jung Hae-dang.

525
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:26,968
You asked to see me?

526
00:44:29,546 --> 00:44:32,279
Did you know something about that letter?

527
00:44:35,343 --> 00:44:37,147
My wife told me you did.

528
00:44:39,398 --> 00:44:44,702
Yes. I heard about that
letter from Kyung-soo before.

529
00:44:46,242 --> 00:44:49,249
You didn't tell Hyun-joon
about it yet, did you?

530
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:52,108
I'm going to tell him when he comes home.

531
00:44:53,726 --> 00:44:54,726
Don't.

532
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:58,942
Do you understand me?

533
00:45:01,546 --> 00:45:02,733
Why aren't you answering?

534
00:45:05,234 --> 00:45:07,327
I'll think about it.

535
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:14,596
You're pretty bold. Are you saying
you're going to disobey my words?

536
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:19,429
I clearly told you not to tell him that.

537
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:24,015
I told you I'll think about it.

538
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:26,022
How dare you say that in front of me!

539
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:30,963
If you want to become the
daughter-in-law of this

540
00:45:30,987 --> 00:45:33,132
family, you should listen
to me, your father-in-law.

541
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:36,210
You have an obligation to do that.

542
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,835
However, I'm not part of this family yet.

543
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:42,351
What?

544
00:45:42,554 --> 00:45:46,792
That means I don't have any
obligations to obey someone.

545
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:51,031
I apologize.

546
00:46:16,437 --> 00:46:21,444
Now do you realize how devious she is?
How dare she say that to you?

547
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:26,624
- She's not to be taken lightly.
- I told you so.

548
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:32,226
So my mother did see something good in her.

549
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:35,999
Is this the time to argue
about that right now?

550
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:40,281
Where will I be able to find a woman
who has no greed to become the

551
00:46:40,305 --> 00:46:45,522
daughter-in-law of this family while doing
everything she can for Hyun-joon nowadays?

552
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,593
What did you say?

553
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,976
How will I be able to
make her become my ally?

554
00:46:52,304 --> 00:46:56,077
Jung Hae-dang is pushing a
knife towards you right now!

555
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:03,663
How would she dare tell Hyun-joon
anything when I gave her a warning?

556
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:08,390
I can't believe you. You still
don't know Jung Hae-dang at all.

557
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:14,874
She's fully capable of telling him that
and something more. I'm telling you!

558
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,062
I'm sure of it.

559
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:29,554
It hasn't been long since I made this
radish kimchi, so why is so sour already?

560
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:36,272
It tastes fine to me. It's very delicious!

561
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:40,530
Maybe my tongue is getting old. I don't
find anything delicious like before.

562
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:44,358
Goodness. You're not that old yet.

563
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:48,382
- Is something upsetting you?
- Of course not.

564
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:53,507
He said he was just going to drink a cup
of coffee, so why isn't he back yet?

565
00:47:53,843 --> 00:47:57,126
Maybe they're getting along so well that
they're going to have dinner together?

566
00:47:57,632 --> 00:47:59,382
Yeah, right.

567
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,515
Are you eating dinner? My dad came home.

568
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,905
- He's here?
- Really? Let's go.

569
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:15,898
Father!

570
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:22,163
D-Did you meet her? How was she?

571
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:28,155
- So-so.
- So-so? What do you mean by that?

572
00:48:29,304 --> 00:48:31,632
Did you have dinner with her?

573
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:35,694
We didn't have much to
say, so we ate early.

574
00:48:36,187 --> 00:48:37,937
You guys didn't have much to talk about?

575
00:48:39,195 --> 00:48:41,976
- So you didn't like her?
- I said she was so-so.

576
00:48:42,187 --> 00:48:45,265
What kind of answer is that?
Either you like her or you don't!

577
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:49,640
He must have liked her in order
to have eaten dinner with her.

578
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,650
So did you guys plan to meet again?

579
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:54,710
She asked for my number,
so I gave it to her.

580
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,076
Then it's a success! He did like her!

581
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:04,358
All people are the same. There aren't
especially bad or good people.

582
00:49:04,937 --> 00:49:07,780
Are you going to meet her
again if she calls you?

583
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:11,444
I'm not sure. I'll have to see about that.

584
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:13,062
How is that possible?

585
00:49:13,523 --> 00:49:17,990
What do you mean? He gave her his
number because he likes her, too.

586
00:49:18,982 --> 00:49:22,250
- So you do like her.
- I told you she was so-so!

587
00:49:22,274 --> 00:49:23,607
Let's go up and eat!

588
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,359
Mom!

589
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:35,554
I'll come back after I finish eating, so
tell me the details then. Okay, father?

590
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:49,537
- Mom, aren't you going to finish eating?
- Go ahead and stuff your faces.

591
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:52,679
Oh, my.

592
00:49:56,022 --> 00:49:57,250
What's wrong with your mother?

593
00:49:57,274 --> 00:50:01,074
Why worry about her? She won't
die from missing one meal.

594
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:07,202
My head was hurting the past few
days, but I feel so refreshed now!

595
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:12,843
- My mom is suspicious.
- Right?

596
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:15,319
Even though she's suspicious,
it's too late now.

597
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:19,315
What if we have to light candles and
start a protest at the front gate?

598
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:23,319
Gosh. Don't say that
when it's already over.

599
00:50:23,578 --> 00:50:26,960
It's not over. It has just started.

600
00:50:27,515 --> 00:50:31,538
- My mom can't live without winning.
- She's not the type to easily back away.

601
00:50:32,234 --> 00:50:36,585
Gosh. Eat up. Let's end
this conversation here.

602
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,953
He's so ignorant.

603
00:50:53,078 --> 00:50:55,929
I was late. There was a
lot of traffic today.

604
00:50:57,265 --> 00:51:00,444
Hae-dang, what did you do
the whole day without me?

605
00:51:01,015 --> 00:51:03,343
She learned kitchen-work from Na-kyung.

606
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:05,452
You must had suffered.

607
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:09,913
You shouldn't say such things in front
of your family. You'll be called a fool.

608
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:16,320
When they get married, are you going
to leave the housework to Hae-dang?

609
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:18,569
Of course. She should know
how to do the housework.

610
00:51:19,507 --> 00:51:23,772
It's about Na-kyung stopped
doing housework now.

611
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:28,812
- Na-kyung, do the housework for a big longer.
- Pardon?

612
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,437
- All the housework you learned is a waste.
- Why is it a waste?

613
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:37,249
She needs to know how to do it so that she
can teach her future daughter-in-law.

614
00:51:37,742 --> 00:51:40,491
We don't even have a child, so we
won't be having a daughter-in-law.

615
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,772
It's not like you guys
won't have a kid forever.

616
00:51:45,453 --> 00:51:51,147
Once they're married, focus on
becoming pregnant, Na-kyung.

617
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:55,640
If you still can't get pregnant, I'll
really chase you out of this house.

618
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:59,226
Grandmother, I know you're
half-joking, but she's

619
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:03,710
not at the age where you
can chase her out anymore.

620
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:06,937
It's been years since
she got married to me.

621
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,952
Even if I tell her I'll chase her
out, she won't get scared anymore.

622
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:13,934
Goodness. All of you are
siding with your wives.

623
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,194
That's not bad. We're
like other people now.

624
00:52:20,734 --> 00:52:23,408
Na-kyung, take care of the
housework for a bit longer.

625
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:26,063
Hae-dang, do you want to learn
how to run the gallery?

626
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,562
The gallery?

627
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:32,323
Buying and managing
expensive art pieces are

628
00:52:32,347 --> 00:52:34,771
unexpectedly important
to managing the funds.

629
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:37,733
I left it in someone else's
care, but it makes me uneasy.

630
00:52:38,468 --> 00:52:41,077
It's something that someone
from our family should do.

631
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,968
Father, then I should do it.

632
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:46,905
You're not capable of doing such a thing.

633
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,265
I should be more capable than Hae-dang.

634
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:54,476
How could I leave such an
important task to someone

635
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,612
like you who is hot-tempered
like a boiling pot?

636
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:02,038
You should start studying for it.

637
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,843
You won't even let Hyun-joon near the
company, but you'll let Hae-dang?

638
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,468
That's a bit odd.

639
00:53:12,804 --> 00:53:14,137
What's odd about it?

640
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,257
I can drive Hae-dang around
and play her secretary.

641
00:53:19,077 --> 00:53:21,319
I can see her for the entire day.
Sounds great to me.

642
00:53:22,218 --> 00:53:25,687
Thanks to my wife, I'll be able to check out
the financial structure of the company.

643
00:53:28,867 --> 00:53:32,702
What is he up to? It's something
I haven't imagined before.

644
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:36,905
I'm not interested.

645
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:46,288
Even if I start learning now, it's not
something someone like me can do.

646
00:53:48,054 --> 00:53:50,819
As expected, you're a reasonable
woman, sister-in-law.

647
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:56,796
You must be in a haste, considering
you called her "sister-in-law."

648
00:53:59,968 --> 00:54:02,421
Discuss it with Hyun-joon
before giving me an answer.

649
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:05,554
How about you try it out?

650
00:54:08,273 --> 00:54:11,163
The fact that I'm going to leave
this in your hands instead

651
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:15,553
of my wife or other daughter-in-law
is very meaningful.

652
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:21,296
What do you mean by that? Are you
sneaking in an apology to your kids now?

653
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:25,891
Are you using her because you're too
embarrassed to apologize to them yourself?

654
00:54:27,656 --> 00:54:29,389
You can think as you wish.

655
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:32,789
Let's eat.

656
00:54:45,593 --> 00:54:48,015
Look at this. Just look at it!

657
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:52,608
I think I'm the only
sane one in this family!

658
00:54:54,851 --> 00:54:56,522
Ask anyone on the street!

659
00:54:57,054 --> 00:55:00,937
I should be the one running the gallery,
not some woman singing at a cabaret!

660
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:06,679
- Does your father have early dementia?
- I wish.

661
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,843
She's not just a singer! She's
a singer from a cabaret!

662
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,866
On top of that, I graduated from college.

663
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:18,546
Why didn't you say anything
after you heard that?

664
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,812
Grandmother wants you to use
any means to have a baby.

665
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:25,442
That means she's finally accepting
you as a member of this family.

666
00:55:26,726 --> 00:55:28,085
What more do you want?

667
00:55:28,406 --> 00:55:31,757
So am I no better than Jung Hae-dang?

668
00:55:33,023 --> 00:55:38,750
- Hae-dang is innocent.
- And what? I'm guilty?

669
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,234
Both my father and grandmother
don't like you because you

670
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:44,719
got smart with them with
that foolish brain of yours.

671
00:55:44,743 --> 00:55:50,374
A cabaret singer is handling expensive art
pieces and going to work at the gallery.

672
00:55:51,117 --> 00:55:53,647
But I need to cook food in the kitchen?

673
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,991
Do you think they'll let her go
to the gallery empty-handed?

674
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:01,418
Anyways, what does my
father have up his sleeve?

675
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:08,093
Is having one of us sit in such an important
position a way of apologizing to us?

676
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,483
Do you not know your father?
Apology, my foot.

677
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:15,983
One of his weaknesses
probably got caught again.

678
00:56:16,983 --> 00:56:21,457
Is that so? Find out what that is.

679
00:56:23,405 --> 00:56:24,709
- No.
- What?

680
00:56:25,046 --> 00:56:28,241
Using my brain won't work. All
it gives me is a headache.

681
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,716
Find out for yourself. I won't.

682
00:56:42,414 --> 00:56:44,783
Still, aren't you giving
her such a big offer?

683
00:56:45,705 --> 00:56:48,491
When you're making a deal with someone, you

684
00:56:49,288 --> 00:56:52,538
have to make them an
offer they can't refuse.

685
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:57,135
Still, I should be the one
in charge of that position.

686
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:01,354
Don't wives of CEOs usually
run those kind of things?

687
00:57:02,534 --> 00:57:06,159
It won't be easy for her to
refuse because this is an offer

688
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:09,628
that Hyun-joon, rather than
she, won't be able to refuse.

689
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:18,542
- Are you serious?
- He told me not to tell you.

690
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:23,995
Didn't you hear any hints
about the location?

691
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:29,651
It's been too long. This is all I remember.

692
00:57:31,846 --> 00:57:36,167
So think of a place where your
mother could have hid the clue.

693
00:57:37,378 --> 00:57:40,503
There must a place that only
the two of you know of.

694
00:57:42,144 --> 00:57:46,549
- I can't think of it.
- Think of it. You must think of it.

695
00:57:47,979 --> 00:57:51,214
Eventually, Kyung-soo can't
lose against his mom.

696
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:57,924
We have to find it before Kyung-soo does.

697
00:58:21,884 --> 00:58:24,479
(To My Son/Choi Kyung-ae)

698
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:39,908
Hyun-joon, I have buried the
keepsake that must be given to you

699
00:58:39,932 --> 00:58:44,352
underneath the tree in the yard
that only you and I know of.

700
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:15,964
- It's a letter.
- What is it about? Please read it to me.

701
00:59:16,472 --> 00:59:20,971
I'm blind, so I can't read
anything that isn't in braille.

702
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:25,541
I don't know how to use a smart-phone,
so I can't send you a photo either.

703
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:30,098
I can't ask just anyone to
help me with this either.

704
00:59:31,027 --> 00:59:35,042
- Send it to me through mail.
- She said I had to give it to you directly.

705
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:41,073
I'll call you back when I'm
in Korea again. Good-bye.

706
01:00:00,886 --> 01:00:05,174
So think of a place where your
mother could have hid the clue.

707
01:00:06,253 --> 01:00:10,167
We have to find it before Kyung-soo does.

708
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,759
What is it you have to tell me?

709
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:38,096
I wanted to officially tell you she
refused to work at the gallery.

710
01:00:40,222 --> 01:00:42,464
- Really?
- Hae-dang told me to tell you that.

711
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,628
Okay. That's too bad then.

712
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:50,854
Don't you feel embarrassed in front
of your future daughter-in-law?

713
01:00:55,378 --> 01:00:58,792
Aren't you afraid something has
been captured in the cameras?

714
01:00:59,886 --> 01:01:02,486
So eventually, she told you everything?

715
01:01:02,807 --> 01:01:06,363
How could mom have committed
suicide when she had installed

716
01:01:06,387 --> 01:01:09,289
cameras because she was
afraid of being murdered?

717
01:01:11,683 --> 01:01:16,924
At the moment of the incident, you
were there at the cliff with her.

718
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:19,003
I told you there was a will.

719
01:01:19,253 --> 01:01:22,432
It was written in the letter
that she had written a

720
01:01:23,049 --> 01:01:25,187
will, just in case, but
the will had gotten lost.

721
01:01:27,097 --> 01:01:28,525
Do you still have something to say?

722
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:32,143
- I didn't kill her.
- Who'd believe you?

723
01:01:32,472 --> 01:01:36,120
If you want to make me into a
murderer, find the evidence!

724
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,823
Don't worry. I'll be sure to find it.

725
01:01:53,027 --> 01:01:56,159
See? Did you think she was a normal woman?

726
01:01:57,667 --> 01:01:59,831
She's a disgusting, impudent woman.

727
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,628
I gave her a warning. I gave her a chance.
So how dare she?

728
01:02:05,284 --> 01:02:07,893
Yet, she's going to become
my daughter-in-law?

729
01:02:09,089 --> 01:02:13,339
Did you get all the photos and films
that have to do with the hotel incident?

730
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:18,635
Of course I did. I got them right
after the meeting with her family.

731
01:02:20,495 --> 01:02:22,362
- Then take her out.
- What?

732
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:27,760
Are you serious? Then
what about my dignity?

733
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:30,472
This isn't the time to
protect your dignity.

734
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,222
Do you want to really be hurt by Hae-dang?

735
01:02:33,464 --> 01:02:35,471
No one can win against her.

736
01:02:37,355 --> 01:02:40,214
Why? Because she has no greed.

737
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:45,299
Do you know what kind of person is the
most impossible to control in this world?

738
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:47,339
It's someone who has no greed.

739
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:51,819
She's just doing this
because she wants to get

740
01:02:51,843 --> 01:02:54,206
revenge against me for her
younger sister's death.

741
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:57,284
She has no interest in becoming
the wife of a wealthy man.

742
01:03:00,284 --> 01:03:03,448
In the end, she'll shake Kyung-soo, too.

743
01:03:05,261 --> 01:03:08,417
Eventually, she'll stab you in the back.

744
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:16,143
There's no one who knows
her better than I do.

745
01:03:23,894 --> 01:03:28,307
Let's just have the wedding
in the yard in a party style.

746
01:03:29,683 --> 01:03:36,503
If people mingle together, they won't even
know if the bride has many guests or not.

747
01:03:37,933 --> 01:03:39,378
Thank you for your consideration.

748
01:03:43,003 --> 01:03:45,886
I can't allow this marriage.

749
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:55,214
What are you talking about?

750
01:03:56,394 --> 01:03:59,315
I can't allow this marriage to happen.

751
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:03,415
Are you joking? What on earth
are you talking about?

752
01:04:04,346 --> 01:04:07,307
I don't want a daughter-in-law like her.

753
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,667
Is this what you're doing now?

754
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:13,917
How can you go back on
your words at your age?

755
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,768
Especially in front of your
sons and daughters-in-law?

756
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:22,956
Let me repeat myself. I can't
allow this marriage to happen.

757
01:04:23,378 --> 01:04:29,292
Don't allow it then! Who's scared?
I'm going to get them married!

758
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:35,846
Then, at that moment, I'm going to
give all of my shares to Kyung-soo.

759
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:45,917
Those damned shares!

760
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:49,799
That threat is your means of power.

761
01:04:50,698 --> 01:04:52,143
Go ahead! Give them to him!

762
01:04:56,917 --> 01:04:59,182
Grandmother, you should go in and lie down.

763
01:05:43,675 --> 01:05:46,379
Now do you realize that you
won't become this family's

764
01:05:46,403 --> 01:05:49,203
daughter-in-law just because
the families met each other?

765
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:57,971
The time has finally come for me to ask
Kyung-soo to give the letter to me.

766
01:05:58,941 --> 01:06:03,255
What? Do you think my son
will give you that letter?

767
01:06:05,034 --> 01:06:08,034
He'll never be able to abandon me.

768
01:06:09,058 --> 01:06:11,870
That was when I was going
to marry Hyun-joon.

769
01:06:12,753 --> 01:06:13,753
What?

770
01:06:14,175 --> 01:06:17,839
Since I won't be able to marry
Hyun-joon anyways, should

771
01:06:17,863 --> 01:06:21,332
I tell him to give up the
letter and run away with me?

772
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:23,254
Don't kid yourself.

773
01:06:23,909 --> 01:06:26,464
Let's ask him if I'm kidding or not.

774
01:06:27,503 --> 01:06:30,057
Fine. Let's do it then.

775
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:39,299
We should ask my son who
he'll choose between us.

776
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:46,110
Your eyes are shaking right now.

777
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:23,458
("You Are Too Much")

778
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:25,402
- Where are you going?
- To get the letter.

779
01:07:25,426 --> 01:07:28,320
- You can't!
- Go in there and persuade Mr. Park at once!

780
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,817
If I have to choose either of
you, my choice is always her.

781
01:07:30,841 --> 01:07:34,084
It's a foundation party. It's about time
you said hello to the board members.

782
01:07:34,108 --> 01:07:37,095
- Don't go there.
- I'm going to follow Mr. Park wishes.

783
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,604
I told you that you shouldn't
do what I tell you not to do!

784
01:07:39,628 --> 01:07:42,402
- Did you just hit me?
- Yes, I did.

785
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:44,089
She hit me two times.

786
01:07:44,363 --> 01:07:46,551
Give us the master bedroom
and move into the annex!

787
01:07:46,575 --> 01:07:49,636
Did you see that? Finally the hierarchy
is being organized properly.

788
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:53,721
- Don't you dare act arrogant in front of me.
- I've had enough of this. How dare she?

789
01:07:53,745 --> 01:07:57,522
Call Im Cheol-woo and tell him to bring
me the evidence to destroy Yoo Ji-na!

790
01:07:57,546 --> 01:08:01,518
There's a way we can get that letter.
I'll make sure to get it for you.

791
01:08:01,722 --> 01:08:06,467
Now it's time for you to choose. Choose
either your late mother or Hae-dang.

792
01:08:06,698 --> 01:08:08,950
Her friend's father passed away?
But yesterday

793
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:11,128
she said her friend's
mother had passed away.

794
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:14,424
Mother, Cheol is at the
front gate right now.

795
01:08:14,878 --> 01:08:17,211
I'll be keeping watch in the living room.
