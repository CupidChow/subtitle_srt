00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:07,937
(Episode 33)

2
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:12,101
Kyung-soo, get up and go
to the annex this instant.

3
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:16,992
What are you doing? Kyung-soo
is part of this family, too.

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,477
Why are you suddenly telling him to leave?

5
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:22,742
Get up and go to the annex right now.
Didn't you hear me?

6
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:27,238
Mother, why are you insisting
on making the girl who was

7
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:30,017
about to marry Kyung-soo
your granddaughter-in-law?

8
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:33,421
I told you it doesn't matter!
They're not brothers!

9
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:36,359
Do you think he'll become your
son just because you insist?

10
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:42,882
Hyun-joon, don't you even dare think
of coming anywhere near my company.

11
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:46,604
Why would you tell your eldest son
not to come near the company?

12
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:50,763
- What kind of nonsense is this?
- I'm not the only one saying nonsense right now!

13
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:53,866
You're going to push away your
sons who are almost turning forty

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,664
and put a stranger who isn't your
flesh and blood in their spot?

15
00:00:56,905 --> 00:01:00,172
You keep talking about flesh and
blood, but why is that so important?

16
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,117
Who cares if they're my flesh and blood?
Just look at the way they treat me!

17
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,688
I don't need sons who are
my flesh and blood anymore!

18
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:09,109
Kyung-soo, get up this instant
and get out of this house!

19
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,336
Stay seated.

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,476
- Get out at once!
- Stay in your seat!

21
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,742
Hae-dang, get up.

22
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,312
What are you doing sitting here?

23
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,903
I can't stand this family.

24
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:36,348
Get up and leave this house with me.

25
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,442
I don't need anything now.

26
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:44,364
Get up. Get up and leave this
house with me right now!

27
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:50,333
Lee Kyung-soo, what the hell do you
think you're doing in front of me?

28
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,520
- What are you doing?
- Hae-dang!

29
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:56,622
We don't belong here.

30
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:00,685
Get up.

31
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,559
Leave this house with me right now.

32
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:22,778
Lee Kyung-soo, I forgot about you.

33
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:26,302
Hae-dang.

34
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:30,262
The person I love right
now is Park Hyun-joon.

35
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,231
That's a lie.

36
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:35,629
That's a lie!

37
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,012
I met you when you were blind.

38
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,653
If I think about it now,
that was pity, not love.

39
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:52,950
In that sense, I've never
loved you, Kyung-soo.

40
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:58,396
Hae-dang...

41
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,450
You might still have feelings for me...

42
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:09,965
but get rid of them.

43
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:17,247
This is all I have to say to you.

44
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:34,882
Hae-dang, let's go inside now.

45
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,653
This is all he'll ever amount to, but you're
going to raise him as your successor?

46
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,981
Do you think he wants to live
in this house as your son?

47
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:29,590
If you raise him as a successor, what
will happen to our family in the future?

48
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,740
How dare he have lingering feelings for his

49
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:34,755
sister-in-law and try to
play an impudence trick!

50
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:38,543
Your son is quite amazing.

51
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,715
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

52
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:46,083
Like mother, like son.
Both of you are so vulgar!

53
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:03,575
Hyun-joon, I...

54
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,379
Don't say anything and just stay still.

55
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,226
I understand how you feel
right now more than you do.

56
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,075
Thank you for saying that at that moment.

57
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:20,864
It's okay if it's a lie. Even
if it's a lie, I'm grateful.

58
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,325
How could you pull such a stunt
in front of the whole family?

59
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,012
- How would that make me look?
- Get out.

60
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:41,188
Every time Mrs. Sung opens her
mouth, she calls me vulgar.

61
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:43,184
Must you add to that, too?

62
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:49,550
What on earth do I mean to you?
Why do you keep humiliating me?

63
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:52,856
Mr. Park had such high
expectations for you.

64
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:55,317
How could you put him in
an embarrassing situation?

65
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,723
How will I be able to face him now?

66
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:03,278
Do you think it's easy for him to
push his sons aside and choose you?

67
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:08,497
The fact that he doesn't get along
with his sons is a blessing for you.

68
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:10,622
How could you be so ungrateful?

69
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:15,395
I was too ashamed to look at him!
I was dying of embarrassment!

70
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:21,364
So now you're embarrassed of me.
Then I'll disappear from your life.

71
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:36,152
Where are you going? If you leave now, you
will never be able to come back in here.

72
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:40,460
- Then what do you want me to do?
- Forget about Jung Hae-dang!

73
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,588
- That's not easy!
- She forgot about you. Didn't you hear her earlier?

74
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:48,635
Didn't you see her making you into a
strange person just to save her own neck?

75
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,271
- She lied because she had no choice!
- Why do you think that's a lie?

76
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:55,509
I could tell from the look in her eyes
that she was lying through her teeth.

77
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:59,127
- What?
- We know everything just by looking at each other's eyes.

78
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:06,134
How on earth can you become free from her?

79
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:14,002
If you know a way, let me know.

80
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,033
What?

81
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,056
The cause of all tragedy is you.

82
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,472
Please leave.

83
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:28,478
It's only natural that
your two sons hate you.

84
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,555
It's because you've committed
many sins during your life.

85
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:38,062
You dare rub salt in their wounds by
choosing another man just because

86
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:41,689
they won't listen to you after you
committed all the sins you wanted?

87
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:45,993
You're worse than that vulgar Yoo Ji-na.

88
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:49,017
Yes. I'm the bad guy here.

89
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:53,650
- You're the one who should go to hell!
- I'll go to hell, so just leave already!

90
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:57,413
Step away from your CEO
position and atone to Hyun-joon

91
00:07:57,437 --> 00:08:00,127
and Hyun-sung for all
the wrong you've done.

92
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:04,486
- Even if I go to hell, I won't do that.
- Why not?

93
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:12,665
Maybe you want to repent because you're
getting older, but I'm only 63 years old now.

94
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,665
If I give everything up, what will
I do for the rest of my life?

95
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:22,470
In my point-of-view, you're the betrayer.

96
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,845
It's the duty of parents to sacrifice
themselves for their children.

97
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,525
The reason why I committed
those sins with you

98
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,530
is because I thought that
was the best for you.

99
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,993
Such duties don't fit me, so
tell everyone else to do that.

100
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,209
I have too many days of life
ahead of me in order to pay

101
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:44,299
repentance to my two sons who
regard me as a murderer.

102
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:15,110
It's too late, so I can't see
your father before I go home.

103
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:19,280
- You can see him next time.
- You had a hard time today, didn't you?

104
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:22,117
I'm okay.

105
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,030
I'll be going now.

106
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,374
I'm sorry, Kyung-soo...

107
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:32,931
(Lee Kyung-soo)

108
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:36,926
I hesitated to text you, but I did, just
in case you were worrying about me.

109
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:41,900
I know how you feel. Don't worry about me.

110
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,759
You left your phone in my car.

111
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:25,001
You got a text from Lee Kyung-soo.
I'm sorry, but I opened it.

112
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:26,963
Good night.

113
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:30,931
Hyun-joon.

114
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,030
I can still bear it.

115
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:42,315
Do you remember how I
told you that you can't

116
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,108
think about him anymore
when I tell you not to?

117
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:51,056
I know people can't force
someone to like them...

118
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,646
but I already bet my all on you.

119
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:42,105
Grandmother feels bloated.
She said we can eat first.

120
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,876
- What about Kyung-soo?
- He said he'll eat later.

121
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:46,634
Let's eat.

122
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:57,282
The problem isn't Kyung-soo. It's Hae-dang.

123
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,182
Na-kyung.

124
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,391
It depends on how the
woman acts for the man

125
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,767
to have lingering feelings for her or not.

126
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,791
Na-kyung.

127
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,595
Kyung-soo is only twenty-five years old.

128
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:12,439
He's at a healthy age where he can fall
for someone recklessly in an instant.

129
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:19,837
Hae-dang is 33 years old.

130
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,454
She can just reason with him, but
she's purposely agonizing him.

131
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,791
That's enough.

132
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:29,431
You don't know a woman's
mentality very well.

133
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:33,915
Even when women go to a men with good
statuses because they need them,

134
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,919
they want the men they had
dumped to remember them forever.

135
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,767
- Do you think Hae-dang is like you?
- What did you say?

136
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,134
Just eat.

137
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:47,171
Because she worked at a
cabaret before, she'll be

138
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:50,135
able to gobble up ten people
like naive Kyung-soo.

139
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,118
Even if she eats them up for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

140
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:57,392
she's much better than you who married
for business and promised to get a

141
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:59,821
divorce with nothing but
three million dollars.

142
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:06,868
- Hyun-sung, see me before you go to work.
- Okay.

143
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,298
- Why are you allowing her to run her mouth like that?
- I'm trying to warn her.

144
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,845
It's about time we chase her out. You should
use this chance to end ties with her.

145
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:33,790
I can't get a divorce.

146
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,306
I'm sick and tired of how father lived,
so I want to just live with one woman.

147
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:45,517
Is that all? Aren't you just letting her
be just in case she's of help to you?

148
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:47,298
What do you mean?

149
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:50,331
You don't want the company to
be in someone else's hands, but

150
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:53,058
you'd rather be the owner instead
of Hyun-joon. Isn't that it?

151
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,696
Even though it may be an empty promise,
why can't you just say you'll give

152
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,495
the company to the more skilled one
after we chase out Yoo Ji-na together?

153
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:03,306
Because it's an empty promise.

154
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,275
It gets complicated when the
hierarchy gets rearranged.

155
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:12,353
No one puts the eldest first these days. The
one who is more competent gets to own it.

156
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,983
You can't win your father this way.

157
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:20,376
You won't be able to win him by
trying to get your share of this.

158
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,634
I will never allow Yoo Ji-na's son
to take over the company either.

159
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:31,134
However, I don't want either you or father
to tell me what to do about my marriage.

160
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,478
This is why you can't win!

161
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:38,290
If you're going to give something,
you should give completely.

162
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:41,603
Why are you being shamefully calculative?

163
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:44,915
I was always weak-hearted and shameful.

164
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:50,657
- Goodness. You've been coaxed by your wife already.
- Good-bye.

165
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,221
Fool. My goodness.

166
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:08,447
Hello, mother.

167
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,884
About what happened at the
table earlier... thank you.

168
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:14,470
It's nothing.

169
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:17,569
Regardless of whether
the family believed you

170
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:20,041
or not, I was grateful you helped me out.

171
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:24,689
According to grandmother,
no one can beat compulsion.

172
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:28,748
Whether they believe it or not,
let's keep arguing that Kyung-soo

173
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:32,196
is naive and it's all Hae-dang's
fault for being a cunning fox.

174
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:35,859
Do whatever you can to stop Hae-dang.

175
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:39,837
I'm not someone who forgets gratefulness.

176
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,735
You didn't drink this in the morning.

177
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,986
You're going to ruin your divine
skin by worrying like that.

178
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,790
Divine, my foot.

179
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:08,697
Come with me.

180
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:24,088
I really don't want to
chase you out of here.

181
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,376
If I was like before, I would've chased
you out at once, but I'm old now.

182
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,368
I must've gotten attached to you.
What do you think about that?

183
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,345
Didn't you get attached to me?

184
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,233
Of course I did.

185
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,439
I've served you for years now.

186
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,548
Do you think serving me for years
gives you the right to act up?

187
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:52,821
Grandmother, please think of this
from my point-of-view at least once.

188
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,882
- Think about what?
- I'm the daughter-in-law of a conglomerate

189
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:58,236
family by name only. No one
like me live the way I do!

190
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:02,206
I've lived years serving this
family out of gratefulness

191
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,319
that you accepted someone
like me from a low birth.

192
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,565
If you're so upset, you
can start going out now.

193
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:11,111
My family may be shabby, but
not shabbier than Hae-dang's!

194
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:14,501
Your character is no better than hers.

195
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:19,673
How would anyone be able to use a
shallow, frivolous person like you?

196
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:24,091
- You don't have to worry about where to use me.
- What?

197
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:27,767
Because I'm going to
find my own way to live.

198
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,478
Yeah, right. You won't be
able to handle yourself.

199
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:35,700
If you dare entice Hyun-sung into stirring

200
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:38,532
trouble, I will really
kick you out of here!

201
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:41,618
- Even if I get kicked out, I can't stop it.
- What?

202
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:45,724
I told you. I'm not the new bride who used

203
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:49,595
to turn pale with the
raising of your voice.

204
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:56,767
Wow. I'm speechless.

205
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:03,204
We're going to have a meeting with
Hae-dang's family. Make some time.

206
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:09,618
- What meeting?
- Aren't you going to meet up with your new in-laws?

207
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,751
- I won't be attending the meeting.
- And if you won't?

208
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:19,165
I have no intention of accepting
her as my daughter-in-law.

209
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:33,556
We can skip the meeting. You
already met her father anyways.

210
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:38,548
I don't even want to introduce Mr.
Park as my father.

211
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:44,556
It's not like you don't have a father. How
will her family feel if he doesn't show up?

212
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:49,181
I can just say he's ill and on the
brink of death in the hospital.

213
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:52,092
- Do you think that makes
sense?- Do you think that's

214
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:54,633
the only thing that doesn't
make sense in this family?

215
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:57,117
Goodness gracious.

216
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,008
It looks like it's going to be
difficult to have a proper wedding.

217
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:08,180
Please excuse me, too.

218
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:15,453
She was at my beck and call, but she's
already teamed up with that side.

219
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:22,281
My goodness. So many things
have become a waste.

220
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:35,504
What did you call me for?

221
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:38,875
You need to meet someone in her family.

222
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:40,867
You mean, Jung Hae-dang?

223
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:44,938
It will be uncomfortable for your
mother-in-law to meet with them,

224
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,242
especially since such things have
happened between Hae-dang and Kyung-soo.

225
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,742
Okay. I'll go meet them.

226
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,242
Bring in what I have prepared.

227
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,466
So you're going to go meet her?

228
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,375
I'm going to take Hae-sung.

229
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:11,123
Hae-dang told me not to bring her, just in

230
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:13,566
case uncomfortable words
might be exchanged.

231
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:17,086
What if they want us to bring
a lot of wedding gifts?

232
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,861
Should I go with them? I want to see what
a conglomerate family member looks like.

233
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:24,120
Why would you go? Are you trying to
spoil it? It's be better if I go.

234
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:28,289
- Yeah. It would be better if you go with Hae-jin.
- Huh?

235
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:35,235
No. Are you crazy? I'm not Jung
Kang-sik's wife. Why would I go there?

236
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:38,201
Don't be like that and just go.

237
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:42,250
I'd consider it if Mr. Jung bows
his head and politely asks me.

238
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:52,478
Wouldn't that be a lot better
than just sending the girls?

239
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:54,360
You think so, too?

240
00:22:55,594 --> 00:23:00,750
- But my mom has a condition.
- What condition?

241
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:06,164
She said she'll consider going if you
bow your head and ask her politely.

242
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,720
Bow what? Is that lady serious?

243
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:14,623
- How dare you call your
in-law "that lady!" - What?

244
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:19,860
It makes me uncomfortable to see you
treating her so disrespectfully!

245
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:23,586
Why would you feel uncomfortable?

246
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:27,649
All the sons in the world have a dream for

247
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:31,391
their moms to remain as
white jades forever!

248
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,898
A dream? And what exactly
does a dream mean?

249
00:23:36,173 --> 00:23:37,664
Well, to be exact...

250
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,156
I don't know either.

251
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:44,711
Dream, whatever!

252
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:48,524
F-Father! Father!

253
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:54,686
Look here, Mrs. Baek Mi-sook!

254
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:57,602
What brings you up here
without a call, Mr. Jung?

255
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,093
Are you really going to be like this?

256
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:06,586
You told me to call you
before I come downstairs.

257
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:10,211
Can you barge into my house without a call?

258
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:15,000
- Gosh! Why are you so petty?
- How am I petty?

259
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:20,313
This has to do with Hae-dang's marriage!
Must you show off now?

260
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:25,634
What do you mean "show off?" You're using
improper language towards your in-law.

261
00:24:25,907 --> 00:24:28,208
You're so annoying. They say
your habits from when you

262
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:30,615
were three-years-old will
follow you until you're eighty.

263
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,327
How can you still be annoying
when you're a grandma?

264
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:39,125
What? What do you mean I'm annoying?
How can you say that to your in-law?

265
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:41,383
I was offended by the rumor, too!

266
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:45,655
Ever since my wife died, I've
lived like a white jade!

267
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,758
That's because you have no choice.
No one ever liked you before.

268
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,571
Goodness, of course there was!

269
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:57,178
Didn't you see the lady who
owns the rice cake store

270
00:24:57,202 --> 00:25:00,301
give me a piece of rice
cake every time I pass by?

271
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:04,513
She gave it to you because she wanted
you to buy rice cake, not because

272
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:07,103
she likes you! You're counting
your chickens before they hatch.

273
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:13,078
Then did you ever receive rice cake
or something from someone before?

274
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,867
Of course I did!

275
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:18,451
I can't go the neighborhood convenience
store because the owner who

276
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,501
became widowed the year before last
keeps winking at me like this.

277
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:24,853
Look who's talking. You're the one who's
counting your chickens before they hatch.

278
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:29,950
Ever since he had passed away from
the shock of losing his wife, he had

279
00:25:29,974 --> 00:25:34,922
problems with his face muscles, so even
when he's alone, he winks like this.

280
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,580
Are you done talking?

281
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,055
What are the two of you doing right now?

282
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:41,719
People would think you were
having a lovers' spat!

283
00:25:41,953 --> 00:25:43,828
- What spat?
- A lovers' spat?

284
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:48,992
Gosh, we need to move out or something.
We can't live under the same roof!

285
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:50,906
What are you doing?

286
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,547
How do I look? Do I look okay?

287
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:12,133
- Why did you suddenly get a perm?
- Why? Do I smell like hair chemicals?

288
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,477
Usually perms gets natural a week later...

289
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:19,860
Darn it. My heels must have been scraped.
They hurt so much.

290
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Let's go.

291
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,625
Hold on.

292
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:34,007
I need to put a napkin in here. I
can't walk a single step like this.

293
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:36,073
I should've just worn my usual shoes.

294
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,664
They hurt since I'm wearing new shoes.

295
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:42,094
Are you okay now?

296
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:48,102
- Goodness. What's wrong with my hair?
- We'll be late. Please hurry.

297
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:55,696
What if she tells us to buy a whole bunch
of things? It's not like we can say no.

298
00:26:56,188 --> 00:27:00,203
Yet, we can't say that we'll even
sell the house to prepare the gifts.

299
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,867
- We'll just have to say we can only do our best in our circumstances.
- Gosh!

300
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:06,739
They shouldn't make us buy
so many things when they

301
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:08,727
obviously know what kind
of situation we're in!

302
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:12,586
They're just doing this for
formality, aren't they?

303
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:17,219
They wouldn't actually expect anything
from a family like ours, would they?

304
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,266
Excuse me, miss.

305
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,727
- Are you referring to me?
- Why do you keep staring at me?

306
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:36,992
- Did I?
- Why are you eavesdropping and smiling? It's offensive.

307
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:43,211
I apologize if you were offended,
but please keep it down.

308
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:45,625
You're making other people
feel uncomfortable.

309
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:47,384
What?

310
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:55,180
Why? Am I not even allowed
to talk in hotel restrooms?

311
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,271
Your voice is too loud.

312
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:00,350
You're really offending me here.

313
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:04,443
This is just a restroom! Are
hotel restrooms so special?

314
00:28:04,693 --> 00:28:07,404
Mother, what's wrong? I'm
sorry if she offended you-

315
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:13,818
I'm nervous and sensitive already.
Just look at the way you speak to me!

316
00:28:14,397 --> 00:28:18,428
- Who are you trying to teach here?
- Are you done talking?

317
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:22,131
Do you think I'm done? I'll end it
here because I don't have time.

318
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:26,787
As a young woman, you should just let
it pass. Don't you have a mother?

319
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:29,037
How can you speak informally to me?

320
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:32,083
If you speak informally
to someone just because

321
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:34,467
you're older than them,
you'll be greatly humiliated.

322
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:39,006
You look like a rotten person.

323
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,420
- Excuse me?
- I said you look like a rotten person!

324
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,530
Let's go.

325
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:04,990
We're here. We're standing at the entrance.

326
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:08,490
I just arrived, too.

327
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,756
Let's go sit down.

328
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:37,146
It's nice to meet you. I'm
the second daughter-in-law.

329
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:41,291
I'm the younger sister
right under Hae-dang.

330
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:47,514
- I felt odd just coming alone, so I brought my mother-in-law with me.
- I thought so.

331
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:53,318
I'm sorry for having caused you so
much trouble when we've just met.

332
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,584
I've never had a reason to come
to places like this, so...

333
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,014
I think I behaved very
rudely to you earlier.

334
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:04,397
That's too bad.

335
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:09,920
"That's too bad?" What
an insolent way to talk.

336
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,717
What did you want to see us for?

337
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:18,842
I wanted to meet you because I was
curious about what you thought.

338
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,318
We don't really have an opinion.

339
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:27,600
We should do whatever your family
wants to the best of our ability.

340
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:32,482
Do you want us to take care of all
the wedding gifts by ourselves?

341
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,264
Well, no...

342
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:40,240
My grandmother-in-law had no
choice but to accept this

343
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:43,037
marriage, but that doesn't mean
we actually prize the bride.

344
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:47,920
Wouldn't it be too difficult
to get all the wedding

345
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:52,688
gifts for a woman who had
worked at a cabaret before?

346
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:58,318
We didn't actually wish for that...

347
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:06,467
We just heard you were a wealthy family,
so we were just saying it as a joke.

348
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,451
It doesn't mean anything.

349
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:14,928
We're going to do it to
the best of our ability.

350
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:17,592
By selling your house?

351
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:22,092
Isn't that you said earlier?

352
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,021
She's slightly tiring me out.

353
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:30,834
So what is it that you have to say to us?

354
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:35,263
Doesn't something come to your
mind when you heard our family

355
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:39,279
accepted a woman who had sang at a
cabaret as our daughter-in-law?

356
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:41,779
What comes to your mind?

357
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:49,357
To my father, Hyun-joon
is like a disowned child.

358
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:51,440
Are you serious?

359
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:57,740
The reason why he couldn't
get married so far

360
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:01,115
is because of his involvement with women.

361
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:06,756
He even said he meets any women himself.

362
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,467
Instead, he gets tired of them very easily.

363
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:14,303
What are you trying to say?

364
00:32:14,608 --> 00:32:19,155
He even broke off a wedding recently.
Did you hear about that?

365
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:25,295
We had allowed him to get engaged to that
woman because he loved her to death.

366
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:32,407
My grandmother-in-law gives into her
grandson's whims without even considering

367
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:36,600
the woman's feelings and grants him
permission for whatever he wants to do.

368
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:41,084
However, my father-in-law
is firmly against this.

369
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:48,811
So I'm not understanding your point.

370
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:53,584
We don't mind if you continue on
with this marriage as long as

371
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,326
you're okay with her getting
divorced with alimony later on.

372
00:32:58,764 --> 00:33:02,811
If you say that, how are
we supposed to reply?

373
00:33:03,084 --> 00:33:04,817
You can reply comfortably.

374
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,443
The way you're talking is extremely rude.

375
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:13,842
We have standards, too. We don't
just like anyone who is wealthy.

376
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:17,709
- Mother...
- Did I seem rude to you?

377
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:21,686
I was being as polite as I could.

378
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:25,315
Your family even accepted a woman
who had abandoned her own son.

379
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:32,080
- Did Yoo Ji-na send you here?
- That's not it.

380
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:37,107
Can you excuse us for a moment?

381
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:43,732
- Why?
- I think it would be better if I ended this conversation with the elder.

382
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:47,912
Okay, then. I'll be in the front.

383
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:05,029
My father-in-law asked
me to give this to you.

384
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,193
What's this? Does he want us to prepare
the wedding gifts with this money?

385
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,662
You can think comfortably.

386
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,045
Why do you keep telling
me to think comfortably?

387
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:17,482
- Goodness.
- It's a million dollars.

388
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,292
A million dollars?

389
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:26,061
A million dollar worth of wedding gifts?

390
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:30,835
You'll need at least a hundred thousand
dollars to prepare a watch as a wedding gift.

391
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:34,319
Really?

392
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:36,483
If you want to proceed
with this marriage, you

393
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,460
can use this money to
prepare the wedding gifts.

394
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:42,256
If you don't, you don't have
to return this money to us.

395
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:45,811
What do you mean by that...?

396
00:34:46,749 --> 00:34:51,787
My father-in-law told me that you
could consider this as compensation.

397
00:34:52,764 --> 00:34:55,443
- Compensation?
- I'll be leaving now.

398
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:09,217
Is she trying to tell us to take
this and never come around again?

399
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:20,271
Oh my gosh.

400
00:35:21,397 --> 00:35:22,857
Why are fuming?

401
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:25,757
I'm not going to go
anywhere with you anymore.

402
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:32,045
What? I followed you until I scraped
my heels, but how can you say that?

403
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,990
- Why would you start a fight in the restroom?
- I didn't know that was her!

404
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:38,170
And why did you accept the money?

405
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,827
Would I reject money she gave us
to prepare wedding gifts with?

406
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:42,326
That's not money for wedding gifts.

407
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:47,607
I don't care how wealthy they are. I can't
let Hae-dang get married into that family.

408
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:51,553
Let's go inside and talk. My
scraped heels are hurting so much!

409
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,936
Gosh! Ouch! That hurts!

410
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:02,779
Mother is driving me crazy.

411
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,607
How am I driving you crazy? If you don't
like it, you can just return the money.

412
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,521
Or else, we can buy
wedding gifts with this.

413
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:12,318
So his father is against this.

414
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:18,115
- Should we just take this money and end it?
- What?

415
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,936
Her mother-in-law is going
to be Yoo Ji-na, and

416
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,920
her sister-in-law seems
twice as worse than her.

417
00:36:26,522 --> 00:36:28,437
The only one Hae-dang can believe in is his

418
00:36:28,461 --> 00:36:30,632
grandmother, but how long do
you think she'll live for?

419
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,389
She's believing in Hyun-joon.

420
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:39,491
- Hyun-joon is a nice person... but he might be a player.
- A player?

421
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:44,678
He had a fiance, but he broke off the
wedding because he likes Hae-dang.

422
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,865
How could that happen? I never
knew he had that side of him.

423
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:57,084
Still... do we just accept this money?

424
00:36:57,202 --> 00:37:00,521
Are you crazy? If they're not going
to get married, we should return it.

425
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:03,421
She told us to just accept it. I
heard it with my own two ears.

426
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:05,568
- So you want me to accept this?
- Why not?

427
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:08,274
You're crazy when it comes to money.

428
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,447
You have nothing, so why are
you pretending to have pride?

429
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:15,934
If she gets a divorce, will she not accept
alimony because of pride? Is that smart?

430
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,936
You mean to say they'll get divorced?

431
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,710
If they get a divorce, do you think
this is all they'll give her?

432
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:22,429
What on earth are you saying?

433
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:27,123
Sometimes, people must be
humble when it comes to money.

434
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:32,090
If you used the money Hae-dang
made by suffering all

435
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:34,772
kinds of humiliation to
educate your other children

436
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,530
but will deny this money
without even considering it

437
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:40,234
for thirty minutes, that's
not pride but arrogance.

438
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:56,538
She didn't just throw this money at
you guys. She gave you guys a choice.

439
00:37:57,045 --> 00:37:59,904
That means their family
isn't that rude, right?

440
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:03,248
No. It means they're beyond rude.

441
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:07,919
If she's going to get married, then she'll
have to prepare this much wedding gits.

442
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:11,615
If she's not, then she'll just have to take
this money and never come near them again.

443
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,097
- Honey.
- What?

444
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:16,812
Even if it's the latter,
this is a huge sum of money,

445
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,728
so his father isn't such
a rude person after all.

446
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,350
You and your mother are crazy over money.

447
00:38:22,983 --> 00:38:24,967
Do you think we can make
this kind of money even

448
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:28,037
- if all of us work for the rest of our lives?
- What?

449
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:30,873
To be honest, if Hae-dang was my flesh and

450
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:33,320
blood, I would've told her
to accept this money.

451
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:35,771
How could she accept such insulting money?

452
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:38,920
There's no money in this world
that isn't insulting...

453
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:43,021
if you actually think about it.

454
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:44,943
You're really something.

455
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:54,566
- She's much more arrogant than I thought she was.
- Really?

456
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:59,803
She didn't even speak in a loud voice,
but she was looking down on me so much.

457
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:02,264
That must be what women of
wealthy families are like.

458
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:08,146
The ones who struggle to survive
are the unfair ones here.

459
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:21,967
Prior to Hae-dang, did you have a fiance?

460
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:26,709
How do you know about that?
Oh, did Hae-dang tell you?

461
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:30,654
If you had invited people to the wedding, you
should have taken responsibility for it.

462
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:33,318
I didn't want to lose Hae-dang.

463
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,779
I was always curious why
you hadn't gotten married

464
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,248
yet with your good looks
and wealthy family.

465
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,389
- Mr. Jung - I can understand it
if the man has a nice personality.

466
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:50,783
You can have complications with women
if you're too nice to reject them.

467
00:39:52,038 --> 00:39:55,420
That's not it. I'm not
nice to everyone either.

468
00:39:56,709 --> 00:40:00,561
We're both men, so it's not like I don't
understand your situation at all.

469
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,807
But as the father of a daughter, there's no

470
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:06,702
bigger reason for
disqualification than that.

471
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,959
Mr. Jung.

472
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:20,990
Na-kyung, are you really
going to be like this?

473
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:24,722
How can you do this without discussing with

474
00:40:24,746 --> 00:40:26,561
me first just because
my father told you to?

475
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:29,670
I did it good intentions.

476
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,264
I thought they would be troubled about
how to prepare the wedding gifts.

477
00:40:34,374 --> 00:40:35,374
Grandmother.

478
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:45,928
- She made me look like some awful kind of player.
- Tell Hae-dang to come here.

479
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:52,045
Give this to your family.

480
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,451
And just get married.

481
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:00,592
Wedding gifts? Don't even bring
a single pair of chopsticks.

482
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:02,615
We have plenty of them in our kitchen.

483
00:41:03,842 --> 00:41:04,842
Mrs. Sung...

484
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:06,717
Give it to your father.

485
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:09,787
Your future father-in-law
is overflowing with

486
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,732
money and wants to show
it off, so just take it.

487
00:41:17,077 --> 00:41:19,128
Didn't you think you would
at least benefit this

488
00:41:19,152 --> 00:41:20,889
much from getting married into this family?

489
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:23,998
Tell him there's no need for him to
pump gas at the gas station anymore.

490
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:29,389
Although we worked hard to earn money
and were always struggling financially,

491
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:34,186
we're not people who can comfortably
accept money for no reason.

492
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:38,607
Why is there no reason? I was thinking
of setting up his own gas station.

493
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,983
Seriously? Then set one
up for him right now.

494
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:47,396
Don't you worry. Just get married.
A gas station is nothing.

495
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,318
Then let's do this. Give this
petty money back to father.

496
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:56,264
- You can just set up a gas station for her father right now.
- All right.

497
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,464
I'll do that, so don't you worry.

498
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:14,740
- Isn't this great?
- Are you a little kid? Are you celebrating right now?

499
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:19,492
Don't worry. The only thing
my family has is money.

500
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:24,392
- Hyun-joon.
- I always felt bad that your father had to work outside

501
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,501
while sweating in the hot weather
without an air conditioner.

502
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:30,214
I'm thrilled thinking how my father-in-law

503
00:42:30,238 --> 00:42:32,538
will become the proud
owner of a gas station.

504
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:38,240
- You're being rejected by my family right now.
- Oh, that's right.

505
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:50,568
Kyung-soo, go cycling with me tomorrow.

506
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:54,295
I don't know how to ride a bike.

507
00:42:54,522 --> 00:42:58,732
I'll teach you. You'll feel much
better after you sweat outdoors.

508
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:05,771
Why aren't you answering? Your father
is about to take some time off for you.

509
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:11,639
Are you teasing your sons right now?

510
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:16,170
You've never even gone to a
ping-pong facility with them once.

511
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:24,803
- I'm going to use this.
- What's that?

512
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:28,105
The money you made Na-kyung
give Hae-dang's family.

513
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:33,533
They're not going to accept it, so I told
her not to prepare any wedding gifts.

514
00:43:33,784 --> 00:43:35,556
I told her to just bring herself.

515
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:41,603
- They didn't get your drift.
- What drift?

516
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,898
So? Can I use this or not?

517
00:43:48,104 --> 00:43:52,565
- You can use this.
- Thank you. I'll use it well.

518
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:58,353
I'll buy a car and jewelries for Hae-dang.

519
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,213
Are you going to drink again?

520
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:24,494
As long as Mrs. Sung insists, won't Hae-dang
be getting married into this family?

521
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:27,823
Who could lose against that old woman?

522
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:32,291
I think we'll need a fatal blow.

523
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:35,666
They're indigent people, so
they don't understand when

524
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,947
we're trying to knock them
down in a glamorous way.

525
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:40,229
Then what will you do?

526
00:44:40,253 --> 00:44:42,307
If they can't be knocked
down in a glamorous way,

527
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:44,424
they'll have to be knocked
down in an explicit way.

528
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,142
Please do something about her. I'm
going to become neurotic at this rate.

529
00:44:50,573 --> 00:44:52,306
We need to cheer you up.

530
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,916
By the way, about my
friend from last time...

531
00:44:58,845 --> 00:45:01,088
- What friend?
- My friend from church.

532
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:05,681
Oh, him?

533
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:09,189
He said he'll buy us lunch.
Tomorrow is Sunday, you know.

534
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Really?

535
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:16,072
What should I do? You must be preoccupied.
Should I refuse?

536
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:19,892
I'm not sure. What should we do?

537
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:22,455
Let's just refuse. It's okay.

538
00:45:23,315 --> 00:45:27,267
Still, he's a busy person,
and yet, he contacted you...

539
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:33,189
That's true. Normally, he
wouldn't have contacted me.

540
00:45:34,502 --> 00:45:38,400
He must have truly been your
fan ever since he was younger.

541
00:45:41,057 --> 00:45:42,096
What should we do?

542
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:47,373
Go out with me and have lunch. We'll
be together, so what's the problem?

543
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,236
That's true. Then should we do that?

544
00:45:55,955 --> 00:45:57,314
You must dress nicely.

545
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,103
It would be a bit funny
if I made a big fuss.

546
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:02,221
Is that so?

547
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:08,174
You're beautiful no matter what you wear.

548
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:48,228
Let me officially introduce myself.
It's an honor to meet you.

549
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,494
Why are you smiling by yourself in the
dressing room in the middle of the night?

550
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:07,213
I'm not smiling.

551
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:10,174
I'm just organizing my clothes.

552
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:25,471
- She fell for it.
- Be careful.

553
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:30,080
They say celebrities are more
naive than you think they are.

554
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:32,270
You're confident in this, aren't you?

555
00:47:33,463 --> 00:47:34,463
Just trust me.

556
00:48:17,877 --> 00:48:22,072
- What are you doing?
- You surprised me. Why did you wake up?

557
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,017
To use the bathroom.

558
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:30,424
But why have you kept being restless
over clothes ever since earlier?

559
00:48:30,931 --> 00:48:37,377
Well... I'm eating lunch with Na-kyung
tomorrow, but I couldn't decide what to wear.

560
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:42,596
I know you don't have friends, so I won't
stop you from hanging out with Na-kyung.

561
00:48:43,284 --> 00:48:45,056
However, you need to be careful with her.

562
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:47,730
I'm being careful, so don't worry.

563
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:37,775
How can a man like you sit in front
of the piano the entire day?

564
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,518
Here.

565
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:43,432
Change into this.

566
00:49:57,276 --> 00:50:03,744
Let's practice here. Men learn quickly.
Get on first.

567
00:50:12,322 --> 00:50:14,205
First, step on the peddle.

568
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:19,103
If you decrease your speed, you might
stumble, which will cause you to fall.

569
00:50:19,971 --> 00:50:21,689
- Okay.
- I'll hold onto you.

570
00:50:28,643 --> 00:50:29,643
Okay. Let's go.

571
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:53,392
If you started, you must pedal quickly.
Or else, you'll fall.

572
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:56,619
Okay. Let's try it again.

573
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:07,705
Okay. One, two, three. Go!

574
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:09,814
Yes! Step on it!

575
00:51:10,322 --> 00:51:13,197
Good! Harder! Harder! Harder! That's it!

576
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:16,674
The handle! Be careful of the handles!
Look forward!

577
00:51:19,088 --> 00:51:20,555
That's it! You got it!

578
00:51:23,643 --> 00:51:26,314
Yes! Step on it!

579
00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:36,330
Mother, your eyeliner is a bit smudged.
You need to fix it.

580
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,611
Really? I'll go check
in the restroom mirror.

581
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:41,603
No, I'll do it for you.

582
00:51:46,174 --> 00:51:47,752
- Done.
- Done?

583
00:51:48,518 --> 00:51:50,627
Let's go in. You look very beautiful.

584
00:51:58,987 --> 00:51:59,987
Hello.

585
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:04,484
I hope we haven't pestered
you into making time for us.

586
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,799
If I make time for everyone who pesters me,
then I'll be meeting people all the time.

587
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:12,416
I was the one who pestered
Na-kyung so that I could see you.

588
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:14,550
Have you been well?

589
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:24,439
Come on! Look at me, too!
Aren't you being too much?

590
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:29,877
The dress you wore today
looks perfect on you.

591
00:52:41,189 --> 00:52:44,760
Celebrities don't really have the chance
to meet people from diverse fields.

592
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:47,236
What was your first impression of me?

593
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:52,603
I can't find anyone like you
in the entertainment field.

594
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:56,564
That's why I was a bit... how
do you say it? Cautious?

595
00:52:56,987 --> 00:53:00,049
- Do I make you uncomfortable?
- No, that's not it.

596
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:05,119
One of the singers I know
married a fund manager.

597
00:53:06,776 --> 00:53:09,039
She said they had started to
dated because his forearms

598
00:53:09,063 --> 00:53:11,002
were attractive when his
sleeves were rolled up.

599
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:14,493
- Really?
- She saw him ruthlessly making files with

600
00:53:14,517 --> 00:53:17,057
the sleeves of his white
dress shirt rolled up,

601
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:19,939
and his forearms had looked really sexy.

602
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:23,385
You tell fun stories.

603
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:26,244
I mean we're weak in those areas.

604
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:29,212
You have an honest and modest
personality with a glamorous beauty.

605
00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:33,025
- She's totally my style. What do I do?
- What will you do?

606
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,431
What if my life becomes exhausting now?

607
00:53:37,627 --> 00:53:40,330
I'm going to use the restroom.
You two can continue your chat.

608
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:52,780
Is it awkward because it's just us two?

609
00:53:53,682 --> 00:53:55,494
No. It's not like that.

610
00:53:56,315 --> 00:53:59,291
You should be awkward,
but you're rather calm.

611
00:54:02,174 --> 00:54:05,510
Can you give me your number?

612
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:11,103
If you need to contact me, can't
you do it through Na-kyung?

613
00:54:12,276 --> 00:54:14,385
Should I? Would that be
more comfortable for you?

614
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:20,285
Photography is my hobby. I
was going to send you some

615
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:23,464
photos I took, but if it's
uncomfortable, that's okay.

616
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:28,541
Well... I'm not uncomfortable...

617
00:54:46,253 --> 00:54:47,253
Here you go.

618
00:54:50,597 --> 00:54:52,127
Why are you coming back so quickly?

619
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:58,003
- What were you two talking about?
- Bad things about you, of course.

620
00:54:58,027 --> 00:55:00,247
I knew it. What kind of
bad things did you say?

621
00:55:00,948 --> 00:55:02,963
That I am so well-behaved
to the point I am cute?

622
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,134
You're not the cute style.

623
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,042
She was cute in her school days.
Kind of dense and cute?

624
00:55:10,331 --> 00:55:13,151
- I was dense?
- You're dense now, too.

625
00:55:19,354 --> 00:55:22,948
You've gone back to being a college
student since you've met an old friend.

626
00:55:24,339 --> 00:55:26,338
It's nice and comfortable
to see you like this.

627
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:30,956
Really? Then how about the three of us
meet up and eat lunch together sometimes?

628
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:33,300
We're going to leave you out next time.

629
00:55:33,324 --> 00:55:35,678
You better not! I'm going
to break down into tears!

630
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:48,291
Hey, you little punk! Is
that how fast you can go?

631
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:51,260
Follow me! Catch up to me!

632
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:57,456
Step on it!

633
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:10,894
It's hard, isn't it?

634
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:15,065
It feels very refreshing.

635
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:23,174
To be honest, it's the first time I
came out to exercise with my son.

636
00:56:25,206 --> 00:56:29,893
I've never done this with
Hyun-joon or Hyun-sung before.

637
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:37,546
You probably didn't know what
having a father is like,

638
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:41,447
but I didn't know what it is
like to have a son either.

639
00:56:43,115 --> 00:56:44,115
Is that so?

640
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:51,364
You need to go around with your sons,
sweat it out, and fall together...

641
00:56:53,263 --> 00:56:55,115
in order to know what
it is like to have one.

642
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:04,599
- Let's drink some water.
- I'll bring it.

643
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:30,786
You must always be careful on the streets
where a car can appear any minute.

644
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,653
- I'm sorry.
- You almost got hurt.

645
00:57:34,209 --> 00:57:36,903
You almost got hurt because of me.

646
00:57:38,076 --> 00:57:39,076
Stand up.

647
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:49,708
You could have gotten hurt.
Why did you do that?

648
00:57:50,177 --> 00:57:54,036
All I thought of was how
I had to protect you.

649
00:57:55,584 --> 00:57:58,763
All I thought of was how I
couldn't let you get hurt.

650
00:58:02,169 --> 00:58:04,369
Brush the grass off my back, too.

651
00:58:30,404 --> 00:58:32,356
Your posture makes you
look like you're in PGA.

652
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:36,226
Isn't your weight resting
too much on your right leg?

653
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:45,173
Isn't father being too much?

654
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,317
How could he go cycling with Kyung-soo?

655
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,380
Has he ever taken us to play sports before?

656
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,458
He's just trying to rub salt in our wounds.

657
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:14,763
- Did you have a good time today?
- Yes. It was comfortable and nice.

658
00:59:15,974 --> 00:59:19,950
At home, you seem like a
robot, but today, you seemed

659
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:23,996
like my younger sister and
not my daughter-in-law.

660
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:28,060
To be frank, I'm at an age to be your
sister, not your daughter-in-law.

661
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:33,591
That's true. Anyways, thanks to you, I was
able to cheer up. I had a great time.

662
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:07,747
Men do not obtain love through the heart.

663
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:11,239
You obtain it through power.

664
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:16,130
That's also the least you could
do for the woman you love.

665
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:19,373
Really?

666
01:00:19,966 --> 01:00:23,825
Of course, women are drawn
to emotions at first, but

667
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:29,434
eventually, they go to men who
have the power to protect them.

668
01:00:33,856 --> 01:00:37,302
That's one of the loveable
points of women as well.

669
01:00:39,107 --> 01:00:42,528
If you want to obtain the woman
you love, you must gain power.

670
01:00:43,951 --> 01:00:50,341
A man's love will reach its limits
if he only depends on romance.

671
01:00:54,677 --> 01:00:55,677
Let's go.

672
01:01:04,888 --> 01:01:06,270
It's very hot today.

673
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:10,294
Yes, it is.

674
01:01:17,275 --> 01:01:18,724
(Im Cheol-woo)

675
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:33,435
Where did he get this photo?

676
01:01:35,341 --> 01:01:36,528
Did he have it?

677
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:40,193
No way.

678
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:43,927
"The Perfect Woman."

679
01:01:54,762 --> 01:01:55,949
Why are you so surprised?

680
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:20,025
Kyung-soo has decided to enter college
in the business administration major.

681
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:25,223
Is that true?

682
01:02:26,754 --> 01:02:29,863
Oh, Kyung-soo. You made the right choice.

683
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:34,508
So Na-kyung, take responsibility
and find out what Kyung-soo

684
01:02:34,532 --> 01:02:38,248
needs to do in order to enter
school in his situation.

685
01:02:40,311 --> 01:02:43,560
Weren't you going to focus
on music, Kyung-soo?

686
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:45,944
What on earth is this suddenly all about?

687
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,569
It didn't happen suddenly.

688
01:02:48,467 --> 01:02:53,748
While cycling, we talked a lot
and discussed about the future.

689
01:02:54,952 --> 01:02:56,733
That's how we came to this decision.

690
01:02:57,249 --> 01:03:01,350
Don't be ridiculous! What kind
of funny business is this?

691
01:03:01,764 --> 01:03:04,794
What do you mean "funny business?"
Please watch what you say.

692
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:09,287
- You look undignified in front of your grandchildren.
- What? Dignity?

693
01:03:09,678 --> 01:03:11,998
Kyung-soo, I need to talk to you.

694
01:03:14,897 --> 01:03:17,022
If you need to say something
to him, say it here.

695
01:03:17,717 --> 01:03:19,670
There's no need for you
to get up, Kyung-soo.

696
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,773
Are you really going to do this?

697
01:03:23,797 --> 01:03:26,787
What are you so jealous about
that your face turned pale?

698
01:03:28,046 --> 01:03:29,046
I'm jealous?

699
01:03:29,155 --> 01:03:31,796
Why? If your little brother is
going to start his studies,

700
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,146
it's your duty as his older
brother to help him out.

701
01:03:34,749 --> 01:03:36,943
What would you want to
speak to him alone about?

702
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:38,428
You stay out of this.

703
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:44,225
Until when will you regard
her as "you" in front of me?

704
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:46,240
Until the day I die. You happy?

705
01:03:46,538 --> 01:03:50,506
You need to broaden your mind.
You're so petty.

706
01:03:51,967 --> 01:03:55,147
Are you really doing this because
you're jealous, just like she said?

707
01:03:55,404 --> 01:03:59,506
Who would get jealous about not
receiving love from someone like you?

708
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:03,240
- Then what's wrong with your attitude?
- I told you to stay out of this!

709
01:04:03,397 --> 01:04:05,397
How dare you keep speaking
informally to me!

710
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:08,881
Don't you dare shout at me with
your vulgar mouth again unless

711
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:14,131
you want to end your life. Do
you understand, Yoo Ji-na?

712
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:18,287
Who are you to end my life?

713
01:04:19,444 --> 01:04:21,865
Go ahead! Try it then!

714
01:04:22,116 --> 01:04:24,404
I told you to shut that
vulgar mouth of yours!

715
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,920
I might not go to college. If
you tell me not to, I won't.

716
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:34,819
However, do not act disrespectfully to Mrs.
Yoo Ji-na in front of me ever again.

717
01:04:35,178 --> 01:04:37,567
- What?
- No matter how much you despise her, she's your

718
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:40,061
step-mother, so how could you
treat her so disrespectfully?

719
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:44,341
The least you can do is treat
her with some respect.

720
01:04:45,655 --> 01:04:49,100
I dread becoming disappointed by you.

721
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:51,001
You dread becoming disappointed by me?

722
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:54,092
What will you do if you get disappointed?

723
01:04:54,835 --> 01:04:57,342
I've already been disappointed
by you many times.

724
01:04:58,233 --> 01:05:00,717
How can you talk about respect to me?

725
01:05:01,717 --> 01:05:06,061
How can you talk about respect when
you think about my late mother?

726
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:11,358
That's my problem. I'm the
ungrateful bastard here.

727
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:15,897
That's not a reason for you
treat her with disrespect.

728
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:20,171
Are you curious about why I treat
your mother with disrespect?

729
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:27,037
You just hate her because she's
being loved by Mr. Park!

730
01:05:27,186 --> 01:05:33,358
Far from it. You wait right here. Don't
go anywhere and wait for me here.

731
01:06:04,249 --> 01:06:07,014
Oh my goodness! What's this?

732
01:06:09,194 --> 01:06:12,295
Are these the photos from when they
had gone to the countryside together?

733
01:06:14,366 --> 01:06:18,739
Oh my goodness. You two
hadn't just gone for a drive?

734
01:06:19,749 --> 01:06:23,037
Park Hyun-joon knows very well
that nothing happened that night.

735
01:06:23,874 --> 01:06:27,404
He had purposely put me in a
trap to take these photos.

736
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:30,897
Not everyone falls into a trap. You
fell into it because you're you.

737
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:35,045
This happened, and yet, you two
got married? You are crazy!

738
01:06:46,483 --> 01:06:50,936
Now do you realize why I
disrespect your mother?

739
01:06:55,350 --> 01:07:01,162
The moment I expose these photos to
the world, it's over for your mother.

740
01:07:01,952 --> 01:07:04,715
Before I call the reporters
and expose this to

741
01:07:05,709 --> 01:07:07,717
them, hand over the letter
and leave this house.

742
01:07:08,632 --> 01:07:10,407
Disappear from our family.

743
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:15,342
Give me that letter right
now and leave this house!

744
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,163
("You Are Too Much")

745
01:07:53,187 --> 01:07:55,733
Kyung-soo and I only have you.

746
01:07:55,757 --> 01:07:57,821
Your father is in the palm of my hand.

747
01:07:57,845 --> 01:08:01,758
If you think it's so unfair, blame your
mother who had begged for your father's love.

748
01:08:01,782 --> 01:08:04,140
- It's me. You need to speed things up.
- Who is it?

749
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,372
- Stop the car!
- Where are you going?

750
01:08:06,396 --> 01:08:08,921
Go ahead and marry Jung Hae-dang.
Instead, give me the film.

751
01:08:08,945 --> 01:08:10,758
How did you let such photos be taken?

752
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:12,985
How about Kyung-soo goes
to a theological college?

753
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:16,561
How could I live with the woman
I love as my sister-in-law?

754
01:08:16,896 --> 01:08:19,498
You can do it because you've become my son.

755
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:22,764
- What kind of friend is she meeting until so late?
- I don't know.

756
01:08:22,921 --> 01:08:24,388
Did you take a shower?
