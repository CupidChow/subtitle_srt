<i>[Episode 17]</i>

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,640
<i>I recently heard</i>

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,640
that my friend,
Lee Kyung Soo, had surgery.

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,440
Wh... Wh... What kind of surgery?

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,150
I heard he had cornea transplant
surgery and that the results were good.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:48,070
That means that he
will be able to see you.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,270
He said your voice is
the same as his mom's

9
00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:00,560
and now he can see if your face
is the same with his own eyes.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,100
<i>Tears again even when I’m in love.
Goodbye to those nothing memories.</i>

11
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,180
<i>I’ll forget them all.</i>

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,350
<i>It was such a useless connection.
I have never been happy before.</i>

13
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:24,540
<i>I cried every night. Drunkenly
holding on to it, asking how I can live.</i>

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,590
<i>But what use is it to ask? There’s
only the typical answer, “Cheer up!”</i>

15
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,780
<i>That means he will be able to see you.</i>

16
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:01,370
Now all we have to do is find
Lee Kyung Soo, but it won't be easy.

17
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,180
You made sure the people we were in
contact with will keep their mouths shut

18
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,400
even if someone else were
to ask them about it, right?

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,860
Of course.

20
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,360
The check we sent as a thank you must
have been an unimaginable amount

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,990
because their mouths were wide
open. I told them not to worry.

22
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,190
I think Father has
already taken measures.

23
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,190
We were one step too far behind.

24
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,910
We must still find another way.

25
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,050
Why haven't we seen that
wench at the other house?

26
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,090
She doesn't leave the house at
all when she has no appointments.

27
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,430
What's going on with her?

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,380
I'm not sure.

29
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,130
Don't turn on the lights!

30
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you shutting yourself in here
and not eating

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,720
because you're angry I forced
you to announce the engagement?

32
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,050
- No.
- Then what is it?

33
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,350
For someone who already has what he wants
and is waiting to just get sick of it

34
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,840
why does it matter?

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,910
Is it because you're afraid that I might
throw you away after I get sick of you?

36
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,520
Mind your own business and get out.

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,800
Even if you do get abandoned,
you still need to eat.

38
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,090
For someone who is going to the police,
you should worry about yourself.

39
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,990
You believe what Hyun Joon said?

40
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,280
Should I believe you then?

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,470
Don't worry. I don't know
about anyone else

42
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,910
but I will not be crushed by my own son.

43
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,260
So, get up and eat.

44
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,740
No matter what happens...
Are you going to protect me?

45
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,090
It's not like you announced our
engagement just to cause trouble for me.

46
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:22,050
I have no time to argue with you.

47
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,250
What's going on?

48
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,240
What are you going to do
if the child shows up?

49
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,310
Did you hear news about the child?

50
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,850
I asked you if you're
going to protect me!

51
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,420
You still don't understand
how I feel about you?

52
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,640
You think I would have you
announce our engagement

53
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,060
just to cause trouble for you?

54
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,990
What are you doing here?

55
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,680
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?

56
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,500
I got in because someone
opened the door for me.

57
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,780
Why aren't you coming in?

58
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,590
I'm taking lessons now.

59
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,510
Come this way.

60
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,860
- I look forward to working with you.
- Me too.

61
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,600
Please tell me about yourself.

62
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,680
What would you like me to tell you?

63
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,750
Anything is fine.

64
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,420
There is not much to tell you.

65
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,160
I heard that you learned piano
from your mother. Is that true?

66
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,440
- That's right.
- What does your father do?

67
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,260
I don't really like talking
about personal matters.

68
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,120
- Why?
- I'm naturally a defensive person.

69
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,580
I'm someone who doesn't like
to make people feel uncomfortable

70
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,070
so you can treat me
like I'm your older sister.

71
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,100
How come you suddenly became
uncomfortable with Yoo Ji Na?

72
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,180
We're not uncomfortable with each other.

73
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,080
It seemed like she was unavailable

74
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,910
to take lessons anymore
because she got so busy.

75
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,540
I don't think she's that busy.

76
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,090
Where is the piano?

77
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,840
It's in my room.

78
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,320
Which way is the room?

79
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,450
Did you drop anything in the yard today?

80
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,500
Why are you asking me that?

81
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,460
No reason in particular.

82
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,760
I was going to help you search
for it when I clean the yard.

83
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,050
I will ask for help when I need it.

84
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,010
<i>There is something unsettling about him.</i>

85
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
Let's talk.

86
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,270
Quit giving lessons to her.

87
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,780
- Why?
- I can give you the money!

88
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,200
I don't need that kind of money.

89
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,680
Are you saying that you're going
to keep coming to this house?

90
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,980
It has nothing to do with you.

91
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,880
You can't talk about
Lee Kyung Soo with them at all.

92
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,940
Please.

93
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,230
You're going to do
this favor for me, right?

94
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,990
Why are you not answering?

95
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,330
You said he's your best friend's son.
What are you so afraid of?

96
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:55,220
What should I do if Lee Kyung Soo
says he wants to meet you?

97
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,180
- What?
- Why don't you meet him once

98
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,850
since he's your best friend's son?

99
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,550
Did you...

100
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,510
talk about me?

101
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,750
I wasn't going to

102
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,800
but since you said he's your friend's
son, I didn't think it would matter.

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,630
I told you not to!

104
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,620
I even told him that you said
that he was your friend's son.

105
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,870
- What?
- I think

106
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,400
he wants to meet you.

107
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,000
What do you think?

108
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,430
Were you scared?

109
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,810
- Yes.
- Even though you can't see?

110
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,200
I felt something in front of me.

111
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,970
- You can feel that?
- Were you trying to see

112
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,400
if I would get scared or not?

113
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,630
I mean... I didn't do it on purpose.

114
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,230
Why did you go to the other house?
Did Yoo Ji Na want to see you?

115
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,200
I went to go say hi.

116
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,900
- Is that so?
- Bye.

117
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,180
<i>I don't think he is blind.</i>

118
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,010
I didn't even ask for you.
What's going on?

119
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,220
Why did you want
to see Yoon Sung Ha again?

120
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,660
You are very nosy.

121
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,160
I'm just a very curious person.

122
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I needed to give him
something, that's all.

123
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,130
He told me that he just wanted to say hi.

124
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,400
The two stories are different.

125
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,740
Why do you care so much
when it doesn't even matter?

126
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,140
It's tiring.

127
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,900
It's funny that both of you
are telling me different stories

128
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,450
when it's not a big deal.

129
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,150
It's funny?

130
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,040
Is it about your mom?

131
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,540
Remember when I told you
I went to my sponsor's house?

132
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,240
Yeah, I remember.

133
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,150
I've been going there
to give piano lessons

134
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,680
and I've been pretending
that I can't see.

135
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,020
- Why?
- I thought if I pretended to be blind

136
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:13,470
it would lower any suspicions they might
have that I was looking for something.

137
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,110
- But?
- I think they found out.

138
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,940
Really?

139
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:27,760
In unrelated news,
I will be on TV tomorrow.

140
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,470
Already?

141
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,340
Sorry. I've been so
occupied with other things.

142
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,320
I'll do my best.

143
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,450
Of course. I know you'll do your best.

144
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,150
<i>Today, you will think that you are
seeing the young Yoo Ji Na again.</i>

145
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,100
<i>I introduce you to Yoo Ji Na's
impersonator, Yoo Jui Na!</i>

146
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,350
A round of applause please!

147
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,190
She's on! She's on! Hae Dang is on TV!

148
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,220
She's on! She's really on!

149
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,090
Why am I so nervous?

150
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,490
<i>Tears again even when I’m in love.
Goodbye to those nothing memories.</i>

151
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,550
<i>I’ll forget them all.</i>

152
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:43,490
<i>But what use is it to ask? There’s
only the typical answer, “Cheer up!”</i>

153
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,690
It's over? It ended so quickly...

154
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,240
It was fun!

155
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,980
It was fun! Wouldn't you say it was fun?

156
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,670
Something felt a little off...

157
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,800
No... It was fun. It was fun...

158
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,200
Are you sure that this program is
a program she should have been on?

159
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,760
I was a little embarrassed watching it.

160
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,140
- Don't say that when Hae Dang comes in.
- Of course not.

161
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,680
It's hard to make it the first time.

162
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,970
I don't think that was right.

163
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,430
I think the audience felt
a little awkward too...

164
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,740
Let's look at the comments
on the internet!

165
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,720
We might just be acting extra
sensitive because we're family.

166
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,350
You think so? Then, hurry and go check!

167
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,130
Okay! Okay!

168
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,660
Mom, you're going too?

169
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,030
<i>[She really has two left feet.
You call this a variety show?]</i>

170
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,000
What are people saying?

171
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,120
I don't think Hae Dang should see this.

172
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,960
Why? Is it not good?

173
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,060
"Why are they playing
soccer on a basketball court?"

174
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,550
"I almost died from cringing."

175
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,150
I almost died from cringing?

176
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,960
Someone said the stage
suddenly became a night club.

177
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,230
What?

178
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,700
I think she should've been
on a music program.

179
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,400
Poor Hae Dang...

180
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,030
<i>[I never knew that variety
could be this entertaining!]</i>

181
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:33,080
It's not like she is their worst enemy...
Why are they attacking her so hard?

182
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,580
I don't think Jung Hae Dang
should see this.

183
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,100
She really tried hard.

184
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,680
I think we took this too lightly.

185
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,890
What are you doing here?

186
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,110
I just want to hide in a corner.

187
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,540
Things don't always
go right the first time.

188
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,850
Being on television is not the same
thing as a night club performance...

189
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,410
I think I was being presumptuous.

190
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,200
Did you read the comments?

191
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,740
"The young Yoo Ji Na is back?"

192
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,460
"The producers have
gone crazy to cast her."

193
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,950
"This is a disgrace to Yoo Ji Na."

194
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,340
"She belongs in a night club."

195
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,670
Stop it. This is all my fault.

196
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,360
I was getting ahead of myself
and didn't prepare enough.

197
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,190
I rushed things. I should've had
you appear on a music show.

198
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

199
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,020
<i>[How does she expect to become a singer?]
[You call this a variety show?]</i>

200
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,920
She probably got a sense of what
broadcasting programs are like now.

201
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,130
I asked your fans to help write
hateful comments as you requested

202
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,350
but I don't feel good about what I did.

203
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,210
Why would you feel bad?

204
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,750
If she can't even handle this,
how is she going to continue?

205
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,690
But people who are meant
to survive will survive.

206
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,300
I hear a thorn in your voice.

207
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,840
I'm not worried about her.

208
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,460
I'm concerned about who you are becoming.

209
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,240
<i>This phone is currently turned off.</i>

210
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,230
Hurry so we can feed her
as soon as she comes in.

211
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,510
She loves hand-cut
noodle soup with chicken.

212
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,210
Should I go check on the broth?

213
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,170
Yeah and make sure
to scoop out the chicken fat.

214
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,470
She hates when the fat
is floating in the soup.

215
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,120
Yes, Mother.

216
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,720
How is it? It has to be a little spicy.
She likes it a little spicy.

217
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,220
I think it's perfect for her.

218
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,470
You're cooking rice too, right?

219
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,500
- We're eating noodles.
- Stress might not make her feel well

220
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,410
so she might not digest the flour
very well. So, we can give her rice.

221
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,280
- What side dishes should we prepare?
- Do we have perilla leaves?

222
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,940
She can eat a whole bowl
of rice with just perilla leaves.

223
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,650
Perilla leaves? Perilla leaves?

224
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,890
We have perilla leaves!

225
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,760
- Thank goodness.
- Hurry up and wash them!

226
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,620
You want a full stomach
when you're upset.

227
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,400
We're going to prepare a feast
for her and feed her well.

228
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,270
What should I do?

229
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,220
- Just keep talking when she comes in.
- Keep talking?

230
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,960
Just talk about anything to keep her
from thinking about how upset she is.

231
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,280
Oh... Okay.

232
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,840
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to wait outside.

233
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,740
Are you trying to make her cry?

234
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,960
It's better to act like
everything is normal.

235
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,020
You think so? You're right.

236
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,020
Hae Dang!

237
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,530
Geez. Geez.

238
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,200
We made hand-cut noodle soup
with chicken. Your favorite!

239
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,820
You made it at this hour?

240
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,800
We really enjoyed watching you
on TV today. It was so much fun!

241
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,890
I have never seen
anything so entertaining!

242
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,840
I agree! You did really well for
someone on TV for the first time.

243
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,000
I really enjoyed it too!

244
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,370
You think just anyone appears on TV?

245
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,670
Hae Dang, congratulations
on your TV debut!

246
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,260
Let's celebrate it by eating
some hand-cut noodle soup!

247
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,210
Thank you.

248
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,350
We made this a little spicy.

249
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,860
If your stomach doesn't
feel good, we also have rice.

250
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,240
Thank you.

251
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
You are very photogenic.

252
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,900
Don't you agree?

253
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,850
You're right! Hae Dang resembles me.

254
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,770
Her small face looked really
great and pretty on TV!

255
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:35,730
When you appeared on TV, I was
so nervous I didn't know what to do.

256
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:42,060
My heart was racing and I wanted
to hide under the blanket and...

257
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,960
I mean... I didn't want to do that.

258
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,100
It was so cool to see my family on TV

259
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,030
I didn't know what to do with myself!

260
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,900
It would have been better
if the results were better.

261
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,690
Not at all! We enjoyed it.

262
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,530
It was fun. It was fun, right?

263
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,990
- Yeah!
- Yeah! It was so much fun!

264
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,800
- The best! The best!
- Yeah! Yeah!

265
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,110
As long as we enjoyed it,
that's all that matters.

266
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,870
Of course! Of course!

267
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,710
Now that I've experienced this

268
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,880
I bet when celebrity family members die

269
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,750
they find lots of crystals in their body!

270
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,660
Why crystals?

271
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,410
Did you read the comments?

272
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,790
- No! Of course not!
- No! We didn't read them!

273
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,900
Nobody read them. Why would we
read them? Did you read them?

274
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,230
Am I crazy? Why would I read them?

275
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,980
If she didn't read them, nobody did.
Don't worry about it.

276
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,080
Does the soup taste good?

277
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,440
Yes.

278
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,860
Why are you crying?

279
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,740
Thank you, everyone.

280
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,380
There is no need to cry.
There are better reasons to cry.

281
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,360
This is only the beginning.

282
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,510
I realized that celebrities
must have thick skins.

283
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,120
She's right.

284
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,090
You become stronger as you
face and endure the storms.

285
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,900
- I believe in my daughter!
- Me too!

286
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,170
- Me too!
- I believe in you completely!

287
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,260
- Hae Dang, you can do it!
- Hae Dang, you can do it!

288
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,440
I believe in you too! You can do it!

289
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,150
You can do it!

290
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,250
- Of course she can.
- I totally believe in you.

291
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,070
I believe in you too.

292
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,010
Go ahead and eat.

293
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,010
- Let's eat.
- The food tastes good.

294
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,660
<i>I think he wants to meet you.</i>

295
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,770
<i>What do you think?</i>

296
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,360
- What's going on?
<i>- I have something to say.</i>

297
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,900
It's important.

298
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,670
I'll send the car over.
Come out and meet me.

299
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:18,210
How does the blind child know
you're Kim Hae Jung? How did he find you?

300
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,200
He might have had surgery.

301
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,630
I show up on TV all the time.

302
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,120
If he's not dumb,
why wouldn't he be able to?

303
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,090
If he really wanted to, he would
come find me right now.

304
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,310
If the child shows up,
what are you going to do?

305
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,650
Or should I ask it this way?

306
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,990
What are you going to do

307
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,810
if the child tells the whole
world that I abandoned him...

308
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:55,730
as a way to get me back
for what I did to him?

309
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,610
I would stop him.

310
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,990
- How are you going to stop him?
- Whatever I have to do to stop him.

311
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,340
Don't worry.

312
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,660
No matter what happens,
I will protect you.

313
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,220
Do you have the power to protect me?

314
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,040
I told you, it's not easy
to bring me down.

315
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,530
I wouldn't be I am today if
I were an easy person to take down.

316
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,580
No matter what happens,
I have the power to protect you.

317
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,440
Do you...

318
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,740
still love me?

319
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:53,610
Even after I found out everything
about you, I did not abandon you.

320
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,190
The reason why I forced you
to announce our engagement...

321
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,890
was not to make you mine.

322
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,540
It was to protect you.

323
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,580
Because I love you.

324
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,240
Why... do you like me so much?

325
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,800
At first, it was out of curiosity and
longing to find a woman like you.

326
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,910
But now I understand that you
did all that to survive.

327
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,500
I don't know if it's because
you and I are so similar

328
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,240
but I can't control my feelings for you.

329
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:47,410
My feelings can make me go crazy

330
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:52,300
but they will not make me
sick of you or let me abandon you.

331
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,170
Hug me.

332
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,760
You're the only person I have now.

333
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,730
I knew there would come a time

334
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,810
when you would say those words.

335
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,130
I'm only going to look
at you from now on.

336
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,870
I'll only look at you.

337
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,400
Yoo Ji Na, it's been a long
time since you came over.

338
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,470
Why are you addressing her as Yoo Ji Na?
She'll be your mother-in-law soon.

339
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:20,940
You haven't eaten properly the last
few days, so chew slowly and carefully.

340
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,340
I'll take care of myself.
Don't worry about me.

341
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,330
Actually, it'll be better for you
to eat porridge instead.

342
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,510
It's a hassle, but what can you do?
We don't want her to be sick.

343
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,500
Okay. I'll go ahead and prepare it.

344
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,280
Get up.

345
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,140
Get up now and go to the other house.

346
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,020
Don't come anywhere near here again.

347
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,770
- Mother!
- This whole time

348
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,480
I have let you eat with us
because you were a friend.

349
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,190
She's going to be your daughter-in-law!

350
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,550
That's why I can't eat at
the same dinner table as her!

351
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,680
An elder told you to stand up.
Why are you just sitting there?

352
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,900
Mother. Let me see you for a minute.

353
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,710
You want to be the head of this household

354
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,580
after you went on vacation with him?

355
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,690
I'll say it again. Nothing happened.

356
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,040
Does it matter if something
happened or not?

357
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,040
80 years I have lived my life and
I have never seen anything like you!

358
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,400
Starting tomorrow morning,
prepare bread for breakfast.

359
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,360
I have to eat bread and
vegetables in the morning.

360
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,990
Grandmother has to eat
rice in the morning.

361
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,190
Then, you can set it up in her room.

362
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,960
What is this wench saying?

363
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,820
I'm going to marry Chairman Park.

364
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,280
I'm not some mistress
hiding in the other house.

365
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,770
Why wouldn't I be able
to eat with the family?

366
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,290
- What did you say?
- Either eat bread with us here

367
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:07,450
or if you don't like that, you will
have to eat in your room, Mother.

368
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,510
Mother?

369
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:14,420
You understand? Prepare
bread, vegetables, and juice.

370
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,290
I will let Chairman Park know.

371
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,100
He will do as I say, of course.

372
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,120
Tell your father-in-law
to come to my room!

373
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,260
You are the worst of the worst.

374
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,710
The worst... How shameless.

375
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,460
Don't take my words lightly.

376
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,490
Did you not understand when
I said that I wouldn't see you anymore

377
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,060
if things turned out for the worst?

378
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,610
I have plenty of files
to remove you from your position

379
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,170
- locked in my safe.
- So?

380
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,790
So, get that wench out of my sight!

381
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,540
Haven't you ever heard of the saying

382
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,350
"Burn not your house
to frighten the mouse away"?

383
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,310
If we pursue this battle,
you won't survive.

384
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,580
If you beat me, what
will you be left with?

385
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,770
Why do you assume that
I would have nothing?

386
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:20,530
I have my two precious
blood relatives, my grandsons.

387
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:25,590
A father needs to be a good
role model of filiality for his sons.

388
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,800
Think of why I hate my grandsons
when my own son defies me.

389
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,760
- You're being so cruel.
- You're the one being cruel.

390
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,670
Before you see me do more cruel things,
get that wench out of my sight!

391
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,140
- I can't do that.
- What?

392
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:48,490
If you really want to take me down,
then I will let you do that.

393
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,000
If that is really your wish,
do whatever you want!

394
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,990
You.

395
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,530
- Let's talk.
- I have nothing to say.

396
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,990
Get out of this house immediately.

397
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,980
I'll buy you a bigger house,
just move out.

398
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,870
This house has remnants of Mom.

399
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,420
This house has memories.
Am I crazy? Why would I leave?

400
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,500
You think I will just let you stay here?

401
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,440
Why not? Is it uncomfortable for you
if we all live together?

402
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,830
What's wrong with that?
As she said, nothing happened.

403
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,150
- Are you done talking?
- I think it will be fun

404
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,250
for us to eat together
at the dining table.

405
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,720
I almost want to show
it to our neighbors.

406
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,650
Where else would you find such

407
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,360
an entertaining show,
if not in our prideful house?

408
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,340
If anyone should leave, take her
with you and leave this house together.

409
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,090
- You don't even belong here.
- I don't belong?

410
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,050
Who? Me?

411
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,900
Who else?

412
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,830
Stop talking back and get out!

413
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,240
Who are you telling to get out?

414
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,090
He is the eldest son in the family!

415
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,160
He's going to marry Yoon Hee.

416
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,450
I'm going to give him the house and
the company, and I will take care of him!

417
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,320
I don't like you either, Grandmother.

418
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,570
- I like you!
- What?

419
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,240
Out of everyone in this family

420
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,950
you're the only one
who acts like a human being!

421
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,800
What's going on?

422
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:36,700
From now on, if anyone acts offensively
to Hyun Joon, there will be consequences.

423
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,750
Everyone understand?

424
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,110
What kind of situation is this?

425
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,590
I've suddenly became a prince.

426
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:54,450
The more I watch Chairman Park,
the more ridiculous it gets.

427
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,750
Every elder in this family
can only talk about Hyun Joon.

428
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,410
"There's no one else like you."

429
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,200
"You're the only decent one
in this family."

430
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,970
What does that make me?

431
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,360
What have I done for all these years?

432
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,020
Even if Hyun Joon defies Father
and Grandmother countless times

433
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,580
they accept him as part of the family.

434
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,340
Could it be that there's something

435
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,290
about Father and Grandmother's
relationship that we don't know?

436
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,030
Didn't you notice his expression?

437
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,160
Grandmother was unyielding
because she trusted something.

438
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,520
Then that means
it's all over for us, too.

439
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,660
They'll give all their assets
to Hyun Joon once he gets married.

440
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,110
She's trying to dare him to disobey her.

441
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,220
You think it's easy for her
to cast her son aside

442
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,470
and give everything to her grandson?

443
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,530
"Try if you dare."
It's a challenge.

444
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,110
Grandmother, come and have breakfast.

445
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,740
All right.

446
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,480
Did you sleep well?

447
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,040
Mother.

448
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,340
I prepared Mother's breakfast separately,
so bring it to her room.

449
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,860
Let's just eat.

450
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,150
I feel nauseous whenever
I smell breakfast being prepared

451
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,480
and can't even eat bread.

452
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,640
That's why I haven't had
breakfast with you all yet.

453
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,840
So should I hole up somewhere
like a mistress and eat alone

454
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,940
even after we're married?

455
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,640
Bring Mother's breakfast to her room.

456
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,150
Yes.

457
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,820
She's someone I need to live out
the rest of my days with.

458
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,410
I'm sorry.

459
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,090
Then where should the other heir eat?

460
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,110
Should there be a table for two
in Grandmother's room?

461
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,210
Do whatever you wish, Hyun Joon.

462
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,500
Grandmother.

463
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,210
Stay in your room.

464
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,400
I'll bring the food to your room.

465
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,140
Here. Have some.

466
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,980
Are you enjoying the bread?

467
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,670
If you don't wish to eat alone,
come and eat with us.

468
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,850
How is it that you're so delicate
when you eat?

469
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,290
Thank you for thinking that.

470
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,650
The salad is so fresh.

471
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,090
Please have some, Mother.

472
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,300
Eat it yourself.

473
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,690
As expected of my grandmother.
She wouldn't retire to her room quietly.

474
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,150
Looks like you're faced with
a battle at the breakfast table.

475
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,070
I wish I could resurrect
my deceased daughter-in-law.

476
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,180
I wish I could do that.

477
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,520
She really is a brazen woman.

478
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,830
It's hard to take her on
when she's so shameless.

479
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:30,150
I tormented that poor, kind soul
when she was alive.

480
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:37,110
Having her in the household
must be my divine punishment.

481
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:41,280
My late mother-in-law
was a good-natured woman.

482
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,720
She was against our marriage at first

483
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,900
but she was so good to me
once we were married.

484
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,400
My daughter-in-law,
my sweet daughter-in-law...

485
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,740
I can't even resurrect her.

486
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,120
You're upset, aren't you, Grandmother?

487
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,470
"Upset" doesn't fully
encapsulate how I feel.

488
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,800
I want to cry.
I want to cry so badly.

489
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,140
<i>This old hag is so unyielding.</i>

490
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,430
<i>Looks like she won't be
tormenting me anytime soon.</i>

491
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,110
You're here?

492
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,700
I wanted to see you
before you left for work.

493
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,290
I should get used to being
in this part of the house.

494
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,550
Good. You just need to have that resolve.

495
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,810
- Why would you follow me outside?
- Call me when you arrive at the office.

496
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,690
All right. Go back inside.

497
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,310
Your tie...

498
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,340
It's a bit crooked.

499
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,140
Have you changed your strategy?

500
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,150
I don't plan on being
used by you ever again.

501
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,270
So mind your own business.

502
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,740
What could it be?

503
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,430
You couldn't have fallen in love when you
were blackmailed into this engagement.

504
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,900
What could be so urgent that
you've suddenly changed your tune?

505
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,800
It's none of your business.

506
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,430
Could it be that you plan to use
his authority to your advantage

507
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,510
even though you don't have
the slightest interest in loving him?

508
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:47,010
It's none of your business whether
I love him or manipulate him.

509
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,580
You've picked a losing card.

510
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,350
Who knows if it will be you or
Chairman Park who will lose?

511
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,120
If you've got a card that will ruin
Chairman Park, then use it.

512
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,820
Don't just talk big.

513
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,010
Oh, that's right.

514
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,290
Congratulations on
Jung Hae Dang's debut.

515
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,360
Do you get it now?

516
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,260
What you've done to Jung Hae Dang?

517
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,880
Your need to rebel against your father
and your feelings of disgust toward me

518
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,410
aren't those feelings to blame
for how things have turned out?

519
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,340
It would've been different
if it had been a music show.

520
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,700
Would it?

521
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,410
Even at the audition,
the crew members spoke so well of her.

522
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,760
But there's a ceiling for impersonators.

523
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,790
Are you sure they weren't praising her
for doing a good job of imitating me?

524
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:42,570
Did you take their praises of
a show monkey to heart?

525
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,030
What's important starts right now.

526
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,590
I'm formally engaged to your father.

527
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,530
What if Jung Hae Dang shows up
as your woman?

528
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,560
How could I stand to see that?

529
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,330
Do you know what kind of relationship
I had with her deceased boyfriend?

530
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,280
If you keep protecting Jung Hae Dang

531
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,690
I'll work even harder...
to stomp all over her.

532
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,140
No, wait.... shouldn't I do that to her?

533
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,170
What do you plan to do?

534
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,470
If you love her...

535
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,640
then stay away from her.

536
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,510
Park Hyun Joon.

537
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,940
I saw you on TV.

538
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,170
I even enjoyed reading
the comments about you online.

539
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,750
Do you get it now?

540
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,020
What happens to you
if you try to stand up to me?

541
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,790
I heard the staff members
think awfully highly of you.

542
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,850
What to do?

543
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:58,290
You would do everything because
you didn't want to be a burden.

544
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:04,480
Even in that moment...
didn't you ask me to step aside?

545
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,320
This isn't the end.

546
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,340
Even if it is...
it doesn't matter.

547
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,790
This isn't a matter for you to mock.

548
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:20,150
I did my best, and it's my responsibility
to accept whatever happened.

549
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,300
So you'll hold your head
up high until the end?

550
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,840
Why did you seek me out tonight?

551
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,550
Did you want to put me in my place?

552
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,560
If you truly want to appear on TV,
and make it as a singer...

553
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,070
then it's best that you
fall in line with me.

554
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,390
A singer should be on music shows.

555
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,230
How can she become a laughingstock
by appearing on variety shows?

556
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,270
If you really want to become
a successful singer

557
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:50,010
then leave Park Hyun Joo's agency
this instant.

558
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,890
Then I'll train you as a singer.

559
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,710
I'll use all of my resources
and teach you my secrets.

560
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,480
I'll train you to become a singer.

561
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,230
I politely decline your offer.

562
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,840
You shouldn't reject
this offer so quickly.

563
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,610
Let me repeat myself.

564
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,320
I don't need your help.

565
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,050
Were you at the cafe?

566
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,830
That's what I thought,
so I waited here for you.

567
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,430
You should have come to me instead.
What were you doing?

568
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,310
Didn't I tell you to come to me
at times like these?

569
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:05,640
I thought that would only upset you.

570
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,660
We should share these feelings together.

571
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,840
You've been through
so many painful experiences.

572
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,690
You shouldn't go through
more pain because of me.

573
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,720
Hae Dang.

574
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,440
Look at me.

575
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,780
You loved me when
I couldn't see anything.

576
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,650
I said that I would even die for you.

577
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,470
How could I ever forget
the love you showed me then?

578
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,760
How am I to repay you
for all the love you've shown me?

579
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,840
You have my heart.

580
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:50,690
The heart that doesn't want
to bring you more emotional pain.

581
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,610
We should share how we feel
when things are hard

582
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,600
and share in each other's joy
in the happier times.

583
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,000
That's how I said
we should live our lives.

584
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,390
It feels like the more I like you

585
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,150
the more things there are
that I feel bad about.

586
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,210
- I thought you sold it.
- As if I could.

587
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:52,120
Thank you so much
for appearing on the show.

588
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,970
You really felt like my own mother,
not my mother-in-law, that day.

589
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,010
I'm not just saying this because
you returned this ring to me

590
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,090
but I regard your sisters
as my own daughters.

591
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,650
I know that.

592
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,960
If you weren't my daughter-in-law,
I would've treated you like my own child.

593
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,030
I understand what you mean.

594
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,820
This is why relationships
are so complicated.

595
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,570
The relationship between
a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law...

596
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,780
Yes.

597
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,000
In any case, thanks for the ring.

598
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,340
I have no reason to hide it when
you've officially given this to me.

599
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,660
This has been a great day for you, Mom.

600
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,870
You got your ring back
after making hand-torn noodles.

601
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,610
Still, she didn't sell this ring.

602
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,140
That's what I'm saying.

603
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,610
All right. I'll focus on
her good qualities.

604
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,090
Being a lecturer at a university
isn't something to scoff at.

605
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,710
Just because you got a ring...

606
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,440
Goodness. Do you like it that much?

607
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,580
Geez.

608
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,320
Goodness, you're still up?

609
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,720
There's no end to your studies, is there?

610
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,590
Studying is something you're bad at
unless you were born to do it.

611
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,660
Honestly, I'm studying
because I find it fun.

612
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,140
It's fun?

613
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,120
Just your luck.

614
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,500
Wrap it up and come to bed.

615
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,000
Go to bed. I need to finish this.

616
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,120
Do it in the morning.
Stop. That's enough.

617
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,660
- Stop. Stop.
- Wait a second.

618
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,770
- Wait.
- Come with me.

619
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:32,850
- I have to turn off the computer.
- I'll do it. Don't worry, just go.

620
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,230
- We're off to bed.
- Go on.

621
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,190
Gosh, are you sure those two
are the same people

622
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,450
who were about to file for divorce
not too long ago?

623
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,410
Don't you think we might hear news
of Hoon getting a sibling soon?

624
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,740
Why are you worried?
You'll be raising that child, anyway.

625
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,850
Huh? What did you say?

626
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:48,660
Why would I?

627
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,380
<i>[Mobile Banking]</i>

628
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,730
<i>[Retina Scan]</i>

629
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:01,980
<i>[Retina Scan]</i>

630
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,870
<i>[Transfer Complete: 44,290 won]</i>

631
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,620
What are you doing, Hae Dang's father?

632
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:14,750
Yes, I had a bill to pay,
so I was making a transfer.

633
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,290
You can do that on your phone?

634
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,750
You're really with the times.

635
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,880
This is nothing.

636
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,930
- I got this ring back.
- Goodness, you must be happy.

637
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,820
By the way, are things okay
with Hae Dang?

638
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,310
She always acts as if everything
is okay in front of the family.

639
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,550
You should get her married off.

640
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,440
Why?

641
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,510
She's a bit too old to be
making her debut.

642
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,860
Many people debut
before they turn 20.

643
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,570
It's rather late for her at 33.

644
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,590
I thought about that, too.

645
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,150
You should get her married
when there's someone who likes her.

646
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,650
If she'd marry Hyun Joon,
I would marry her off tomorrow.

647
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,920
Let her get married
to that cafe owner.

648
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,980
- He's too young.
- Then let them live that way.

649
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,460
I think he will only bring her pain.

650
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,810
After meeting him, I don't think
he would do that to her.

651
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,220
Every person is different.

652
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,800
Eight years is too young.

653
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,050
People nowadays embrace the youth.

654
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,700
It's the trend! The trend!

655
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,210
Maybe over my dead body.

656
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,080
- He has no parents.
- So what if he did?

657
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,090
You would let them
get married if he had parents?

658
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,680
Can't you see when you look at me?

659
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,960
What's so good about having in-laws?

660
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,680
Having useless in-laws
is simply a burden.

661
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,760
It feels strange hearing you say that.

662
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,890
What's there to feel strange about?
It's the truth.

663
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:45,160
- Then you're owning up to it?
- I am.

664
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,720
Even if I had a daughter

665
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,910
I'd never let her marry into a family
that had a mother-in-law like me.

666
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,560
Never mind, a sister-in-law
who got a divorce.

667
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,410
I've recorded your statement.

668
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,330
Here!

669
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,170
What did you do?

670
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,440
It's the trend to record events
from time to time.

671
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,110
This is the biggest trend
of them all these days!

672
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,740
Now you can't back out of your word.

673
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,670
- Erase it this instant!
- Why would I?

674
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,650
I need to use this
when I need things to go my way!

675
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,350
Hurry up and erase it.

676
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,640
Don't worry so much.
I don't know how to use that feature.

677
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,060
What don't you know when
you just transferred money on your phone!

678
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,520
I don't believe you.

679
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,320
- Give it to me.
- I didn't record anything!

680
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,090
Is it? Is it a trend?

681
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,990
Should I reconsider?

682
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:45,050
- Did you come to have coffee?
- You scared me.

683
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,570
Welcome.

684
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,240
I was just passing by.

685
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,630
Come on in.

686
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,730
- Sit wherever you like.
- Okay.

687
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,020
I'll have a cup of coffee.

688
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,880
I bought some fruit.
Would you like a smoothie?

689
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,580
Sounds good.

690
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,090
To be honest, I can't tell
what a good cup of coffee is.

691
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,180
I added in a banana
so it won't be as tart.

692
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,900
Thank you.

693
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,370
I'll enjoy the drink.

694
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,710
Why are you sitting down?

695
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,830
Do you have something to say to me?

696
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,020
No, it's not that...

697
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,230
I thought that maybe...
you were here to see me.

698
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,780
That's why I sat down.
I'm sorry.

699
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,610
No, no. Take a seat since you've
already pulled up a chair.

700
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,500
All right.

701
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,670
- So...
- Yes? Do you have something to say?

702
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,680
Oh, what would I have to say?

703
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,740
This juice is delicious.

704
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,090
Go attend to your business.

705
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,350
Yes, please excuse me.

706
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,400
Thank you for the drink.
It was lovely.

707
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,480
Of course. Goodbye.

708
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,710
All right.

709
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,110
Goodness me.
I need to pay.

710
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,770
No, no. That's not necessary.

711
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,790
Why would it not be necessary?

712
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,000
It's on the house, sir.

713
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,350
You had me pay last time.

714
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:29,070
It's on the house for parties of one.

715
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,130
Is that right? Okay.

716
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,980
Thanks for the drink.

717
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,110
What did you want to talk to us about?

718
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:55,030
I wanted to speak to everyone
about the engagement ceremony.

719
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,400
Your engagement ceremony?

720
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,360
Since we've announced our engagement,
we should hold a ceremony.

721
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,170
Don't be ridiculous.

722
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,970
Should we... hold a wedding instead?

723
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,770
Are you trying to insult me?

724
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:16,680
As my second marriage, I would prefer
a wedding over an engagement ceremony

725
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,600
but since this is her first time,
I want to stick to tradition.

726
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:27,360
If you don't plan on embarrassing
yourself in front of a crowd

727
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,740
then don't make such absurd suggestions!

728
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,530
I'd like to hold the ceremony
as a garden party on the estate.

729
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,280
Make proper preparations.

730
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,250
Yes, Father.

731
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,010
So you've decided to marry her?

732
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,380
That's right. What of it?

733
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,270
Don't entertain such
ludicrous thoughts.

734
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,580
Do I need your permission
to hold an engagement ceremony?

735
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,900
Fine. Go ahead and do it.

736
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:03,040
You'll need to give each of your guests
a photo album of the happy couple.

737
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,090
A photo album? What does he mean?

738
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,980
What were you referring to?

739
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,780
Those photos which angered you
when you saw them.

740
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,350
I'm still holding on to those.

741
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,900
What?

742
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,870
I'll hand them out during
your engagement ceremony.

743
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,080
Do you think I'll stand idly by

744
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,980
and watch that woman
hold her engagement after how Mom died?

745
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,830
So you'll hand those photos out
in front of all those people?

746
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:59,710
Explain to each and every person
that nothing happened.

747
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,620
Tell them yourself.

748
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,750
"Yes, nothing happened that day."

749
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,960
"Of course, nothing happened."

750
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,440
But will people believe that?

751
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,950
It's not like she was kidnapped.
She got in an elevator with me

752
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,970
and she walked into a room with me--

753
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,090
There really isn't anything
you won't say.

754
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,800
If you dare to slap me one more time...

755
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,000
that will be the end for you.

756
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,920
You pushed Mom off a cliff.

757
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,630
Then you manipulated the will.

758
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,250
A man who would call himself
my father would strike me?

759
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,110
Geez.

760
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,800
There's no point in waiting
until you hold the engagement ceremony.

761
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,440
I should release the photos
to the media this instant.

762
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,150
You!

763
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,650
What? You don't think I'll do it?

764
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,760
You think anything will stand in my way
after Mom died the way she did?

765
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,220
Try to hold your engagement ceremony
or a wedding.

766
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,370
See what happens.

767
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:20,500
What will you do if you don't let him
have the engagement ceremony

768
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,110
and he goes ahead with the wedding?

769
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:27,630
There are moments in life where
you cannot lose your ground.

770
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,680
An engagement ceremony?

771
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,400
I won't stand for it!

772
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,900
What do you think of holding
a private engagement ceremony?

773
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,140
I'll make it up to you with
a wonderful wedding present.

774
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,870
Why? Because Mother is against the idea?

775
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,510
- Well, that--
- I don't want that.

776
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,370
What would become of me
if I backed down before we're married?

777
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:01,040
I'm going to go through with
the engagement ceremony.

778
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,720
Why would Hyun Joon make such a threat
if there are so many people there?

779
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,460
What?

780
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,640
Are you backing down because
you're afraid of what people might think?

781
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,830
Everyone knows that nothing happened.

782
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,910
But he has the photos.

783
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:23,210
If we back down now, he'll continue
to use that against us in the future.

784
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,580
Then we won't be able to do anything

785
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,880
let alone the engagement ceremony
and the wedding.

786
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,230
Tell him to do whatever he likes.

787
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,300
Because that will mean
the end of his life too.

788
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,810
He's not someone who is scared by that.

789
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,660
I'm the same way.

790
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:48,620
I'm a woman who abandoned her child
and faces criticism every day.

791
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,380
You think I would be
afraid of some photos?

792
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,280
I'm going to have that
engagement ceremony, no matter what.

793
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:09,030
- Oh, how pretty!
- You look so beautiful.

794
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,330
How lovely.

795
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,640
Here are our selections.

796
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,300
What is that in your hands?

797
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,920
I thought about it,
and I figured it was easier

798
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,740
to hand out the photos
rather than making an album.

799
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,600
So call off the engagement ceremony.

800
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,390
It's too late.
The guests have already arrived.

801
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,110
Do whatever you wish then.

802
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,340
Everything is ready.
Please come outside.

803
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:53,280
Thank you all for coming out
to the engagement ceremony

804
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,680
of Chairman Park Sung Hwan
and singer Yoo Ji Na.

805
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,820
Our lady of the hour is Yoo Ji Na.

806
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,480
We will proceed with the cake cutting.

807
