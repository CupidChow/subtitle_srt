00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:07,812
(Episode 37)

2
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:34,589
What are you two doing here?

3
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:40,081
- H-hyun-sung...
- What do you think you're doing at the front gate?

4
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:47,445
Hyun-sung!

5
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:53,117
- Please talk with me before you go inside.
- Talk about what?

6
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:58,585
Do you think words are
needed in this situation?

7
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,788
- Hyun-sung!
- What do we do?

8
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,356
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

9
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:11,250
I'll call you later.

10
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:18,656
Hyun-sung!

11
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,711
- Are you going to tell Na-kyung?
- I'm going to tell my grandmother.

12
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:24,735
You can't!

13
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:26,758
I can't?

14
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:29,867
- Let's talk tomorrow.
- About what?

15
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:34,687
- There must be something you want from me.
- Something I want?

16
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:41,187
Na-kyung always tells me that you can't
get anything if you don't do anything.

17
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:45,679
I look forward to what you can give me.

18
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:50,734
However, I don't need anything,
except for you to leave this house.

19
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:07,688
What did she say?

20
00:02:08,023 --> 00:02:12,191
She said we should make a deal because
there will be something I want from her.

21
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:16,710
- And what did you say?
- I told her I didn't need anything.

22
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:19,942
You did the right thing. That
way, we won't get caught.

23
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:53,921
Good morning, mother.

24
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,015
- We need to talk.
- I have to make breakfast.

25
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:16,632
- What did Hyun-sung tell you?
- Drink your juice.

26
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:18,273
Didn't he tell you anything?

27
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:22,554
About what happened at the
front gate last night?

28
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:27,580
The hug was one-sided. Hyun-sung
happened to come at that moment.

29
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:30,859
Really? You didn't go out
to be purposely hugged?

30
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,851
- What?
- So why did you go out in the first place?

31
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:38,761
He was going to be out all night
waiting for me, so how could I not?

32
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:43,812
- I went out to send him home.
- Why didn't you explain that to Hyun-sung?

33
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,009
Won't you explain it to him so
that he won't get the wrong idea?

34
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,312
The wrong idea?

35
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,937
Then I won't even have to help you.

36
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:55,945
Misunderstandings are bound to be cleared
up one day, even if you leave them alone.

37
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,960
- Are you really going to be like this?
- Of course, I'm on your side.

38
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:03,250
I'm a pretty loyal person.

39
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,399
However, the problem is the fact
that you went out at that hour.

40
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:14,624
Just make sure Mrs. Sung
doesn't hear about this.

41
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:21,413
Eventually, we ended up on the same
boat, whether you like it or not.

42
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:30,429
Kyung-soo, come work out
with me in the afternoon.

43
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:35,468
How about Hyun-sung joins you guys?

44
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,663
It would be nice if he got
along with his older brother.

45
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:48,319
He has to learn about the company anyways,
and he could learn it from Hyun-sung.

46
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:54,626
Hyun-sung, please take
good care of Kyung-soo.

47
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,601
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

48
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:09,484
It's because I think Kyung-soo
will have a hard time

49
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,351
having both Hyun-joon and
Hyun-sung as enemies.

50
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,386
There's something Hyun-sung wants as well.

51
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,695
He's not the type of person to simply
do something beneficial for Kyung-soo.

52
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,617
On top of that, there's Na-kyung. Do you
not know the type of person she is?

53
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:36,617
- Then how about you give your shares to Kyung-soo now?
- What?

54
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,578
You're going to give them to him anyways.
Why not give them to him sooner?

55
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:45,070
You and I can go on trips
and just enjoy life.

56
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:49,319
- Honey.
- I'm saying this for your sake.

57
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:54,663
I feel bad that you're growing
old while doing work.

58
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:06,765
- Why are you becoming more and more like that?
- More like what?

59
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:08,742
Aren't you thinking of me too easily?

60
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:11,851
Thinking of you too easily?
What do you mean by that?

61
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,445
I'm in an irreversible
fate with my two sons.

62
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:20,760
I thought it would be
better to make your son

63
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:25,828
my successor instead of
a complete stranger.

64
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:31,835
- That's a great idea.
- But how could you already tell me to give my shares to him?

65
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,046
I said it because I care about you.

66
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:37,408
If you truly care about me,
you should say "not yet,"

67
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:40,555
even though I say I'm going
to give them up already.

68
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,884
But you're the one who said that last time.

69
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,093
I was saying that to crush Hyun-joon.

70
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:52,289
All right. Why are you getting angry?
I was saying it for your sake.

71
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:06,984
- What is it? What's going on?
- What do you mean?

72
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,953
Don't try to fool me. Are you
really going to be this way?

73
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,218
I hope you end up doing something that
will only benefit that vulgar Ji-na

74
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:19,453
by trying to use that brain of yours
by yourself, just like last time.

75
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:22,430
I have no idea what you're talking about.

76
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:23,734
Listen to me carefully.

77
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:31,031
The reason why I'm allowing you to stay
in this house isn't because I like you.

78
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,877
I'm sick and tired of my son, so I'm
terrified of making my grandsons

79
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:42,413
remarry, just in case someone
worse than you comes along next.

80
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:47,960
However, if you really are no use, I'll
have no choice but to chase you out.

81
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,046
You signed the contract.

82
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:53,506
- If I have to get a divorce because of the contract, then so be it.
- What?

83
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:59,960
However, Hyun-sung might remarry
me about one year later.

84
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:01,500
What did you say?

85
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:04,546
If I remarry him, do I need to give
the 3 million dollars back to you?

86
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,585
That article wasn't in the contract.

87
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:13,499
- You brat!
- Isn't this up to Hyun-sung anyways?

88
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:14,590
Are you serious-?

89
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:21,546
Fine. Was this all you
could ever amount to?

90
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:25,140
You're so useless!

91
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:27,921
I'm sorry this is all I could be.

92
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,413
I'll prepare lunch for you.

93
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:42,042
Find. I don't need anyone. I'm
going to solve this myself.

94
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:46,624
I'm not dead yet, you brats!

95
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:53,812
Please sit here for a moment.

96
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,968
- I was in the middle of doing something.
- Please just sit here.

97
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:12,372
Hyun-sung said that exercising
with Kyung-soo and teaching

98
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:17,219
him how to work at the company
will only benefit Kyung-soo.

99
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:23,085
- Really?
- He's going to tell grandmother when he comes home from work tonight.

100
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:28,742
Isn't there something that
could entice Hyun-sung?

101
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:31,945
Something that could
completely blow him away.

102
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,671
So what's that?

103
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,882
I thought of it! The letter!

104
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,250
The letter?

105
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:43,960
- There's no safe in the annex.
- What?

106
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:49,812
To be frank, all women have a
couple male friends these days.

107
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:57,843
I don't think it's bad for you to
have friends of the opposite gender.

108
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:01,515
On top of that, where
else would you meet a man

109
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:04,101
like Cheol who has a
safe and clean identity?

110
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:10,375
Are you telling me to steal the letter?

111
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,468
Just take a brief look before
putting it back in its place.

112
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:29,609
Did you go to a funeral dressed like that?

113
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,765
I got the notice suddenly when I was out.

114
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:35,359
I was eating with my friend
when I suddenly got the call.

115
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:37,703
It was your friend's father
who had passed away?

116
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,218
He collapsed suddenly because
of high blood pressure.

117
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:43,062
Last night, you told me your
friend's mother had passed away.

118
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:47,460
Was it her father or mother
who had passed away?

119
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,406
Hyun-joon, what are you
doing here at this time?

120
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:01,703
My grandmother wanted to see me right away.

121
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,467
Grandmother, I'm home.

122
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,515
I think Ji-na is having an affair.

123
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:18,179
Na-kyung has that weakness.

124
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:22,882
- I think I know who it is.
- You do? Who is it?

125
00:11:23,422 --> 00:11:27,437
- It's Hyun-sung's friend, the lawyer who came to our house last time.
- Really?

126
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:31,788
The way he treated Ji-na was peculiar.

127
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,227
Really?

128
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:38,710
Na-kyung was playing innocent,
but I'm sure it's him.

129
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:40,953
What a disgusting creature.

130
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:45,648
Your father pushed his own
sons aside to protect

131
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:49,195
her son, so how dare she have an affair?

132
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:53,742
I want to see the look on Mr.
Park's face when he finds that out.

133
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:57,281
They had even gone to play ball together.

134
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,382
This is our last chance.

135
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,624
Our last chance to chase
her out of our house.

136
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:05,211
Of course, she'll play innocent.

137
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:10,054
I'm sure Na-kyung has the
evidence nicely prepared.

138
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:15,015
- But do you think she'll willingly give it up?
- That's what I want to know as well.

139
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,304
Where can I find this?

140
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:38,984
What are you doing right now?

141
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,524
Didn't you go out to exercise?

142
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,867
Mr. Park had an emergency
meeting, so he canceled it.

143
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,570
- What were you doing here?
- I need that letter.

144
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:58,273
So you were digging though my
things to find that letter?

145
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,742
- Park Hyun-sung knows my weakness.
- What weakness?

146
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,719
What weakness?

147
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:15,124
He saw me meeting that
man at the front gate.

148
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,882
- Who?
- Hyun-sung's friend who had come over last time.

149
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,546
Did something really happen with him?

150
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,445
Are you crazy?

151
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,188
You should understand my
position of having to live

152
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:33,453
- with a man 18 years older than me.
- Understand you?

153
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,579
Who told you to live with a
man 18 years older than you?

154
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:41,788
Your father is a man who doesn't
deserve to live with a woman like me.

155
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:46,640
- What?
- He doesn't understand my delicate mental world.

156
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:50,445
You mean your crazy mental world.

157
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,812
I'm a singer whose young life had been
more glamorous than anyone else's.

158
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:58,278
But to your father, I'm no
different than a regular

159
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:00,933
woman who cooks and grows old in the house.

160
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:02,423
And your point is?

161
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:04,949
My life was more glamorous than
anyone else's, but I ended up

162
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:07,312
falling off the stage more
appalling than anyone else did.

163
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:12,288
Your father can't fill up my empty heart.

164
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:15,578
Who is my father? "Your father?"

165
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,318
Must you see me go to the
hospital from a drug addiction?

166
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:25,178
You tried to use me to push aside his two
sons, and yet, you dare have an affair?

167
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:26,359
It's not an affair!

168
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,015
It's my desperate struggle to live.

169
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,898
So are you saying you're going
to keep meeting that man?

170
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:39,999
I'm asking you! Are you
going to keep meeting him?

171
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:43,812
- I can't live without him now.
- Then you can live without me.

172
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,359
- I can't live without you either!
- Then you can live without Mr. Park.

173
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:51,929
I need him, too.

174
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:56,515
- Look here, Mrs. Yoo Ji-na!
- You're holding onto that letter for me anyways.

175
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:58,609
So give it to me.

176
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,601
Don't be ridiculous and just persuade Mr.
Park to allow Hae-dang get married.

177
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:05,523
- I can't.
- You can't?

178
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:08,140
I'd rather die. I won't do that.

179
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,186
You have so many things
you hate and want to do.

180
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,718
How could there be such a
selfish person in the world?

181
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:20,468
This is who I am. I was always like this.

182
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:22,226
What?

183
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:26,843
Still, you were able to come
into this world because of me.

184
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:30,710
So there's no need for you
to act smart in front of me.

185
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,015
Let's just get married.

186
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,439
Are you sure you don't
have to get that letter?

187
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,096
My grandmother is worried that
the person who calls himself my

188
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,766
father will give up his shares
to Kyung-soo once I marry you.

189
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:14,968
Still, I made up my mind to marry you.

190
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:17,297
Hyun-joon...

191
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:21,445
Even though I can't get a single
share, will you still marry me?

192
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:24,445
Are you worrying about that right now?

193
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,133
Because if that happens, I'm not
the son of a conglomerate family.

194
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:33,335
You need the letter to take revenge
for your mother's unfair death.

195
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:35,203
I thought about it deeply.

196
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:40,078
My mom truly loved her children.

197
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:47,812
To get her revenge, I met the one person
I would love for the rest of my life.

198
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,078
I don't think she would
want me to give that up.

199
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:57,241
I know that. My mom loved me so much.

200
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:03,398
To you, I can't say that I'm the
son of a conglomerate family.

201
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:09,207
In some sense, there's a greater possibility
that Kyung-soo will inherit the shares.

202
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:12,007
Still, will you marry me?

203
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:19,062
Kyung-soo is the man I had once loved.

204
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:25,481
To be honest, I am worried about him,
and he is a very pitiful person.

205
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,335
However... that's not love anymore

206
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:33,687
Hae-dang...

207
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:38,478
Yoo Ji-na once told me that Kyung-soo is
unable to leave me even though I'm eight

208
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:42,625
years older than him because of his pain
of having been abandoned by his mom.

209
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:46,626
When Kyung-soo grows older,

210
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:52,351
he'll come to realize what his
exact feelings for me were.

211
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,476
Just like how I had realized
while receiving your love,

212
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:05,937
"Oh. So this is how it feels for
a woman to be loved by a man."

213
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:10,198
But I'm not able to do many
things for you anymore.

214
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,499
You may not be able to get
revenge against Yoo Ji-na.

215
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:18,195
Rather, you might be bullied along with me.

216
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:22,953
Let's endure this together.

217
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:25,242
Hae-dang.

218
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,320
I said you can't.

219
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:36,796
What if he uses this as an excuse
to transfer all his shares?

220
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,421
We're just going to have a
simple wedding at a cathedral.

221
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:41,788
- Hyun-joon.
- I'm sorry, grandmother.

222
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,953
If you feel uncomfortable
coming because of father,

223
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:47,140
you don't have to come. I won't be upset.

224
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:53,398
- We want to have a simple wedding at a cathedral.
- At a cathedral?

225
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:57,609
Hyun-joon's father and the rest of
his family may not be able to come.

226
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,997
Are you serious?

227
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:02,757
Please don't ask why.

228
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,984
Still, I made up my mind
to marry Hyun-joon.

229
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:14,038
Then will only our family come, too?

230
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,570
That way, Hyun-joon will
feel less guilty about it.

231
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,921
Do you have the confidence
to go and live well?

232
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:30,531
- Yes.
- Okay. Then let's do that.

233
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:39,843
You're more reasonable and
patient than anyone I know.

234
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:44,218
So I'll put my faith in you and send
you off to marriage with a good heart.

235
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:48,539
Thank you.

236
00:19:56,797 --> 00:20:00,117
A cathedral? The wedding of a wealthy
man will take place at a cathedral?

237
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,516
We're not going to invite anyone else.
It will just be the family.

238
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,851
- Why?
- Because that's what I want to do.

239
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,398
His family will have many guests.
After all,

240
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:13,328
it's a conglomerate family
we're talking about.

241
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,882
- His father and family members may not be able to come.
- What?

242
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,599
This is all Ji-na's fault, isn't it?

243
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:22,913
She made such a ruckus
at the family meeting.

244
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:25,175
His father couldn't put
up with his young wife's

245
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:27,327
tantrums, so he's against
this marriage, isn't he?

246
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:31,320
It's fine as long as she has
his grandmother on her side.

247
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:36,476
Just hearing about her made me fear her. I
bet Ji-na won't be able to go against her.

248
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,460
Still, how could she get
married without any guests?

249
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:43,546
If we want to invite all the guests, do you
think we can even compare to his family?

250
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,687
I think this is for the better.

251
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:49,968
- Won't you be upset?
- I'm fine.

252
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:52,844
Yeah. It's be nice to have
a wedding with just the

253
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:55,213
family at a cathedral
with encouraging hearts.

254
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,828
So I don't have to invite anyone?

255
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:02,663
I'm not inviting my friends, so
why should you invite yours?

256
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:07,171
That's great! To be honest, I
felt sorry about inviting them.

257
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:09,070
It's a once-in-a-lifetime wedding!

258
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:12,422
Even though we're sorry, we should be
shameless and invite anyone we can!

259
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:16,976
Oh, come on. We're doing this because
Hyun-joon might feel guilty.

260
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:21,945
Goodness! That Yoo Ji-na
is a pain in the neck!

261
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:25,148
Just keep that in mind. Meeting adjourned!

262
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:26,883
Okay.

263
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:35,390
- So you can come if you want.
- Did you really decide to do that?

264
00:21:36,437 --> 00:21:37,437
Yes.

265
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:42,117
Mom will be disappointed in heaven if she
finds out you're getting married like this.

266
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:45,765
There's nothing more important
than being with the one you love.

267
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,624
What's the point of having many guests?

268
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,320
- Should I invite the employees at least?
- No, thanks.

269
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:56,906
They'll find it difficult to
attend because of Mr. Park.

270
00:21:58,344 --> 00:22:00,804
Oh, what about the ring?
Did you prepare it?

271
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:03,851
I'm just going to prepare
to the best of my ability.

272
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,242
I'll prepare it. It's the least I can do.

273
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:13,312
For mom's sake, don't you
think I can at least do that?

274
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,929
Then I'll gratefully accept it.

275
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,476
They're really going to
get married like that?

276
00:22:25,883 --> 00:22:28,031
In some way, I envy him.

277
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,343
That means that's how much
he likes Jung Hae-dang.

278
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:34,523
Do you think that's something
you should say in front of me?

279
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:40,062
Meet with Hae-dang and get her a ring.
I'll give you the money.

280
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:41,841
Excuse me?

281
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:45,826
The entire family can't attend, so we
should at least get her a good ring.

282
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:47,335
Why should I do that?

283
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:50,804
Just do it! Can't you even do that?

284
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:57,109
When I think of my late mom, I feel bad
that he'll have his wedding this way.

285
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,125
All right.

286
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:04,015
If I say I won't do it, you'll
probably bring up divorce again.

287
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,351
Make them set these all over again.

288
00:23:11,492 --> 00:23:13,863
Hyun-sung said he would get her a ring.

289
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:15,890
Do you think a mere ring is enough?

290
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:25,999
Nowadays, some people give nine to
thirteen jewelry sets to the bride.

291
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:29,073
But who cares about the quantity?

292
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:31,851
These are all good ones.

293
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:36,752
As long as the designs
are changed to match a

294
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:40,921
young women, these are good wedding gifts.

295
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:43,132
I'll gratefully accept them.

296
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,695
Should I invite some guests for you?

297
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,796
They'll gossip about how my own father
isn't even attending the wedding.

298
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:52,812
That's true.

299
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:04,601
Hi.

300
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:08,585
Get something that Hae-dang likes.
Don't worry about the money.

301
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,882
Hyun-joon, I don't need this.

302
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:21,367
Just do as I say.

303
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:26,203
My family won't be able to prepare
such a nice wedding gift for you.

304
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,554
- Do you think I wish for something like that?
- Do you think I do?

305
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,062
Still, we should get wedding
gifts for the bride.

306
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,390
These are excessive.

307
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:42,265
I like this one. Do you?

308
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,148
Then I'll choose this one.

309
00:24:50,508 --> 00:24:52,718
So this one will be your ring.

310
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,355
We're going to set these again.
They're wedding

311
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:00,061
gifts, so make sure they're
simple but dignified.

312
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,031
- No. This is too much.
- My grandmother is giving these to you.

313
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,072
I'm getting married this Saturday.

314
00:25:21,172 --> 00:25:22,172
You...

315
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,249
I didn't give you permission!

316
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:28,132
I don't recall you getting permission
from grandmother to get married.

317
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:31,546
This is why they say like father, like son.

318
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:35,585
You should've shown a
good example as a father.

319
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:41,710
She's someone who has refused an offer
her future father-in-law had made her.

320
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:47,970
How could I allow such a woman to become
the eldest daughter-in-law of this family?

321
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,203
So what is going to come
out of your mouth next?

322
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:58,327
Are you going to say you're going to
transfer the shares to a complete stranger?

323
00:25:59,656 --> 00:26:03,703
I'm going to transfer them to him anyways.
It's not a bad idea to do it beforehand.

324
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:08,742
- I won't accept them, even if you give them to me.
- What?

325
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,671
I'm not in the situation to accept
them anyways. It's burdensome.

326
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,135
You are completely thoughtless, aren't you?

327
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:31,538
Do you want me to receive the shares when
you're having an affair with another man?

328
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:34,392
Then why else would I be with
a man who is 18 years older

329
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,891
than I am when I don't even
love him the slightest bit?

330
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:39,507
- Because you like it.
- What?

331
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:42,626
He may be old, but he has money and power.

332
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:45,424
You can find other
qualities in someone else.

333
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,031
Listen to me carefully.

334
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,999
I'm not playing Mr. Park's son
in order to be a con-artist.

335
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:57,124
End things with that man at once.

336
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:01,421
You don't listen to me, so
why should I listen to you?

337
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:06,437
Because I'm playing Mr. Park's son
so that you can play the rich madam.

338
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:10,196
For Hae-dang's and late Mrs.
Choi's sakes, I should

339
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:12,992
give that letter to Park
Hyun-joon and leave at once.

340
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:17,257
Still, I'm enduring it so you can
keep playing the rich madam.

341
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:20,844
Then while you're enduring it, just accept
the shares when he offers them to you.

342
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:23,117
Should I accept them and
give them to Park Hyun-joon?

343
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:24,827
What?

344
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:28,685
I can't give the letter to him because Mr.
Park will turn

345
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:32,344
out to be a murderer and you'll
become a murderer's wife.

346
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:37,781
So I'll feel less guilty if I get the
shares and give them to Hyun-joon.

347
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:46,976
- Do you hate me that much?
- Did you realize that now?

348
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,507
Still, at that moment, he said
he wouldn't accept the shares.

349
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:02,413
That's why a person's first
impression is very important.

350
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:06,882
At first glance, I didn't
want to treat him crudely.

351
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:10,218
It's clear that he's a
different person from Ji-na.

352
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,492
He is playing Mr. Park's
son for his mom's sake,

353
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:17,734
but inside, he must be suffering.

354
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,804
That's why who you were
raised by is very important.

355
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:26,703
If he had grown up under Ji-na,
would he have such discernment?

356
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:33,453
Goodness. Now, I miss your late mom.

357
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:41,062
- Still, I'm very grateful to you nowadays.
- Really?

358
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:48,523
If you weren't here, how would Hyun-sung
and I dare go against father?

359
00:28:49,414 --> 00:28:54,538
I'm on death's doorstep. I don't know
how long I'll be able to endure it.

360
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:56,906
Why would you say that?

361
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:02,226
Even though you can win against
everything, you can't win against time.

362
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,398
It's difficult for me to try to
survive on my own in this situation.

363
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:14,804
How could you go back and forth?

364
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:18,992
If you pity your brother that much,
throw all of your greed away right now!

365
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,492
You're so greedy, and yet, you're
pretending to be loyal to your brother.

366
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:29,023
Hyun-joon is getting married, so
it makes me think of my late mom.

367
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:30,992
You're unstoppable.

368
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:33,969
It's because I'm this kind of
person that I'm not divorcing you.

369
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:36,460
Why can't you realize that?

370
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:53,851
Last time, you suddenly changed your
mind and told me to accept Hae-dang.

371
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,593
- It's because of Kyung-soo, isn't it?
- I told you it's not.

372
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:01,976
He said he didn't need the
shares in front of everyone.

373
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:07,026
= Isn't that quietly spitting in my face?
- Spitting in your face?

374
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:11,656
What would I look like in front of
my mother, Hyun-joon, and Hyun-sung?

375
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:14,203
I scolded him.

376
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:19,257
Are you sure he's staying
in this house to be my son?

377
00:30:19,492 --> 00:30:21,140
Then why else would he be here?

378
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:26,023
Why do you keep having
such thoughts about him?

379
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:33,695
It's because he's pure. Do you want him
to be someone who covets inheritance?

380
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,906
Thank you for refusing the shares.

381
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,690
I said I don't want them, so for the
time being, he won't be able to

382
00:30:53,714 --> 00:30:57,719
bully either you or Hyun-sung with
the talk of transferring shares.

383
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:01,632
- I'm going to marry Hae-dang.
- I heard.

384
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:06,773
Eventually, you don't need the shares.
You chose Hae-dang.

385
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,828
When I think about my late mom,
I'm overwhelmed with guilt,

386
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,917
however, I have no choice but to
choose Hae-dang in any situation.

387
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:22,499
To be honest, that fact
about you reassures me.

388
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,101
Are you congratulating me?

389
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:26,448
Because I always want her to be happy,

390
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:30,671
although I don't even know if I
have the right to wish for that.

391
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:33,148
I'll gratefully accept your heart.

392
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:38,554
May I tell you to take good care of her?

393
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,343
It's another fate of mine
to accept the fact that

394
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:47,246
you two worry about each
other in a platonic way.

395
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:53,163
It's not like we'll never see each other.
We have no choice.

396
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:57,398
From the depth of my
heart, I congratulate you.

397
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:00,344
Thank you.

398
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:22,077
Hae-dang, congratulations.
You must become happy.

399
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:27,531
Thank you for everything and... I'm sorry.

400
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:58,156
Here we go. One, two, three!

401
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:17,578
So you're going to become my
daughter-in-law, are you?

402
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:23,681
Fine. Just get married into this
family and see what happens.

403
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:37,148
They'll have to make do with this.

404
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,656
Her family said they would prepare
it, so why did you do it instead?

405
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:43,374
Do you have a problem with that?

406
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:47,163
- She got a bunch of wedding gifts.
- Didn't you get them, too?

407
00:34:48,242 --> 00:34:52,249
I did everything for you, too, or did you
forget since it happened a long time ago?

408
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:57,781
- Did Hae-dang sign a contract, too?
- Are you mad? Why would I make her do that?

409
00:34:57,953 --> 00:34:59,460
It's not fair.

410
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:06,578
She got married to Hyun-joon knowing
that he might not get any shares.

411
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:10,460
Then does it look like Hyun-sung
is about to get any shares?

412
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,754
You got married to him
knowing that he would.

413
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,382
Grandmother, if you keep this up, I'm
going to give her a hard married life!

414
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,835
My goodness. You're going to give your
older sister-in-law a hard married life?

415
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:23,921
If I'm in the position to, why not?

416
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:29,031
Hae-dang may be nice, but she's not easy.
Can't you tell?

417
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,734
You might end up having a hard married
life because of her, so watch out.

418
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:51,156
Don't waste any time. We need to feed the
newly-weds as soon as they come home.

419
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:54,804
At last, Hae-dang is leaving home.

420
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,140
- Gosh. I know.
- I still can't believe it.

421
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:01,660
Now that she's married
into such a family, she'll

422
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:03,563
only be able to come here
twice a year, right?

423
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:06,062
She won't be able to come
here as often as she likes.

424
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,406
I'll miss her. What will I do?

425
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:12,815
You live with your family even though
you're married, so you won't know

426
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,913
this, but if you get married, you
become a part of someone else's family.

427
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,343
Whether you live together
or not is very important.

428
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,064
Goodness. There's no such thing nowadays.

429
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:26,374
At first, she might feel unfamiliar and
uncomfortable, but just wait a few months.

430
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:29,614
It will feel like home to
her, so when she comes here,

431
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:31,680
she'll think, "I have to
hurry up and go home."

432
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,127
Mom! Mom! Mom! They called to tell me
that they'll be arriving in ten minutes.

433
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:38,284
- Really?
- Yes.

434
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:40,283
- Hurry up and prepare to set the table.
- Okay.

435
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,890
Looks delicious.

436
00:36:44,378 --> 00:36:46,159
Mrs. Baek, please sit with him.

437
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:49,627
Oh, goodness no. Why would an in-law
like myself receive your bow?

438
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:55,526
Please just sit with him. You took care
of Hae-dang like you were her mother.

439
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:57,722
That's true, but...

440
00:36:57,746 --> 00:37:00,471
Hurry up and sit down so we can
receive their bows and eat!

441
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,627
We'll live well.

442
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,299
Yes. You must.

443
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:32,783
Thank you for raising me and
taking care of me all this time.

444
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:37,065
It has finally hit me now.

445
00:37:38,651 --> 00:37:44,291
- Mrs. Baek, thank you for everything.
- You don't have to thank me.

446
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:50,323
Thanks to you, I was able to live
here without walking on eggshells.

447
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:54,819
You'll be living with your in-laws now,

448
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:58,393
so you won't be able to come here
as comfortably as you'd like,

449
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:02,963
- but if anything upsetting happens, give me a call.
- I will.

450
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,237
When you get married, the one
you miss the most is your mom.

451
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:12,416
Since your mom is not around,
you'll have to hold in a lot.

452
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:15,096
Don't hold it in and call me.

453
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,791
Okay, I'll do that.

454
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:31,282
Now I should call you my son-in-law.

455
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:35,612
I allowed her to get married to
you because of my faith in you.

456
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,127
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes. I'll love and cherish her.

457
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:45,933
- I'll pour you a drink.
- I'll pour you one first.

458
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:47,885
- Me?
- Yes.

459
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,100
Please take good care of our father-in-law.

460
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:01,682
Oh, don't you worry. I'm like his son.

461
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,940
He said that he wished to grow old
with me like I'm his son and friend.

462
00:39:07,698 --> 00:39:09,713
Did I say it was my wish?

463
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,158
- You said something similar to that.
- I don't remember.

464
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:22,908
Are you apathetic towards me now
that you have a wealthy son-in-law?

465
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:27,744
Goodness. Unlike the way you look,
you have quite a lot of jealousy.

466
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,312
That's because he doesn't
have any brothers.

467
00:39:31,483 --> 00:39:35,458
He's the only son, so he grew up
receiving all the love from our mom.

468
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:39,705
That's why sometimes he
acts like a child now, too.

469
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:44,244
I do not! My mom isn't the type of
person to accept such behavior either.

470
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:50,369
Of course she does! She fed you a lot
of delicious foods behind my back!

471
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:54,330
My goodness. So did you grow up starving?

472
00:39:55,901 --> 00:40:00,252
In spite of his appearance, she made
sure to make him three hot meals a day.

473
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,893
You and I ate all the cold rice, mom.

474
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:05,533
Didn't you guys have a rice cooker?

475
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:09,151
What I mean is that she
didn't feed him old rice.

476
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:11,488
She would only feed him new, soft rice.

477
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:14,065
You were raised so honorably?

478
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:19,612
Yes! In spite of my appearance, I
grew up never eating old rice!

479
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:25,190
- Then why don't you have any glamor?
- Of course he does!

480
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,484
He looks like this because
he was nagged by her

481
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,230
- ever since he got married.
- Mother.

482
00:40:29,254 --> 00:40:31,587
Before he was married,
he wasn't dripping with

483
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:33,844
glamor, but he didn't
look like he does now.

484
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,049
No way.

485
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:41,830
Stop it. I'm the new groom here.
I'm the star of the party.

486
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:44,776
That's right! That's right!

487
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,871
Goodness. Maybe it's because
you came here often before you

488
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,486
got married, but you already
seem like part of our family.

489
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,776
I feel like that, too.

490
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:55,338
Please take good care of Hae-dang.

491
00:40:56,307 --> 00:40:58,354
Please take good care of my father-in-law.

492
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:02,268
Why would you say that to her?

493
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,292
Throughout our honeymoon,
Hae-dang cried a few times

494
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,905
while wondering how she
could leave you behind.

495
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:19,846
It hasn't been long since Hae-soo passed
away, but now I'm leaving as well.

496
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:23,385
You must feel really empty.

497
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:25,737
Don't worry about me.

498
00:41:27,378 --> 00:41:30,830
I have the family on the second floor, and
I don't have time to be lonely either.

499
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:36,619
Mrs. Baek, please take good care of my dad.

500
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:39,315
Why do you keep saying that to me?

501
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:43,744
Don't say that to her. Say it to my face!
To my face!

502
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,393
How could she ask her to do that?

503
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:49,651
Have a drink.

504
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:57,065
Take this to your grandmother-in-law.

505
00:41:57,721 --> 00:41:58,721
Thank you.

506
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,401
Dad, I'll be going now.

507
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:07,698
- Okay. Bye, sweetie.
- Take care.

508
00:42:08,948 --> 00:42:13,112
Let me hug you one last time.

509
00:42:21,714 --> 00:42:26,166
- Thank you for being born as my daughter.
- I'll live well.

510
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:34,135
Although Hae-dang won't be
able to come over often,

511
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:37,877
I'll come every couple of
days, so don't be too sad.

512
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:42,057
Okay. Your grandmother
must be waiting. Go on.

513
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:44,260
- Okay.
- Bye.

514
00:42:47,307 --> 00:42:49,455
- Drive safely!
- Bye.

515
00:42:50,956 --> 00:42:53,266
Bye, Hae-dang.

516
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:10,862
Goodness. She left. She's gone.

517
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,853
What are you doing here?

518
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:48,940
She took everything she needed, so we
just have to clean up everything else.

519
00:43:57,487 --> 00:44:04,276
Now she's finally free from the tiresome
restraints of being Yoo Ji-na's imitator.

520
00:44:06,698 --> 00:44:07,698
I know.

521
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:25,514
Call the company and tell
Sung-hwan to come home early.

522
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:28,693
- Why?
- "Why?"

523
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,350
Hyun-joon and Hae-dang are coming today.

524
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:37,920
Do you think he'll come home and early and
accept their bows with an open heart?

525
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,679
Of course he should accept their
bows as the father-in-law.

526
00:44:40,703 --> 00:44:43,092
You have big dreams, mother.

527
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:49,482
Are you worried we'll make
you accept their bows?

528
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:03,732
Did you make a lot of different foods?

529
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:07,232
It would be burdensome for
us to make a big fuss.

530
00:45:07,716 --> 00:45:09,100
Are you her mother-in-law?

531
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,146
The way you talk.

532
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,029
Make three of four more things.

533
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:18,420
- If I do, do you think the family will properly eat them?
- Why wouldn't they?

534
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:23,584
Father hasn't allowed this marriage, so I'm
worried a war will break out at the table.

535
00:45:23,702 --> 00:45:28,248
Even though a war breaks out, make more
food. I'll eat them all if I have to.

536
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:35,873
- Welcome.
- Hello.

537
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,600
Welcome!

538
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,725
My family prepared these.

539
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:53,803
All right. Make sure you tell
them we'll gratefully enjoy them.

540
00:45:55,256 --> 00:45:59,810
Your father-in-law is busy with
work, so he'll be home late.

541
00:46:03,741 --> 00:46:05,865
Come inside. I should accept your bows.

542
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:10,826
Mother, we're back from our trip.

543
00:46:17,061 --> 00:46:20,021
So are you telling me to
accept your bow right now?

544
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:24,256
We'll live well.

545
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,068
Let's see if that will really happen.

546
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:31,193
What are you standing there for?
Why would you bow to her?

547
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:34,242
What right does she have
to receive your bow?

548
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,834
Don't worry. Even if they beg me to
accept their bows, I'll decline.

549
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:46,529
I became your daughter-in-law.

550
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:56,318
Fine. Go ahead and be my daughter-in-law.

551
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:15,689
Good.

552
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:19,896
Thank you for getting married
into our complicated family.

553
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:23,709
Even though I may be lacking,
please bear with me, grandmother.

554
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:30,881
Hyun-joon is a pitiful boy.
His future is in your hands.

555
00:47:31,717 --> 00:47:36,358
Even though it may be difficult,
I hope you can endure as this

556
00:47:36,382 --> 00:47:40,874
family's eldest daughter-in-law,
so that I can rest in peace.

557
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:43,873
I'll keep that in mind, grandmother.

558
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:53,301
- We should open up the wedding food. Please come out, grandmother.
- Should we?

559
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,280
Let's do that.

560
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:58,772
Goodness.

561
00:48:02,616 --> 00:48:09,639
Goodness. How modest. Your mother is not
around, so who prepared all of this?

562
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,865
Mrs. Baek did.

563
00:48:12,116 --> 00:48:16,654
- Oh, your sister's mother-in-law?
- Yes.

564
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:19,641
How kind of her. She cared for you like you

565
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:22,037
were her daughter being
sent off to marriage.

566
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:25,639
What's that?

567
00:48:27,116 --> 00:48:30,693
Can't you tell? It's wedding food.

568
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:33,999
Why are you laughing?

569
00:48:34,023 --> 00:48:38,365
Did you even think of preparing something
like this when you got married?

570
00:48:38,577 --> 00:48:41,764
If I knew you wanted it, I would've
hired someone to prepare it for you.

571
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,600
It doesn't even cost much.

572
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:47,287
This is done with sincerity, not money!

573
00:48:48,264 --> 00:48:50,131
What a vulgar thing you are.

574
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:55,412
Hae-dang, thank you for the
wedding gift you gave me.

575
00:48:56,178 --> 00:48:59,178
I gave it to the housekeeper,
so just keep that in mind.

576
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,740
What a vile brat!

577
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,180
So why did you waste your money on her?

578
00:49:08,327 --> 00:49:11,725
- Still, she's my mother-in-law.
- Mother-in-law, my foot!

579
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:15,451
You should've just tossed her a
couple pairs of outer socks.

580
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,844
- Why are you laughing?
- A couple pairs of outer socks?

581
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:21,350
Even that's a waste on her!

582
00:49:22,866 --> 00:49:27,771
Call your family and let them know we have
gratefully accepted the wedding food.

583
00:49:28,303 --> 00:49:29,303
Okay.

584
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:34,467
Welcome home, father.

585
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:40,959
Father, we're back from our honeymoon.

586
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:45,021
- Hi.
- Please accept our bows, father.

587
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:48,670
Is Hyun-joon going to bow to me, too?

588
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:51,787
I'll bring him downstairs.

589
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:54,163
Forget it.

590
00:50:01,491 --> 00:50:04,889
Your mother is destined to be the
death of three daughters-in-law.

591
00:50:05,748 --> 00:50:08,365
In the end, Jung Hae-dang
became my daughter-in-law.

592
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:12,576
Things have become like this anyways,
so we must make her be on our side.

593
00:50:12,905 --> 00:50:17,162
Are you crazy? Why would you
make her be on our side?

594
00:50:17,412 --> 00:50:22,623
We need to have someone on our side. You
can't overcome my mother on your own.

595
00:50:23,022 --> 00:50:26,654
- There's Ko Na-kyung.
- She's someone who can never be trusted.

596
00:50:27,342 --> 00:50:29,225
She's utterly useless.

597
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,521
I'm going to chase Hae-dang
out of here no matter what.

598
00:50:33,553 --> 00:50:35,787
My mother isn't an easy person to overcome.

599
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:40,603
Either she leaves or I do. One of
us will end up leaving this house.

600
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:57,857
- Good morning, mother.
- Are you out of your mind? How can you call me mother?

601
00:50:58,084 --> 00:51:01,350
If you don't want to hear it,
you can leave this house.

602
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,600
- So you're saying you eventually became my daughter-in-law, huh?
- Yes.

603
00:51:06,936 --> 00:51:09,326
How on earth can you and I
live under the same roof?

604
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:13,842
If you don't like it, you
can't leave this house.

605
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:18,193
Fine. Let's take this all the way.

606
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,256
I'll prepare breakfast.

607
00:51:28,756 --> 00:51:32,560
Why are you already doing kitchen work?
You should rest a few more days.

608
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,624
It's fine. What's the point of just
sitting down and doing nothing?

609
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:38,381
Do you remember what I told you before?

610
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:43,662
Why aren't you answering?
Do you have bad memory?

611
00:51:44,216 --> 00:51:47,407
Or are you saying the past
doesn't matter anymore

612
00:51:47,431 --> 00:51:50,684
since you became this
family's daughter-in-law now?

613
00:51:51,225 --> 00:51:53,920
I won't be competitive without
a purpose, and I'll make

614
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,686
sure to act the same whether
the family is around or not,

615
00:51:58,428 --> 00:52:02,678
so make sure you remember my words of telling
you to be careful with what you say.

616
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:05,131
"Make sure you remember?"

617
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:09,482
Both of us can just remember what we must.
Isn't that so, Na-kyung?

618
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:13,342
You said I don't have to call you
sister-in-law in front of the family.

619
00:52:13,702 --> 00:52:15,006
You don't.

620
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:22,026
- However, how could I speak with honorifics to my younger sister-in-law?
- What?

621
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:24,381
This is nothing for you to
shake with anger about.

622
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:26,833
Who on earth would shake
with anger because their

623
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:29,231
older sister-in-law doesn't
use honorifics with them?

624
00:52:31,155 --> 00:52:36,287
Wow. Look at her. There's no
easy person in this world.

625
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:39,381
What are you standing there for?
You need to cook the rice.

626
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:45,756
I can't believe this!

627
00:52:57,076 --> 00:53:01,748
Goodness. This is breakfast
prepared by Hae-dang.

628
00:53:03,295 --> 00:53:05,362
Na-kyung did almost everything.

629
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:11,529
My goodness. I get to eat food
that Hyun-joon's wife prepared.

630
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:15,131
I have no regrets. No regrets at all.

631
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:17,654
- Eat a lot, grandmother.
- I will.

632
00:53:19,577 --> 00:53:22,701
- What about Kyung-soo?
- He said he would be eating in the annex from now on.

633
00:53:23,295 --> 00:53:25,623
He'll only come by the
main house when necessary.

634
00:53:26,106 --> 00:53:29,881
Just hire a housekeeper
and make her work there.

635
00:53:30,217 --> 00:53:32,131
That would be convenient for him as well.

636
00:53:32,991 --> 00:53:38,576
It's uncomfortable for him to eat meals
with adults. So do that, Na-kyung.

637
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,217
Okay.

638
00:53:40,538 --> 00:53:42,193
- Mother.
- Why are you calling me?

639
00:53:43,279 --> 00:53:45,521
This is for family order.

640
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:49,625
Thanks to you, our family
became a mess, but

641
00:53:49,649 --> 00:53:52,381
there is something called the Maginot line.

642
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,498
- Do you have something to say to me?
- Kyung-soo is part of this family, too.

643
00:53:56,788 --> 00:53:58,529
That's why we're living together!

644
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,685
If you pity him so much,
go and cook for him.

645
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:06,903
If you don't want to cook for him, take the

646
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:09,360
leftovers from the main
house and feed them to him.

647
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,975
Are you done talking?

648
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:13,826
What do you think, Sung-hwan?

649
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:20,889
Must we make Hae-dang and Kyung-soo eat
with each other at the table every day?

650
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:23,993
Just so that your wife isn't offended?

651
00:54:25,483 --> 00:54:29,053
It doesn't matter where you eat. Let's eat.

652
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:31,748
Did you hear that?

653
00:54:32,295 --> 00:54:35,904
Even your trusted husband
wants it to be done.

654
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:37,655
Kyung-soo isn't adopted.

655
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,271
He's worth much less than
that to me because of you.

656
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:52,193
See? This is how it eventually turns out!
What were you talking about back there?

657
00:54:52,663 --> 00:54:55,982
Then should I tell Hyun-joon's
wife to not join us at the table?

658
00:54:56,185 --> 00:54:58,068
Why are you being pushed
around by your mother

659
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,093
when you can win against
her if you wanted to?

660
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:03,771
Besides transferring my shares,
what other power do I have?

661
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:07,811
The one who won't accept
my shares is your son.

662
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:11,646
Your son gave you a loss.

663
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:16,218
I'll never leave this alone.

664
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:23,108
No one can win against someone alone.
That's what a family is like.

665
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:32,982
Sung-hwan, come see me before you leave.

666
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:34,897
What is it?

667
00:55:35,185 --> 00:55:39,576
Give me the phone number of
Hyun-sung's friend who is a lawyer.

668
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:42,170
Do you need a lawyer?

669
00:55:42,334 --> 00:55:46,951
It would be nice if I got
some work for his friend.

670
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:51,514
He came over to our house, so
he should be good in some way.

671
00:55:52,084 --> 00:55:56,545
- Do you have his number?- I
got his name card before.

672
00:55:58,576 --> 00:56:00,482
- You have it?
- Yes. Here you go.

673
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:07,202
Im Cheol-woo? There's no
telephone number for his office.

674
00:56:07,623 --> 00:56:12,818
Really? Hyun-sung was the one who
always contacted him for me.

675
00:56:13,155 --> 00:56:15,014
I'll call his cell-phone number then.

676
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:18,060
- Okay. I'll be going to work then.
- All right.

677
00:56:26,764 --> 00:56:33,654
Hi. It's me. Send Mr. Yoon to my house.
I have something for him to do.

678
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:39,381
- So is Hae-dang doing well?
- Of course.

679
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,451
Is Yoo Ji-na saying anything harsh to her?

680
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:44,139
She has my grandmother.

681
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:49,123
We were curious about her. Thank you
for coming and telling us about her.

682
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,287
She should at least call often.

683
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:54,912
She's probably too conscious
of her in-laws to call.

684
00:56:55,381 --> 00:56:58,250
That's right. When you first
get married, it's difficult

685
00:56:58,274 --> 00:57:00,538
to even call people to
ask how they're doing.

686
00:57:00,562 --> 00:57:04,215
You don't even know how time flew by,
and you're too busy sleeping at night.

687
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,553
No news is good news.

688
00:57:07,342 --> 00:57:11,483
She'll be doing well. With her
personality, she'll survive anywhere.

689
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:15,098
My grandmother would like
to invite Mrs. Baek,

690
00:57:15,122 --> 00:57:17,748
Bong-sun, Hae-jin, and
Hae-sung to our home.

691
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:20,318
Me?

692
00:57:21,444 --> 00:57:23,850
She wants to thank you
for the wedding food.

693
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:28,865
- My goodness. She doesn't have to do that.
- What about me?

694
00:57:30,061 --> 00:57:33,795
- Do you think she'll like her in-laws to come over?
- Why not?

695
00:57:34,209 --> 00:57:38,123
There are many people who have never
been to their in-laws' house before.

696
00:57:38,436 --> 00:57:41,046
That's how you must be
delicate in-laws are.

697
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,342
Yet, we see each other every single day.

698
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:47,006
That's why we're not normal.

699
00:57:47,272 --> 00:57:50,631
But you can go over there?

700
00:57:51,045 --> 00:57:53,529
It's okay because I'm her in-law's in-law.

701
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:55,818
How could there be such a thing?

702
00:57:56,451 --> 00:58:00,100
She was just saying it to be nice.
We're not going there.

703
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:04,185
- I want to go.
- Me, too!

704
00:58:05,084 --> 00:58:07,232
I want to check how
Hae-dang is doing as well.

705
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:09,451
I want to see a conglomerate
family's house, too.

706
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,150
Tell her thank you for
her kind words and that

707
00:58:13,174 --> 00:58:15,624
we'll come by later when
we have the chance.

708
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:16,968
When is later?

709
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:19,482
Let's just let this one go, okay?

710
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:23,626
What's wrong with you? What is it?
Are you embarrassed?

711
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:27,667
If you go over there, you'll meet
Ji-na and Hae-dang's sister-in-law.

712
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:31,209
If you get into a fight, you'll
only cause trouble for Hae-dang.

713
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:35,185
Am I a fighter? Why would I fight over
there? You're embarrassed, aren't you?

714
00:58:36,936 --> 00:58:40,474
Aren't you embarrassed of your foolish
mother-in-law and housekeeper sister-in-law?

715
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:43,569
Why would we go over there and
say that I'm a housekeeper?

716
00:58:43,593 --> 00:58:48,131
- Look how she's not denying it!
- You know I can't lie.

717
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:54,850
What? Goodness. Forget it! I'm not going!
This is sickening.

718
00:58:55,044 --> 00:58:59,176
What if Ji-na picks on the wedding gifts?

719
00:58:59,464 --> 00:59:01,959
Do you have the confidence
to hold in your anger?

720
00:59:02,061 --> 00:59:04,101
Why would she pick on
perfect wedding gifts?

721
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:08,179
Do you think she won't be able to? She can
pick on it if she puts her mind to it.

722
00:59:08,203 --> 00:59:09,845
How could I let her just pick on them?

723
00:59:10,373 --> 00:59:13,999
How dare a woman who had abandoned her
child try to give Hae-dang a hard time?

724
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:18,771
All right. All right. I think it'd
be best if you guys went later on.

725
00:59:19,451 --> 00:59:22,656
Right? I have to deliver
parcels on that day, too.

726
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:25,257
- Let's just push back the date.
- Yes, yes.

727
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:27,498
- When is that day?
- Sorry?

728
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:29,615
We haven't even decided the date yet.

729
00:59:30,365 --> 00:59:34,028
Is that so? I just thought
it would be best to avoid

730
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:37,928
the things that should he
avoided for Hae-dang's sake.

731
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:41,553
It's fine, Hae-sung. They can fight.

732
00:59:42,186 --> 00:59:44,764
Our family is a War Diary anyways.

733
00:59:45,256 --> 00:59:48,990
It's strange if we don't
fight, so it doesn't matter.

734
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:56,053
What do you mean by that? Is
your family really a War Diary?

735
01:00:00,959 --> 01:00:04,068
No, I just... well...

736
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:06,357
I'm sorry.

737
01:00:09,241 --> 01:00:10,389
"War Diary."

738
01:00:11,506 --> 01:00:12,506
This is good.

739
01:00:14,038 --> 01:00:15,905
Did he even answer his call?

740
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:20,350
As you have ordered, I told him that Ms.
Ko Na-kyung had something to give to him.

741
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:21,842
Okay. Good job.

742
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:26,942
- What should I do after I meet him?
- I'm going to meet him myself.

743
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:42,951
- Do you remember my face?
- Of course.

744
01:00:44,123 --> 01:00:46,264
- What brings you here?
- Have a seat.

745
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:59,742
You can drink tea by yourself. I
don't drink just anything outside.

746
01:01:00,842 --> 01:01:02,357
- I'll order later.
- Sure.

747
01:01:05,116 --> 01:01:07,014
What did you come here for?

748
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:11,146
I'll give you ten times the amount
Ko Na-kyung promised to give you.

749
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,271
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Didn't you do this for money anyways?

750
01:01:21,802 --> 01:01:28,287
Or did you really fall
in love with Yoo Ji-na?

751
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:38,365
- Ten times the amount?
- Yes. Ten times the amount.

752
01:01:46,053 --> 01:01:51,343
The money Ms. Ko Na-kyung offered me
isn't a small amount though, Mrs. Sung.

753
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,554
How much did she offer you?

754
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:57,529
Did she offer you a million
dollars or ten million dollars?

755
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:04,068
Then are you saying you can
give me a million dollars?

756
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:09,006
My son gives me a million
dollars for pocket money.

757
01:02:10,373 --> 01:02:13,451
You clearly said a million, didn't you?

758
01:02:19,004 --> 01:02:20,725
($1,000,000)

759
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:30,646
What can I do for you?

760
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:33,178
Will you do anything I tell you to do?

761
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:36,959
If it's something I can
do, of course I will.

762
01:02:39,108 --> 01:02:40,108
Good.

763
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:46,942
I won't be able to go
out for the time being.

764
01:02:46,966 --> 01:02:49,889
After what happened at the
front gate, how can I go out?

765
01:02:50,264 --> 01:02:52,014
Let's see each other one last time then.

766
01:02:53,201 --> 01:02:55,934
I'm leaving to America next week anyways.

767
01:02:58,936 --> 01:03:00,693
I won't be able to come back for a year.

768
01:03:00,967 --> 01:03:06,404
- What are you talking about?
- I want to see you one last time.

769
01:03:19,741 --> 01:03:23,732
I was dying of worry for the past few days.
Nothing happened, right?

770
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:26,779
I'm going crazy sucking up to Ko Na-kyung.

771
01:03:28,881 --> 01:03:31,107
But why are you suddenly
leaving to America?

772
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:35,881
I didn't want to leave because of you,
but it looks like I'll have to go.

773
01:03:36,662 --> 01:03:39,248
- For one year?
- Visit me in America.

774
01:03:41,452 --> 01:03:42,873
I'll miss you. What will I do?

775
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:48,553
Who's that? Oh, it's parcel service.

776
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:52,857
Hold on. Just stay in bed.

777
01:03:55,803 --> 01:03:57,060
Is it parcel service?

778
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:16,881
You... You vulgar creature!

779
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,717
M-mother...

780
01:04:20,202 --> 01:04:22,959
You're over now!

781
01:04:55,045 --> 01:04:57,670
("You Are Too Much")

782
01:04:57,819 --> 01:05:01,211
They say a good person needs to come into
the family in order for it to be at peace.

783
01:05:01,327 --> 01:05:02,804
Are you saying she could pass away?

784
01:05:02,828 --> 01:05:04,954
Did you bring the evidence you collected?

785
01:05:05,154 --> 01:05:08,279
I gave it to Mrs. Sung.
Don't contact me again.

786
01:05:08,577 --> 01:05:11,240
So who is the woman who
fought with grandmother?

787
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:13,285
Who knows?

788
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,834
What happened that day? Did you
do something to Mrs. Sung?

789
01:05:17,108 --> 01:05:19,045
What a freak.

790
01:05:19,069 --> 01:05:20,225
Grandmother!

791
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:24,271
She set a bait to make me fall into a trap!

792
01:05:24,381 --> 01:05:28,303
What does it matter what I saw when
you had an affair with Im Cheol-woo?

793
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:31,410
This fight is over. Just
fall permanently asleep.
