1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,773
(Scavenger hunt six people)

2
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:01,859
The only event left is

3
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:03,015
the scavenger hunt.

4
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:09,927
I'll do it!

5
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:13,388
The scavenger hunt has another name...

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:14,921
Another name?

7
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:15,724
Yes.

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,565
It's called the 'Confession Event.'

9
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:19,520
Huh?

10
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,941
Every year, there's an event where

11
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:23,550
someone who draws that paper

12
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:24,900
has to confess on the spot.

13
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,652
Huh? What's up with that?

14
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:28,654
Yeah, exactly.

15
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:30,030
So,

16
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:31,425
those who want to confess

17
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,129
will target that paper,

18
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:34,910
but those who don't want to confess

19
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:36,753
will avoid participating in this event.

20
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:38,778
I was searching for you everywhere.

21
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:49,591
Come with me.

22
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:05,585
(Someone you like)

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,483
Let us

24
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,569
finish this race!

25
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:17,119
Sahara.

26
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:19,329
Dammit!

27
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:20,622
Well, it can't be helped.

28
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:22,082
Alright.

29
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:23,959
I'll carry you.

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,419
Your leg must hurt.

31
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:28,919
Oww!

32
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:10,767
"Mr. Sahara & Toki-kun"
(Episode 3)

33
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,380
(This is how Sahara and my story begins)

34
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:19,514
I forgot to return this.

35
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:22,768
(Someone you like)

36
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:26,072
That...

37
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:28,273
I drew it too.

38
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,317
Huh?

39
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:32,569
Someone you like.

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,237
Someone you like?

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,574
Did you confess?

42
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,635
I ate it.

43
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:43,789
Ate it?

44
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:44,790
Yeah.

45
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,333
Wait, the paper?

46
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:48,293
Really?

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,629
Just how much did you hate it?

48
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,242
I thought multiple times

49
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,390
that if it had been a different topic,

50
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,890
I could have confidently

51
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:00,890
gone to the 'someone you like' person,

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,650
and had fun with friends.

53
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,296
It became my only memory

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,452
of the sports festival.

55
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:18,240
A 'paper-swallowing incident'.

56
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:21,993
Just a funny story, right?

57
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:28,333
Haa...

58
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,335
If only I had crossed the finish line.

59
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:32,087
That's what I thought.

60
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,657
Someone you like?

61
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,352
What does that even mean?

62
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:54,109
Someone you like...

63
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,154
Does he have one?

64
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:58,739
The one that Sahara...

65
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,074
likes.

66
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:07,293
I guess he has one.

67
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:09,416
Yeah.

68
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,254
Huh? But what kind of person is it?

69
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,876
Someone like this.

70
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,017
Someone like that.

71
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:32,647
What...

72
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,649
What type exactly?

73
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:01,259
So, in the end,

74
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:03,470
Toki-kun,

75
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,781
what did he draw in the scavenger hunt?

76
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:07,182
Oh...

77
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:08,850
I wonder what it was.

78
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:12,646
Could it be...

79
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,656
"Someone you like?"

80
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,732
Who knows.

81
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:18,568
What a vague answer.

82
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,072
Ah.

83
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,400
By the way,

84
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:24,467
the other day during

85
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:25,716
English supplementary lesson,

86
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,896
Toki asked me to teach him

87
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:28,021
the kanji for Icchan.

88
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:29,209
Kanji?

89
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,080
Yeah.

90
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:31,581
The 'rou' in 'Ichirou.

91
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,037
It's like the word 'wolf'

92
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,743
which Toki-kun couldn't write.

93
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,285
Even during an English lesson,

94
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:37,587
I ended up teaching him kanji.

95
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,673
Is that so?

96
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,344
He's straightforward, pure,

97
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:46,179
and a bit clueless,

98
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:49,516
but that's what makes Toki-kun good.

99
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,561
If only people could accept

100
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,480
that straightforwardness.

101
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:16,710
Snow White?

102
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:19,212
Huh?

103
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:20,672
(Class Play 'Snow White' Cast)
Huh?

104
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,302
(For School Festival)

105
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:23,258
Congratulations, Toki-kun.

106
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,926
You got the lead role!

107
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:27,332
(Snow White)
Seriously, why is there

108
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:29,028
(Snow White)
a female role in this?

109
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,528
Let the girls do it! Come on.

110
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:34,561
I told you, it's an all-boys cast.

111
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:36,605
I'll even be the wicked stepmother.

112
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,648
Let's do our best together!

113
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:41,651
Ugh...

114
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:43,236
It's not bad, you know.

115
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,284
Getting to see you,

116
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:45,822
who is far from Snow White, in the role,

117
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,991
should be much more interesting and fun.

118
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,242
Huh?

119
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:51,745
Besides,

120
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:55,540
I want to see your acting as Snow White.

121
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:56,958
Huh?

122
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:57,959
Oh, right.

123
00:06:58,883 --> 00:06:59,869
There's also a kissing scene.

124
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,796
Huh? K-Kissing scene?

125
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:02,839
Huh?

126
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:04,336
Who am I supposed to kiss?

127
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,239
The prince.

128
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:07,677
The prince?

129
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,596
Who?

130
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,557
Huh?

131
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,480
That would be me...

132
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,317
Huh?

133
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,701
But don't worry,

134
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,046
it's not an actual kiss.

135
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,988
Just bring your faces close.

136
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,865
Yeah, it's just a play, after all.

137
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:31,201
A kissing scene, huh?

138
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:33,448
Looking forward to it.

139
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,213
Looking forward

140
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:47,658
to the kissing scene?

141
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,054
It would be my first kiss.

142
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,473
He doesn't understand others at all.

143
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,392
Ugh, dammit!

144
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:18,283
(Storeroom)

145
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:38,351
Huh?

146
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,520
An empty classroom...

147
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,439
Wide-open window...

148
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:45,150
Suicide?

149
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,659
Ouch...

150
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,908
What the hell are you doing?

151
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:56,995
Are you out of your mind?

152
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,038
What do you mean?

153
00:08:58,075 --> 00:08:59,088
If you're troubled,

154
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:00,252
you can talk to me about it!

155
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:02,167
Ah. Umm... It's not like that.

156
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:02,834
Huh?

157
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,544
I was trying to take a photo...

158
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:05,336
A photo?

159
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:07,862
Over there...

160
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:08,631
Huh?

161
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:17,265
Seriously...

162
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,380
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,102
No.

164
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,438
I'm the one who's sorry.

165
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,070
Yeah.

166
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:32,772
I'm Toki Kanade.

167
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,105
We're in the same grade?

168
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:36,409
Oh. Yes.

169
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:38,298
I'm in Class C.

170
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:40,246
I'm in Class D.

171
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,122
Class D?

172
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:42,248
Right next door.

173
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:43,583
Oh. Yes.

174
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,170
I'm Todo.

175
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,046
Todo...

176
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,525
Huh? Are you the

177
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:58,741
younger brother of that Todo?

178
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,281
Oh. Yes.

179
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,852
My name is Takuya.

180
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,787
Takuya.

181
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:06,147
Yes.

182
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,305
I'll get that for you.

183
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:27,085
Huh?

184
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:31,851
Here.

185
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,260
Did you take all these photos?

186
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,554
Thank you.

187
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:40,557
They're kind of lame, right?

188
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:44,644
No,

189
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:46,229
they're pretty amazing.

190
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,064
They're beautiful.

191
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,735
I don't know much about photography.

192
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:56,573
But yeah,

193
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:00,368
I like your photos.

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,995
Really?

195
00:11:07,473 --> 00:11:08,740
But...

196
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:10,488
you guys don't look much alike

197
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,624
for brothers.

198
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,554
I get told that a lot.

199
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:24,981
Ah.

200
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:28,188
Did I say something unnecessary?

201
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:35,091
(Class Play Venue This Way)

202
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:38,239
Wow, so many people.

203
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:40,263
It's packed!

204
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,746
Alright, everyone, gather around.

205
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:51,282
Let's show them

206
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:52,450
the results of our practice.

207
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:53,463
- Yeah.
- Sure.

208
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,548
Give it your all!

209
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,059
Oh!

210
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,343
Alright, let's do it!

211
00:11:58,367 --> 00:11:59,344
Do your best!

212
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:00,720
- Best of luck!
- Break a leg!

213
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,804
Good luck!

214
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,432
Oww..

215
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:06,351
It hurts.

216
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,728
Huh? Wait, are you okay?

217
00:12:08,752 --> 00:12:09,637
Stomach ache?

218
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:10,647
Are you alright?

219
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:12,565
Huh? Where does it hurt?

220
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,214
Huh? Stomach ache?

221
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:16,069
Stomach ache? It hurts, right?

222
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:17,195
What should we do?

223
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:20,485
Next up is the Class Play,

224
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,909
'Snow White, ' performs by Class 2-C.

225
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,827
Please enjoy!

226
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,543
Once upon a time,

227
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,086
in a castle far away,

228
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:17,088
there lived a

229
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:20,800
beautiful young woman named Snow White.

230
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,192
Snow White was a very kind person,

231
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:39,983
getting along with animals so well

232
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:42,466
that she even sang songs with them.

233
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,147
Ah, Mister bird.

234
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:57,045
Let's sing together!

235
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:15,271
Let him sit for a while.

236
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,909
Yes.

237
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:16,564
Miki.

238
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:18,053
What should we do?

239
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:19,750
There's only 30 minutes left.

240
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:22,862
Is there anyone who can substitute?

241
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:24,655
It's the prince role, too!

242
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,199
Ah!

243
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:27,492
- Huh?
- Huh?

244
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,832
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

245
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,169
who is the fairest of them all?

246
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,741
(Rise)
Ah! Oh my gosh!

247
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:43,299
(Rise)
Amazing, senior!

248
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:44,550
You are also

249
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:49,047
quite beautiful.

250
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,015
Hmm.

251
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:52,558
However,

252
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,805
there is someone

253
00:14:54,969 --> 00:14:56,646
much more beautiful,

254
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,038
tens or hundreds of times more

255
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:00,976
beautiful than you.

256
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:02,902
What?

257
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,870
Tens

258
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,314
or hundreds of times?

259
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:09,351
Who on earth is that?

260
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,203
That person is

261
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,541
Snow White.

262
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:19,502
Snow White?

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,334
What did you say?

264
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:24,941
She is more beautiful than me?

265
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,885
I won't allow it!

266
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:30,972
I absolutely won't allow it!

267
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:34,517
Soldier! Take Snow White to the forest,

268
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,477
and kill her!

269
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,311
Me?

270
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,148
Wait.

271
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:46,237
I will...

272
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:49,115
turn Snow White into a corpse!

273
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,008
Having consumed

274
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:58,158
the poisoned apple and perished,

275
00:15:58,306 --> 00:15:59,758
Snow White was carried to

276
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,110
the forest by the dwarfs.

277
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,839
They sat around her,

278
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,118
mourning for three days

279
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:07,368
and three nights.

280
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:20,188
Ugh! What should we do?

281
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,649
Did you find the substitute

282
00:16:24,665 --> 00:16:25,625
for the prince?

283
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,615
Huh?

284
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:32,997
It's not my fault if I forget the lines.

285
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,647
One day,

286
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,357
a handsome prince

287
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:07,902
appeared before Snow White.

288
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,328
What a beautiful princess.

289
00:17:17,922 --> 00:17:19,352
- Huh?
- Hmm?

290
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,456
No way.

291
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:22,282
Huh?

292
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:23,668
Why

293
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,087
is there so much commotion

294
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:26,220
in the audience?

295
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,986
How cool!

296
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,466
It's as if she's sleeping.

297
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,861
Wait a second, that voice...

298
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:38,775
Have I heard it somewhere before?

299
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:41,269
Hmm?

300
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:47,650
Huh?

301
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:49,395
Why...

302
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,321
Why is it Sahara?

303
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:02,456
Why are you holding back your laughter?

304
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,101
No, but,

305
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:24,270
you're too cool,

306
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:26,063
even if I don't know what's going on.

307
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:37,616
Close your eyes.

308
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,301
She's alive again!

309
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:36,819
The gymnasium was in chaos that day,

310
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:39,196
and my first kiss

311
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:41,031
tasted like blood.

312
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:56,839
With Sahara...

313
00:20:57,602 --> 00:20:59,341
The one I like...

314
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,512
First kiss!

315
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:07,099
Teacher,

316
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:08,918
I'm really sorry.

317
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:12,229
Saharan, let's take pictures!

318
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:13,439
Alright, cheese!

319
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:15,463
- So cool!
- Again!

320
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,234
Saharan, look this way!

321
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:18,527
Alright.

322
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,551
So cool!

323
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:21,947
Let me see!

324
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,161
Again.

325
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:31,957
Amazing!

326
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:43,048
It's so awkward!

327
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,680
I can't face anyone!

328
00:21:55,018 --> 00:21:56,524
What's with today?

(Sahara Ichiro)

330
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,447
Huh?

331
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:08,514
Sahara?

332
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:10,554
No way.

333
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:16,502
Today, I'm just preoccupied with Sahara,

334
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:18,170
so it only looks like Sahara.

335
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,342
Sahara!

Huh?

Swimming?

Is this Sahara?

346
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:48,719
It has nothing to do with you.

347
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,263
The reason that...

348
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:52,222
I...

349
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:54,062
Why did you hide and run away

350
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:55,664
from something so important?

351
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,144
