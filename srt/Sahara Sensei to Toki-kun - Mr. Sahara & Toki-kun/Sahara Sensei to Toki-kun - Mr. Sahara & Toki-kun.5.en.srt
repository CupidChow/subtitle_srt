1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,880
Be prepared to catch him.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,060
Huh?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,840
Take this!

4
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:14,827
Wait!

5
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:16,646
Now you won't be able to

6
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:17,656
play in today's match!

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,040
Serves you right!

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,140
Hold up!

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,080
- Is he okay?
- He seems fine.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,000
Rise, take him to the infirmary.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,540
And you?

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,580
I'll go after him!

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,620
Are you alright?

14
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,440
What should we do?

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,800
I should be safe now.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,200
Hey.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,180
You caused quite a scene,

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,620
even without you doing all that.

19
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:09,295
Todo has already decided

20
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:10,702
that he will not compete.

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,780
I know.

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,860
Did you hear the restroom talk?

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,069
Todo has a strong sense

24
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:25,210
of responsibility.

25
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,952
It's easier for him not to be able to

26
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:29,038
play because of me

27
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,663
than to bring it up himself.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,780
That would make you a villain.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,140
Fine by me.

30
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,700
A villain is fine,

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,740
being hated is fine!

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,920
You're foolish, aren't you?

33
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,180
It's fine.

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,040
It's not fine.

35
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:04,596
Don't get used to that kind of thing.

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,580
Got it?

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,300
I'm still a little angry, you know?

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,580
Yeah.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,340
Toki.

41
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,800
Hit me.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,340
Huh?

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,581
"Mr. Sahara &amp; Toki-kun"
(Episode 5)

44
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,784
(This is how Sahara and my story begins)

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,160
Come on.

46
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,580
Quickly, hit me.

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,060
Huh?

48
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,340
Why?

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
I slapped your hand the other day.

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,160
Is your lower back hurting?

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,100
To make up for that mistake.

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,580
Huh?

53
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,020
Who would do that?

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,186
Forget that I'm a teacher.

55
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,461
Now, come on.

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,760
Well then...

57
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,940
You...

58
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,600
You punched with a fist!

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,700
Sorry! It's just a bad habit.

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,860
Right, you used to be a delinquent, huh?

61
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,300
Sorry! I'm really sorry!

62
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,600
I thought my jaw was
going to be dislocated.

63
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,853
I've never seen Sahara

64
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,611
make that kind of face before.

65
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,126
I've never seen you

66
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,611
laugh like that either.

67
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,740
No, this isn't it...

68
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,360
Toki.

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,320
How about we talk about the past?

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,020
Huh?

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,260
You're in the infirmary.

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
Infirmary...

73
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,660
I see.

74
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,100
I...

75
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,480
Toki-kun...

76
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,240
Taku-chan?

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,240
Long time

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,960
no see.

79
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,300
Huh? Why are you here?

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,060
I was called by Toki-kun.

81
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,640
No, actually, he helped me to get here.

82
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,500
Sorry!

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,800
Huh?

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
I couldn't persuade Todo.

85
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
I tend to say unnecessary things,

86
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,215
and honestly,

87
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:42,832
I thought of not meddling any further.

88
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,780
But what do you want to do?

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,340
Being asked that by Toki-kun...

90
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,660
So, I wanted to talk to you.

91
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,540
I also wanted to talk to you.

92
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,720
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,900
I kept avoiding you.

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,300
It's not like that!

95
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,300
Taku-chan,

96
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,576
you tried so hard to become

97
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:26,787
a part of the family...

98
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,640
Even so,

99
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,140
I...

100
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,715
Taku-chan and I

101
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,309
have been together since we were born.

102
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,720
I thought my childhood friend

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
was more than a brother to me.

104
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,380
But...

105
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,080
when we actually became brothers,

106
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,840
it felt distant.

107
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,400
As I grew older,

108
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,660
we became more distant from each other.

109
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,581
I wondered if it was okay

110
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:01,789
for my younger brother...

111
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:02,547
No,

112
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:05,800
for me to step into your life any more.

113
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,807
At that time, I happened to

114
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:23,073
overhear something.

115
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,370
'I've never thought of him

116
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:27,426
as a brother.'

117
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,200
Taku-chan.

118
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,940
I didn't know what to do,

119
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,560
so I ran away.

120
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,620
I'm sorry for making you sad.

121
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,500
But that

122
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,680
wasn't because I don't like you.

123
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,220
No, on the contrary,

124
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,640
to me,

125
00:07:57,306 --> 00:08:00,360
you are more than a brother.

126
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,300
Come back home.

127
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,380
It's not fun without Taku-chan.

128
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,360
Let's play together like we used to,

129
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,960
talk,

130
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,340
cry,

131
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,600
and laugh together.

132
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,940
I want you by my side.

133
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,580
That sounds like a proposal.

134
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:51,880
Huh?

135
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,100
That's not what I meant...

136
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,740
I'm just kidding.

137
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,520
If you're okay with me...

138
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,460
Huh?

139
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,780
Taku-chan!

140
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,780
I'm glad!

141
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:15,540
I'm so glad!

142
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
Really, Shin-chan,

143
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,095
you're a crybaby in front of me.

144
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,800
Whoa! This lake is amazing!

145
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:33,880
What do you mean amazing?

146
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,380
Shut up!

147
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Anyway, why a lake?

148
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,436
Once you've come this far,

149
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:41,631
you don't have to worry about

150
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,037
acquaintances seeing us.

151
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,780
Remember the story about

152
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:48,686
not confessing during

153
00:09:48,702 --> 00:09:49,772
the sports festival?

154
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,660
That...

155
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,920
I drew it too.

156
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,920
Huh?

157
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,860
Someone you like.

158
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,660
Someone you like?

159
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,980
I remember.

160
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,780
After that, I did it.

161
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,220
I confessed.

162
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,240
Huh?

163
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,980
It was on graduation day.

164
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:17,221
I didn't have any intention

165
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:18,589
of expressing my feelings,

166
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,307
but they said

167
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:21,932
they would accept everything.

168
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,700
I had hope,

169
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,448
and for the first time,

170
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:26,987
I expressed my true feelings.

171
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,640
I was splendidly rejected.

172
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,840
Huh?

173
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,920
I wondered why

174
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,616
and I felt betrayed and resentful.

175
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,079
But I also thought maybe

176
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,470
I was the one who caused

177
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:56,643
the disillusionment.

178
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,480
Since then,

179
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
I decided to stop falling in love.

180
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,740
Were you that into them?

181
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,020
That person

182
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,427
was a junior on the swim team,

183
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,902
and my first love.

184
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,060
Come on.

185
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,540
Sahara's first love...

186
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,099
I wonder what kind of person they were.

187
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,540
Hey.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,480
Did you quit swimming

189
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,900
because of of your first love?

190
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,411
Why would you think that?

191
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,300
No.

192
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,660
I mean,

193
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,380
you were both on the swim team, right?

194
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,420
So...

195
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,247
You were rejected and

196
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:58,380
things got awkward,

197
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,653
maybe you ended up going

198
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:01,736
to the same university.

199
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,180
That's not it.

200
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
It would have been better

201
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,461
if that were the case.

202
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,765
I thought I destroyed

203
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,454
the image of a respected senior

204
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,171
and let him down.

205
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,603
So, at least I wanted to be cool

206
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,260
as a swimmer.

207
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:27,079
In university, I kept swimming,

208
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,440
pushing myself over and over again.

209
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,220
I was relentless.

210
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
My waist started to hurt.

211
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,158
I should have consulted with the coach

212
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,690
or my teammates right away,

213
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,713
but the expectations and gazes

214
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:04,197
around me didn't allow that.

215
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,760
Huh?

216
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,840
So,

217
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,360
what happened?

218
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,140
It was broken.

219
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,900
My career as an athlete was over.

220
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,680
The way people looked at me changed.

221
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,424
They treated me like I was fragile,

222
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:57,877
like they'd given up on me...

223
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,380
but the hardest part was...

224
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,775
It was the second time

225
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,078
they got disappointed in me.

226
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:09,422
Don't push yourself.

227
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,860
Thank you.

228
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,280
I see...

229
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,460
Rehabilitation for a while.

230
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,900
What a shame.

231
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,560
Really...

232
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,439
What are you doing?

233
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,240
Earlier,

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,631
when you asked me about swimming,

235
00:14:56,655 --> 00:14:57,873
and I brushed you off,

236
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,300
it was because of this.

237
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm scared.

238
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,224
I'm terrified of people knowing

239
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,249
my miserable and pitiful past.

240
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm afraid of people seeing this scar,

241
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,812
and of meeting someone

242
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,171
who knows my old self.

243
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,340
This scar is hurting like a curse,

244
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,060
it's reminding me even now.

245
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:02,888
I've been thinking for a long time.

246
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,540
Why can't I get closer to you?

247
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,080
Why...

248
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,400
can't I understand you?

249
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,860
But now I finally understand.

250
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,460
You...

251
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,657
Some part of your heart,

252
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:29,954
you don't believe in me.

253
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,500
Everybody has one or two flawed parts.

254
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,160
Even if they have them...

255
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,300
I won't be disillusioned.

256
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,980
Believe in me more.

257
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,640
Does it hurt?

258
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,040
It's ticklish.

259
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,880
Whoa, I'm wet all over!

260
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,620
Sahara, isn't it bad
having it look like this?

261
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, they'll dry eventually.

262
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,000
It's cold.

263
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,420
Isn't that Toki?

264
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,800
I haven't seen his companion before.

265
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,820
Oh, he's a teacher from Toki's school.

266
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,480
Hmm...

267
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,120
It's not that I don't believe you.

268
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,740
Huh?

269
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,600
Actually, if I didn't believe you,

270
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,600
I wouldn't be telling you.

271
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,140
I see.

272
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,140
Huh?

273
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,280
Huh?

274
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,100
Huh? Umm...

275
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,980
You mean...

276
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
Is it possible that you,

277
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,560
like me?

278
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,560
Keep it down.

279
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,840
Huh?

280
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,460
Was I right?

281
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,829
I thought you had

282
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:01,266
already figured it out.

283
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,300
Huh?

284
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,501
You're making things

285
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:09,908
unnecessarily complicated!

286
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,673
If you don't say it clearly,

287
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:15,102
it won't get through.

288
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,360
As I said earlier,

289
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,160
it's not about not trusting you.

290
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,540
It's my own issue.

291
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,009
Even if I try to say it,

292
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,650
I can't put it into words properly.

293
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Just a two words feel too long for me.

294
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,560
Earlier doesn't count!

295
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,120
Huh?

296
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
No matter what, I'll wait for you.

297
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,392
When that time comes,

298
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,963
I will

299
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:57,206
respond with all my heart.

300
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,180
Got it?

301
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,153
Why do you act

302
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,036
so manly at times like this?

303
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,340
What? Wanna fight?

304
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,580
No way.

305
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,180
Wait for me.

306
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,780
It might take some time,

307
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,560
but when the time comes, I'll tell you.

308
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,120
Sure!

309
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,520
I headbutted Todo, so...

310
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,460
The girls must be angry.

311
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,780
No,

312
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I decided to do it!

313
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,140
I'll embrace the role of the villain!

314
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,860
Good morning.

315
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,980
Toki-kun!

316
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,720
Good morning.

317
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,960
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

318
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,020
Uh, yeah...

319
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,620
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

320
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,779
Senior Todo

321
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:22,722
said Toki-kun saved him

322
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:25,199
from talking about the injury.

323
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:28,380
So that's why everyone was so friendly.

324
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,800
Toki-kun, did something good happen?

325
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,520
Huh?

326
00:21:34,855 --> 00:21:36,075
Your face looks refreshed.

327
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,620
Hmm?

328
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,956
After the headbutt yesterday,

329
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:41,976
where did you go?

330
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,520
Huh?

331
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,817
I don't think Sahara sensei

332
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:45,056
was around either.

333
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,020
Did something good happen?

334
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,580
Ah.

335
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,400
Huh?

336
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,400
Hmm?

337
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,520
No! No such thing!

338
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,460
Where are you going?

339
00:21:54,764 --> 00:21:55,520
Toki-kun.

340
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,540
Toki-kun.

341
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,280
I hope this continues in the future.

342
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,340
And about Sahara, too...

343
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:09,907
The advisor for the swimming club?

344
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,660
Yes.

345
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,660
Why did you change your mind?

346
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,320
Well, a lot has happened.

347
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:20,252
It's a delightful offer,

348
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,963
but truth be told, we were planning to

349
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:23,276
ask a new teacher for the role.

350
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,420
A new teacher?

351
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,120
The new teacher
