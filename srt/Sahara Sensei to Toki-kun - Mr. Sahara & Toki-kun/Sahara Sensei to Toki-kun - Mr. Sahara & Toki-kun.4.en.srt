1
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,083
That was

2
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:42,918
an accident.

3
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,716
But...

4
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:46,490
the fact remains that it happened

5
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:48,195
with the person I like.

6
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:55,020
Calm down.

7
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,707
- Calm down.
- Toki!

8
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:05,786
Sa...

9
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:06,813
ha...

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,580
ra!

"Mr. Sahara &amp; Toki-kun"
(Episode 4)

12
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:51,893
(This is how Sahara and my story begins)

13
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:02,600
Are you okay?

14
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:12,299
Sahara.

15
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,969
Why are you here?

16
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:17,429
Well,

17
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:20,874
no reason.

18
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,606
When I come here, I feel calm.

19
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,529
I see.

20
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,067
For me, this place is...

21
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,814
Are you okay?

22
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,560
Umm... You know...

23
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:55,300
After that.

24
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,701
Oh, it was tough.

25
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:03,145
Being chased around

26
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,911
for photos and stuff.

27
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,353
Oh no!

28
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,680
- Just take more photos.
- Huh? Wait.

29
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,211
And you, Toki? Are you okay.

30
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:19,499
The blood.

31
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:33,400
There's none!

32
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,592
Moreover...

33
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,387
stealing a kiss from you.

34
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,347
Was it okay?

35
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,710
It's not like I care!

36
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:49,271
Even though it's just my first kiss.

37
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:50,772
Got a problem with that?

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,120
It was my first time too.

39
00:03:59,213 --> 00:03:59,993
Huh?

40
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:03,452
Why are you making that face?

41
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:04,884
It's a lie!

42
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,837
Definitely a lie!

43
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,240
It's not a lie.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,520
Well, you know...

45
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,841
Don't worry about it.

46
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,140
First kiss...

47
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:21,928
Was it Sahara's first kiss, too?

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,848
Ah!

49
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,380
Right!

50
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,019
This...

51
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:30,270
There here.

52
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:32,323
This is Sahara, right?

53
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,025
(The New Rising Star in

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,800
Amazing.

56
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,169
In high school, you went to

57
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:42,556
the national tournament,

58
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,630
and in college,

59
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,325
you were an Olympic candidate.

60
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,260
And what about it?

61
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,720
What about it?

62
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:53,440
I didn't mean to meddle,

63
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,440
but I didn't know about it.

64
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,372
I just thought Sahara

65
00:05:02,397 --> 00:05:04,692
must have been in some sports.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,420
You're fast

67
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,160
and strong.

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,560
Hey, are you still swimming?

69
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,920
What's wrong? Are you okay?

70
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,340
Oh. Is your lower back hurting?

71
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,240
Sorry.

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,560
It's none of your business.

73
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,360
Sahara's hands always touch me gently.

74
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,360
For the first time,

75
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,154
I was rejected by those hands.

(Seiryu High School)

77
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,180
Ugh.

78
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,080
What's wrong?

79
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,580
I don't understand.

80
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,005
I don't understand anything

81
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,380
about Sahara.

82
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,300
Ah!

83
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,180
You're Todo's younger brother!

84
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,240
Perfect timing.

85
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,140
Perfect timing?

86
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,840
Yes.

87
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,260
Well...

88
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,180
Here you go.

89
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,460
I was planning to give you this later.

90
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,900
Huh? What's this, a photo?

91
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,040
Whoa!

92
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,960
This is...

93
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,480
I hope I'm not troubling you.

94
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,740
I will gladly accept it.

95
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,600
Could you do me a favor

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,080
in exchange?

97
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,080
A favor?

98
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,220
What is it?

99
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,721
Could you tell that person

100
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:10,900
not to play in the

101
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:13,127
upcoming basketball game?

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
That person?

103
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,680
Oh, your brother?

104
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:24,040
Yes.

105
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,520
Wait,

106
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,562
you took a picture of him?

107
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:30,988
It was during morning practice,

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,617
I usually only take pictures

109
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:33,762
of landscapes.

110
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,172
When I was little,

111
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:44,157
that person asked me to take pictures

112
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:45,982
of him playing basketball.

113
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,660
I see...

114
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,011
And I've been taking pictures

115
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,356
every day since then.

116
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,540
Every day?

117
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,820
Doesn't it get boring?

118
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,380
Absolutely not.

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,480
Wow...

120
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,140
you're really loyal to your brother.

121
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,246
I think it's closer to 'attachment'

122
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:11,207
more than loyal.

123
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,380
Is his lower back hurting?

124
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,154
If he plays in the game,

125
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:24,560
he'll definitely push

126
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,997
himself to the limit.

127
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,820
Well, I can stop him.

128
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,920
But aren't you faster than me?

129
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,580
Why me?

130
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,780
Well, that's...

131
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,520
Taku-chan.

132
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,740
Ah.

133
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,880
Wait, Taku-chan!

134
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,280
Todo.

135
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,240
Here.

136
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,160
Oh. Thank you.

137
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,469
Sorry for showing you

138
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:28,174
that ugly scene earlier.

139
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,920
Sibling quarrel?

140
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:34,700
Umm...

141
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,120
Where should I start explaining?

142
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,214
First,

143
00:09:43,238 --> 00:09:45,323
I'm relieved that Taku-chan seems fine.

144
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,495
I was surprised

145
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,011
he lost some weight, though.

146
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,780
Don't you live together?

147
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,160
It's more like he ran away from home.

148
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,026
Seems like right now,

149
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,347
he's staying with Uncle.

150
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,208
Seems like?

151
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:12,362
Actually, Taku-chan and

152
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:13,974
I aren't blood-related.

153
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:15,552
We're childhood friends.

154
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
Huh?

155
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,700
His original surname is 'Fujimura.'

156
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Our mothers were childhood friends,

157
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,760
and we've been together since birth.

158
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,560
But...

159
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:35,235
But on Taku-chan's seventh birthday,

160
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,259
his parents

161
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,399
got into an accident on their way back

162
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:40,086
from buying a birthday present.

163
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,040
So, he ended up at your place?

164
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,820
Yeah,

165
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,360
we took him in.

166
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,720
But since that day,

167
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:55,989
he started to see everything

168
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:56,803
as his fault

169
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:57,942
and became pessimistic.

170
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,807
He distanced himself from people.

171
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,580
Taku-chan has no friends.

172
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,679
He doesn't want to inconvenience anyone.

173
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,860
Hmm?

174
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,400
Huh?

175
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:28,017
But he approached me today on his own.

176
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,120
Maybe he's drawn to you.

177
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,400
Honestly, I envy you, Toki-kun.

178
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,720
I...

179
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,285
could only hold on to Taku-chan

180
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:55,396
with the label of a stepbrother.

181
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,996
The cause of Taku-chan's

182
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:11,378
running away from home

183
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:12,402
was me.

184
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,480
I said something like

185
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:18,299
'I've never thought of you

186
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:19,755
as my little brother'

187
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,920
Huh?

188
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,400
I said it indirectly.

189
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,252
It seems he heard it from

190
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,877
my conversation with friends,

191
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,060
he felt responsible, and left.

192
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,720
Why would you say something like that?

193
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,700
It's not like he would understand

194
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,940
that I like him as a lover.

195
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,333
Yeah...

196
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,120
Huh?

197
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,580
Huh?

198
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,460
Hey, how about you substitute for me?

199
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,060
Huh?

200
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,575
No way, we're from different classes

201
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,583
and grades.

202
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,960
No way!

203
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:05,075
Absolutely not.

204
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,696
That's the one thing I can't do!

205
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
Why panic?

206
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,360
Ah!

207
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,200
Do you have someone you like?

208
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,380
N-no, I don't have anyone I like!

209
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,678
Then you should

210
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,899
honestly convey those feelings!

211
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:36,260
No. It's impossible.

212
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,600
If I say it,

213
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,695
it won't end with just

214
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,053
running away from home.

215
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,640
That's why

216
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,860
I'll never say it in my life.

217
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,720
But earlier, that guy gave me a photo...

218
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,880
He was worried about you!

219
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,960
About your lower back.

220
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:03,342
He said

221
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:05,131
not to play in the match tomorrow.

222
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,720
Did he find out?

223
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,652
But that doesn't mean

224
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,347
I should convey my feelings.

225
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,600
Why?

226
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,960
Why are you trying to dodge

227
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:31,789
and escape from important things?

228
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,160
Toki-kun, you won't understand.

229
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,300
Huh?

230
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,505
Your straightforwardness

231
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,755
is truly amazing.

232
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
But, you know,

233
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,029
not everyone can be

234
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,474
as straightforward as you.

235
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,480
You...

236
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,029
The words you just said

237
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,076
can only be used to force others.

238
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,020
(The day of the match)

239
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,020
I'm sorry! Sorry!

240
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,180
Ah, sorry.

241
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,980
Thank you.

242
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,240
Icchan.

243
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,320
You came.

244
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,480
Yeah.

245
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:12,799
And

246
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:14,570
when I came into the restroom,

247
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,795
there you were...

248
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,320
(Pain and fever relievers)
Can't just ignore this.

249
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,505
I won't return these

250
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:25,036
until you tell me everything.

251
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,980
Since when?

252
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,240
At first, it was my left leg.

253
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,188
After spraying the pain reliever

254
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:47,368
on my sprained ankle,

255
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,040
the strain affected my lower back.

256
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,980
Does the advisor know about this?

257
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,900
No,

258
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,933
I've been playing carefully

259
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,315
so it wouldn't be noticed.

260
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,420
But it seems like Taku-chan noticed.

261
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,876
Even so,

262
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,407
I won't withdraw from the match.

263
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,953
I want to meet everyone's expectations

264
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:21,860
and win.

265
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,900
Todo.

266
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,120
But most importantly,

267
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,440
I want Taku-chan to watch.

268
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,733
That's the remaining purpose

269
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:34,030
for me right now.

270
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,200
You really love your brother, huh?

271
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,320
- That's not it...
- I had an acquaintance...

272
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,640
in a similar situation.

273
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,760
Huh?

274
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,191
He struggled a lot,

275
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,785
had no one to talk to,

276
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,580
just desperately practiced.

277
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,900
Because that was his only purpose.

278
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,020
Eventually, he didn't listen

279
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,254
to those around him.

280
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,715
Crushed by various pressures,

281
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,940
he broke down.

282
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,280
Both mind and body...

283
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,140
That's why you

284
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,660
shouldn't ignore the voices

285
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,658
of those who watch over you,

286
00:18:58,689 --> 00:18:59,814
the ones who would stop you

287
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,216
from making mistakes.

288
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Got it?

289
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,700
I...

290
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,509
I said some pretty harsh things

291
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:16,534
to Toki-kun.

292
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:19,372
Yeah.

293
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,180
Aren't you mad?

294
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,080
Why would I be mad at you?

295
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,280
Well...

296
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,420
Not everyone's strides are the same.

297
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,095
Someone else's one step might be

298
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,053
two or three steps for others.

299
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,020
You don't have to become like Toki.

300
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,300
Toki is Toki.

301
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:02,027
You should take your own step forward.

302
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,240
Icchan.

303
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,660
What do you want to do?

304
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,620
I'll take a break today.

305
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:31,272
For the sake of Taku-chan,

306
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:33,816
who was worried about me.

307
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,500
I see.

308
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,680
Ah.

309
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,632
But if I say it before the match,

310
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,696
it might be a bother...

311
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,140
Better than something happening

312
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:45,421
during the game.

313
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,200
I'll say it together with you.

314
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,660
Alright.

315
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,620
Oh!

316
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,600
- Senior Todo, do you best today!
- I'll be rooting for you!

317
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,580
- Today, I came...
- Senior, I'll cheer you on!

318
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
Give it your all!

319
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,380
Can we take a picture together?

320
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,340
I'll take it for you.

321
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Please take it for me.

322
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Do you best! I'll be watching.

323
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,400
- I'll take it for you.
- You okay?

324
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,700
Ah.

325
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,460
Toki-kun.

326
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,620
Be prepared.

327
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:00,640
Huh?

328
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,340
Take this!

329
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,813
Hah! Now you won't be able to

330
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:13,076
play in today's match!

331
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,800
Serves you right!

332
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Hold on!

333
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,480
- Is he okay?
- He seems fine.

334
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,420
Rise, take him to the infirmary.

335
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,980
And you?

336
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,140
I'll go after him!

337
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,040
Are you alright?

338
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,840
What should we do?

339
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,080
Let's have the teacher take care of him.

340
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,720
Are you okay? Hurry.

341
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,120
Are you okay?

342
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,100
Can you slowly get up?

343
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,800
I should be safe now.

344
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,300
Hey!

345
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:46,660
(Next episode)
Let's talk.

346
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,100
About the past.

347
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,254
Did you really like

348
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,495
that person that much?

349
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,140
It's pathetic.

350
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,840
I'm afraid of my past being discovered.

351
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,060
Deep inside, you don't trust me.
