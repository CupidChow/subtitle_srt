1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,660
He's special, right?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,840
Toki-kun.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,880
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,220
Very special.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,960
Then, why don't you go after him?

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,100
Nekoto,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,760
thank you.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,639
Isn't it out of character for you

9
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,021
to suddenly disappear?

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,520
It's not like that.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,400
I just got tired of silently listening.

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,880
And besides...

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,080
I believe you, after all.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,680
What?

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,340
What? A thank you, maybe?

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,610
(Nursing facility)
Thank you for your hard work.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,960
Oh,

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,960
Nekoto.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
How about some drink?

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,880
Hmm! It's good!

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,540
Thank you for your hard work.

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,100
How about you?

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,640
Did you make up with Sahara?

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,360
This might be

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,300
a bit surprising.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,320
Senior Sahara and I,

27
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
back in high school,

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,960
we had mutual feelings for each other.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,580
Hmm...

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,460
I like you.

31
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,324
The meaning of liking for you and me

32
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,160
is just too different.

33
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,565
During the graduation ceremony,

34
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,790
I rejected him.

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,600
Even though I rejected him, I confessed.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,140
Wait, when?

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,100
Today.

38
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,840
And I got turned down splendidly.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,300
I see...

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,080
I didn't intend to confess.

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,100
I'm not qualified to do that either.

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,520
Besides, Senior Sahara...

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,760
You were amazing today.

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,006
Well,

45
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:08,295
the current me

46
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:11,076
is a super invincible man.

47
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:30,743
Well,

48
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:33,610
- already has someone he likes.
- if you won't drink, I will.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,260
Why? Weren't you going to throw it away?

50
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,840
Yet, I confessed...

51
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,958
I envied him,

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,849
as he could openly and

53
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:42,233
naturally love him

54
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:46,164
without a care in the world.

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,370
I knew it.

56
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,870
I knew about what you

57
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,136
both felt for each other

58
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,331
and what happened at

59
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,714
the graduation ceremony.

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,360
I had a feeling about it.

61
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,040
You did your best.

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Yeah...

63
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,140
Thank you very much.

64
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,980
Yeah.

65
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,782
"Mr. Sahara &amp; Toki-kun"
(Episode 8)

66
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,476
(This is how Sahara and my story begins)

67
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,860
Alright!

68
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
When I was in elementary school, here...

69
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,855
What's up with Toki?

70
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,740
Toki, what are you doing!

71
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,200
Hey, Toki!

72
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,100
What's this? Hey, Toki!

73
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,980
Toki!

74
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
What's up with Toki?

75
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,760
Hey, why, Toki?

76
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,060
Toki, hey!

77
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,280
Cut it out.

78
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,280
What are you doing?

79
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,780
Are you alright?

80
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,320
I wanted to become like him...

81
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,440
so I entered the same high school, and

82
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,820
then I met Sahara.

83
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,500
(Do your best - Sahara)
I'm not wrong, am I?

84
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,712
But seriously,

85
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:56,854
there are so many universities!

86
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,080
Oh!

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,720
Long time no see, Toki.

88
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,640
Yo!

89
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:08,300
Good morning!

90
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,920
Good morning.

91
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,180
What's wrong? Did something happen?

92
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,880
No, it's nothing.

93
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,440
Hey, Toki!

94
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:27,655
Are you okay?

95
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,520
Toki!

96
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:31,400
Hey, Toki! Are you okay?

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,280
(Infirmary)

98
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,820
Stop it!

99
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,820
Stop it!

100
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,940
What's this?

101
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,120
This is...

102
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,900
Did you get into a fight?

103
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,840
No!

104
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,620
I kept our promise.

105
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,880
But...

106
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,180
But?

107
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,097
I got jumped by some guys

108
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,105
from another school near the riverbank.

109
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,500
And I took a few hits.

110
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,980
I know it might be hard to believe.

111
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,220
I believe you.

112
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,791
Just please don't get hurt.

113
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,200
Are you...

114
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,640
not mad at me, but worried about me?

115
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,960
If anything were to happen to you,

116
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,420
I'm not sure I could stay sane.

117
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,840
Take a break for the first period.

119
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:51,680
Come to class once you've calmed down.

120
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,960
And about those guys who attacked you...

121
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,600
If anything happens,

122
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
consult me first.

123
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,660
Yeah.

124
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,280
Guess I'll go to class.

125
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,680
Huh, students from another school?

126
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,793
Yes, did you see them?

127
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,176
You saw them, right?

128
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,377
Yeah, they were peeking

129
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,502
from the school gate.

130
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,340
They looked like delinquents, so scary.

131
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,140
I wonder why they came here.

132
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,280
- I have no idea.
- So terrifying.

133
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,781
This is payback for

134
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:30,204
the stupid things I did in the past.

135
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,120
So...

136
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,300
Sahara...

137
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,580
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,000
Toki-kun, can you go to class?

139
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,240
Toki-kun!

140
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,540
Rise.

141
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,900
Sorry.

142
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,260
Please don't stop me.

143
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,920
Hey, Toki-kun,

144
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,761
if you're struggling,

145
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:00,956
it's okay to say so.

146
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:04,135
I'm the type who always

147
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,743
tries to handle things alone.

148
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:08,640
So I understand your feelings.

149
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,354
But sometimes, sharing the burden with

150
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:15,046
someone else can make you feel lighter.

151
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,640
Rise...

152
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,151
So, if you have something

153
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,767
you're dealing with,

154
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,100
you can rely on me.

155
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,520
But this is my problem.

156
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,100
I don't want to bother my friends.

157
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,780
Is it something you can't even ask

158
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:41,062
Sahara sensei to help you with?

159
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,760
No.

160
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,660
But I don't want to bother Sahara.

161
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,740
Toki-kun!

162
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,300
About those guys who attacked you...

163
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,117
If anything happens,

164
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:05,601
consult me first.

165
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,900
Yeah.

166
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,580
That expression...

167
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,822
it's like he's determined to

168
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:18,779
handle everything on his own.

169
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,340
Sahara-sensei, Toki-kun is...

170
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,680
What's this? How lame.

171
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,820
I don't know.

172
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,440
You don't?

173
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
What's up with him?

174
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,920
Hey,

175
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,700
you finally showed up, Toki.

176
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,820
Did you want this back so badly?

177
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,337
If you do, try to take it back

178
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:49,025
in a serious showdown!

179
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,545
(Kinouchi University)

180
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,880
Where did he go?

181
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,160
Did you get into a fight?

182
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,980
No!

183
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,880
I kept our promise.

184
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,020
But...

185
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,380
But?

186
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,219
I got jumped by some guys

187
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:28,961
from another school near the riverbank.

188
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,407
And I took a few hits.

189
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,020
That's right.

190
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,600
What's wrong, Toki?

191
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,160
Fight properly.

192
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,160
I won't fight.

193
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,720
I already made a promise.

194
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,440
What's with that nonsense!

195
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,440
Who did you promise?

196
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,140
What's up with Toki?

197
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,280
Toki, what are you looking at?

198
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
What's this? Hey, Toki!

199
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,000
Hey, Toki!

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,620
Why does that memory from back then...

201
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,940
Cut it out.

202
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,940
What are you doing?

203
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,920
Hey, Toki! Hey, Toki!

204
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,600
Cut it out.

205
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,880
What are you doing?

206
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,180
It was Sahara?

207
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,360
Huh?

208
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:48,600
Sahara? Who's that?

209
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,380
Whatever, let's take care of this guy!

210
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,120
Go ahead.

211
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,120
If you're going to hit someone, hit me!

212
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,120
But,

213
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,480
don't lay a finger on Toki Kanade!

214
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,342
Ah.

215
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,200
Whoa!

216
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,960
This guy is a teacher at Toki's school!

217
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,440
- A teacher!
- What? That's bad!

218
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Let's get out of here!

219
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,600
Wait for me!

220
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,200
Hey, are you okay?

221
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,900
Shut up!

222
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,856
How dare you butt into my business

223
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,168
without permission...

224
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,640
You...

225
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,540
Are you okay?

226
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,020
You...

227
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,020
You...

228
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,160
You handsome bastard!

229
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,260
Because at that time, Sahara saved me.

230
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,640
I am here

231
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,770
because he stayed

232
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:06,051
by my side all this time,

233
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,280
that's why I am the person I am today.

234
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,248
You have always been my hero,

235
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:17,953
both in the past and now.

236
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,580
You keep saying embarrassing things...

237
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,020
What's wrong with that!

238
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,020
No, it's not wrong.

239
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,112
But if that's the case,

240
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:31,901
then you're the same.

241
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,780
Huh?

242
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,680
Don't you remember?

243
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,420
(4th grade elementary school, fractions)

244
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,180
Shall I teach you this?

245
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,520
Alright, how about try doing this one?

246
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,320
Yeah.

247
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,340
Like this?

248
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,720
Yeah.

249
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,420
Yes.

250
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,160
You're amazing.

251
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,160
You should become a teacher!

252
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,198
I started to think that

253
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:25,062
even if I can't swim anymore,

254
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:28,899
there might be someone who needs me.

255
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,320
Sahara...

256
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,685
So, if it weren't for meeting you,

257
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:37,482
I might not be here either.

258
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,505
Just as you are the hero for me,

259
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,755
I am the hero for you.

260
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,060
I like you.

261
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,880
Huh?

262
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,060
Huh?

263
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,580
Huh?

264
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,380
Huh?

265
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,640
Huh?

266
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,180
I finally said it.

267
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,140
What's with me?

268
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,980
I didn't plan on saying it.

269
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:17,688
But hearing your story

270
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,651
made me think this was the right time.

271
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,850
I also...

272
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,480
You don't have to answer.

273
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,700
Huh? Why?

274
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,752
You're going to respond with

275
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:41,471
your whole body and soul, aren't you?

276
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,920
Then now is not the time.

277
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,526
Find what you want to do,

278
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,400
once you achieve it,

279
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,500
then you can respond to my feelings.

280
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,895
Now I'm completely waiting for you.

281
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,700
Ah!

282
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,904
You don't understand

283
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,193
other people's feelings at all.

284
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:41,740
But...

285
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,460
Yeah?

286
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
I've firmly accepted it.

287
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,920
Sahara.

288
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,580
What is it?

289
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,280
My armpit hurts.

290
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,040
That's the abdomen, right?

291
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:25,176
Oww!

292
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,680
You alright?

293
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,360
How am I alright?

294
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,360
Ouch!

295
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:34,960
Oww...

296
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,940
(Seiryu High School)

297
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,531
During my time in the third year,

298
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:44,093
there were moments of struggle,

299
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,481
but we also created

300
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:46,723
many joyful memories.

301
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,880
And...

302
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,563
Hey, can you imagine

303
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,259
what I used to be like?

304
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,320
Always getting into fights,

305
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,320
living each day covered in scars.

306
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,274
But then, in my second year,

307
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,086
I started going to school regularly,

308
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,840
making friends,

309
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,840
studying, participating in events,

310
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,820
and everything became fun.

311
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,520
Toki Kanade.

312
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,000
I like you.

313
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,940
Will you be my boyfriend?

314
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,460
Sahara Ichiro!

315
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,460
I also like you too!

316
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,080
I like Sahara!

317
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,872
Like, like, like, like,

318
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:02,739
I like you very much!

319
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,200
I've waited a long time for this.

320
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,500
Be prepared, okay?

321
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,240
Hmm?

322
00:23:34,531 --> 00:23:36,582
Wait, that's too much.

323
