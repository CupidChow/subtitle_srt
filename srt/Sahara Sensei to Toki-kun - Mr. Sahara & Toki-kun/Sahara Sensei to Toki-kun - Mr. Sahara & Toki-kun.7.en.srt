1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,800
Senior Sahara.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,140
Hmm?

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,440
I used to like you.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,880
If I say that, how will you react?

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,880
Toki.

6
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:33,306
If I ever feel weak again,

7
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,252
can I have your energy?

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,578
Oww!

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,080
I'll inject the energy for you anytime!

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,940
Nekoto,

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,541
shall we continue our conversation

12
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:09,580
from earlier?

13
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,989
"Mr. Sahara &amp; Toki-kun"
(Episode 7)

14
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,488
(This is how Sahara and my story begins)

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,375
23.25 seconds! Amazing!

16
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:09,890
Another personal best!

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Yeah!

18
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,360
During high school,

19
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,138
when I first joined the swim team,

20
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,182
I was quite quick-tempered

21
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,740
and Senior Sahara...

22
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,420
Honestly, I couldn't stand him.

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,860
Sahara,

24
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,940
Yes?

25
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,964
I burned today's video for you.

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,140
Thanks!

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,140
But one day...

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,900
Well then, I'll head out first.

29
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,900
Good job.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,540
- Um, Senior,
- Hmm?

31
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,540
what was that just now?

32
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,432
Oh, that's Sahara swimming.

33
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:57,252
I record it from various angles.

34
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,820
He takes it home to analyze the form.

35
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,220
Oh.

36
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,544
He might not look like it,

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,348
but he's quite the hard worker.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,740
Wow...

39
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,865
I begin to see

40
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,880
the true nature of Senior.

41
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,900
Senior!

42
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,660
Oh!

43
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,984
On the days when I felt

44
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:42,187
I hadn't practiced enough,

45
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:43,531
I always run back home.

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,380
Why do you go that far?

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
Well...

48
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:55,020
It's about determination, pride,

49
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,660
and pressure, I guess.

50
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,660
Oh...

51
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,020
I'm not some extraordinary person,

52
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,789
so if I don't practice,

53
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,827
I get anxious and

54
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,086
my mentality gets weaker.

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,860
That's why I have to do my best.

56
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,062
What have I always been

57
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,282
thought about this person?

58
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,719
Always fighting

59
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,860
invisible pressure to work hard.

60
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,400
And yet...

61
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,191
I misunderstood you

62
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,200
without knowing anything.

63
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,280
And I made assumptions about you.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,160
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,880
Ah...

66
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,760
I don't know anything about you either.

67
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,180
So, let's call it even.

68
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,520
Huh?

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,787
From now on,

70
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:05,912
let's get to know each other better.

71
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,320
Nice to meet you!

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,200
Alright.

73
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,700
Nice to meet you.

74
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,800
Go!

75
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,800
Yes.

76
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,935
As a result,

77
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:42,211
after the graduation of the manager,

78
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:43,335
Senior Hasegawa...

79
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,540
So hungry.

80
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
I'm hungry.

81
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,797
I started supporting

82
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,852
and managing Senior.

83
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,080
Senior.

84
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,940
Senior.

85
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,060
Hmm?

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
It's about time.

87
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,320
Ah...

88
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,440
Just a bit more.

89
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,600
10 minutes more...

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,360
Huh?

91
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,957
Hello? Nekoto?

92
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:23,843
Sorry for calling you out of the blue.

93
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:25,583
I tried calling Sahara,

94
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:26,748
but he's out of range.

95
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,580
Is he nearby right now?

96
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:33,772
Yes. I'll pass it to him.

97
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
Thank you.

98
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,640
Hello.

99
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,940
Oh, Sahara?

100
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,340
Long time no see. How have you been?

101
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,780
Yes, I'm doing well.

102
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,080
How about you?

103
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,480
Oh, I see.

104
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,096
Graduating does bring

105
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,221
its own challenges.

106
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,020
Could it be,

107
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:56,780
Yes.

108
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,480
Senior Sahara,

109
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,360
- thinks about Senior Hasegawa...
- Right.

110
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,960
Ah.

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,260
By the way,

112
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,660
at the recent sports festival...

113
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:11,060
(Someone you like)

114
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,071
Back then,

115
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,634
he probably drew 'someone you like.'

116
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,869
But...

117
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,041
Senior Hasegawa, who had graduated,

118
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,329
wasn't there...

119
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,960
I see...

120
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,260
That makes sense.

121
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,020
Well then.

122
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,760
Goodbye.

123
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,600
Thank you.

124
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,600
Yes.

125
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,660
You seem

126
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,120
to get along well with Senior Hasegawa.

127
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:56,980
Huh?

128
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,000
You get along with her more than I do.

129
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,000
Hmm?

130
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,220
Why am I irritated?

131
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,220
Ahh...

132
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,140
I was just getting comfy...

133
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,340
Wait...

134
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,900
What is this restless feeling?

135
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,540
Do I like Senior?

136
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,180
But I can't say it.

137
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,092
I just want to be by his side.

138
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,217
That's all I want.

139
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,660
I'll accept everything

140
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,360
from you.

141
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Senior,

142
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,640
are you hiding something from me?

143
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,880
Huh?

144
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,428
I had a feeling that you were.

145
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,500
You're free to talk about it.

146
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,940
I'll accept it all.

147
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,120
I decided to believe those words.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,660
So...

149
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,200
I like you.

150
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Huh?

151
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,220
I like you.

152
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,780
I like you, Senior.

154
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:15,251
But it's impossible for me.

155
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,900
The meaning of liking for you and me

156
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,060
is just too different.

157
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,720
I...

158
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,840
lied.

159
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,740
Huh?

160
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,260
Sahara.

161
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,680
Where are you?

162
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,560
Nekoto Minato is...

163
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,900
He was a man I used to like.

164
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,660
It's not that I don't believe you.

165
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,020
It's my own issue.

166
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,120
Will you be alright?

167
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,560
I can be myself now,

168
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,040
and that's thanks to you.

169
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,980
Wait for me.

170
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,740
It might take some time,

171
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,380
but when the time comes, I'll tell you.

172
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,140
Why did you lie?

173
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,279
It was the day before

174
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:11,209
the graduation ceremony.

175
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,193
So, please take care of

176
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:15,873
the surprise for tomorrow.

177
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,646
Got it! Leave it to me.

178
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,154
I'll share it with everyone.

179
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,760
I really appreciate it.

180
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,740
Sahara's graduation is finally here.

181
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,280
It's so fast.

182
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:32,997
But it's amazing, isn't it?

183
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,715
Getting into that prestigious university

184
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:36,176
through a sports recommendation.

185
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,317
And being a candidate for

186
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,142
the Japanese national team.

187
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,800
He might really make it to the Olympics.

188
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,020
At that moment, I realized.

189
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,290
Senior is going to shine on

190
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:57,305
a big stage from now on,

191
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,680
attracting attention from the media,

192
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,080
And if that happens,

193
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,503
won't my existence

194
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,511
become a burden for you?

195
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,940
As a lover, especially as a man...

196
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:18,591
I thought I might ruin your future.

197
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,596
When I found out that you got injured

198
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:31,572
at the university, I regretted it a lot.

199
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,020
Trying too hard

200
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,540
without being able to apply the brakes.

201
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,760
Sahara-kun, don't push yourself.

202
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,120
Thank you.

203
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,916
I should have known you

204
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,783
better than anyone,

205
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,460
yet I couldn't stop you.

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,680
It made me so angry at myself.

207
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,920
I see...

208
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,520
What a shame.

209
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,260
Really...

210
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,560
What are you doing?

211
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,140
I...

212
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,039
said things that could

213
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,461
create misunderstandings,

214
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:46,620
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,860
After that, I couldn't get

216
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,384
in touch with you at all.

217
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,940
But...

218
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,173
when I came to this school,

219
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,137
you were here.

220
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,210
I know I don't have

221
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:17,366
the right to say this.

222
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,780
But if

223
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
I could have another chance...

224
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,060
Can I say that I like you?

225
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,985
They both liked each other,

226
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,500
but because of a misunderstanding...

227
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,980
Should they just let it be?

228
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,800
What should I do?

229
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,340
Ah!

230
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,240
Nekoto.

231
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,560
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

232
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,140
The fact that you were thinking of me,

233
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,980
went out of your way for me,

234
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,420
just knowing that makes me happy.

235
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,620
Senior...

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Maybe we took too long to get here.

237
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,420
Both you and I.

238
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,400
You mean it's too late?

239
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,079
Maybe so.

240
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,160
But I don't regret it now.

241
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,560
So...

242
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,524
you don't have to feel

243
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:00,649
responsible anymore.

244
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,000
For getting injured

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,060
and quitting swimming,

246
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,960
it's my own issue,

247
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,680
but I've been causing you pain

248
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,540
and hurting you all along...

249
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,740
I'm sorry.

250
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,620
Certainly, Senior is too weak.

251
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,320
Huh?

252
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,260
You're hurting him like that too.

253
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,220
Huh?

254
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,720
Did you think it went unnoticed?

255
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,480
He's special, right?

256
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,480
Toki-kun.

257
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,320
Yeah.

258
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,800
Very special.

259
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,040
Then, why don't you go after him?

260
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,040
Nekoto,

261
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,060
thank you.

262
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,200
Toki!

263
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,049
Isn't it out of character for you

264
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,362
to suddenly disappear?

265
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,600
It's not like that.

266
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,260
I just got tired of silently listening.

267
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,460
And besides...

268
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,800
I believe you, after all.

269
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,980
What?

270
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,820
What? A thank you, maybe?

271
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,720
You've always supported me,

272
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,180
and I've always been spoiled by you,

273
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,140
so, this time, I'll pamper you.

274
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,785
I can tell by the look on your face

275
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,050
that you would reject Nekoto.

276
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,060
But...

277
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,140
I came here because I was afraid.

278
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,520
Yeah.

279
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,860
Adults are unfair.

280
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,440
Yeah.

281
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,020
And I'm just a dumb kid.

282
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,380
It's fine being a kid.

283
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,320
Hey! Take that back!

284
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,820
Because, no matter how you look at it...

285
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,020
Hey! What happened to pampering?

286
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,814
Well, Toki Kanade-kun,

287
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,244
that's one of your cute points.

288
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,820
You didn't have to say 'cute, '

289
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,140
but I don't feel bad about it.

290
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:44,975
(This is a fictional work)

291
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,633
(Next episode)

292
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,036
If anything happens to you,

293
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
I'm not sure I can keep calm.

294
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,140
If there's anything, you can rely on me.

295
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,140
(Do your best, Sahara)
If there's anything, you can rely on me.

296
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,296
I don't want to cause

297
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:53,416
trouble to my friends.

298
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,860
Don't mess with Toki Kanade.

299
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,796
You've always been a hero to me

300
00:23:57,821 --> 00:23:59,421
even before and now!
