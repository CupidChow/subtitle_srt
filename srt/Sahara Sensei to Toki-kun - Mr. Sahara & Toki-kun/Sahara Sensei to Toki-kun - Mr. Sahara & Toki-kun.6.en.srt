00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,720
- See you again, Master!
- Yeah.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,760
- Thank you!
- Next time this Saturday, okay?

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,360
- This Saturday, right?
- Yes, thank you!

5
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,360
Ta-da!

(Congratulations on Passing)

7
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,760
Senior Todo, congratulations!

8
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,580
Thank you.

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,849
I got into a top university

10
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:17,552
with a renowned basketball program

11
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:18,857
through a quota system.

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,620
Wow, that's amazing!

13
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,100
Are you aiming to become a pro?

14
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Oh, actually,

15
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm thinking of aiming for the NBA.

16
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,140
Wow!

17
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,000
Ah, Rise-kun.

18
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,820
Yes?

19
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,096
Once you clear that table,

20
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:34,356
you can go.

21
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,040
Okay, got it!

22
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,300
- Thank you.
- Yes.

23
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,200
Senior,

24
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,200
congratulations!

25
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,800
Thank you.

26
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,320
Hey,

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,780
Toki-kun, what about you?

28
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,440
Huh? What do you mean?

29
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,120
Here.

This needs to be submitted this week.

31
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,860
Oh!

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,080
This?

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,080
Right?

34
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,820
Wait, do we all have to submit this?

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,220
Of course.

36
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,386
We have career counseling next week.

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,820
What did you write, Takuya?

38
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,940
I've been considering it for a while.

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,266
I want to study

40
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,313
photography at university.

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,440
My family is also supporting me.

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,560
Here are go.

43
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,420
Oh!

44
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,900
Rise, what about you?

45
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,900
Oh, I'm going to be a police officer.

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,480
Hey, Rise,

47
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,719
if you're done working,

48
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:48,056
come sit and some eat cake.

49
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,860
Sorry. I have my next part-time job.

50
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,800
Well then, see you later.

51
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,080
See you later.

52
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,960
Oh.

53
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,340
Another part-time job after this?

54
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,380
Rise-kun's mother is sick.

55
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,500
Huh?

56
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,640
The medical expenses are quite high.

57
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,295
Here you go.

58
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,120
Oh.

59
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,900
Thank you.

60
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,238
That's why,

61
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:11,965
he wants to at least be able

62
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:13,582
to take care of himself.

63
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,360
Police officers have stable incomes.

64
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,738
I guess he doesn't want

65
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:20,824
to burden his family.

66
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,200
What's wrong, Toki-kun?

67
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,214
Seeing Rise and Takuya

68
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,972
thinking seriously about the future...

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,949
I started wondering what I'm doing.

(This is how Sahara and my story begins)

73
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,229
The new teacher,

74
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:43,801
he's your junior, Sahara-sensei.

75
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
Senior Sahara...

76
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,440
Nekoto...

77
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,060
Again?

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,820
Please strike a pose!

79
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,600
Let's take a picture!

80
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,400
I haven't seen that face before.

81
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,040
The new teacher, Nekoto-sensei.

82
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,155
He was Sahara-sensei's junior

83
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,979
in high school, apparently.

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,580
I see,

85
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,940
So, he's from the swim team...

86
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,940
Right.

87
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,436
You must have heard

88
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,882
from Sahara-sensei, right?

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,060
Huh? No, I haven't.

90
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:38,452
Toki-kun, aren't you curious?

91
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,600
About what?

92
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
About his high school days.

93
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,532
Well,

94
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,946
it's not like I'm not curious about it.

95
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,200
Wait for me.

96
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,760
It might take some time,

97
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,480
but when the time comes, I'll tell you.

98
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,080
Sure!

99
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,880
Toki-kun, are you okay?

100
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,320
Yeah.

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,640
Right now, I'm a super invincible man!

102

Nothing can shake me!

103
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,380
Invincible!

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,020
What happened?

105
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,680
Why did you become a teacher?

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's my line.

107
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,260
You must have many other options.

108
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,625
I heard you turned down the offer

109
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,328
to be the swim team advisor.

110
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,611
You could have become a great coach...

111
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,695
That's the last thing

112
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,400
I want to hear from you.

113
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Why...

114
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:29,835
does it have to turn out like this?

115
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
I see...

116
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,500
Rehabilitation for a while.

117
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,420
What a shame.

118
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,860
What are you doing?

119
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,560
It's not his fault.

120
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,500
I understand.

121
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,260
I like you, senior.

122
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,640
But it's impossible for me.

123
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,240
The meaning of liking for you and me

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,980
is just too different.

125
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,720
It's over.

126
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,080
It's in the past.

127
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,840
But...

128
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,340
Sahara, what's wrong?

129
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,200
Hmm?

130
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,200
Homeroom is about to start.

131
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,280
This is 2-D.

132
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,460
Huh?

133
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,900
We're in 2-C.

134
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,180
Yeah.

135
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,300
Also, you don't have anything with you,

136
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,740
attendance book and all.

137
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,220
Ah.

138
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,160
I'll go back to the staff room.

139
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,420
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Ah, it's this way.

140
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,920
Huh?

141
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,960
You don't look well.

142
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,003
Just lack of sleep.

143
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,380
Ah.

144
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,720
Here,

145
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,060
please take this.

146
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,260
Thank you.

147
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,740
You're willing to accept it.

148
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,240
I'm sorry about this morning.

149
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,160
- But, senior...
- We're just colleagues at work.

150
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
Let's have a good working relationship.

151
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,780
So,

152
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:21,435
let's not talk about those things.

153
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,200
I understand.

154
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,160
What are you doing?

155
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,780
There's still water!

156
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,920
I was careless.

157
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,380
Maybe I'm just sleep-deprived.

158
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
That's absolutely a lie.

159
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,820
Something must have happened, right?

160
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,940
Just say it.

161
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,080
I'm not okay.

162
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,740
But, for now...

163
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,360
"I don't want to talk."

164
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,020
Right?

165
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,460
Yeah?

166
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,399
Today,

167
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:51,423
you're amazing.

168
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:53,736
Well,

169
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:55,530
I'm currently

170
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,299
a super invincible man.

171
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,780
Well,

172
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:28,740
if you're not going to drink it, I will.

173
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,040
You can't!

174
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,200
Why? Weren't you going to throw it away?

175
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,240
You're not going to drink it anyway.

176
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,580
I want to drink it now.

177
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,340
- Why?
- I've changed my mind.

178
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,660
That was fast.

179
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:41,372
A manly man doesn't

180
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:43,310
change his mind so fast!

181
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,300
Let me drink it!

182
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,920
Hey! Stop!

183
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,380
- Give it to me!
- It will spill!

185
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,700
Oh!

186
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,200
Hello, senior Hasegawa.

187
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,980
Are you here to visit your father?

188
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,440
Yes.

189
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,320
You came after work, right?

190
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,780
How's the work at your alma mater?

191
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,880
What's wrong?

192
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,640
What?

193
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,260
Sahara became a teacher at the school?

194
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:40,347
Yes.

195
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,320
Back then we couldn't find him anywhere.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,960
You and the others also lost contact.

197
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,060
Yeah.

198
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,125
I never expected him to be

199
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,158
at our alma mater.

200
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,899
Hard to see what's right

201
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:54,836
in front of you.

202
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,160
Are you okay?

203
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,400
Huh?

204
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,000
I mean,

205
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,847
you're the type to

206
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,879
carry everything on your own.

207
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,640
Don't think too much about it.

208
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,740
But...

209
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,260
Don't have any regrets.

210
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,900
But it's impossible for me.

Today's the deadline! Oh, no!

215
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,080
Hey, what's wrong?

216
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,480
Oh, the new teacher...

217
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,560
Ah,

218
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,780
you were with Senior yesterday.

219
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:15,020
Senior?

220
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,260
Oh, you mean Sahara.

221
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,920
No, it's nothing...

222
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,840
What's your name?

223
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,780
Toki Kanade.

224
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,300
Toki?

225
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,400
Are you feeling unwell?

226
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,780
It's nothing.

227
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,680
I'm fine.

228
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,680
Careful!

229
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,640
Toki!

230
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,020
Toki-kun!

231
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,920
Toki!

232
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,840
Huh?

233
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:57,840
Are you okay, Toki?

234
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,020
I'm sorry, Toki-kun protected me...

235
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,220
Toki!

236
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,380
Covered in blood...

237
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,960
No...

238
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,560
This is...

239
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,680
Tomato juice.

240
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,060
Oh, is that the infirmary?

241
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,995
Right, I protected the teacher

242
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,198
and fell down the stairs.

243
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,520
Yes?

244
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,660
Are you okay?

245
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,180
I'm fine.

246
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,840
What?

247
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,420
Huh? Sahara?

248
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,100
Huh? No! What?

249
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,740
I'll lend it to you.

250
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,340
Huh?

251
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,194
Your shirt was covered in tomato juice,

252
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:13,996
and Rise and the others are washing it.

253
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,800
Also...

254
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
I won't do anything, so relax.

255
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,000
Toki...

256
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,460
Yes?

257
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,107
Your career choice on the survey

258
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:34,436
is quite terrible, isn't it?

259
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,260
Did you see?

260
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,660
Well, you...

261
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,240
Only "adult" is written.

262
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,400
But

263
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,700
it's true that I want to be one.

264
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,296
That doesn't mean

265
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,750
you have to write it down.

266
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,835
It's fine to be vague like

267
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:54,996
'University enrollment.'

268
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,000
But...

269
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,120
I really want to become an adult soon.

270
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,460
(Adult)

271
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,309
I want to be a man who can

272
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,401
support Sahara in various ways!

273
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,100
Toki...

274
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,520
Also, is Nekoto-sensei okay?

275
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,880
He looked really sick.

276
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Something happened, Sahara?

(Infirmary)

278
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,420
Nekoto Minato is...

279
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,540
Well...

280
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,780
He was...

281
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:55,702
a man I used to like.

282
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,900
Seriously?

283
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,757
Unexpectedly meeting him again

284
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,351
has me feeling things.

285
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,420
I thought I had gotten over it,

286
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,796
but honestly, it's...

287
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
tough.

288
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
Sorry for involving you.

289
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,260
It's fine!

290
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,760
It's not your fault,

291
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
and I don't care!

292
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,560
Then why are you getting upset?

293
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,420
I'm not angry at you, Sahara.

294
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,500
Even though you're suffering...

295
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,460
You couldn't say it yesterday

296
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:02,708
because you felt really uncomfortable.

297
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,926
I'm angry at myself for

298
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:07,246
suspecting weird things!

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,820
Toki...

300
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,180
But...

301
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,960
But since you said it clearly now,

302
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,320
I'll let it go.

303
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,940
You should be mad at me about it.

304
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,620
I was shaken yesterday,

305
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,737
and I wasn't able to

306
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:07,924
sort out my feelings.

307
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,160
But I don't have any guilty feelings.

308
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,000
Besides,

309
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,360
I can be myself now,

310
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,980
and that's thanks to you.

311
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,580
Thanks.

312
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,560
Yeah.

313
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,099
By the way, aren't you going to

314
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:50,560
wear your jacket?

315
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,040
I will!

316
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,000
Don't look at me!

317
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,700
Toki.

318
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,562
If I ever feel weak again...

319
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:14,625
Can I have your energy?

320
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,242
Whenever you need,

321
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,500
I'll inject the energy for you!

322
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,700
Why are you smiling?

323
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,439
I'm sorry for all the troubles

324
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:54,892
I've caused you.

325
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,120
You weren't feeling well too, right?

326
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:01,291
Next time, say it properly.

327
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:03,081
Don't push yourself.

328
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,519
You're the type who tries too hard

329
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:07,584
on your own.

330
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,140
Senior Sahara.

331
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,240
Hmm?

332
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,187
I used to...

333
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,460
like you.

334
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,640
If I say that,

335
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,880
how would you react?

336
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:31,709
(This is a fictional work)

337
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,311
(Next episode)

338
00:23:32,335 --> 00:23:33,765
You can say it.

339
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,780
I'll listen to everything.

340
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,342
I thought about trying to

341
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:38,678
believe those words.

342
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,460
I lied.

343
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,923
You've always helped me.

344
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:45,804
This time it's my turn.
