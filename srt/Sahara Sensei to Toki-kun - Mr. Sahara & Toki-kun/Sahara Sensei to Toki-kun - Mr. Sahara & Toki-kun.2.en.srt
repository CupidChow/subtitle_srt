1
00:00:00,562 --> 00:00:02,127
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:06,822
Don't you dare blabber about things

3
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:10,494
I don't know in front of me.

4
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:11,678
Why, you little...

5
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:12,971
Are you showing off?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,436
What?

7
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:21,396
Nothing.

8
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,275
It seems like

9
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:28,129
you like Icchan, huh?

10
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:40,619
Getting angry without

11
00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:42,369
knowing the reason isn't right either.

12
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:43,553
Come to school again tomorrow.

13
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:45,813
Absolutely no more fighting, okay?

14
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,422
Come see me anytime.

15
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,054
What of it?

16
00:00:58,213 --> 00:00:59,726
I like what I like.

17
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,854
What's wrong with that?

18
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:16,034
You're really strong

19
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:19,162
and straightforward.

20
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:21,039
Huh?

21
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,087
I think that's great.

22
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:28,797
I want to support you.

23
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,009
Oh!

24
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,845
You're a good guy!

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,677
I've changed my opinion of you.

26
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:37,637
Thanks.

27
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:39,683
Well, shall we start from page 15 then?

28
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:40,559
Yeah.

29
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,607
Let's start here.

30
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,110
I feel like school is...

31
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:52,775
Good morning,

32
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,103
tuck your shirt into your pants.

33
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:55,465
Good morning, shirt...

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,533
Oh well.

35
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,837
School has some really good guys.

36
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:01,288
Umm...

37
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:07,002
Um, well...

38
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,091
W-would...

39
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:22,976
Would you like to be friends with me?

40
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,975
I thought you didn't like

41
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,327
to hang out with others.

42
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:32,803
But it was the right decision

43
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,817
to approach you.

44
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,364
Nice to meet you, Toki-kun.

45
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:36,900
Maybe it's not so bad.

46
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:39,034
Yeah.

47
00:02:40,137 --> 00:02:41,189
How cute,

48
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,329
I'm not cute.

49
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:43,997
Enough.

50
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,995
"Mr. Sahara & Toki-kun"
(Episode 2)

51
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,216
(This is how our story begins)

52
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:41,596
So,

53
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:43,021
the results of

54
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:45,076
the mid-term exams came back...

55
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:49,396
Oh.

56
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:50,647
Oh.

57
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,065
Oh.

58
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,943
Yeah!

59
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,487
Amazing!

60
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:04,756
I worked really hard

61
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,201
because it's Sahara's class.

62
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,791
(Toki Kanade 87 points)
Only in PE do I have a good score,

63
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,001
(Toki Kanade 87 points)
just like a weirdo.

64
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,712
I'd die if it gets revealed.

65
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,170
No need to worry about it

66
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:16,231
getting revealed.

67
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,632
I'm the one who graded it.

68
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,808
You, stop appearing out of nowhere!

69
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,678
Because you were spacing out.

70
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:22,429
Ah!

71
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,765
I remember.

72
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:26,057
In middle school,

73
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,584
there were those who got high scores

74
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,029
only in this kind of subject.

75
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,647
Toki, you are that type, right?

76
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,518
No way!

77
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:35,801
Dammit!

78
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,278
I won't forgive you.

79
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,388
Alright, alright.

80
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:42,540
Toki,

81
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:45,702
you did well.

82
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,374
Good job!

83
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:10,769
Great work.

84
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,106
All forgiven.

85
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:18,902
Ah.

86
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:22,864
I'll go and thank that glasses guy too.

87
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,833
Cute.

88
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,387
That is...

89
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,433
that glasses guy?

90
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:50,100
You didn't know?

91
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,641
He is the ace of the basketball club,

92
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,032
a promising future player.

93
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:55,156
I got an English lesson from him.

94
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,691
He's trilingual, being a quarter German.

95
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,075
And he has that look.

96
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,654
Well, the girls won't leave him alone.

97
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:15,083
Oh,

98
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:16,334
Toki-kun!

99
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:20,338
Ah, yeah...

100
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:23,300
How was it? English?

101
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:24,718
English?

102
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,101
Thanks to you,

103
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:35,812
I avoided getting
a failing grade.

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,273
That's good.

105
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:39,399
That's good.

106
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:42,736
Ah,

107
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:45,155
so, you made friends with a classmate.

108
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:46,615
I'm Rise.

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,046
By the way, you have a younger brother

110
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:50,829
in the second year, right?

111
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,078
Huh, glasses...

112
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,000
I mean,

113
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:58,001
Todo,

114
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,827
a younger brother...

115
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,424
You have a younger brother?

116
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,593
Oh.

117
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,886
Yeah.

118
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,138
By the way,

119
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,385
Toki-kun, do you seem

120
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,659
different from before?

121
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,812
The death stares.

122
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,606
The death stares?

123
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:20,941
Yes, the death stares.

124
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:27,614
Amazing.

125
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,483
Is this what it means

126
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,722
to be popular with girls?

127
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,409
Um, Rise Senpai,

128
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,996
please take this.

129
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:36,706
Thank you.

130
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,001
Wait.

131
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:44,214
It seems like everyone around me

132
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,883
is so popular.

133
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,095
Compared to that...

134
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:54,349
I need to try harder!

135
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,938
To earn recognition from Sahara,

136
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,857
to be praised by Sahara...

137
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,321
(Scavenger hunt six people)

138
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:09,456
The only event left is

139
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:10,706
the scavenger hunt.

140
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,201
Does anyone want to volunteer?

141
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,543
Teacher, what should we do?

142
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,670
Should we draw lots?

143
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,508
That's a dilemma.

144
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,052
Right here,

145
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,179
if I volunteer...

146
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:39,261
it must be good!

147
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,442
I'll do it!

148
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:50,139
Toki-kun, that is...

149
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:51,746
Huh?

150
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:53,981
Huh?

151
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,869
You volunteered for the scavenger hunt?

152
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,122
Ugh... What's the big deal?

153
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:00,602
If you have something to say,

154
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:01,665
say it clearly!

155
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,001
Same goes for you, Rise!

156
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,296
Well...

157
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:10,008
The scavenger hunt has another name...

158
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:11,433
Another name?

159
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:12,300
Yes.

160
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,054
It's called the 'Confession Event.'

161
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,264
Huh?

162
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,728
Con-fes-sion!

163
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,925
Eek!

164
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,023
Are you a girl?

165
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,193
Why is it called the 'Confession Event'?

166
00:09:28,974 --> 00:09:31,321
You see, that kind of event is...

167
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,182
(Someone far away from school)

168
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,240
(A fast runner)

169
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,362
The rule is to find someone

170
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,391
from the audience

171
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,870
who matches the topic you picked

172
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,221
and reach the goal.

173
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,038
Yeah.

174
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:41,109
(Bespectacled person-Long-haired person)
Among them,

175
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,190
there's a paper that says

176
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,307
'Someone you like.'

177
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,462
Every year, there's an event where

178
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,057
someone who draws that paper

179
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,356
and has to confess on the spot.

180
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,216
Huh? What's up with that?

181
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,592
Yeah, exactly.

182
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,010
So,

183
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,524
those who want to confess

184
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,220
will go for that paper,

185
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:58,962
but those who don't want to confess

186
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:00,994
will avoid participating in this event.

187
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,478
Why didn't you tell me, Rise?

188
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,798
Because you volunteered

189
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,048
before I could tell you.

190
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,028
Then...

191
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:13,738
Then... Well...

192
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,198
Then...

193
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,754
Teacher.

194
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:31,967
Hmm?

195
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,134
Lik...

196
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,469
Lik...

197
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,745
I like you.

198
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:42,934
What?

199
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:45,979
I can't hear you.

200
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,611
If you don't say it loud and clear,

201
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,905
I won't understand.

202
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,124
Eek! It's impossible, impossible!

203
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,418
Do I really have to confess like that?

204
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,087
I guess you don't want to do it.

205
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:12,297
Of course.

206
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:14,765
Because

207
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:17,385
I'm not mentally prepared yet.

208
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:19,413
Is that the problem?

209
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,056
That's right, Todo,

210
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,474
you be my substitute.

211
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:24,056
Huh?

212
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:25,365
No, we're in different classes

213
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,381
and grades.

214
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,101
No way!

215
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,216
Absolutely not.

216
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:30,581
That's the one thing I can't do!

217
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,410
Why panic?

218
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,111
Ah!

219
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:39,157
Do you have someone you like?

220
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:41,409
Huh?

221
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,702
- Huh?
- Huh?

222
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:48,114
N-no, I don't have anyone I like!

223
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:48,958
You do.

224
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,532
Ah!

225
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,839
I have club activities.

226
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:55,632
Huh?

227
00:11:59,023 --> 00:11:59,761
See you.

228
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:09,646
That...

229
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:11,481
He's clearly in love, isn't he?

230
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:13,983
That's right.

231
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:22,878
(42nd Seiryu High School
Sports Festival)

232
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,827
The 'Sports Festival, ' huh.

233
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:26,579
Sahara-sensei.

234
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,041
Have you thought seriously about

235
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:31,499
being the advisor

236
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:32,737
for the 'Swimming Club'?

237
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:33,878
Well...

238
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:38,633
I'll pass.

239
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,221
I see...

240
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:58,002
(Staff Room)

241
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:04,503
Thanks for your hard work.

242
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:05,576
Thanks for your hard work.

243
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,749
Yo.

244
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,712
You're still at school?

245
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,506
I'm about to leave now.

246
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:20,633
What a coincidence.

247
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,261
Let's walk together over there?

248
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,057
Sure.

249
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,729
So, you really didn't know about

250
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,439
the 'Confession Event.'

251
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:35,969
I didn't participate in

252
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:37,477
the sports festival last year.

253
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:38,997
Well,

254
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:40,157
you seemed so eager

255
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:41,422
when you volunteered.

256
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:46,367
I thought maybe you had someone in mind.

257
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,062
What do you care?

258
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:54,208
Oh well,

259
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,002
once you volunteered,

260
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:57,712
you'll have to brace yourself.

261
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,047
Impossible!

262
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:00,757
I'd hate it if I picked it.

263
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:06,105
I also...

264
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:08,306
picked it as well.

265
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,017
I was forcefully made to do it too.

266
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:12,885
In the scavenger hunt?

267
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:13,811
Yes.

268
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,842
During my third year.

269
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:17,857
What did you draw?

270
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:21,527
Huh?

271
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:24,882
Sahara?

272
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,202
I forgot.

273
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:41,516
(45th Seiryu High School
Sports Festival)

274
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,975
At that moment,

275
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,229
For a brief moment,
Sahara's face looked sad.

276
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:57,647
Sahara?

277
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:02,026
I forgot.

278
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,989
Sahara seems to be

279
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,826
telling half truths and partial lies.

280
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,578
Umm...

281
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:13,865
For those participating

282
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,911
in the scavenger hunt,

283
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,523
please proceed to the schoolyard.

284
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:17,542
Alright.

285
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,208
Anything outside the schoolyard

286
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:20,240
is off-limits.

287
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:32,431
Ah,

288
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,093
my usually unused brain

289
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:35,718
is getting confused.

290
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:37,562
I'll stop thinking.

291
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,729
Take your positions.

292
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,995
First, focus on the race in front of me.

293
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:56,038
On your marks.

294
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,720
Ah.

295
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,056
It's started.

296
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:26,235
Sahara-san!

297
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:29,864
Take your positions.

298
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,074
Do you best!

299
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:33,951
On your marks.

300
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:53,883
(Someone you like)

301
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,905
- Senior!
- Senior Sahara, do your best!

302
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,125
Sahara!

303
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:54,272
(Someone you like)

304
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,492
It's impossible.

305
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:09,547
Sahara!

306
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:12,967
Sahara!

307
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,261
Toki.

308
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:16,698
Huh?

309
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:17,705
Sahara!

310
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:18,697
Over here!

311
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,515
Toki!

312
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,017
What's with that position?

313
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:22,435
Twisted my ankle

314
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,895
and fell.

315
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:28,649
And why are you in the parking lot?

316
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,442
Well,

317
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,771
during the sports festival,

318
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:32,478
I'm usually assigned to security here.

319
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:34,375
I was searching for you everywhere.

320
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:45,124
Come with me.

321
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:01,076
(Someone you like)

322
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,932
Let us

323
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,101
finish this race!

324
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:32,227
(Someone you like)

325
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:33,089
Sahara.

326
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:37,635
Huh?

327
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:39,670
Finish the race?

328
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,119
Going outside the course

329
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:43,244
means disqualification.

330
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:47,959
Oh,

331
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:49,230
right!

332
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:51,941
Dammit!

333
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:53,192
Well, can't be helped.

334
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:54,652
Alright.

335
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,502
I'll carry you.

336
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:57,947
Your leg must hurt.

337
00:19:59,238 --> 00:19:59,971
Huh?

338
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:03,244
It can't be helped, I'll carry you.

339
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,739
So,

340
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:06,747
get on quickly.

341
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,376
Then...

342
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,130
Excuse me.

343
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,630
It didn't come true.

344
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:29,895
Huh? What did you just say?

345
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:32,241
I said you're heavy.

346
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:33,532
Huh?

347
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,276
Then you...

348
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,736
It's dangerous!

349
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,737
Oh no!

350
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:39,864
It hurts!

351
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:40,781
Oww!

352
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,340
For now, this should do.

353
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:01,875
Thanks.

354
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,722
Right.

355
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:07,433
I forgot to return this.

356
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:10,835
(Someone you like)

357
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:16,327
That...

358
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:18,628
I drew this one too.

359
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:20,613
Huh?

360
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,740
Someone you like.

361
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,450
Someone you like?

362
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:27,870
Did you confess?

363
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,874
I ate it.

364
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,084
Ate it?

365
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,670
Wait, the paper?

366
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,184
How much did you hate it?

367
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,951
I thought multiple times

368
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,834
that if it had been a different topic,

369
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,459
I could have confidently

370
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,038
gone to the 'someone you like' person,

371
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,780
Someone you like?

372
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,993
And had fun with friends.

373
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:10,569
It became my only memory

374
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:11,804
of the sports festival.

375
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:14,500
A 'paper-swallowing incident'.

376
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,337
Just a funny story, right?

377
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,637
If only I had crossed the finish line.

378
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,347
That's what I thought.

379
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:38,232
Well,

380
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:39,942
see you.

381
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:53,204
Someone you like?

382
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,649
What does that even mean?

383
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:56,140
Ugh.

384
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,422
My head is spinning,

385
00:22:57,447 --> 00:22:59,647
and I don't understand anything.

386
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,163
(Next episode)

387
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:47,676
Snow white?

388
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:48,720
There's a kiss scene.

389
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,596
A kiss scene?

390
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:52,046
What are you doing?

00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:53,349
Don't do crazy stuff like this!

00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:55,059
My name is Todo.

00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,453
Who is the fairest of them all?

00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:59,313
Don't blame me if I punch you.
