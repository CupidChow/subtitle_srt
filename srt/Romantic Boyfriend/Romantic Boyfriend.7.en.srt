00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,650
Stupid Ji Xuan.

5
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,840
You actually dared to spend all the money I saved for my baby.

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,990
I'm going to catch you out.

7
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,670
What am I doing?

8
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,520
I was supposed to steal information,

9
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,120
but how did I end up falling for his charm again?

10
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,169
No.

11
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,900
Next time, I definitely won't fail again.

12
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,010

Heartbreaker!

16
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,280
Stupid Ji Xuan!

17
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,290
Are you done showering?

18
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,240
So fast?

19
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,770
How long could a shower take?

20
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,490
True.

21
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,520
Qiu Feifei,

22
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,940
you seem nervous.

23
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,410
That's not true. There's nothing weird about me.

24
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,230
Is that so?

25
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,080
What are you hiding behind your back?

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
Nothing.

27
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,270
Really?

28
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,620
Really!

29
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,970
Let me see.

This side.

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,930
Stop messing around and go get changed.

32
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,770
How can a grown man be so childish? Come on.

33
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:26,900
Have a seat.

34
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,200
Let's talk.

35
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,800

[WeChat]

39
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,610
you're so busy every day.

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,460
With all these women one after another,

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,940
aren't you afraid of mixing them up?

42
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,600
You were snooping on my phone?

43
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,260
Wait.

44
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,490
How did you unlock it?

45
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,829
So, you did it while I was sleeping last night...

46
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,360
What do you mean last night?

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,410
Your phone doesn't even have a lock.

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,900
I won't hold you accountable

49
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,760
for snooping on my phone.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,880
Give me my phone back.

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,120
Don't be in such a hurry.

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,040
I'm quite interested in your business.

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,040
Like "tool guy for couple photos."

54
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,960
How can you handle so many jobs on your own?

55
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,270
I must say, I'm impressed.

56
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,970
Is there a problem?

57
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,200
We didn't sign any exclusivity agreement.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,990
You have no right to interfere with

59
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,870
what I do in my free time.

60
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,680
That's right. It's none of my business how many jobs someone wants to take.

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,210
But I can't tolerate you taking advantage of me.

62
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,560
Our contract was signed with mutual consent.

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,960
You liar.

64
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,770
I've already asked the other women.

65
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,290
The contracts you signed with them are different from the one you signed with me.

66
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,080
They don't have all those extra charges.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Why are you only bullying me?

68
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,460
I'm telling you,

69
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,140
I can't stand this.

70
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,850
I'm going to tell everyone.

71
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,180
I'm going to file a complaint against you.

72
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,430
It's the New Year,

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,240
and instead of staying home,

74
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,800
why are you staying at a hotel?

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,040
You know nothing.

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,760
With us at home,

77
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,480
how could our daughter and son-in-law have their romantic time together?

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,220
They need their own space now.

79
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,500
It's inappropriate for an unmarried man

80
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,500
and woman to be alone in a room together.

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,490
Cut the crap and eat your noodles.

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't try to deny it.

83
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,190
I've backed up all the contracts, photos,

84
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,740
and transaction records.

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,330
You were so thoughtful.

86
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,210
Of course I was thoughtful.

87
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,710
You are so cunning.

88
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,370
If I weren't thoughtful, wouldn't I be setting myself up to be tricked by you?

89
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,680
Well then,

90
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,450
let's talk about your terms.

91
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,830
I believe I haven't done anything to wrong you.

92
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,900
Why are you treating me like this?

93
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,620
Do you remember what I kept repeating

94
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,659
to you when we signed the contract?

95
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,290
Don't fall in love with you?

96
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,870
Exactly.

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Being a rental boyfriend is just a business after all.

98
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,000
All the perfect images

99
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,050
and all the company

100
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,170
are just an illusion created for the mission.

101
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,030
Why are you suddenly saying this?

102
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,020
Usually,

103
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,890
clients figure this out on their own.

104
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,280
Maybe it's because you don't interact with guys very often.

105
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,050
I just want to keep reminding you

106
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,130
in this way

107
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,260
that this is purely a transaction.

108
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,550
So, you're saying

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,430
that tricking me

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,600
is your way of being good to me?

111
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,390
Yes.

112
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,900
You might not understand it now,

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,630
but I've been keeping a record of every payment

114
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,830
you've made to me.

115
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,070
I plan to

116
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,920
return the money to you when the contract is terminated.

117
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,850
I'm just worried

118
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,390
you might develop feelings for me.

119
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,640
That's ridiculous. Who would have feelings for you? You're so full of yourself.

120
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,240
So why did you sneak glances at me before?

121
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
You even blushed!

122
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,090
Blushing means I have feelings for you?

123
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,250
I was just excited because I was inspired.

124
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,500
To be honest,

125
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,480
I was sneaking glances at you to gather inspiration for the game.

126
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,330
Then why did you secretly transfer money to me in the middle of the night?

127
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,990
That was a royalty payment I transferred to you.

128
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,670
Anyway, now that we've cleared things up,

129
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,360
just give me back my hard-earned money.

130
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,120
I don't need you to be good to me; I only want money.
