00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,830
In that case,

5
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,760
I think it's time to close our deal.

6
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,740
I'll pack my things and leave now.

7
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,670
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

[Blessing]

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,230
I was going to leave anyway.

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,030
Qiu Feifei,

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,860
do you really think you could easily access my phone

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,740
with your IQ?

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,710
Did you do it on purpose

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,430
so I'd find out and you could leave?

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,910
I was originally worried

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,670
that doing this might affect you psychologically.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,950
But now that the misunderstanding has been resolved,

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,080
that's for the best.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,740
Don't.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,430
We've had a great time working together.

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,090
If you leave in such a hurry,

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,110
I can't explain it to my parents.

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,000
Your parents will be back in a week.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,050
Just pick a day and tell them I've left.

25
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,150
Why do you have to go?

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,510
Then why do you have to make me stay?

27
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,570
That's because...

28
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,350
Right.

29
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,420
Why do I have to make him stay?

30
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,950
To get material for my game.

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,990
That must be it.

32

remember to leave me a five-star review now that the mission is over.

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,140
No, your mission is not over yet.

36
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,420
What else?

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,759
I have a class reunion in a few days.

38
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,440
Because of Yang Peiyan...

39
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,050
I hope you'll come with me.

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,000

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,810
Really, go with me this time.

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,710
That's too far away.

45
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,440
I suggest you not to go.

46

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,170
are you pregnant?

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,870

You can't just always let him have his way.

96
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,710
Young men these days need to learn self-control

97
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,630
and understand how to be considerate of girls.

98

Well,

119

why haven't you given up yet?

120
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,900
It's not that I have someone like you with me every day.

124

I still have you.

Xue...

191
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,630
Xue!

192
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,990
Qiu Feifei,

193
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,870
is it fun to mess with me like that?

194
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,590
Do you have any idea

195
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,750
how many orders I'll lose after this?

196
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,830
I'm just returning the favor.

197
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,340
Do you know

198
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,659
my reputation at work is ruined and I've become a horny girl?

199
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,909
How can I face them?

200
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,750
That was just an accident.

201
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,850
You should've turned off your webcam.

202
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,330
You should've closed your door!
