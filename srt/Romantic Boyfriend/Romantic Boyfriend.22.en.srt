I’ve already picked out the person for you.

It’s that doctor I knew before.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,400
He’s a good person and looks decent too.

is just like I was back in the day.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,770
Yes.

33
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,039
When I first found out about this,

34
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,990
I felt quite uncomfortable.

35
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,500
But after thinking about it,

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,510
over time, we’ve seen what Ji Xuan is like.

37
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,340
I don’t think

38
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,229
he and Feifei have no feelings for each other.

39
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,430
It would be great

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,220
if it turned from fake to real.

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,450
I was thinking

42
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,700
we should come up with some way

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,320
to provoke him.

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,079
Maybe this will work.

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,180
I doubt it.

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,550
Today,

00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,630
we said we’d send Feifei on a blind date,

48
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,980
He didn't even say a word.

49
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,020

51
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,240

We can’t force him

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,850

If you had no feelings for Feifei,

75

you wouldn't have made such that two-faced contract.

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,760
You wouldn’t keep asking her for money either.

77

I think you’re not trying to remind her,

78
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,720

79
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,870
not to get attached.

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,790
If you were really as indifferent as you claim,

82
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,320
when I moved in and made things difficult for you,

83
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,450
you should have left.

84
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,910
You wouldn’t have bothered competing with me.

85
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,440
You just can’t let go of her.

86
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,850
Well.

87
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,950
Just admit that you like her. So what if you do?

88
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,160
Just because I like her, does that mean I should

89
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,579
ignore everything else and just cling to her?

90
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,660
Actually,

91
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,770
from the first moment I saw her,

92
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,340
I've made up my mind.

93
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,020
I decided not to care about

94
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,350
the rental boyfriend status anymore.

95
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,010
So there’s no question of emotional integrity.

96
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,390
What I want most now

97
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,790
is to tell Mingming

98
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,870
that I like her.

99
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,270
They're moving out tomorrow.

100
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,270
Mingming.

101
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,640
Will you miss Lin Ke?

102
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,580
Not really. I don’t feel much.

103
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,210
But...

104
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,320
But why do I feel I don't want to let go?

105
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,010
Let go of whom?

106
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,960
Ji Xuan?

107
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,350
Isn't it strange?

108
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,850
Clearly, at the beginning, our relationship was just a business one.

109
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,620
We didn’t get along well.

110
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,010
But after all these days,

111
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,350
now that he’s really leaving,

112
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,040
I feel quite sad.

113
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,620
It's normal.

114
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,510
Anyone would develop some feelings

115
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,940
after spending so much time together.

116
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,460
That's how people are.

117
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,260
We feel reluctant to part.

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,540
But after that person leaves,

119
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,200
we'll regain composure soon.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,270
Really?

121
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,770
Of course.

122
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,790
But Mingming,

123
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,860
when you were kicked out by your family,

124
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,780
you had nothing to do with Lin Ke.

125
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,580
Why did you bring him along?

126
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,070
You said

127
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,170
you meant well.

128
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,970
But I know

129
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,260
you’re not that kind of do-gooder.

130
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,960
Right.

131
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,340
I don't know since when

132
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,890
I got used to having Lin Ke around.

133
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,670
I got used to his meticulous care

134
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,580
and gentle affection.

135
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,610
What's wrong with me?

136
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,820
Sis.

137
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,280
Lin Ke?

138
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,140
Is the hot milk

139
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,640
on this table every night made by you?

140
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,560
I noticed

141
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,190
you have a habit of drinking milk before bed every night.

142
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,700
But

143
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,590
the milk in the fridge is too cold.

144
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,720
So

145
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,340
I make a cup of hot milk every night and wait for you.

146
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,400
You...

147
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,780
I like you.

148
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,210
From the first moment I saw you,

149
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,490
I liked you.

150
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,700
You must think I'm ridiculous.

151
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,420
Not only did I

152
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,909
cause you to be exposed in front of your parents,

153
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,570
but I also broke our agreement

154
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,720
and let myself fall for you.

155
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,560
But don't worry.

156
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,570
I’ll return

157
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,909
your rent.

158
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,570
Lin Ke.

159
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,400
You’re so pretentious.

160
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,290
But I like that.

161
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,560
Lin Ke.

162
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,960
Listen.

163
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,260
From now on,

164
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,120

all your business.

166

Don't foolishly smile at other women again.

167
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,580
You said you’d persist, didn’t you?

168
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,210
Why are you running away now?

169
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,490
I just confessed to Mingming.

170
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,850
She agreed to be with me.

171
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,090
So we're a couple now.

172
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,960
Mingming has decided

to move out and live with me.

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,810
♫I never cared♫

192
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,410
♫My sincerity, my ruthlessness♫
