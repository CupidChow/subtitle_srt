Of course.

00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,180
All of this

10
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,140
How is it? Isn't it nice?

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,060
Very nice.

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,480

I just learned these Cantonese dishes.

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,580
My skills are a bit rough,

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,580

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,920

28

Thank you, Feifei.

29

Have a taste.

30
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,180
I've been eating fitness meals and salads every day for the past two days.

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,310
It’s been so hard to bear. It’s great to finally have something different.

32
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,220
Isn't bird’s nest supposed to be soaked beforehand?

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,680
When did you prepare this?

34
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,660
I soaked it at three o'clock last night.

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,090

You’re really dedicated.

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,340
It’s not like that.

40
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,540
I just set an alarm to wake up and soak it;

41
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,070

Looking at how Lin Ke handles things.

89
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,460

Feifei was very angry, right?

114
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,980
Well, it’s true.

our Feifei

120
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,570
might eventually get fed up and dump you?

121
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,170
Why should I be afraid of her?

122
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,540
If I don’t want to do something, I simply won’t.

123

If you really want to move out,

131
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,480
you wouldn't stand in front of me now.

132
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,120
My advice is

133
