[Episode 21]

4
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,090
What's my mom doing in my room?

5
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,170
Come out

6
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,150
and wait for me in the living room.

7
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,050
Sky Barking, come on;

8
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,820
otherwise, we're all screwed.

9
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,720
You can come out too.

10
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,660
[Blessing]

11
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,060
Godmother.

12
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,180
Follow me to the living room.

13
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,100
[Blessing]

14
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,000
We're screwed.

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,650
Sky Barking,

16
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,450
this is all your fault. Why did you have to get so fat?

17
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,410
That's right.

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,250
Hello, honey. What's the matter?

19
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,180
Come back now.

20
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,580
Something serious has happened at home.

21
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,220
What?

22
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,699
Tell me.

23
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,840
None of you will say anything, right?

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,720
Fine.

25
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,370
Then let's just wait it out

26
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,829
until your dad comes back.

27
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,610
Mom!

28
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,770
Kneel!

29
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,040
Mingming and the others are guests.

30
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,070
How can you make them kneel in the lobby?

31
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,390
Mingming's my goddaughter.

32
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,390
She's not a guest.

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,530
Besides,

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,710
it's my duty to teach my goddaughter

35
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,900
when she has done something wrong.

36
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,570
Then,

37
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,780
what about Ji Xuan?

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,500
Isn't he your precious son-in-law?

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,329
Don't you love him very much?

40
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,390
It's not good to keep him kneeling, right?

41
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,280
Then I have a question for you, my dear son-in-law.

42
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,500
Are you on my side

43
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,210
or Feifei's?

44
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,170
Mingming.

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,720
Who is this?

46
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,240
Why are you

47
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,220
all at my house?

48
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,500
How can you ask that?

49
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,850
They were already here when you came back last time.

50
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,860
I can't believe you didn't know that.

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,680
What are you young people

52
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,450
up to?

53
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,970
The four of them are united.

54
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,230
It's pointless to ask.

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,070
What should we do?

56
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,350
We can't just let them kneel like this.

57
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,770
Separate them,

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,070
one room for each.

59
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll question them one by one.

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,060
[Round One]

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,100
Godmother,

62
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,579
I was wrong.

63
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,450
I'll call your parents tomorrow

64
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,800
and ask them to take you back.

65
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,450
It's Chinese New Year. You all should go home and be with your families.

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,110
Don't, Godmother.

67
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,110
I ran away from home this time.

68
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,670
If you really send me back,

69
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,490
it'll make me look so bad.

70
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,290
You're in your 30s.

71
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,430
What's all the fuss about?

72
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,350
What else could it be? It's all because of my relationship.

73
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,030
My boyfriend, Lin Ke,

74
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,290
is younger than me,

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,840
and he comes from an ordinary family.

76
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,300
My parents don't like him,

77
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,760
so I moved out with him in a fit of anger.

78
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,530
Really?

79
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,970
Yes, Godmother.

80
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,050
So please don't kick us out.

81
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,930
They won't accept Lin Ke either.

82
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,430
They'll kick him out.

83
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,420
Godmother,

84
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,790
please take us in.

85
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,540
[Round Two]

86
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,830
Your name is Lin Ke, right?

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,610
You came with Mingming,

88
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,560
and you're her boyfriend?

89
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,290
Yes.

90
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,490
I already called Mingming's parents.

91
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,560
Since you came with her,

92
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,430
go back with her tomorrow.

93
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,610
Auntie.

94
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,190
Please don't...

95
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,020
Do you really think I don't know?

96
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,380
You are not her boyfriend at all!

97
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,330
She's a girl.

98
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,490
It's not appropriate for you to be together like this.

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,960
You move out tomorrow.

100
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,360
I'll find a hotel for you.

101
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,930
Please, Auntie.

102
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,850
Although Mingming and I are not dating,

103
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,590
I really like her.

104
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,700
Please don't make me leave her.

105
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,370
Since you like her, you should know

106
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,410
that a man needs to establish a career before getting married.

107
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,730
What's the point of staying with her every day?

108
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,130
Are you going to spend all your money

109
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,720
and then let Mingming take care of you?

110
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,070
It's not like that.

111
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,330
I've never spent Mingming's money.

112
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,090
After I realized my feelings for her,

113
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,610
I made up my mind.

114
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,850
I won't be a hired boyfriend anymore.

115
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,770
I'll find a decent job.

116
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,610
So,

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,400
please...

118
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,330
What?

119
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,270
Hired boyfriend?

120
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,640
So you...

121
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,650
you don't know about that?

122
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:42,970
Yes.

123
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,970
I don't know.

124
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,690
You brazen kids!

125
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,450
Can you rent a boyfriend?

126
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,530
No wonder Mingming's mom and dad are so angry.

127
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,140
You...

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,670
Wait.

129
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,050
Mingming rented you.

130
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,070
Is Ji...

131
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,050
It's not like that, Auntie.

132
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,090
Please don’t overthink it.

133
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,370
I...

134
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,130
Get out.

135
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,810
Out!

136
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,080
[Round Three]

137
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,210
Mom.

138
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,750
Ji.

139
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,020
Come and have a seat.

140
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,730
These are photos of Feifei when she was young.

141
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,530
Take a look.

142
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,810
Feifei was much happier when she was little.

143
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,580
After she went to college,

144
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,240
she met an immature boy

145
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,530
and ended up like this.

146
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
You know that too, right?

147
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,200
I know.

148
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,640
Actually, she is herself

149
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,830
when she's with me.

150
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,760
But she's obviously resistant

151
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,560
to interacting with other boys.

152
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,800
Last time, we met Yang Peiyan outside,

153
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,690
and she reacted strongly to him.

154
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,390
It seems

155
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,650
that you two get along well.

156
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,770
I asked Mingming about this before.

157
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,090
She said Feifei's current condition

158
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,950
won't affect her life much.

159
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,370
Actually, it doesn't matter much.

160
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,100
But

161
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,200
I still think

162
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,610
Feifei might have psychological trauma

163
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,510
and needs to see a psychologist.

164
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Good boy.

165
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,970
Thank you.

166
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,100
In my heart,

167
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,820
Feifei is a girl

168
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,170
who won't be easily defeated by setbacks.

169
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,910
It's all thanks to you. You two taught me well.

170
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,070
Mom.

171
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,170
How dare you call me mom?

172
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,409
Qiu Feifei, you've grown up.

173
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,290
Rental boyfriend.

174
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,750
You've all grown up, and you even dare to lie to your parents?

175
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,560
If you really can't find a boyfriend, just come home.

176
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,080
It's not like we're going to eat you alive, is it?

177
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,850
Didn't you say that if I couldn't find a boyfriend...

178
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,770
You even dare to talk back now?
