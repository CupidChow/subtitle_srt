[Episode 15]

4
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,620
I'm here to see you off.

5
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,820
Let's have a talk.

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
Since you've been here,

7
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,800
we've been arguing every time we're alone.

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,900
This is the first time we're so quiet.

9
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,300
Yeah, it's rare.

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,710
I know the previous competition was unfair

12
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,580
and deliberately targeted you.

13
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,100
But I didn't stop it. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,920
It's okay.

15
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,970
It's in the past.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,340
No.

17
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:30,980
I knew

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,539
you'd done your job well.

19
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,289
It was because I wanted too much

20
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,020
that things ended up like this.

21
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,140
Sorry, I was too willful.

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,910
You paid,

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,020
so you had the right to be willful.

24
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,580
If it were someone else,

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,490
like Lin Ke,

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,890
you'd have already gotten what you wanted.

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,890
You were just unlucky that it was me.

28
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,470
This...

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,450
This is my farewell gift to you.

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,670
I drew it the day I met Yang Peiyan.

31
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,740
And you've helped me a lot since then.

32
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,640
So I want to say thank you.

33
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,230
Even though sometimes

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,140
I can't help but envy Mingming,

35
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,990
I've never considered asking Lin Ke to switch with you.

36
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,200
Because, in my heart,

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,410
my ex-rental boyfriend

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,380
is Ji Xuan.

39
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,460
Is this me?

40
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,829
So,

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,570
are you still leaving?

42
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,350
[Hello, summer]

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,860
Let's go camping!

44
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,140
Go!

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,090
Wait for me, Mingming!

46
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:08,930
Hurry up!

47
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,890
[Hello, summer]

48
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,790

[Sweet summer]

50
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,920
After being cooped up for so many days, I'm finally getting some fresh air!

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,850
Give me your bag.

52
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,310
Did the sun rise from the west?

53
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,850
You're surprisingly considerate.

54
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,280
Someone's back injury hasn't recovered yet.

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,540
I wanted to do a good deed,

56
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,340
but it seems like it's not needed.

57
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,260
I need it.

58
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,760
Thank you.

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,300
Sky Barking, I'm here!

60
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,329
Lin Ke, is it done?

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,610
I'm starving. Hurry up.

62
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,840
It's done. Here.

63
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,570
Mingming, Feifei.

64
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,460
Lin Ke.

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,450
Delicious.

66
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,250
Here.

67
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,870
Cheers!

68
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,370
Where are you going?

69
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,750
Did you two make up?

70
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,030
Make up?

71
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,600
Did we have an argument?

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,600
Qiu Feifei, are you playing dumb with me?

73
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,980
Be honest with me. What did you do?

74
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,570
He was originally insisting on leaving,

75
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,990
and now suddenly he's calmed down.

76
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,830
I didn't do anything.

77
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,080
Let me tell you.

78
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,920
A man's mind is like a labyrinth.

79
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,780
Who knows what they're thinking?

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,180
I didn't do anything last night. Really?

81
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,880
Really?

82
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,570
Yes.

83
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,270
Actually, if you want to be with Ji Xuan,

84
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,660
I wouldn't object.

85
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,310
What nonsense are you talking about?

86
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,950
I was against it at first.

87
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,020
Think about it,

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,890
how many reliable men would agree

89
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,230
to be a temporary boyfriend?

90
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,470
But Ji Xuan seems alright.

91
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,659
He's not a playboy.

92
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,670
If you want to...

93
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,470
Jin Mingming,

94
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,020
if you keep talking nonsense,

95
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,140
I'll rip your mouth apart,

96
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,010
you hear me?

97
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,010
Don't run!

98
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,930
Don't.

99
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,570
Mingming.

100
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,780
What are you whispering about?

101
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,360
Nothing.

102
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,800
We were just expressing our feelings.

103
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,670
Since there's meat and drinks tonight,

104
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,150
how about we play a game?

105
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,550
Sure, what game?

106
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,200
You're the smart one. You think of one.

107
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,700
Let's play the finger-bending game.

108
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,820
Okay.

109
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,770
Here are the rules of the finger-bending game:

110
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,820
If you answer yes to a question, you bend one finger.

111
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,700
The first person to bend all their fingers on one hand loses.

112
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,540
Got it?

113
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,460
Got it.

114
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,850
Get ready.

115
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,530
First question:

116
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,570
If you've already had your first kiss,

117
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,430
bend a finger.

118
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,330
Ji Xuan, who was your first kiss?

119
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,490
I'm not telling you.

120
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,240
Darn it.

121
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Drink up.

122
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,970
Mingming, what about you?

123
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,680
Me?

124
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,700
I probably had it in elementary school.

125
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,870
There was this adorable little boy.

126
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,490
Too bad he grew up not looking so good.

127
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,550
How frustrating.

128
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,190
Second question:

129
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,070
If you've had one relationship,

130
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,909
bend a finger.

131
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,450
If you've had two relationships, bend a finger.

132
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,590
Ji Xuan,

133
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,950
you've had your first kiss,

134
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,280
so why haven't you had your first love yet?

135
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,780
Who says you have to have your first kiss in a relationship?

136
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,040
Playboy.

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,780
Alright, if you have a crush,

138
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,870
bend a finger.

139
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,790
One more round. If your crush is here,

140
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,659
bend a finger.

141
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,500
I quit.

142
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,360
Feifei, you're not being honest.

143
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,850
I am!

144
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,740
When there's a flower to pick, you should pick it.

145
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,570
Drink up.
