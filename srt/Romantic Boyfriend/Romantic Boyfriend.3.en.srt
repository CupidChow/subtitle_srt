[Episode 3]

4
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,830
Here.

5
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,080
Ji, eat more.

6
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,800
Here.

7
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,410
This.

00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,900
[Blessing]

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,480
This is good too.

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,940
Eat it.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,310
Eat.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,760
Thank you, Mom.

00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,670
[Blessing]

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,750
You eat too.

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,610
Okay.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,790
Let's eat.

00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,870
[Blessing]

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,780
You don't have to work so hard.

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,780
My mom just loves feeding people.

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,150
If you keep eating like this,

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,500
you'll be stuffed every meal.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,220
No,

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,660
I can't take money and not do my job.

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,260
It's against my principles.

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,450
Whatever you say.

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,410
My abs.

27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,590
What are you doing?

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,910
My parents are at home.

29
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,660
What...

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,950
What are you doing?

31
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,110
Wait.

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,430
What are you doing?

33
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,820
Ji Xuan.

34
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,140
Can you do me a favor?

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,060
I'm coming in.

36
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,990
Oh no, my army line.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,710
Who let you in?

38
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,990
This is my room.

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,950
Get out.

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,670
You let me in just now.

41
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,230
Don't come any closer.

42
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,850
Stop.

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,390
Do me a favor.

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,810
I'm taking body measurements.

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,470
There are spots I can't reach.

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,590
I refuse.

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,840
Refusal denied.

48
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,650
Let go of me.

49
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,030
Let go of me!

50
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,990
Stop moving.

51
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,470
I can't handle this.

52
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,380
Do it yourself.

53
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,110
Can you be serious?

54
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,310
What you're doing now is for science.

55
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,710
Don't think so dirty.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,880
You blame me?

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
You're the one not following gentlemanly conduct.

58
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,660
Dirty.

59
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,640
Oh no.

60
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,060
What's wrong?

61
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,440
My waist

62
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,050
is 3mm bigger,

63
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,540
but my back muscles increased by 1.5mm.

64
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,240
Do you know what that means?

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,079
What?

66
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,930
It means my muscle is decreasing,

67
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,340
and fat is increasing.

68
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,660
This is all because of my recent overeating

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,900
and lack of exercise.

70
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,170
I knew it.

71
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,240
Even my once sharp jawline is getting blurred.

72
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,110
Boss,

73
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,310
can this count as a work injury?

74
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,730
Do you know how much your mom fed me yesterday?

75
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,350
Plum duck, 600 calories.

76
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,900
Sweet and sour pork ribs, 490 calories.

77
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,310
Steamed bass, 360 calories.

78
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,910
Brewing tofu, 120 calories.

79
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,230
That's...

80
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,560
1,570 colories in total,

81
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,260
three times the normal intake.

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
Three times!

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,149
You really talk a lot.

84
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,370
I'll pay you more,

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
okay?

86
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,550
Alright.

87
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,620
Ji, eat more.

88
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,540
Here.

89
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,220
Mom.

90
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,590
Stop serving him food.

91
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,630
Ji Xuan can't eat anymore.

92
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,159
If you really want to serve food, give it to me.

93
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,620
You're feeding him, but it's torturing me.

94
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,850
What nonsense is this?

95
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,310
What does it matter to you?

96
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,460
Come on, Ji.

97
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,360
It does matter to me.

98
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,930
If he gains weight, I'll have to measure him again!

99
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:55,500
I like eggs.

100
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,950
Mom, give me the eggs.

101
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,170
I'm full.

102
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,200
Ji,

103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,660
why did you eat so little?

104
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,200
I'll get you another bowl of rice.

105
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,840
No need.

106
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,180
Well,

107
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,340
he's already full.

108
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,290
He really can't eat any more.

109
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,290
We're going out for a walk to digest.

110
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,170
Take a walk.

111
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,840
Enjoy.

112
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,690
Please.

113
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,420
What's wrong with them

114
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,870
today?

115
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,700
Let's eat.

116
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,080
That was a close call.

117
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,630
I could still...

118
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,620
No, you can't.

119
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,730
I'm never helping you measure again.

120
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,680
I just wanted to say,

121
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,110
even if I don't gain weight,

122
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,040
I still need you to help measure me.

123
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
Who's going to help you with that?

124
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,310
Isn't that Qiu Feifei?

125
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,210
Don't rush off.

126
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,500
I want to catch up with you.

127
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,590
Don't touch me.

128
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,560
Who is this, Peiyan?

129
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,840
You don’t know her.

130
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,430
She's my college classmate.

131
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,900
Never hung out with guys,

132
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,040
always keeping her distance from us.

133
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,590
Now, she's almost 30,

134
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,550
still single.

135
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,310
I'm warning you.

136
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,770
Stay away from me.

137
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,600
Qiu Feifei.

138
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,430
What's wrong with you?

139
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,410
The problem isn't her, it's you guys.

140
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:41,970
Who are you?
