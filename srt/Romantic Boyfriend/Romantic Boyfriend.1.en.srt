I told you Ji Xuan is coming tonight.

196
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
The guest room is so messy. How can he sleep?

197
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,480
I'm drunk.

198
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,010
I don't remember anything.

199
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,130
You two can share a room tonight.

200
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,570
Anyway, you are a couple.

201
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,920
I must be opening the wrong door.

202
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,200
What is my mom up to?

203
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,750
Accept the reality.

204
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm sorry.

205
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,600
You'll have to sleep on the floor today.

206
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,170
Why are the quilts

207
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,980
all disappeared?

208
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,680
I'll go find my mom.

209
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,760
Your mom won't talk to you.

210
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
What should we do?

211
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,570
Just share the bed.
