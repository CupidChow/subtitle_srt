Who do you think you are,
trying to save a damsel in distress?

I just want to tell you

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,370
please stay away from my girlfriend,

7
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,170
since you're not wearing masks.

8
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,630
Keep a 3-meter distance.

00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,360
Thanks. Let's go.

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,090
Sorry about that.

Thank you.

00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,770
You made my day.

13
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,660
Otherwise, they would have kept bothering me for a while.

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,440

if you're calling me at this hour,

20
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,070
it better be something important.

21

Qiu Feifei,

27
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,340
why does the person you drew look so familiar?

28

Um…

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,500
What happened?

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,889
I met Yang Peiyan today.

Are you okay?

32
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,260
I'm fine.

36
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,580
Tell me now.

37
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,310
It was the temporary boyfriend you introduced to me,

38
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:21,020
Ji Xuan.

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,660
Oh, him.

40
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,940
What's wrong?

41
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,070
What has he done

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,180
that makes you look so uninterested?

43
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,660
That is what

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,690

45
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,420
There was nothing new about it.

46
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,829
Of course there was.

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,390
Ji Xuan was wearing a mask.

48
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,780
And you're so inspired just because of that?

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,620
Yes.

50
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,329
At that moment, I thought

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,100
a man wearing a mask was really handsome.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,500

You can like anyone

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,170
but Ji Xuan.

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,670
A lot of people are after him.

62
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,400
You won't be able to handle him.

63
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,640

Based on the size of my palm,

160
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,890
the contact area is about 23 centimeter.

161
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,530

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,710

164
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,550
But you didn't

165
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,760
charge me when I measured you.

166
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,890
And yesterday we...

167
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,690
We held hands.

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,000

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,670
I was being nice not to charge you.

170

But now it's my duty to charge you.

171
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,930
Okay.

172
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,760

173
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,890

175
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,530

176
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,640
You were gentle yesterday.

177
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,580

178
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,340

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,710
The real me is a greedy person,

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,530
so please don't expect anything more from me.

182
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,380
Okay, I got it.

183
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,420
So mean.

184
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,280
