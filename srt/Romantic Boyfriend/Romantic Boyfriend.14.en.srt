5
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,290
Why are you drinking alone here?

6
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,710
Are you in a bad mood?

7
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,540
What do you think?

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,090
Seriously?

9
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,630
Is it so hard to coax me?

10
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,590
I'm your rental boyfriend, not your nanny.

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,910
It's not my job to please you.

12
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,270
But Lin Ke did a good job.

13
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,539
He’s him, and I’m me.

14
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,090
Since you like Lin Ke so much,

15
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,870
let him

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,230
replace me tomorrow.

17
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,050
But you signed the contract.

18
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,450
I'm moving out tomorrow.

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,620
It's not written in the contract that I can't end it here.

20
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are you leaving?

21
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,000
Actually, I should have left long ago.

22
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,880
I've been here for too long.

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,120
But...

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,009
But you...

25
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,650
Maybe I was possessed.

26
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,729
But it's not too late

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,680
to figure it out now.

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,940
You're leaving right after signing the contract.

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,090
You are a coward.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,600
Yes.

31
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,130
I am a coward.

32
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,140
Since Lin Ke came,

33
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,030
you've been comparing him to me in secret every day.

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,210
In your heart,

35
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,620
I'm not as good a boyfriend as Lin Ke.

36
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:58,970
Right.

37
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,160
You know that?

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,370
I don't want to be like him.

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,090
[Blessing]

40
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,980
Feifei, what's wrong?

41
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,090
Ji Xuan is leaving tomorrow.

42
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,740
He's leaving?

43
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,650
Why?

44
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,860
He said

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
he didn't want to be like Lin Ke.

46
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,230
I didn't expect him to be so proud.

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,570
I wanted him to stay and work off his debt.

48
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,490
Well, now

49
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,620
he's decided to leave on his own.

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,550
It's not bad to get a new boyfriend.

51
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,940
Not bad?

52
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,270
Don't you think he's going too far?

53
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,570
I don't think so.

54
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,610
You don't like him either, do you?

55
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,250
Well,

56
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,720
I didn't want him to leave.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
I still need him as inspiration for my work.

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,690
Have you gotten any inspiration these past few days?

59
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,410
I...

60
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,500
Qiu Feifei.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,930
You're acting strange.

62
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,210
You’re not seriously...

63
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,410

64
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,930
Lin Ke?

65
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,050
Come in.

66
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,610
I'll head out for now.

67
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,670
Wait, Feifei.

68
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,770
I have something to tell you.

69
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,560
What is it?

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,670
I've noticed these past few days

71
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,010
that you all seem to have quite a big issue with Ji Xuan.

72
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,450
Isn't that normal?

73
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,010
He's such a weirdo.

74
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,170
You don't get along with him either.

75
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,450
I didn't get long with him

76
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,600
simply because of our different personalities.

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
But I know

78
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,090
that Ji Xuan

79
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,850
is actually a pretty decent guy.

80
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,690
You brat.

81
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,050
You won the competition. Why are you still defending him?

82
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,200
I can win against him,

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,380
but it has to be through fair competition.

84
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,210
If I won because of some misunderstanding,

85
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,160
then it wouldn't be satisfying at all.

86
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,360
How can you be sure there's a misunderstanding involved?

87
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,860
I heard a bit from Mingming earlier.

88
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,230
I know you have a problem with him.

89
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,670
The main problem

90
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,330
is with his previous charges.

91
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,320
Exactly.

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,310
Look.

93
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,600
Didn’t he treat Feifei like an easy target?

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,890
How could I not be mad?

If I'm not mistaken,

98
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,980
he’s already refunded you the extra charges, hasn't he?

99
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,220
Yes.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
Actually,

101
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,210
I know why Ji Xuan did what he did.

102
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,780
You know?

103
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,909
Actually,

104
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,050
Ji Xuan's family situation is really difficult.

105
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,050
But he's smart.

106
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,970
He has a talent for acting.

107
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,340
After being scouted by the teacher,

108
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,650
he got into the Academy of Drama with his own efforts.

109
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,320
To cover tuition and living expenses,

110
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,250
while still focusing on his studies,

111
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,640
he started acting

112
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,370
as a temporary boyfriend

113
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,570
by chance.

114
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,910
That's how he met you.

115
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,300
Didn't I tell you

116
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,690
I'm an orphan?

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,210
I thought you made it up to deceive my parents.

118
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,870
Idiot.

119
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,750
It was all true.

120
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,590
But that’s still no excuse for him to take advantage of Feifei.

121
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,570
When Ji Xuan was a junior,

122
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,980
he met a girl

123
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,860
and acted as her rental boyfriend for a month.

124
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,590
The girl got obsessed with him.

125
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,130
She kept texting and calling him.

126
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,800
She even caused a scene at his school.

127
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,400
In the end,

128
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,020
she even threatened to commit suicide.

129
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,690
Ji Xuan, why didn't you answer my phone?

130
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,750
I was so nice to you.

131
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,010
I'm just a rental boyfriend.

132
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,060
What rental boyfriend?

133
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,950
What?

134
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,150
Ji Xuan, I believe in you.

135
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,430
You must love me.

136
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,960
Ji Xuan, let's be together.

137
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,409
That incident became a huge scandal.

138
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,110
Ji Xuan's

139
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,610
side job was exposed.

140
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,000
The school knew about his background,

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,730
so they didn’t give him a disciplinary record.

142
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,310
But

143
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,780
he was no longer allowed to do the same kind of part-time job.

144
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,370
At that time,

145
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,090
Ji Xuan was working several jobs

146
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,750
just to barely make ends meet.

147
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,240
Thank you.

148
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,650
In his senior year,

149
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,330
he started getting offers from film crews.

150
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,830
He though his life would get better,

151
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,210
but an unexpected breach of contract occurred.

152
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,560
He had to keep finding ways to make money to pay the penalty.

153
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
But his number one principle was

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,410
to never let a client fall in love with him.

155
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,540
Once bitten,

156
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,890
twice shy.

157
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,480
I guess

158
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,080
Ji Xuan is worried

159
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,580
that the irreparable consequences would happen again.

160
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,909
That's why he took such extreme measures.

162
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,690

After the job is done,

164
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,159
Ji Xuan will return the money to you.

165
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,470
I know Ji Xuan has a lot of flaws.

166
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,730
But I want to say

167
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,450
he's not the kind of person you think he is.

168
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,150
Silly boy.

169
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,270
