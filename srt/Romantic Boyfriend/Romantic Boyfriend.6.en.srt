Mom, Dad.

Feifei

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,170
isn’t actually allergic.

00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,150
You...

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,760
She’s been using sweat therapy to lose weight.

9
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,740
Lose weight?

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,680
Feifei, you need to lose weight?

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,850
Yes.

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,400
Mom.

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,080
I’ve started trying to lose weight.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,610
I’ve been on it for a while, didn’t you know?

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,370
Exactly, Feifei rarely makes such a firm decision.

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,070
Don’t blame her.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,130
Our daughter has grown up.

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,520
She’s starting to care about her appearance.

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,570
It's truly rare.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,350
Thank you, Ji Xuan.

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,690
I’m really grateful for your help today.

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,120
Just a verbal thank you? That’s a bit insincere.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,460
So what do you want?

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,480
Helping you out comes with an additional fee.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,610
Get to know the crisis management fee.

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,539
Ji Xuan!

27
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,050
Don’t pick the wildflowers

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,890

00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,200
Cleanup?

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
No, we're all heading out

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,320
for a big shopping spree.

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,080
Yeah,

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,070
with everything going on,

37
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,510
it’s better to stock up on supplies.

Everyone in the family needs to pitch in today.

40
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,790
Are you going to charge an extra service fee?

41
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm warning you.

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,470
No way.

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,940
Do I look like that kind of person?

44
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,090
You do.

45
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,150
Fine.

46
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,190
I promise not to charge any fees.

47
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,210
Happy now?

48
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:25,460
That's more like it.

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,940
Alright, let’s eat.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,770

Are you okay?

54
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,920
Did you get burned?

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,160
Where did you get burned?

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,610
I'm fine. Luckily, I'm wearing thick clothes.

57
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,940
Look at you.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,690
And you’re still laughing.

59
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,130
Why are you wearing gloves while eating?

60
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,560
Take them off.

61
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,210
Come on.

62
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,640
Now my hands are unprotected.

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,960
If I accidentally touch Ji Xuan,

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,730
he’ll ask me for money again.

65
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,230
I have to stay alert

66
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,890
and extra careful.

67

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,290
Thank you.

It's too dangerous.

Are you okay?

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,440
Why are you so careless?

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,120
Let me see.

78
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,310
Are you hurt?

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,310
I'm fine.

80
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,520
Why are you so clumsy today?

81
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,500
Dad, Mom.

82
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,850
I’ll go check on Feifei.

83
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,530
You know what?

84
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,680
They two are getting along so well now.

85

Look at you.

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,930
The more you see of your son-in-law,

87
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,850
the more you grow to appreciate him.

88
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,960
Of course.

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,920
How about this?

90
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,900
For the 5,000 yuan for the physical contact earlier.

91
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,960
I'll give you a 20% discount.

92
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,820
I'll charge you

93
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,770
just 4,000 yuan.

94
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,810
That expensive?

95
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,710
Why don’t you just go rob me?

96
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,450
Hey, you literally fell on me, okay?

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,970
I’m only charging you 4,000 yuan.

98
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,030
You should consider yourself lucky.

99
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,830
Thank you for you business.

100
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,990
You despicable man, get out.

101
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,089
Hope to see you again.

102
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,670
You jerk.

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,610
I’ll be a despicable man, then.

104
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,890
Once the deal is over,

105
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,060
the best relationship is no relationship at all.

106
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,110
Feifei.

107
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,270
Go get Ji Xuan for dinner.

108
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,970
He’s worked hard today.

109
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,150
I made a big meal

110
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,540
to reward him.

111
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm not going.

112
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,640
I had a fight with him.

113
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,890
You two were fine just during the day.

114
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,690
Why did you fight all of a sudden?

115
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,890
Anyway,

116
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,530
we are enemies.

117
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,040
I’m not setting foot in enemy territory.

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,130
Enemies?

119
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,580
Couples don’t hold grudges.

120
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,320
Go make up with Ji Xuan.

121
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,260
I'm not going.

122
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,570
Well.

123
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,600
You are my mother.

124
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,770
Ji Xuan has only been here for a few days and you're already siding with him.

125
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,380
Which side are you on?

126
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,790
You silly girl.

127
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,070
You should take advantage of the situation

128
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,530
and lock down Ji Xuan while everything’s in your favor.

129
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,010
As soon as the holidays are over,

130
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,600
you should get married.

131
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,700
But here you are,

132
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,240
throwing a fit.

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,580
It’s like your brain is full of mush.

134
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,720
Go make up with Ji Xuan, quickly.

135
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,320
Go.

136
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,030
Hurry up.

137
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,210
Go make up with him!

138
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,620
My mom asked you to come for dinner.

139
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,030
What time is it now?

140
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,860
9:30 p.m. What’s the matter?

141
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,000
I started work at 10 this morning

142
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,360
and finished at 8 tonight.

143
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,870
That’s excluding the two-hour lunch break.

144
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,850
So, I’ve actually worked

145
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,810

146

147
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,330
So?

148
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,550
So, I've finished my job for today.

149
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,200
If I continue to work,

150
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,280
it will be working overtime.

151
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,140
You need to pay me double the rate.

152
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,830
You want a pay raise for dinner?

153
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,210
I'm warning you, Ji Xuan.

154
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,930
Don't...

155
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,320
Don't push your luck.

156
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,810
Eating with you is tiring, okay?

157
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,320
I have to play the role of the perfect, diligent son-in-law,

158
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,730
consuming far more calories than I should.

159
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,870
I have to constantly watch out for your parents’ questions.

160
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,300
And I need to show affection without any signs of acting.

161
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,030
These things test EQ and acting skills, you know?

162
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,640
Fine.

163
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,430
It's up to you. I’m not the one who’ll go hungry.

164
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,180
I’m telling you,

165
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,120
I won’t come to invite you again.

166
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,380
What?

167
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Ji is not coming for dinner?

168
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,950
Sleeping on an empty stomach is bad for his health.

170
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,930
Don't be willful.

171
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,790
Go now.

173
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,220
Hurry up.

174
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,850
I’ll give you double overtime pay.

175
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,890
Come out and eat.

176
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,120
Thank you, boss.

177

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,100
You got paid for dinner.

180

I was just about to compliment your performance,

181
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,740
and now you’re getting

182
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,580
on my nerves.

183
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,240
You’re driving me crazy.

184
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,960
My game just released a new limited-edition skins.

185
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,030
So cool.

186
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,860
I'll buy them.

187
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,220
I’ll spend

188
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,780
648 yuan for now

189

[Sorry, payment cannot be completed. Insufficient balance.]

192
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,590
Insufficient balance?

193
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,159
How is that possible?

194
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,120
Isn’t my game account

195
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,640
directly linked to my bank card?

Ji Xuan.

198
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,270
Ji Xuan.

199
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,710
It's all about Ji Xuan.

200
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,880
Oh my god.

201
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,900
I’ve actually spent so much money on Ji Xuan recently.

202
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,710
I don't even have money for my precious game character.

203
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,220
Why should a three-dimensional guy

204
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,700
get so much of my money?

205
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,980
Darn Ji Xuan.

206
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,070
Don’t even think about me spending another penny on you in the future.
