[Episode 10]

4
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,800
What's going on?

5
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,900
My head hurts.

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,240
Oh my god.

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
Mom!

8
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,550
Wait, you...

9
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,050
We... Why do I feel like this is somehow familiar?

10
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,520
Don't worry.

11
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:15,920
Nothing happened between us this time either.

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,170
But you're naked this time.

13
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,830
That's because you vomited on me yesterday.

14
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,180
Then why are you in my room,

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,700
lying on my bed?

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,789
That's because...

17
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,700
Don't act like a hooligan while you're drunk.

18
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,710
Why are you still so strong after drinking so much?

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,090
I can't hold on anymore.

20
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,070
I can't hold on.

21
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,320
It hurts.

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,470
You really crushed me to death last night.

23
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,660
My waist hurts too.

24
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,840
That’s the waist injury you brought on yourself.

25
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,330
I have no memory of any of this.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,860
Did I black out?

27
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,400
You really don't remember anything?

28
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,570
It's good that you don't remember.

29
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,970
I've been the one suffering all this time anyway.

30
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,730
Then you...

31
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,910
Hurry and get dressed!

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,930
What are you waiting for?

33
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,210
Get dressed, quickly!

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,440
Her waist injury has healed?

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,010
Coming, coming.

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,510
Surprise!

37
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,640
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,970
What's wrong with you?

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,090
Come in first.

40
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,170
It's cold outside.

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,870
Let's go.

42
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,360
[Blessing]

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,110
Give it to me.

44
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,290
Look at you, all disheveled.

45
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,480
Did something happen last night?

46
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,770
I was still hungover and hadn't cleaned up

48
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,900
when you woke me up.

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,480
And you still blame me?

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,540
What's wrong with you?

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,610
You just brought them over here.

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,570
I missed you,

53
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,270
so I came to give you a surprise.

54
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,090
A surprise?

55
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,300
More like a shock.

56
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,030
Tell me what happened.

57
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,380
Feifei.

58
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,200
I have no choice.

59
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,260
My parents kicked me out.

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,150
What?

61
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,710
This is Lin Ke.

62
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,790
He's my boyfriend.

63
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,430
Hello, Feifei, I'm Lin Ke.

64
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,660
Hello.

65
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,690
Jin Mingming, you traitor.

66
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,930
We agreed to stay single,

67
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,060
so how did you end up in a relationship?

68
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,060
You know

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,380
I have no resistance to puppy-like guys.

70
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,900
He's really the puppy type.

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,030
How did you get him?

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,950
With my charm,

73
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,910
it was a piece of cake.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,390
With your charm?

75
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,120
Then why did you get kicked out?

76
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,340
Babe, you're my last hope.

77
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,950
I’m begging you, please take us in.

78
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,980
I can take you in,

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,800
but why did you bring him along too?

80
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,260
What can I do?

81
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,610
A little brother left everything behind for me

82
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,790
and doesn’t even have a place to stay.

83
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,980
How could I not bring him?

84
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,480
It's not that I don't want to.

85
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,340
But you know...

86
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,950
I know, you’re afraid of men.

87
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,030
It's okay.

88
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,790
From now on, I'll let Lin Ke follow me closely.

89
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,290
You just think of him as my little sidekick.

90
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,409
Feifei,

91
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,880
please take me in.

92
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,900
I swear

93
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,170
I’ll eat less, work more,

94
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,960
and won’t give you any trouble.

95
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,480
Alright.

96
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,300
You can stay here.

97
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,970
Just make sure my parents don’t find out,

98
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,900
and you can stay as long as you want.

99
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,030
Mingming, you stay with me.

100
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,350
Lin Ke, you can

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,600
stay with my boyfriend.

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,520
Okay, Feifei.

103
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,550
It’s a good chance for you two to get to know each other.

104
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,690
You’re both around the same age,

105
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,210
so you’ll probably have a lot in common.

106
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,610
I'll listen to Mingming.

107
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,090
[Blessing]

108
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,940
I have something to tell you.

109
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,040
Lin Ke?

110
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,320
Ji Xuan?

111
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,870
Do you know each other?

112
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,760
Yes.

113
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,510
We are classmates.

114
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,740
We are classmates.

115
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,350
You are classmates. What a coincidence.

116
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,610
Lin Ke, you’re also majoring in acting?

117
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,850
Yes.

118
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,880
Ji Xuan is amazing.

119
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,700
He’s the star of our college.

120
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,890
Mingming, why is your boyfriend being so sarcastic?

121
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,740
Defeated opponent.

122
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,270
How could you say that?

123
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,700
Mingming, thanks for standing up for me,

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,670
but Ji Xuan is right.

125
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,220
My grades in the major can’t compare to his.

126
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,460
Your teacher must have bad taste.

127
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,260
There must be gains and losses.

128
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,180
Although my abilities can’t match Ji Xuan’s,

129
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,620
I’m luckier than him,

130
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,940
and I’m quite content with that.

131
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,130
Lin Ke.

132
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,150
Don't you know?

133
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,000
Ji Xuan has been working on film sets since college,

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,730
starting with small roles and bit parts,

135
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,720
from playing background roles to bottom-tier supporting characters,

136
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,180
and still hasn’t made a name for himself.

137
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,170
Even fortune tellers say his destiny lacks fire.

138
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,560
If he becomes an actor,

139
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,030
he'll never make it big.

140
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,240
Well, I'm still better than you.

141
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,030
Mingming, I didn’t realize

142
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,460
your boyfriend was...

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,659
Maybe they had some misunderstandings before.

144
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,000
Forget it.

145
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,750
We're all friends.

146
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,780
We will live together in the future.

147
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,460
So let’s stop arguing.

148
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,260
Babe, don’t get upset;

149
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,400
it affects your looks.

150
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,330
Don't be upset.

151
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,940
Okay.

152
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,780
He bumped into me!

153
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,830
It’s okay, it’s okay.

154
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,560
You go back first;

155
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,820
I’ll handle it for you.

156
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,080
Go.

157
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,330
Why didn't you tell Qiu Feifei about Lin Ke's background?

158
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,360
Because of personal reasons.

159
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,770
Anyway, I’ll explain to her when the time is right.

160
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,159
Don’t talk too much.

161
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,670
Why should I listen to you?

162
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,050
Ji Xuan, you're just Feifei's rental boyfriend.

163
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,340
You have no right to interfere with me and her.

164
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,740
I warn you, keep your distance from Feifei.

165
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,830
If you have any inappropriate thoughts about her,

166
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,310
I won’t be easy on you.

167
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,460
I know without you saying it.

168
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,100
Wait.

169
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,530
What exactly is going on between you and Jin Mingming?

170
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,200
You actually care about things outside of work;

171
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
that’s not like you, Ji Xuan.

172
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,470
Cut the crap.

173
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,950
How would I know?

174
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,670
Anyway, I just need to listen to Mingming.

175
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,880
Let me remind you

176
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,100
to be mindful of your boundaries.

177
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,980
I think you're jealous of me.

178
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,450
Honestly,

179
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,030
the cute puppy image is outdated and needs to be retired.

180
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,159
You’re still unwilling to change your persona,

181
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,830
and your performance keeps declining year by year.

182
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,230
How dare you compare with me?

183
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,490
You don’t understand.

184
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,169
Mingming likes me just the way I am.
