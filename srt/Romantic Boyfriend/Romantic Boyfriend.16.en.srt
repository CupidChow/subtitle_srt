Why do you care so much about a dog?

125
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,770
We haven't seen each other for so long. I'm not the one you missed the most?

126

How could that be?

127
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,170
I want to see my daughter the most.

128
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,550
Just let me take a quick look at the dog. Just one quick look.

129
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,000

130
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,370
Forget it.

131
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,370
The dog has gone far.

132
