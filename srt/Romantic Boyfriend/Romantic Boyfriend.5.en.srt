[Episode 5]

4
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,610
Ji Xuan is just too much.

[Voice] [Hang up] [Video]

6
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,810
What did he do?

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,530
He...

8
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,150
Miss Qiu.

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,170
Please, don't misunderstand me.

10
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,200
Being gentle and considerate is just a persona I use for work.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,000
The real me

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,830
is only in it for the profit.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,170
That's it.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,070
Don't you think he's gone too far?

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,340
[Voice] [Hang up] [Video]

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,650
Too far.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,890
Way too far.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,120
For a guy who plays with your feelings like this,

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,180
you shouldn't give him any kindness.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,510
What feelings?

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,910
I'm talking about money.

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,730
Money!

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,210
The fee for physical contact.

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,840
[Voice] [Hang up] [Video]

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,720
Then I thought about it.

26
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:12,810
Wasn't I just scammed by him?

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,930
Think about it.

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,930
Showing affection

29
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,460
is something a boyfriend should do as a given.

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,539
But he charges extra for it.

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,820
It's just too much.

32
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,100
[Voice] [Hang up] [Video]

33
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,100
Weren't you

34
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,400
just saying you wanted to spend money on Ji Xuan?

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,680
But I have to be willing to spend it.

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,390
If it’s not money I willingly give, I don’t want to pay a cent.

37
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,340
No way.

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,990
The more I think about it, the angrier I get, the more I feel cheated.

39
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,990
I’m going to confront him right now.

40
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,970
Hello, Ji Xuan.

41
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,920
Where are you right now?

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,960
I need to talk to you.

43
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,820
Right now, immediately.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,520
Boss,

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,820
I’m at the studio.

46
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,710
A film crew hired me as an extra.

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,920
I'm taking a day off today.

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,990
No need for rent.

49
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,620
How dare you hang up on me?

50
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,740
Ji Xuan, you...

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,190
Limited edition dynamic skin.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,400
Cut.

53
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,040
Qiu Feifei, wake up.

54
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,630
You’re here to settle the score with him.

55
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,880
Ji Xuan.

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,210
You liar.

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,510
Hurry up and give me my money back.

58
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,440
Sorry.

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,630
We’re filming right now.

60
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,560
You’re making this difficult for us.

61
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,950
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,390
Alright.

63
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,710
The audio didn’t record properly. Let’s do it again.

64
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,440
Come on.

65
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,360
Stunt double, step in.

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,400
Let’s do another take.

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,120
Action.

68
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,260
Stunt double, into the water.

69
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,830
No, no. Not good.

70
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,170
Ready.

71
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Go down.

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,710
Let’s do another take.

73
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,490
Good.

74
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,910
Alright, that’s a wrap.

75
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,829
Stunt double, take a break.

76
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,490
Now, let’s bring in our actor.

77
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,040
You can wipe yourself off.

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,000
It’s cold, isn’t it?

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,329
Let me wipe you off.

80
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,090
Stunt double, take a break.

81
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,000
Don’t change clothes yet.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Wait for the production team’s arrangements.

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,360
What are you filming?

84
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
A historical fantasy drama.

85
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,000
"The Investiture of the Gods."

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,060
Historical drama?

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,329
So casual?

88
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,730
Because we're short on money.

89
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,890
Why did you come to see me?

90
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,030
I just wanted to ask

91
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,630
if the fee for physical contact could be...

92
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,370
Refunding is absolutely out of the question.

93
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,790
We signed a contract.

94
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,700
Every penny I earn is resonable and legitimate.

95
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,710
Alright then.

96
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,860
You’ve worked hard.

97
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,940
You’re not asking for the money anymore?

98
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,160
I think

99
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,540
your acting just now was really good.

100
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,840
"The Investiture of the Gods." I’ll definitely watch it when it airs.

101
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,230
I’m just a stand-in.

102
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,350
You won’t even see me in the drama.

103
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,480
That guy over there.

104
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,810
He’s our lead actor.

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,970
Gosh.

106
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,050
What kind of aesthetic is this?

107
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
Don't underestimate him.

108
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,240
He's our investor.

109
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,010
Well.

110
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,330
Don't be discouraged.

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,580
I think you’re much better looking than the lead actor.

112
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,040
Thank you for comforting me.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,140
As a thank you,

114
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,500
I won’t charge you

115
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,970
for that touch just now.

116
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,170
[Voice] [Hang up] [Video]

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,350
Ming.

118
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,840
How about we make our next game about mythology?

119
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Like "The Investiture of the Gods."

120
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,740
We could design Jiang Ziya

121
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,970
as a handsome man with white hair but a youthful face.

122
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,370
That would be awesome.

123
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,990
Did you get the money back?

124
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,240
Why did you fail again?

125
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,330
There’s nothing I can do.

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,950
I accidentally fell for a honey trap.

127
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,880
What honey trap?

128
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,950
Babe, what are you talking about?

129
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,090
Actually, I thought about it carefully.

130
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,530
Ji Xuan charging for physical contact isn’t that unreasonable.

131
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,330
Think about it.

132
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,080
If the protagonists in otome games

133
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,390
had intimate interactions or special scenes,

134
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,990
wouldn’t there be additional charges?

135
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,120
It’s the same logic.

136
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,830
Qiu Feifei.

137
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,630
Where are your principles?

138
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,520
Strike while the iron is hot.

139
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,159
If you hesitate,

140
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,040
your energy fades.

141
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,490
Anyway, I’m out of steam.

142
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,390
Ming!

143
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,460
My queen, please help me out.

144
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,290
How about this?

145
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,760
You could

146
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,990
add a clause.

147
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,680
If there’s no direct skin contact,

148
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,860
he can’t charge for extra services.

149
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,640
Ming, you’re so smart.

150
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,460
Message him.

151
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,140
He agreed.

152
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,930
When I step in,

153
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,420
it’s like having two of me.

154
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,520
Who dares to intrude into my palace?

155
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Time to eat.

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,180
Time to eat.

157
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,050
Seriously, why do I keep having these dreams?

158
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,760
How am I supposed to face Ji Xuan now?

159
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,950
Dear.

160
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,690
This outfit only exposes 80% of the skin.

161
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,330
If there’s physical contact later,

162
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,650
the price will be 80%

163
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,220
of the usual.

164
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,350
You’re getting a great deal this time.

165
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,550
Well.

166
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,760
The weather’s been so damp and cold lately.

167
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,120
I’ve got a bit of an allergy.

168
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,220
Nothing I can do.

169
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,630
Really?

170
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
I heard allergies can easily lead to a fever.

171
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,290
Let me check your temperature.

172
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,680
You won’t trick another penny out of me.

173
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,210
Well, I’ll just have to try.

174
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,760
Come on.

175
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,030
Mom, Dad.

176
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,680
Feifei.

177
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,400
Sit down and eat.

178
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,659
What's wrong with you?

179
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,860
I'm allergic.

180
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,170
But I’m fine.

181
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,560
Allergic?

182
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,800
You’ve never had this before.

183
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,020
Feifei.

184
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,580
Are you okay?

185
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,570
You don't look well.

186
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,670
I'm fine.

187
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,820
Allergies can be serious. Don’t take them lightly.

188
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,110
We should go to the hospital.

189
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,420
Honey, get the car.

190
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,390
Got it.

191
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,250
No need.

192
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,280
I'm really fine.

193
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,630
No need.

194
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,690
Better safe than sorry. Let’s have a doctor take a look.

195
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,880
Oh no.

196
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,070
If we go to the hospital and Mom finds out I’m lying,

197
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,110
she’ll kill me.

198
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,800
Mom, Dad.

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,070
Feifei

200
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,670
isn’t really allergic.
