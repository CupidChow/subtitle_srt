[Episode 18]

4
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,070
Are you suggesting that

5
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,860
we develop an

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,060
otome game too?

7
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,620
That might not be a good idea,

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,790
it’s just following trends.

9
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,840
Making money isn't shameful at all.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,500
It sounds

11
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,890
good.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,530
A romance development game with a mythological theme

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,740
could be a big hit.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,500
Feifei.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,460
If we do this,

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,100
you could have a younger version of Jiang Ziya.

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,140
You were also inspired by me before.

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,790
You can do the same this time.

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,810
Lin Ke and I can be models.

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,470

Nice, Ji Xuan.

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,850
Now the attention of the them

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,140
is back on us.

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,340
I can make some extra money again this time.

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,340
Learn from me.

Happy Lantern Festival.

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,990
Have you had a quarrel

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,410
when we were away?

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,330
No.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,660
Of course not.

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,259
Come on.

37
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:56,820
Eat up.

38
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,259
Come on.

39
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:57,660
Here.

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,259
Try this.

41
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,460
It smells so good.

42
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,280
Sister, are you homesick?

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,230
Time to eat.

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,450
Babe.

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,850

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,500
Happy Lantern Festival.

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,780
I can’t be with you.

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,780
You two

49
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,940
help yourselves.

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,510
Where did they go?

51
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,610
Have some glutinous rice balls.

52
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,460
I'm leaving first.

53
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,860
Bye.

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,540
Bye.

56
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,890
Sister, have some glutinous rice balls.

57
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,950
It's not a complete Lantern Festival

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,300
without them.

59
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,020
No.

60
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,660
I'm so sad.

61
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,700
I need to talk to my honey.

62
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,140
Happy Lantern Festival!

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,700

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,260
Don't be sad.

67
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,170
Let me wipe your tears.

68
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,870
What's the use of just wiping tears?

69
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,270
The tears you shed

70
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,660
are like raindrops falling on my heart.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,350
A machine is a machine.

72
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,510
How can it understand human emotions?

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,600
I must have gone crazy playing games.

74
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,860
How about

75
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,620
calling Uncle and Aunt?

76
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,660
Today is the Lantern Festival.

77
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,329
No.

78
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,090
If I take the initiative to contact them,

79
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,620
it means I lost.

80
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,750
They will look down on me even more.

81
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,579
[Blessing]

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,530
Uncle and Aunt were also angry before.

83
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,740
If you contact them now,

84
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,340
they would be more than happy.

85
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,140
Lin Ke,

86
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,040
do you think it’s childish for me

87
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,940
to be running away from home at thirty?

88
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,930
Of course not.

89
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,540
You’re the smartest and most amazing girl

90
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,100
in my heart.

91
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,570
Thank you.

92
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,590
But

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,150
I know I was wrong this time.

94
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,520
I deceived them first.

95
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,510
You really

96
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,900
don’t need to defend me.

97
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,750
So,

98
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,310
are you going to apologize?

99
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,269
Today is the Lantern Festival.

100
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,140
They will definitely forgive you.

101
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,870
But what about you when I leave?

102
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,230
It’s not good for you to keep staying here.

103
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,310
It's okay.

104
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,460
I have money.

105
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,780
I can stay in a hotel.

106
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,920
As long as you are happy,

107
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,909
I'm willing to do anything.

108
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,260
Even if this transaction ends,

109
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,070
I can't give you anything.

110
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,390
You don't have to give me anything.

111
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,560
You’re different for me.

112
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,690
I thought

113
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,940
being a devoted and filial man

114
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,659
was just your character setting,

115
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,790
but it turns out

116
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,500
you are sincere.

117
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,700
There’s no one more sincere to you than I am.

118
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,640
Okay.

119
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,060
I hereby declare that

120
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,940
from now on,

121
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,960
you are truly my friend.

122
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,770
I've worked hard for so long

123
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,870
just to become your friend.

124
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,300
Are you happy?

125
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,550
I am very loyal

126
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,740
to my friends.

127
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,480
I'm happy.

128
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,620
I'm so happy.

129
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,730
Hi.

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,040
Babe Lin Ke.

131
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,430
Next week,

132
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,810
you'll be my boyfriend.

133
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,270
But don't worry.

134
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,070
♫Today is Monday, and the cycle begins again♫

135
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,350
I'll protect you.

136
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,680
♫Everything I do seems purposeless♫

137
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,320
♫Should I run away or wait for things to turn around?♫

138
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,460
So

139
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,760
are you going home?

140
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,300
No.

141
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,290
Of course I was wrong.

142
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,920
But I won't regret it.

143
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,110
This time,

144
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,580
I won’t back down.

145
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,960
I know my parents love me.

146
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,060
But what I need more is understanding and respect.

147
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,280
I can endure a moment of loneliness.

148
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,750
This time,

149
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,490
I must change the situation.

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,300
No matter what,

151
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,010
I will support you.

152
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,580
Isn't it beautiful?

153
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,680
Of course.

154
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,840
Really?

155
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,460
Not bad.

156
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,160
By the way,

157
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,380
how’s the game you were playing before,

158
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,140
Love and Pay?

159
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,900
The character affection levels in that game

160
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,050
max out in no time

161
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,410
and it’s not interesting at all.

162
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,760
I’ve quit playing.

163
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,010
Two-dimensional characters are still too mechanical.

164
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,650
None are as cute as our Lin Ke.

165
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,659
So, Lin Ke has returned to being the favorite.

166
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,650
No wonder he hasn’t been coming to discuss strategies with me lately.

167
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,120
You ungrateful little rascal,

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,159
so indecisive.

169
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,940
Qiu Feifei,

170
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,920
what about you?

171
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,140
Be quiet.

172
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
I'm talking to Lu Zihao.

173
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,390
This is a key plot moment.

174
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,480
Didn't you develop a game before?

175
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,770
How's that going?

176
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,060
Still writing, still writing.

177
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,770
Uncle and Aunt,

178
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,980
why did you leave right after the festival?

179
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,240
Please come back soon.

180
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,790
Look at them,

181
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,830
all they care about is romance

182
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,720
and have forgotten about their responsibilities.

183
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,280
You think so too, right?

184
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,130
Exactly.

185
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,500
A house full of love-struck people,

186
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,300
and only the two of us are normal.

187
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,130
Yet, we’re

188
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,890
at the bottom of the food chain.

189
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,920
It’s truly outrageous,

190
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,250
truly outrageous.

191
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,200
Are you comforting me?

192
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,550
You are so obedient,

193
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,100
unlike that silly girl Qiu Feifei.

194
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,950
How dare you call me a silly girl?
