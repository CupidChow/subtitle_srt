4
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,430
It's not my style to run away from a battle.

5
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,080
Let me make it clear.

6
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,240
The final decision regarding this competition will be made by the organizers,

7
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,620
which are Fei and me.

8
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,160
We'll determine the competition details

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,900
and we'll be the judges.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,450
Do you have any objections?

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,150
No.

12
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,050
Since you have no objections,

13
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,130
I announce

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,980
the competition begins now.

15
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,770
Good men in the new era

16
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,720
must excel both in their work and in cooking.

17
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,650
They must be virtuous and capable,

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,190
but more importantly, they must excel at budgeting.

19
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,930
They can handle kinds of housework.

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,710
So now we are going to have

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,380
a boyfriend housekeeping competition.

22
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,180
I have a question.

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,759
Go adead.

24
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,759
Do we need the competition?

25
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,560
I think Lin Ke has already won.

26
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,610
No.

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,460
Fei, I think we should give Ji Xuan a chance.

28
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,190
What if he does his best

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,870
and shows his strength today?

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,070
Alright.

don't blame me for using my own methods.

34
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,840
A regular housekeeping competition

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,910
is too boring.

36
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,990
So today,

37
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,610
I've prepared a fun one for you.

38
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,680
Here is the procedure.

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,140
The first step is to buy the vegetables.

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,530
The contestants need to

41
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,760
get through the 1st eara with Fei and me.

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,640

Take the ingredients

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,410
and sit on the prepared blanket.

48
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,620
And then move to the kitchen without leaving the blanket

49
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,750
until you get there and start cooking.

They need to use their abdominal strength to play this game.

70
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,630
In other words, the person who excels

71
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,610

Why is it so delicious?

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,450
Actually,

85
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,840
a lot of food ingredients have salt in them.

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,740
For example, shrimp skin and seaweed

87
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,450
contains a lot of fibers.

88
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,900
The soup made from them

89
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,580
can make the dishes salty,

90
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,990
but it also adds more flavor,

91
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,970
making the dishes taste better.

92
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,140

Drink less cola.
