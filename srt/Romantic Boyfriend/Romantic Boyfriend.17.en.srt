00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,210
[Romantic boyfriend]

3
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,360
[Episode 17]

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,290
Mingming.

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,880
You need to double-check the values here.

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,110
Okay.

7
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,640
Send the original artwork of Yan Sanniang to the modeling team later.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,080
Our game is about to launch,

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,959
and we need to quickly prepare the second phase tasks.

10
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,650
Got it.

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
What are you doing?

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,640
Playing on your phone during work hours?

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,840
Lu Zihao sent me an invitation for the Lantern Festival.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,880
I need to reply.

15
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,890
Boss.

16
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,600
Please cut me some slack.

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,320
Who is Lu Zihao?

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,410
Isn't Fu Chaoqing your true love?

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,450
Lu Zihao is the main character in the 'Love and Pay' game.

20
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,759
His hands are so pretty.

21
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,090
I wish only to be with you

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,850
on the Lantern Festival.

23
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,789
His voice is also so soothing, I really like him.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,900
Isn't this an otome game?

25
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,759
When did you start liking this kind of game?

26
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,800
I don't know.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
Let me tell you, this game is addictive.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,720
Before I knew it, I was spending big

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,560
to rank up and support this character.

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,490
Spending money?

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,160
Didn't you have PTSD from your last spending spree?

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,940
Well, Lu Zihao cured me of that.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,120
It sounds so compelling,

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,320
I want to give it a try.

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,220
Don't pick the same husband as me!

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
Don't worry,

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,199
I'm not into the older brother type.

38
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,880
Let me see.

39
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,740
[Lu Zihao]

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,870
[Bai Xiao]

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,440
Bai Xiao.

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,000
He looks good and is full of energy.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,050
I'll choose him.

44
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,690
You've always loved puppy-like guys.

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,280
What,

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,740
did I say something wrong?

47
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,920
Leave me alone.

48
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,970
Annoying.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,730
Annoying.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,880
I drew Lu Zihao's

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,720
limited edition card and appearance for the Lantern Festival.

52
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,450
Great.

53
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,270
Let me see.

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,190
He's really handsome.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,680
You're not allowed to like him!

56
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,770
I'm the only Mrs. Lu in this house!

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,650
Humph!

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,310
I'm perfectly happy being Mrs. Bai. Who cares?

59
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,930
Why are they so serious?

60
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,880
It looks like they're playing a game

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,440
called Love and Pay.

62
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,120
They're totally obsessed.

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,329
I've gotten up several times at night

64
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,990
and seen them staying up all night gathering materials.

65
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,780
Isn't that an otome game?

66
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,100
They're not exactly young anymore,

67
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,170
why are they still playing dating games?

68
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,130
You don't get it.

69
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,840
It's exactly women their age

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,170
who are the main audience for otome games.

71
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,840
They're busy with work in big cities,

72
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,130
don’t have time for real relationships,

73
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,500
and have disposable income.

74
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,100
Game companies love people like them the most.

75
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,970
But

76
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,440
aren't they

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,680
game company employees themselves?

78
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,670
It turns out even producers can fall into the traps of capitalism.

79
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,140
No way.

80
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,070
[Blessing]

81
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
Sisters, have some fruits.

82
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,700
No, Lin Ke. I'm not hungry.

83
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,450
[Blessing]

84
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,680
Sisters,

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
let me feed you.

86
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,800
I have no time. I'm busy now. Go play by yourself.

87
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,950
I can't even compete with a 2D character for affection;

88
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,080
I'm really useless.

89
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,600
Wait. Why are you even competing with a 2D character?

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
It's just fictional.

91
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,900
Did I just hear someone looking down on the 2D world?

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Who says real people can compare to 2D characters?

93
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,400
They are flawless.

94
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,440
Not only are they super handsome

95
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,800
with perpetual peak looks

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
and eight-pack abs,

97
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,080
but they're also rich

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,740
and love spending money on you.

99
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,680
And when you're done with them, you can sell your account to recoup costs.

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,170
Plus, they're deeply loyal and devoted,

101
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,220
unlike 3D men

102
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
who are indecisive and hard to read,

103
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,230
with the risk of falling out of love in the future.

104
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,159
That's right.

105
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,750
They can greet you at regular times,

106
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,240
remind you to bring an umbrella when it rains,

107
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,360
remind you to use sunscreen on sunny days,

108
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,760
and tell you to dress warmly when it gets cold.

109
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,240
Yes.

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,760
And in the game,

111
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,360
they also give various gifts, take you out,

112
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,040
whisper sweet words, and set up dates.

113
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,010
They practically have superpowers.

114
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,090
I don’t realize it until you compare,

115
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,200
but these 2D boyfriends

116
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
really outshine 3D ones in every way.

117
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,320
This is the real perfect boyfriend.

118
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,660
We all misunderstood.

119
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,040
If we're going to spend money, we should spend it on them.

120
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,700
That way, we won’t be at a loss.

121
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,180
Yes.

122
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,740
You're right.

123
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,200
With the 2D boyfriend,

124
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,810
who needs a real boyfriend?

125
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,920
I want to be Mrs. Bai.

126
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,600
Then I want to be Mrs. Lu.

127
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,320
It seems like they've really fallen into it.

128
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,830
What should I do?

129
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,850
Mingming is about to abandon me soon.

130
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,830
In the current situation, we can only stop competing against each other

131
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,240
and join forces to fight against the 2D characters.

132
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,130
You're right.

133
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,580
There's no point in competing further.

134
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,240
As the saying goes, “Know yourself and your enemy, and you will never be defeated.“

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,080
How about we

136
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,290
try playing this game

137
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,680
and get into the roles of the characters?

138
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,040
You're right.

139
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,150
We're finally done.

140
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,360
I finally collected everything after spending 100,000 yuan.

141
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,510
Why did you come out so late?

142
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,290
I've missed you so much

143
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,600
after not seeing you all night.

144
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,480
Lin Ke,

145
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,130
did you take the wrong medicine or something?

146
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,460
Sister, isn't this what you like?

147
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,510
Feifei.

148
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,650
Stop!

149
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,730
Wait. What do you want?

150
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,040
Are you satisfied, woman?

151
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,430
What's wrong?

152
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,380
What?

153
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
Aren’t you satisfied?

154
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,710
Isn’t this exactly your type?

155
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,110
What are you doing?

156
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,740
What's wrong with your voice? Why is it so deep?

157
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,900
Don’t you like it?

158
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,980
Don’t you like it?

159
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,440
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,659
Why did you suddenly come up?

161
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,170
Don't you know that I really hate wall bam.

162
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,510
You guys are imitating 2D characters.

163
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,020
I sincerely suggest you don’t do that.

164
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,780
There’s a real difference between 2D and 3D.

165
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,270
We will only feel disgusted if you do this.

166
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,240
That's right.

167
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,650
Hey.

168
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,670
You have double standards.

169
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,780
It’s not double standards; it's a fact.

170
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,640
Two-dimensional boyfriends and real ones are different.

171
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,120
We may like 2D characters,

172
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,480
but we don't like real men doing the same things

173
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,370
because 2D characters are far cuter.

174
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,960
Sister.

175
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,680
You clearly said before that I am the cutest.

176
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,490
I mean that

177
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,040
you are the cutest man,

178
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,930
but of course,

179
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,760
2D characters are even cuter.

180
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,290
Actually, if you want to say we're double standards, that's fine.

181
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,520
We just prefer spending money on 2D characters

182
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,120
because we like them more.

183
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,960
Since otome games are so profitable,

184
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
why don’t you develop one yourself?

185
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,429
Instead of spending money on someone else's game,
