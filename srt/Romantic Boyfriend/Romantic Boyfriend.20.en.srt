[Blessing]

6
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,250
Feifei, let me feed you.

7
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,710
No need. I can do it myself.

8
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,510
I want to eat.

9
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,940
Ji Xuan, feed me.

10
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,770
Jin Mingming,

11
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,440
come out with me for a moment, I need to talk to you.

12
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,660
Fang,

13
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,820
when did you get a dog?

14
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,190
Dog? We don't have a dog.

15
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,460
That's strange.

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,900
A few days ago, I saw Feifei and your son-in-law

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,100
walking a dog around the neighborhood.

18
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,780
It might be a stray dog that Feifei took in.

19
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,190
I haven't seen any dog at home.

20
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,610
A stray dog?

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,810
No way.

22
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,930
How could it be a stray dog?

23
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,420
It looked really expensive.

24
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,570
It was big

25
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,990
and majestic.

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,190
I'll check it out when I get home later.

27
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,180
What's so mysterious?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,070
Mingming,

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,070
let's stop swapping boyfriends and switch back.

30
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,260
Why?

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,420
Haven't you been coveting Lin Ke for a long time?

32
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,660
You two seem to be getting along well.

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,450
Lin Ke is not bad,

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,700
but don't you think it feels a bit weird?

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,030
What's weird about it?

36
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,380
They're all rental boyfriends.

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,820
Once you've paid, they're all the same.

38
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,700
I thought

39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,340
you might feel as uncomfortable as I do.

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,090
Not at all,

41
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,660
Ji Xuan and I are doing just fine.

42
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,990
Look how obedient he is.

43
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,050
Speaking of which, it's strange.

44
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,020
Why is Ji Xuan so obedient to you?

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,750
Did you use some special method?

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,640
What method could I have used?

47
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,860
Like...

48
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,300
money?

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,690
No way.

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,250
Or maybe... you forced him?

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,840
Idiot.

52
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,150
Ji Xuan is just an ordinary person.

53
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,200
Getting him under control isn't as hard as you think.

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,040
Men

55
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,200
need to be trained.

56
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,810
As long as you're skilled,

57
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,320
it doesn't matter whether it's Ji Xuan or anyone else;

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,020
to me, they're all just like Lin Ke.

59
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,190
No.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
Ji Xuan is different from Lin Ke.

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,030
Then tell me,

62
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,390
how are they different?

63
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,900
Ji Xuan…

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,070
He's so temperamental,

65
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,620
so self-assured,

66
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,020
so proud, so cunning,

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,100
and yet so gentle.

68
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,380
Ji Xuan isn't a replacement for Lin Ke.

69
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,940
What's the point of saying all this now?

70
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,950
Ji Xuan is mine.

71
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,079
Ji Xuan is mine!

72
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,280
Feifei,

73
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,390
you finally spoke your mind.

74
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,820
Could we have a talk?

75
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,790
There's nothing for us to talk about.

76
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,320
What about Feifei?

77
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,950
You like her, right?

78
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,890
Don't worry.

79
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,880
I know my place,

80
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,400
and I won't cross the line.

81
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,540
No.

82
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,090
I actually want you to date Feifei.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,740
You know she has androphobia, right?

84
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,940
I know,

85
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,300
but I don't think it's that severe.

86
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,350
Then you're wrong.

87
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,340
Ever since that scumbag Yang Peiyan traumatized her,

88
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,700
she hasn't spoken to any guys

89
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,130
or had any male friends.

90
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,260
Isn't that severe?

91
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,310
But I don't think she's that scared.

92
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,150
Don't you think

93
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,590
Feifei never rejected your approach from the beginning?

94
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,850
Can't you understand?

95
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,900
At first, I didn't think much of you two,

96
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,910
considering your past…

97
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,980
But after spending some time together,

98
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,270
I think you're not bad.

99
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,380
Besides,

100
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,700
if being with you

101
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,460
can cure Feifei's androphobia,

102
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,060
wouldn't that be a happy ending?

103
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,070
What do you think?

104
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,020
I'm okay with helping Feifei overcome her phobia,

105
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,970
but...

106
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,650
shouldn't dating be based on Feifei's willingness?

107
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,159
I feel like Feifei

108
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,770
might not be that into me.

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,140
Feifei has never been in a relationship

110
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,909
and is a bit slow when it comes to feelings.

111
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,820
I'm sure she likes you.

112
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,240
If you don't believe me,

113
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,310
let's make a bet.

114
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,670
Here's how we're gonna do this.

115
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,370
What? You three teamed up to trick me!

116
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,940
For you two,

117
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,310
I had to watch Mingming with him every day.

118
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,670
It was killing me.

119
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,420
Well, it was Feifei's fault for being an idiot.

120
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,620
Getting her to realize her feelings

121
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,730
was really tough,

122
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,900
right, Ji Xuan?

123
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,830
Ji Xuan, you...

124
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,330
My parents are back!

125
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,350
Hide!

126
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,790
Let's go!

127
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,680
What are you doing?

128
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,500
Puppy?

129
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,570
That's strange.

130
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,730
Why is no one home?

131
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,540
Puppy?

132
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,930
Puppy?

133
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,980
Where are Feifei and Ji Xuan?

134
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,180
Why are they missing?

135
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,890
They're hiding in the closet.

136
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,500
Why are we hiding?

137
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,950
How should I know?

138
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,460
I was dragged in here by you.

139
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,130
Well, I…

140
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,710
I was scared by my mom.

141
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,390
I panicked.

142
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,000
Why didn't you remind me?

143
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,450
What?

144
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
Are you angry out of embarrassment?

145
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,810
What are you doing?

146
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,870
What are you doing?

147
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,780
I'm getting out.

148
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,180
This is just a misunderstanding.

149
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,860
Are we going to keep hiding?

150
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,980
You didn't say anything

151
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,740
when she called you earlier.

152
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,920
Now, if you go out,

153
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,300
your mom will definitely think we…

154
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,230
We?

155
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,820
Pervert!

156
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,140
These two kids.

157
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,730
The house is such a mess, and they didn't even clean up.
