[Episode 9]

4
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,440
Class reunion, right?

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,100
You can go by yourself.

6
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,550
You're not the only one who can make threats, you know.

7
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,870
Watch it. I'll file a complaint against you.

8
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,660
Whatever.

9
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,300
Xue will definitely file a complaint against me later,

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,140
after what you've done.

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,440
One complaint or two, it doesn't matter.

12
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,200
That serious?

13
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,980
What do you think?

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,620
In our line of work,

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,940
the biggest taboo is

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,780
mixing personal matters with professional ones.

17
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,430
Forget it.

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,370
I can't get it through your head anyway.

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,440
I'd better leave.

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,520
Wait. Wait.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,840
Master Ji Xuan,

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,940
I was wrong.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,810
Please continue staying here.

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,070
I need you.

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,600
Well...

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,900
Are you that afraid of Yang Peiyan?

27
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,130
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,060
He's the reason

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,460
I'm afraid of men.

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,500
What did he do to you?

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,120
He...

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,700
Qiu Feifei.

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,680
I love you!

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,780
Be my woman!

[You are my only one]

36
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,530
No!

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,850
[You are my only one]

38
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,479
Feifei!

39
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,940
Be my woman.

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,180
Help!

41
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,340
Interesting.

42
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,100
I don't know why I'm stuck here.

43
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,700
Let me give you a suggestion.

44
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,330
Stay away from my woman.

45
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:04,850
Well...

46
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,580
What are you doing?

47
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,020
Are you crazy?

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,050
If you ask me,

49
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,980
it's not the bad men who are scary

50
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,180
but the greasy and overly confident ones.

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,180
Because you can't escape from them.

52
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,650
Because of him,

53
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,730
I have psychological trauma

54
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,340
about having close contact with boys.

55
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,490
All the more reason

56
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,130
you shouldn't go to the reunion.

57
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,130
I've been hiding from him for years.

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,010
Do I have to hide from him forever?

59
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,990
Why should I?

60
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm not the one who's wrong.

61
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,490
Yes.

62
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,520
But your back hasn't recovered yet.

63
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,720
Can't you go later, when you get better?

64
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,400
You're full of excuses.

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
You don't want to go with me,

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,600
but someone else is willing to.

67
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,570
Whatever.

68
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,170
Cheers!

69
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,340
We haven't seen each other for ten years, right?

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,130
How does your husband treat you now?

71
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,970
Pretty good.

72
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,810
You two haven't changed at all.

73
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,950
Really?

74
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,660
I feel like you've changed quite a bit.

75
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,330
Hey, Jin Mingming, what's going on?

76
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,290
What time is it? Why aren't you here?

77
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,770
I'm sorry. Something came up.

78
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,050
I can't go tonight.

79
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,880
Jin Mingming, are you trying to kill me?

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,360
Go home early,

81
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,440
or

82
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,770
call Ji Xuan for help.

83
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,010
He's a professional, after all.

84
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,890
No. I'll never beg him, even if it kills me.

85
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,820
Long time no see.

86
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,350
-Yang Peiyan is here. I really gotta go.
-Long time no see.

87
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,210
Long time no see.

88
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,260
Qiu Feifei, don't rush off yet.

89
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,730
Let's play Truth or Dare.

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,960
Let's all play.

91
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,620
I have the King. Who's holding the Three of Clubs?

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,110
Truth or dare?

93
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,920
Dare.

94
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,180
I can't tell everyone how much I hate Yang Peiyan, can I?

95
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,680
Then you and the one with the highest hand should do a cross-cupped drink.

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,080
Who has the highest hand?

97
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,170
Who?

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,070
Who?

99
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,130
I'd better

100
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,420
drink as a punishment.

101
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,760
It's no fun drinking alone.

102
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Have a drink with me, old friend.

103
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,450
Wait a minute.

104
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,000

I'll file a complaint against you.

151
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,690

I'm already used to

159
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,770
your chicken breast.

160
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,890
I think the chicken breast goes very well with plum wine.

161
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,170
It pairs nicely with wine.

162
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,290
Eat more if you like it.

You were so cool!

167
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,040
I told you not to fall in love with me.

168
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,580
Come on.

169
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,860
I'll only fall in love with you if you stop charging me.

170
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,390
If I didn't charge you money,
I would have to work at a construction site.

171
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,140
How could I afford to study?

172
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,390

173
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,490
Really.

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,730
Didn't I tell you I'm an orphan?

175
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,250
I thought you made that up to fool my parents.

176
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,990
Idiot.

177
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,850

00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,010
Fine.

179
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,680
Don't worry. I won't argue with you about anything anymore.

180
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,810
Good.

181
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,460
Then, do me a favor now.

182
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,150
Just say it.

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
This is a new contract I drafted.

184
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,970
Sign it if there are no problems.

185
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,550

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,470
Yeah.

189
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,180
By signing this contract, you'll be doing me the greatest favor.

190
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
Just sign it.

191
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,440
Why are you in my dream again?

192
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,620
You're haunting me.
