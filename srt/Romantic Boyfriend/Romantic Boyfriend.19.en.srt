[Episode 19]

4
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,350
Handshake.

5
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,260
The other one.

6
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,360
Get down.

7
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,740
Good boy.

8
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,540
Such a good boy.

[Blessing]

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,260
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,820
You were secretly filming me.

12
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,470
No, I was just collecting material. You agreed.

13
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,180
Give it to me.

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,710
No.

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,360
No.

16
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:11,730
Give it to me.

17
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,370
No.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,970
Give it to me.

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,370
Sure, you can use it,

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,160
but you need to pay for

21
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,550
the image rights first.

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,550
Pay me first.

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:29,990
Here.

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,380
[Blessing]

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,500
Give it to me.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,410
Give me. This hand.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,120
This one.

28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:32,979
It's fine.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:33,900
It hurts.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,100
You still need to pay.

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,870
Lin Ke is not here.

32
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,670
I'm here for you.

33
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,330
Me?

34
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,110
Let's talk.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,780
I have nothing to talk to you.

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,729
What about Feifei?

37
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,509
What?

38
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,990
Just because you lost a game,

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,710
you gave me to Jin Mingming?

40
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,790
No, it's not like that.

41
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,270
It's just a small mortgage.

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,509
Just hold on for a few more days.

43
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,060
How could you?

44
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,370
Mingming already has me.

45
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,970
Alright,

46
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,900
you're mine now.

47
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,950
What do you think?

48
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,510
Surprised?

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,520
Yes.

50
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,910
Shocked, more like.

51
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,870
Oh,

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,180
don't be so upset.

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,470
What's wrong with swapping rental boyfriends?

54
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,260
Do you want to choose your customer?

55
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,900
If you're still not happy, I'll double the rent.

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,900
What do you think?

57
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,760
Mingming.

58
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,270
Enough.

59
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,630
Qiu Feifei,

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,300
don't you have anything to say to me?

61
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,880
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,280
That's all?

63
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,750
I knew it, you're dissatisfied with me.

64
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,740
You've wanted to swap me with Lin Ke.

65
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,180
No.

66
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,980
Now,

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,710
you just dumped me.

68
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,100
No, I didn't mean that.

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,960
Ji Xuan,

70
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,710
I was wrong.

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,270
Don't be mad, calm down.

72
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,920
Calm down.

73
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,470
Touch me again,

74
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,600
and I'll charge you extra fee for physical contact.

75
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,690
Give me five minutes to explain.

76
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,170
Go ahead.

77
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,770
It's Jin Mingming.

78
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,940
I had a 100% chance of winning in that game,

79
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,240
but I didn't expect her

80
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,310
spending so much money on it.

81
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,790
That's not what I'm asking.

82
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,360
Why did you use me as a bet?

83
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,560
Well,

84
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,810
we were having fun playing games that day,

85
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,040
and then Jin Mingming suggested a bet.

86
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,290
You know how unreliable Jin Mingming is.

87
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,980
Nothing she says really counts.

88
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,620
But I...

89
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,470
I didn't expect that she was serious this time.

90
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,490
Are you serious?

91
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,600
I...

92
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,400
I'm not serious.

93
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,740
Have you decided?

94
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,850
My patience is running thin.

95
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,590
Mingming, maybe we...

96
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,510
I agree.

97
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,760
Not bad. You're sensible.

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I disagree.

99
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,610
Why are you mad?

100
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,810
Don't worry. I won't abandon you.

101
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,909
Both of you

102
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,040
are like my wings.

103
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,360
You can't have both.

104
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,750
Ji Xuan or me,

105
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,550
you can only choose one.

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,110
Babe,

107
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,870
you're

108
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,450
putting me in a tough spot.

109
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,970
But I choose Ji Xuan.

110
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,710
This is more exciting.

111
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,340
Mingming,

112
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,420
how could you do this to me?

113
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,430
Fine.

114
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,500
Feifei,

115
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,630
from now on,

116
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,370
I'll only serve you.

117
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,260
Let me be your rental boyfriend.

118
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,660
No need.

119
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,780
Feifei.

120
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,870
Feifei.

121
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,420
No need.

122
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:18,950
Fei...

123
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,200
Feifei.

124
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,170
Feifei.

125
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,890
Don't overreact, Feifei.

126
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,110
Ji Xuan made you breakfast?

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,110
He even fed you himself.

128
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,450
How did you do that?

129
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,500
Relax.

130
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,750
Ji Xuan.

131
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,030
I'm thirsty. I want coffee.

132
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,540
Impressive, huh?

133
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,150
Breakfast is here.

134
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,380
You also made sandwiches?

135
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,920
Yeah, Feifei.

136
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,130
Try my cooking.

137
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,090
It's delicious.

138
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,150
Try this one.

139
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,630
It's a different flavor.

140
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,990
This is tasty too.

141
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,470
I've been working overtime lately,

142
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,180
and my shoulders feel sore.

143
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,740
Ji Xuan,

144
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,790
why aren't you charging for physical contact now?

145
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,370
Feifei,

146
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,430
are you okay?

147
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,040
What's wrong, boss?

148
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,080
Call me Dear.

149
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,580
Don't go too far.

150
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,650
My Dear.

151
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,430
Good boy.

152
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,930
You...

153
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,840
You actually called her that?

154
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,620
Where did your pride go?
