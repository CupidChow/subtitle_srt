00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,400

00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,450

Take care.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,120
Bye.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,630
Bye.

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,130
I didn't expect them to be together so soon.

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,310
Lin Ke looks elegant.

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,600
So it surprises me that he acted so quickly.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,060
He did better than Ji.

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,050
Why are these two here

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,660
so disappointing?

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,240
Ji.

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,820
Are you leaving now?

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,280
No, not yet.

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,950
The car I booked will arrive later.

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,210
I'll wait here.

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,680
Is he going to watch our daughter leaving for her blind date?

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,970
He is such an awkward young man.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,820
Why don't you make yourself look nice for the blind date?

30
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,310
What would Dr. Li think of your appearance?

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,350
You're really pissing me off.

32
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,310
I'll go get changed now.

33
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,289

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,870
It's almost noon. Go to the restaurant now.

35
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,930
Don't be late and keep Dr. Li waiting.

36
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,550
Why aren't young people these days as direct anymore?

37
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,330
His girl is about to date someone else,
but he still hasn't told her how he feels.

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,890
What is he waiting for?

39
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,220
Calm down.

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,440
Honey,

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,650
what's the name of the restaurant

42
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,310
you booked for our daughter's blind date?

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,670
I'd like to know the details.

44
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,410
Don't worry.

45
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,829
I booked the most famous one on the internet, Little Paris.

46
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:37,950
I heard that all blind dates there went successful.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,150
Little Paris?

48
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,310
Is that the one near Xikou?

49
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,990
Yes.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,800
It's not very far.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,680
You can even get there by running.

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,920
Finally, here's the silver lining.

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,910
I've been so worried for the past few days.

54
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,300
I'm so anxious about them.

55
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,880
Finally, he is doing the right thing.

56

Let's go and find out what's happening.

Let's go.

59
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,200
This is good.

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,550
These will make great materials

61
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,390
for their future wedding.

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,600
Let's go. Now.

Let's go.

64
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,370
Miss Qiu, your work is in the computer industry, right?

65
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,990
Yes.

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,110
I'm a game designer.

67
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,950
I see.

68
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,430
It's a stressful job,

69
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,230
but

70
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,220
it would be better if you adjusted your schedule
and worked out more.

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,950
After all, health is the foundation of good work.

72
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,260
Thank you, Dr. Li.

73
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,520
I’ll keep that in mind.

74
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,990
After all, I'm not that young anymore.

75
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,870
Nonsense.

76
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,070
You're so lovely

77
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,990
and nice.

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,850
It's the first time anyone has called me lovely.

79
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,630
Dr. Li, you're too kind.

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm not being kind.

81
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,870
I'm telling the truth.

82
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,330
Aunt Fang is a nice person as well.

83
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,070
She's kind and generous.

84
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,020
That's right.

85
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,920
I think my mom is great too.

86

We are well-suited for each other.

87
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,050
Actually, I really like your parents

88
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,290
and the environment of your family.

89
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,950
It makes me like you even more.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,010
We'll be perfect together.

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,250
Oh, okay.

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,800
Look. This meal

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,560
has a total of 500 calories.

94
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,370
It's a very reasonable amount.

95
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,330
Would you like to give it a try?

96
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,980

Dr. Li said something that touched me deeply.

He said

161
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,030
he likes Feifei's family,

162
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,800
which makes him wants to be with her even more.

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm really an orphan.

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,590
Since I was young,

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,740
I've never felt a parent's love.

166
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,000
But ever since I came to the Qiu family,

167
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,590
Feifei,

168
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,030

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,770
and dad

172
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,450
might not have been simple and pure,

173
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,320
but what I feel for her is very real.

174
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,090
I not only like Feifei,

175
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,590

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,210
you're still seeing

191
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,460
other young women.

192
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,820
You're right.

193
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,510
Therefore,

194
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,840
when I decided to pursue Feifei,

195
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,120
I made up my mind

196
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,380
that I wouldn’t engage in anything
like being a rental boyfriend ever again.

197
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,809
[WeChat]

198
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,220
Dad.

199
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,710
Mom.

200
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,180
I will never upset Feifei.

201
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,000
Please give me a chance.

202
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,660
Feifei.

203
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,210
Ji Xuan.

204
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
Ji Xuan.

205
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,970
You...

206
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,190
You're back.

207
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,200
I'm back.

208
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,130
Feifei,

209
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,810
would you take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

210
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,840
No need to spend money

211
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,900
or build up affection.

212
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,470
You could have a sunny, filial boyfriend.

213
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,600
Would you

214
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,110
like that?

215
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,910
Are you kidding me?

216
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,630
I'm not kidding. I'm serious.

217
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,260
I just want

218
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,630
a kiss from you.

219
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,170
Do you want me to be your boyfriend or not?

220
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,380
No, I don't.

221
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,980
♫Today is Monday, and the cycle begins again♫

222
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,500
♫Everything I do seems purposeless♫

223
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,950
I'm sure it's a value-added service.

224
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,500
♫Should I run away or wait for things to turn around?♫

225
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,510
I won't be fooled again.

226
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,390
I don't need to pay me money.

227
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,560
♫Decide now, no more doubts♫

228
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,050
Because from now on,

229
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,590
I'm officially your boyfriend.

230
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,350
♫All the most important decisions♫

231
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,030
I will only serve you, Qiu Feifei.

232
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,830
♫Change the environment; love yourself first♫

233
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,350
All of your requests will be free of charge.

234
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,330
♫There will be surprises♫

235
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,970
♫Being strong or fragile; I will never lie♫

236
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,890
♫There's no need to act tough for anyone♫

237
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,570
♫Plain or madness; just a thought apart♫

238
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,250
♫When I wake up; I welcome a new imagination♫
