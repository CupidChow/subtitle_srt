[Episode 12]

4
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,230
I need to confess something to you today.

5
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,350
I knew it! You've been using cheats.

6
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,510
Where did you buy it?

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,260
No.

8
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,320
I'm sorry for lying to you.

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,240
Actually, Lin Ke isn't really my boyfriend.

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,820
Just like Ji Xuan,

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,140
he's a rental boyfriend.

12
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,050
Feifei wants to rent a boyfriend?

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,240
I didn't expect her to have such hobby.

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,380
Let me see.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,310

[Lin Ke]

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,510
This is exactly my type.

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,710
Sorry, Feifei.

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,060
[Installation designer]

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,350
I'll find you another one.

[Ji Xuan]

23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,960
Ji Xuan?

24
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,410
This guy's good-looking. Okay.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,780
[Ji Xuan]

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,660
Baby Lin Ke,

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,480
I'm coming for you.

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,400
That's the story.

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,150
So,

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,660
Lin Ke is also a rental boyfriend,

31
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,380
and he was assigned to me at first?

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,890
Babe, I know I was wrong.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,130
I've realized my mistake.

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,810
Since I knew Ji Xuan was unreliable,

35
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,400
my conscience has been suffering every day.

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,590
You can punish me however you want.

37
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,120
You're so mean.

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,370
You keep the golden card to yourself

39
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,830
and leave me the junk card.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,450
Tell me,

41
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,070
are you still my good friend?

42
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,320
I was wrong, babe.

43
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,810
Please forgive me.

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,710
We can swap if you want.

45
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Lin Ke for you, and Ji Xuan for me.

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,650
No way.

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,410
Something's wrong with you, Qiu Feifei.

48
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,720
You really don't want to swap?

49
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,730
Could it be that you're falling for Ji Xuan?

50
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,130
Absolutely impossible.

51
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,000
Really?

52
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,370
How could I like him?

53
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,079
My parents have accepted him anyway.

54
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,520
I'll just settle for now.

55
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,490
Don't worry. I'll make it up to you.

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,079
It's just Ji Xuan.

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,450
I'll train him

58
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,650
to be as perfect as Lin Ke, a model

59
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,540
boyfriend.

60
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,850
[Blessing]

61
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,480
I advise you

62
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,020
to let go of your unnecessary self-esteem.

63
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,140
Destiny is rare.

64
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,770
Whatever you do, do it early.

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,110
We can have a competition then.

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,570
[Blessing]

67
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,640
If Ji Xuan loses,

68
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,410
he must sign the contract.

69
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,670
Ji Xuan is very competitive, right?

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,280
We just need to play some tricks

71
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,260
in the competition

72
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,410
to make the result biased towards Lin Ke.

73
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,010
That way,

74
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,340
it's reasonable

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,520
to let Ji Xuan sign the contract.

76
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,770
Although Ji Xuan is competitive,

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,380
he might not agree to participate in this kind of competition.

78
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,220
It’s fine.

79
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,680
He can leave if he doesn't want to compete.

80
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,390
It's not that easy

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,750
to let me stay

82
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,150
or leave as you like.

83
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,360
Mingming, don't do this.

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,010
I don't want Ji Xuan to leave.

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
Feifei, don't be soft-hearted.

86
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,840
We didn't take his money.

87
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,060
After signing this contract,

88
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,990
Ji Xuan will obey you from now on.

89
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,160
Don't you want Ji Xuan to be as sweet

90
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,450
and caring like Lin Ke?

91
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,160
Ji Xuan,

92
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,370
what are you doing?

93
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,730
Pack my things and leave.

94
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,270
Why are you suddenly packing and leaving?

95
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,300
I just heard Jin Mingming saying

96
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,950
they don't need rental boyfriends anymore

97
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,850
and want to find an excuse to kick us out.

98
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,690
I think,

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
in that case,

100
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,540
I'd rather leave on my own

101
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,760
than be embarrassed.

102
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,110
I'm leaving,

103
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,510
and you'll be next.

104
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,150
Take care.

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,070
How could this happen?

106
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,890
Ji Xuan,

107
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,100
let's form an alliance.

108
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,620
I don't want to leave Mingming.

109
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,570
You don't want to leave either, do you?

110
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,730
In that case,

111
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,550
let's form an alliance for the next few days

112
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,590
and work together to win them back.

113
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,870
I refuse.

114
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,940
Don't reject me so quickly.

115
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,470
I know we didn't get along with each other before,

116
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,050
but we're both rental boyfriends,

117
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,630
so our interests align.

118
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,050
If you give up now,

119
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,830
you won't get a good review.

120
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,540
If you cooperate with me,

121
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,080
I'll make sure Feifei gives you a high rating.

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,210
Okay, I agree.

123
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,210
I called you here today

124
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,980
to announce something.

125
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,300
Ji Xuan was right.

126
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,540
Mingming doesn't want me anymore.

127
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,170
As you all know,

128
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,320
my rental boyfriend has been exposed.

129
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,880
Now, only Feifei still needs a rental

130
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,230
boyfriend.

131
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,640
Then only one of you can stay.

132
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,530
So,

133
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm going to hold

134
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,890
a Best Boyfriend Competition.

135
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,400
You two are contestants.

136
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,520
Feifei and I will decide the winner as judges.

137
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,750
Given the situation, the loser won't be

138
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,260
kicked out immediately,

139
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,030
but the house is not for free.

140
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,590
The loser must sign this new lease agreement,

141
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,870
take on household chores,

142
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,480
and serve us well.

143
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,960
Ji Xuan,

144
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,250
this is clearly aimed at you.

145
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,380
You want to team up with me against Mingming?

146
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,350
No way.

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
So, are you going to participate in this competition?

148
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,510
I'm in, Mingming.

149
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,780
I'll win for sure.

150
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,660
Too bad he's hard to fool.

151
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,760
Alliance is indeed unreliable.

152
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,750
Ji Xuan, what about you?

153
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,980
If you don't want to compete,

154
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,120
you don't have to do it.

155
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,070
It's fine.

156
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,220
It's not my style to run away without a fight. I'm in.
