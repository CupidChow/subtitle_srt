00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,360
GO, YU QING

172
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,120
Since Captain left,

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,640
the team has been in low spirits.

174

I wasn't paying attention
and thought it was the captain's voice.

I almost thought we had to run laps again.

Where are Qiao Chen and Baiyang?

Oh. They misbehaved in class today
and had to stay behind.

With a team like this,
will we be able to beat Hai Guang?

If we lose to Hai Guang,

should we tell Captain
it was because he wasn't here?

[Qiao Chen] We haven't even played
against each other in an official match.

280
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,319
What is there to talk about?

281
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,880
A few days ago,
we played against Hai Guang.

282
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,160
We thought we'd come over and say hi.

283
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,680
Oh! What I want to tell you is,

284
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
if you don't work hard,

285
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,760
our today will be your tomorrow.

286
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,839
Captain, are you insulting them
or are you insulting us?

287
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,520
After a couple of matches,
I've been thinking,

288
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,080
why do we feel fear on the tennis court?

289
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,280
Then, I realized that,
it's not that we're not good enough.

290
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,800
It's that we didn't work hard enough.

291
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,480
We can only keep our fingers crossed
during the draw.

292
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,160
But if we practice as hard as we can,

293
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,920
no matter what opponent we face,

294
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,240
we will have the confidence to fight
until the last minute.

295
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,960
[Jingtian] That why I decided that,
from now on,

296
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,080
we'll work twice as hard.

297
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,600
Ying Cai will not back down again.

298

Very well.

301
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,920
Since you're here,
let's play a serious match.

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
-Of course--
-Sorry.

303

I didn't bring my racket.

304
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320

306
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,320
I'm just the messenger.

307
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,600
If you guys at Yu Qing
keep treating us like this,

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,280
it's going to get pretty awkward.

309
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,840
See you.

310
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,960
Uh...

311
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,640

I thought we could have a good game.

312

He said he was just the messenger.
Who is the messenger?

313
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,360
[Coach Qi] Siyang arranged all of this
before he left.

314
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,240
-Coach.
-[Coach Qi] Starting today,

315
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,800
up until the national tournament,

316
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,240
we will have a friendly match
with other schools each day.

317
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,760
I hope you guys can adjust your mindset
and find your focus

318
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,720
through these friendly matches.

319
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,600
Don't let Siyang's good intentions
go to waste.

320
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,440
Even though he's abroad,
he's still thinking of us.

321
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,480
Of course.

322
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,240
He only did this
to let you guys know that,

323
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,640
even though he's abroad,
his spirit is always here with the team.

324
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,960
[Coach Qi] He'll do his best
to help everyone win.

325
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,840
You won't let him down, will you?

326
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
[both] No.

327
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,280

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,200
[He Xinglong sighs]

492
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,040
Yu Feng wouldn't get defeated that easily.

493
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,560
I remember that they fight harder
the further they're behind.

494
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,200
That's right.

495
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,160
Last time, when we did
out-of-school training,

496
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,840
we lost our uniforms to them.

497
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,800
Hey, they're here.

498
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
[gloomy music]

499
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,200
You look like you got beat pretty bad.

500
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,680
What's up with you guys?
You are missing team members.

501
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,320
Where are Xingzi and Xu Ziping?

502
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,760
Sorry, Captain and Xingzi
couldn't come today.

503
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,320
He asked me to congratulate you guys
on getting into the national tournament.

504
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,600
[Tienan] Keep up the good work.

505
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,200
Let's begin.

506
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
[upbeat music]

507
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,840
Come on, Qiao Chen.

508
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,000
It's time for me to teach you
how to play tennis again.

509
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,560
Let's begin, Lu Xia.

510
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,040
Come on, baby!

511
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Burning!

512
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,000
All right, that's the Yu Feng I know.

513
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,800
Come on, Golden Partners!

514
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,480
[chuckles]

515
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,600
Cool. So many He Xinglongs.

516
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,800
CHI DAYONG AND TANG JIALE
VS. CHEN DESEN AND WEI KEFEI

517
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,360
QIAN CHEN VS. SHEN WEIMING

518
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,360
LU XIA VS. SIMA YIWU

519
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,760
You guys deserve to compete
in the nationals.

520
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,960
Compared to you,
Yu Feng still has a long way to go.

521
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,040
You just lost to Hai Guang.

522
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,720
Their goal is to win the national
championship three times in a row.

523
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,520
It's not embarrassing to lose to them.
Keep training and come back next year.

524
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,760
No need to be this scared.

525
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,280
Next year...

526
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,320
[soft chuckle]

527
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,640
I bet you'll do even worse
when you go against Hai Guang.

528
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
[comical music]

529
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,400
Eh?

530
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,880
Did I say something wrong?

531
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Sorry about that.
You didn't do anything wrong.

532
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,320
[Yiwu] But Hai Guang is...

533
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,280
Never mind. It was a good match today.
I'll tell our captain all about it.

534
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,280
I look forward to playing
with you guys again.

535
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,880
What is wrong with them?
They just lost a game.

536
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,760
They didn't expect to lose to that extent.

537
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
It was 0-3.

538
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
[Yan Zhiming] They pretty much
didn't win any points.

539
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,040
It was a complete failure.

540
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,360
For a dark horse like Yu Feng,
it probably hurt their pride.

541
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,800
Yu Feng's captain, Xu Ziping,
got hurt by Yuan Chi...

542
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,920
during the match.

543
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
[Dayong] He didn't come
to the friendly match today.

544
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,760
I guess it's pretty serious.

545
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
They still have a long way to go.

546
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,680
[Yan Zhiming] Before Yu Feng
sent us their videos

547
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,960
of their match with Hai Guang,

548
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,560
I adjusted our daily training schedule
based on our previous data on Hai Guang.

549
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,920
[Tang Jiale] That is too much!

550
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,640
Are you sure we can do it?

551
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,160
You can do it if you want to.

552
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,760
[sighs]

553
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,840
In preparation for this,

554
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,480
I've increased the intensity
of your physical strength training.

555
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,800
Hai Guang has a strong team,

556
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,160
and if we want to stall them,
it will be a long battle.

557
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,080
Having strong stamina
is the best way to do that.

558
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,560
Just let us see the schedule, then.

559
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,080
We need to prepare ourselves for it.

560
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,160
I'll give each of you your personalized
training schedules later.

561
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,120
But before the personalized training,
we have to complete basic training.

562
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,560
[Yan Zhiming] Put on your wrist
and ankle weights

563
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,200
and run at least ten laps
around the court.

564
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,520
I won't give you a limit.

565
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,120
The person with the most laps
won't have to drink Yan-juice that day.

566
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,320
As for the others,

567
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,000
the amount you drink will be determined
by the laps you run.

568
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,520
Yan,

569
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,120
you've turned your Yan-juice
into a punishment for us.

570
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,360
I didn't expect that either.

571
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,320
But I think it will work.

572
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,600
[laughs]

573
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,080
What does that mean? I don't understand.

574
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,160
We have to run ten laps,
but they won't be counted.

575
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,760
So we'll be ranked
according to the additional laps we run.

576
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,400
Oh.

577
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,240
Also,

578
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,000
before the tournament,

579
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,880
I'm going to pause the daily training
of those who are not main players.

580
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,680
They will be assisting with the training
of the main players.

581
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Take a look.

582
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,920
Huh? There's a lot of data on Hai Guang.

583
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,600
A whole page on just statistics.
That's more than Xing Yao.

584
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,320
Zhiming, did you start
collecting this data from Grade 10?

585
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,000
I never thought of beating Xing Yao
as our ultimate goal.

586
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,480
I'm quite curious

587
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,360
about what happened during the match
between Yu Feng and Hai Guang.

588
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,240
I agree. It was just a game.

589
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,400
They completely wrecked Yu Feng,
who usually has high spirits.

590
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,720
Hai Guang is really good.

591
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,160
We've never watched them play officially.

592
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,760
[Qiao Chen] What's the fuss about?

593
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,000
Maybe we can beat them easily.

594
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,720
If that's the case,

595
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,600
we'll win the championship
this year for sure.

596
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,960
Mm-hm.

597
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,960
[sighs]

598
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,480
Being an idiot is a blessing sometimes.

599
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,800
[chuckles]

600
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
It's not wrong to think like that.

601
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,440
When you're on the court,
both sides are equal.

602
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,640
No matter how good your record is,

603
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,280
-all games start at 0-0.
-Mm-hm.

604
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,840
Both sides have equal chances of winning.

605
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,720
Let's start training.

606
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Yes. We have to win for Yu Feng, too. Go!

607
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
Go!

608
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,760
[Qiao Chen and Tang Jiale] Go!

609
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,200

-[Coach Qi and Qiao Chen] Yes!

612
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,520
Have some more.
You need nutrients for training.

613
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,840
After your training sessions,
just come on over

614
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,639
and I'll make good food for you guys.
[chuckles]

615
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,800
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

616
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Dig in.

617
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,600
[Yan Zhiming] The food was quite greasy.

618
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,000
Everyone should have some Yan-juice later
to balance your diet.

619
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,800
-[retches, coughs]
-Ah!

620
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,360
Don't talk to me about Yan-juice today.

621
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,960
I've prepared a secret weapon.

622
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,199
These are vitamin C tablets.

623
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,080
If you guys suck up to me after eating,

624
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,320
I might feel generous
and give you guys some.

00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,320
[soft chuckle]

626
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,719
Give me some...

627
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,560

Don't get my magazine dirty.

631
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,239
What magazine?

632
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,320
The latest Tennis Monthly?

633
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,520
[Qiao Chen] There's an article
about our match with Xing Yao.

634
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,320
Photos of the whole team
are in this magazine.

635
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,560
It's worth collecting.

636
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,040
Really? Let me see. Where are we?

Really? Is everyone here?

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,040
Come take a look.

Look at me.

[Tang Jiale] I look so handsome.

643

Poor Dachi, he got blocked by Siyang.

[tranquil music]

645
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,480
It's mainly about Siyang's match
with Ji Jingwu.

646
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,600
-[Tang Jiale] Mm-hm.
-Eh?

647
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,040
[Yan Zhiming] I was not there.
Did they Photoshop me in?

648
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,440
[laughs]
They did a pretty good job.

649

a special feature on Hai Guang.

Hm.

663

REPORTER: SHASHA

664
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,600
Now, let's learn more
about Hai Guang's team.

665
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,440
What kind of moves do they have?

666
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,640
First, we have the vice-captain,
Tian Zilong, who led the team to victory.

667
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,800
Not only does he have
impeccable leadership skills,

668
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
but he's also a very well-rounded player.

669
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,120
TIAN ZILONG

670
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,120
Speaking of Tian Zilong,
another one of Hai Guang's top three

671
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,160
is Liu Lian, another exceptional player.

672
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,560
LIU LIEN

673
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,640
They spelled his name wrong.
It's spelled L-I-A-N.

674
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,440
That's Shasha's style.

675
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,080
We shouldn't watch this.
Let's change the channel.

676
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,000
Hey.

677
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,800
Yet, for the provincial finals,
fans might be sad to learn

678
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,400
that the captain of Hai Guang's team,
Bai Shiting, who many call a genius,

679
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,080
won't be able to play due to his illness.

680
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,360
[Sha] We wonder if his absence

681
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,520
will affect Hai Guang's chances of winning
the championship three times in a row.

682
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,040
We will definitely be looking forward
to this match.

683
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,760
[Qiao Chen] Finally, some good news.

684
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,960
If their captain isn't playing,
it's fairer for us.

685
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,800
[Dayong] Both sides of the scale
have lost their heaviest weights.

686
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,320
It increases the chances of us winning.

687
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,440
Yes. We're all just high school students.

688
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,440
How good can we be?

689
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,400
We've been training hard
and we are hard workers.

690
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,840
We can't be that much worse.

691
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,120
The show said

692
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,000
that they hold friendly matches
with other schools every weekend.

693
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,880
Yes. Maybe we should go check them out.

694
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,920
Hey! It's the weekend tomorrow.

695
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,760
I think that, right now,

696
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,960
we should complete our training plan
at our own pace.

697
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,320
That's the most important thing.

Do you all want to go?

Whether we go or not,
it won't change how good they are.

702
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,120
We should go.
Let's see how much of a difference it is.

703
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,280
Let's meet
at the school entrance tomorrow.

About showing our fear
in front of Hai Guang.

at the school entrance?

Using data, he can predict
the outcome of the match.
