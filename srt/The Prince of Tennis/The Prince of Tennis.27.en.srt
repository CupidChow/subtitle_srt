[Xiuwen] He didn't come
to practice these days.

Can he make it in time to the qualifying?

Will he come or not?

320

[Xiuwen] He can't enter

if he doesn't enter the elimination?

I wonder how it's going.

327
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,920
Isn't it better if he practices with us?

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,520
He will easily go
into a dead-end if practices alone.

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,640
He is even more stubborn
than me sometimes.

330
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,760
It's the coach's idea
to let Lu Xia practice alone.

331
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,080
She has her own reason for that.

The match against Xing Yao
is crucial for us.

[Siyang] The result determines
whether we can enter the Nationals.

Could I have a look
at my training plan today?

Don't slow me down.

It's all my fault.

371
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,840
It's because of me
that Lu Xia was troubled

is only because you want
to beat different opponents,

491

but you don't truly understand
who your opponents are

I think you should give up.

I mean, there are two on the court.

Your real opponent is not me,

Your opponents on the court

come and go all the time.

504
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,720
But who will always stand in your court?

505

That one is your most important opponent.

506

[Siyang] Lu Xia.

509
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Why do you play tennis?

510
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
A man.

511
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,880
What will you do after beating him?

512
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,400
What will you gain after that?

513
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,760
[Coach Muyun]
Playing tennis is like traveling.

514
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,520
The journey is more important
than the destination.

515
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,000
Whoever you set as your target,

516
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,280
and no matter
whose skills you want to learn,

517
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
you've only just begun to learn tennis.

518
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,000
As long as you go on playing,

519
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,960
you'll meet different types of players.

520
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,720
[Siyang] Maybe...

521
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,400
you'll meet someone stronger
than your target

522
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,520
even before beating that person.

523
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,600
The significance of what you're doing

524
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,600

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
That one is your most important opponent.

00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,760

7 DAYS BEFORE YU QING VS XING YAO

537
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,360
I was talking

538
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,400
about the Enlightenment.

539
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,920
[teacher] Now, let me tell you
about some thinkers

during this period,

00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,680
as well as the significance
and differences in their ideas.

I found you staring out that window
very often.

552
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,120
I think we'd better seal that window
as soon as possible

You always stick to your post.

But my legs are weak.

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,840
And besides, what should I do
with my vegetables if I escape?

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,640
Young man.

For what?

For the perfect time
to pick the fruit and vegetables.

What?

577
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,720
Every fresh fruit and vegetable
has a perfect time to be picked.

578
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,000
Picking them at that moment

579
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,360
can maximize their nutritive value
and water content.

580
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,760
For instance, this onion
has to wait two hours to be picked.

That's its perfect time.

will be highest then.

00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,280
You're still here?
The training has finished.

680
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,760
Seeing you stay here,
I wonder what you are doing.

681
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,400
It's going to rain.

682
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,320
I guess you don't have an umbrella.

683
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,360
I'm thinking about the lineup
of the school qualifying.

684
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,960
[Siyang] The coach will determine

685
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
who can play against Xing Yao
according to the qualifying result.

686
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,560
I'll wait for you.

00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,080

Baiyang, let's be a doubles pair.

693
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,920
No.

694
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,400
I won't let other people affect me.

695
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,120
I will win on the singles.

696
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,720
It's okay if you want
to go on practicing your Boomerang Snake.

697
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,800
But it's no use
if you can't use it in your match.

698
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,880
You can't create enough curve in a match

699
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,520
to make your Boomerang Snake ball
fall in the single's sideline.

700
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,960
It gives you no advantages.

701
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,120
What's your point?

702
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,320
Your practice
needs to be tested in a real game

703
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,200
to give you the confidence to use it.

704
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,640
What do you think?

705
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,880
Let's be a doubles pair

706
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,000
to strengthen your Boomerang Snake.

707
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,720
What about you?

708
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
I can also make progress in this way.

[Zhou Zhi] I remember walking this road
every time after training

I've been thinking about something.

What is it?

726
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,840
What if we are...

727
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,880
in different teams?

728
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,080
How did you come up with that?

Haven't you thought about it?

730
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,440
We would have

731
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,680
met on different occasions

732
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,920
and had a good game if so.

Which do you prefer?

738
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,440
Being teammates on the same team...

739
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,480
or being opponents?

740

Don't think about things
that only take place in your imagination.

I knew you'd say so.

Now that we are on the same team,

let's work hard together
and make it to the end.

You want more than the Nationals, right?

Of course, I want to keep winning

as long as we do our best,

then we won't have regrets.
