337
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,320
whatever happens.

338
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,520
We both agreed last year
that we'll play against Xing Yao together.

339
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,760
Do you know how helpless I felt...

340
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,720
before the game?

341
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,720
[exhales sharply]
I promise.

342
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,440
I will be with you

343
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,440
for every single game

344
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
as long as you need me.

345
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,640
All right.

346
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,640
No other man can hear me
saying these words.

347
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,560
We still have some unresolved problems,
but we will be partners again, right?

348
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,800
Mm-hm.

349
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
[chuckles softly]

350
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,440
[man 1] Mu Siyang's film.

351
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,160
Let's go.

352
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,480
[sighs sharply]

353
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm willing to do anything
as long as the captain can recover.

354
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,600
[Siyang] What are you willing to do?

355
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,800
Captain.

356
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Are you okay?

357
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
I'm fine.

358
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,200
It's just that my old wounds recrudesced.

359
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,040
I just need to rest for a while.

360
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,160
Don't fool us this time.

361
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,920
Right. You played with difficulty today.

362
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Are you really okay?

363
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,880
[sighs]

364
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,880
Give me your hand.

365
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,040
Huh?

366
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,320
It hurts! Your hand is okay!

367
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,360
[groans]

368
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,600
Now that the captain is okay
and we have beaten Xing Yao,

369
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,680
let's celebrate at my place
and have some goose.

370
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
That's great.

371
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,720
Let's go.

372
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,200
[soft chuckle]

373
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
[light music]

374
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,560
-[all] Cheers.
-Wait.

375
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,720
Before that,

376
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,440
let me say something from my heart.

377
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,400
Just a few words.

378
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,200
Just think of it as a match summary.

379
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,640
-[Qiao Chen] Okay.
-[Coach Qi] Mm.

380
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,120
I know that many of you played
in the nationals last year.

381
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,080
You played against Xing Yao
and ended up with pity and regret.

382
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,520
[Coach Qi] So you want to fulfill
your dream this year.

383
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,920
You keep on training
even when you're graduating this year.

384
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,600
And it is the first time for many of you
to play in the nationals this year.

385
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,840
You are full of expectation and curiosity,

386
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,880
not knowing what obstacles
you will come across.

387
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,200
But you got through that.

388
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,320
You've become a strong team.

389
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,520
As your coach,

390
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
I'm very proud of you.

391
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,160
We've had a lot of setbacks,

392
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,400
but I believe these experiences
will give you new beginnings

393
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,000
and will make you stronger.

394
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,440
You will become a better team.

395
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,240
Let's move forward together.

396
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,760
Our aim is the national championship.

397
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,120
Let's march on.

398
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,280
That was so good.

399
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,560
And short.

400
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
When did you guys secretly eat the food?

401
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,640
Oh. Coach, we didn't eat it secretly.

402
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,880
You...

403
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,360
Before the speech,

404
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
you told us to eat while listening, right?

405
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,840
-[chuckles softly]
-Why are you laughing?

406
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,720
Because...

407
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,200
Because he sounds just like you.

408
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,440
-[Tang Jiale giggles]
-You think so? Let me do another one.

409
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
[quirky music]

410
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,320
Anyone who loses

411
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,280
has to drink this.

412
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,880
[Baiyang] Does it look familiar?

413
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,440
This is you
when you force us to drink Yan-juice.

414
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,000
That's right.

415
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Hey, I got another one.

416
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
[Tang Jiale clears throat]

417
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,120
You still have a long way to go.

418
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,960
[chuckles]

419
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,640
How's that?

420
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,920
It was no good.

421
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,560
[Qiao Chen] Everyone can imitate Lu Xia.

422
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,920
Try someone who is difficult to imitate.

423
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,120
How do you know he is imitating me?

424
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,040
Tell me.

425
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,680
You can try.

426
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,960
[Qiao Chen] Fine.

427
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
You still have a long way to go.

428
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,520
[laughing]

429
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,840
-[chuckling]
-I've never said that.

430
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,440
That's Lu Xia's line.

431
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,280
What? You want to fight?

432
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,000
[Tang Jiale laughs]

433
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,680
Give me my bandana back.

-[phone buzzes]
-[Baiyang scoffs]

435
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,680
[Baiyang] I can do it, too.

436
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,480
Hello, doctor.

437
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,320
[doctor 1] It was just
an initial examination.

438
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
The result was not good.

439
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,040
Come to me again tomorrow.

440
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,680
I have to warn you.

441
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,920
There won't be another chance

442
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,920
if you don't listen to me.

443
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,480
Okay.

444
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,840
I know.

445
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,160
Thank you.

446

[somber music]

447
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
The weather's nice.

448
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,840
Oh.

449
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,120
Um, thanks for winning the match
for Yu Qing.

450
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,240
Um... No.

451
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,960
I shouldn't say thank you.

452
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,560
I should say congratulations.

453
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,200
I believe that
you will keep moving on together.

454
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,040
You will go farther and farther.

455

It's a meteor shower.

[Ying] I have a wish.

459
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,760
I wish Yu Qing can win

460
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
the national championship.

We can make a wish.

[both grunting]

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,080
This one. Turn the page.

-This.

Is everyone here?

Oh. Siyang isn't here.

Coach.

477
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,800
I have something to tell you.

478
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,200
Starting today,

479
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,920
Siyang will leave the club for a while.

480
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,440
What?

481
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
[somber music]

482
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,760
[doctor 1] You didn't need surgery before.

483
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,480
But I believe

484
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,960
you knew it well after that game.

485
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,840
[doctor 1] If you don't hurry up
and receive treatment,

486
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,160
it may cause permanent damage
to your arms.

487
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,800
A decision must be made quickly.

488
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,200
You have to take the surgerysoon.

489
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,080
Or else you may not be able
to play tennis,

490
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,600
let alone play a match.

491
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,000
If you continue like this,
the consequence will be really bad.

492
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,480
I know.

493
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,040
I will do any kind of examination
you arrange for me.

[Zhuo Zhi] Yes.

497
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,960
My good friend got sick.

498
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,080
He didn't tell me before.

499
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,600
It suddenly occurred
when he was taking the exam.

500
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,080
I would like to visit him.

501
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,560
How could that be?

502
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
Is he okay now?

503
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
I don't know.

504
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,840
The result will come out today.

505
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,400
[sighs]

506
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,600
Hurry off then.

507
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,120
Just send me a message
in these types of situations.

508
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,040
-Mm-hm.
-Okay?

509
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,560
-Take care.
-[Zhuo Zhi] Sure.

511
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,760
A good friend?

512
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,720
Don't you think the friend
he described sounds familiar?

513
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,160
Huh?

514
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,080
[Dayong] Do you know any of his friends?

515
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,120
Is that your classmate?

516
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,160
Oh.

517
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,800
I know!

518
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,080
The one he was talking about
is our captain.

519
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,480
Our captain?

520
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,560
Zhuo Zhi.

521
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,880
Zhuo Zhi.

522
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,760
Where is Zhuo Zhi?

523
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
-[Tang Jiale] I have no idea.
-Let's practice first.

524
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,960
The captain would say so if he was here.

Hmm?

529
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Little Lu Xia.

530
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,960
Take line 5 to Xiang Jiang Station,
then change to line 10,

531
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,680
go out from exit B
of the People's Hospital, then turn left.

532
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,400
You saw him?

533
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,040
Look at you.

534
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,880
Just say it if you want to visit Siyang.

535
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,760
Why do you have to secretly check the way?
You want to go alone?

536
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,240
You are far from finishing
the training volume.

537
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,200
No chatting.
Let's go together after training.

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,760
[Siyang] Wait.

[groans]

543

What did the doctor say?

00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,520
Oh. Sit down.

548
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,560
I'll ask him if you don't tell me.

549
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,480
The doctor said that my situation...

550
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,520
is not good.

551
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840

[Siyang grunts]

Have you thought about it?

557
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,360
What if you can't play tennis anymore?

558
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,040
[sighs]

559
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,320
We've already finished the game.

560
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,880
So why ask that?

561
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,800
[Siyang groaning]

562
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,680
What's next? What's your plan?

563
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,160
We got in touch
with a hospital in Germany.

564
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,120
[Siyang] I'll be going there soon.

565
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,000
[groans]

566
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,840
I thought you wouldn't go.

[scoffs]

Yes.

569
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,560
You should have gone there.

570
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,000
Now that you decided to go,

571
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,520
just get better.

572
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,000
Don't worry about us.

573
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,400
[soft chuckle]

574
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,040
Here.

575
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,520
This is for you.

576
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,760
For me?

577
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,640
Who else?

[sighs sharply]

579
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,600
From this match,

580
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,480
I saw everyone's enthusiasm
and perseverance.

581
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,760
[Siyang] Not only from this game,

582
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,280
I saw everyone was growing

583
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,800
since the beginning
of the regulation match.

584

[light music]

585
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,080
About you and Lu Xia,

586
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,520
I don't need to worry at all.

587
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,600
I really have no reason
to delay my treatment any longer.

588
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,320
What if you can't play tennis anymore?

589
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,160
Will you regret it?

590
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,600
No.

591
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
Good for you.

592
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,240
[Zhuo Zhi] I want to be like you.

593
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,040
Ignore the consequences...

594
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,840
and never regret.

595
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,760
YU QING

596
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,680
[Yan Zhiming] I have already checked.

597
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,400
The hospital Siyang stays in
doesn't accept visitors after 11:00 p.m.

598
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,760
When will Xinglong finish his training?

599
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,320
In about five minutes.

600
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,480
And me?

601
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,440
In about ten minutes.

602
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,400
How about Lu Xia?

603
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,640
Lu Xia won't have time to visit him.

604
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,840
How about tomorrow at noon?

605
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,920
That's only an hour of lunch break,
we have no time to return.

606
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,920
I mean if we can do some training
at noon tomorrow,

607
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,560
we'll have enough time at night, right?

608
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,680
We usually finish training at 8:00 p.m.

609
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,560
If we practice at noon for an hour,

610
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,120
we can finish by 7:00 p.m.

611
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,280
So we can make it
to the hospital at 7:30 p.m.

612
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,720
I think it is feasible.

613
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,880
Mm-hm. I'll make a plan

614
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,920
-and send it in the group chat.
-[Dayong] Okay.

615
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,360
Let's go back and rest.

616
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,760
Come to the tennis club office tomorrow.

617
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,840
Yan, wait a minute.

618
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,640
About the training plan...

619
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,720
[Lu Xia] Qiao Chen,
I want to ask you something.

What? Who is it about?

621
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,080
You also know this person.

622
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,360
Someone I know?

623
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,040
Is it a love problem?

624
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,040
I wonder if this person will study abroad.

625
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,560
You are good.

626
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,200
You've found someone who's going aboard.

627
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,560
Will you accept it...

628
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,120

If the girl I like is leaving,

00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,480
I'll tell her...

632
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,720
that I like her.

633
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,320
I can't let her leave
without knowing this.

634

The girl you like?

635

Aren't we going to eat together
at lunch break?

It's all your fault.

Why did you visit your friend alone?

We have to finish the training
before visiting hours in the hospital.
