00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,160
Get ready.

Hey!

171
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
[Baiyang] What's the rush?
We haven't even started yet.

[breathes heavily]

173
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,600
It's not raining. Why is there thunder?

174
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,920
[Coach Qi] All right.

175
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,920
On your marks.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,840
Ready.

177
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,440
Set.

No, I can't.

186
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,640
I'm too tired. I have no energy.

187
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,400
Do you want a break?
We've been doing extra practices lately.

188
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,480
No, I'm done.

189
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,840
Just kidding!

190
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
He faked it again?

191
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,560
People fall for it every time.

192
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
We have 25 minutes and 32 seconds left.

193
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,160
I will not be the last one.

194
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,120
That was fast.

195
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,520
You really are a hiker.

196
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,920
You're not bad either.

197
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,840
I've got some hidden skills.

All right. Good job, everyone.

200
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,920
Now let's start the three assessments
on serving, attacking, and defense.

201
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,080
Huh?

202
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,000
But I thought you said

203
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,760
that was our last training program
just now?

204
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,440
Training and assessments are not the same.

[groans]

206

[Coach Qi] You've been training
for this long now.

00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,560
Are you not curious to see
what the results would be?

208
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,400
I'll do it.

You haven't been feeling well these days.

222
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,640
How about you go see the doctor
in advance?

223
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,280
No, it's okay.

224
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,640
I'll take some medicines.

It's raining outside.

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,680
-I'll take some umbrellas for them.
-Ahh!

230
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,960
They'll be back in a bit.

231
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,640
What if they catch a cold from the rain?
They have matches tomorrow.

232
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,160
It's raining heavily,
and you don't feel well...

233
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,800
Did you not see Qi Ying?

234
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,840
Isn't she here?

235
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,880
She went out to give you umbrellas.
She just left.

236

It's raining so much!

We have to take her to the hospital now.

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,040
[Xingzi]
It must be because she fell before,

241
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,440
and then she was in the rain for too long.
She has a fever.

[Coach Qi] Siyang.

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,680
Coach, how's Ying?

[Siyang] She's been a great help
these past two days.

Everyone is worried about her.

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,480
She has a high fever.
She needs to go to the hospital now.

247
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,480
Is it that bad?

248
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,480
By the way, get Huang Jing.

249
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,520
He's also sick.

250
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Let's do this.

251
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,960
I'll have Mu and Xiuwen go together.

252
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,400
That way, they can take care of everyone
at the hospital.

253
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
What about here?

Don't worry.
I'll take care of things here.

In that case, I'll go too.

My brother is here.

They'll behave themselves.

258
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,080
Okay. Don't make any trouble.
I'll be back early tomorrow morning.

Her fever is gone too.

Are you're still worried about Ying?
I didn't know you are the caring type.

Good to know she's fine.

But did you wash this?

Those who know how to cook are gone.

Stop being picky.

A blackout?

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,560
Why isn't power back yet?

282
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,800
It's not going to last all night, is it?

283
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,440
It must be because of the thunderstorm.

284
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,360
Just use the flashlight for now.

285

not even 9 p.m. yet.

I can't fall asleep even if I want to.
And we've run out of entertainments.

Go! This is entertaining.

Will the rain stop tomorrow?

Of course.

-We still need to get our uniforms back.
-Mm.

I can't wait to have a good match
against them tomorrow.

How about this?

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,680
The rain will stop.

336
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,920
Once it clears up,

337
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,120
let's go see the sunrise together.

338
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,080
-Yes!
-I'm in!

339
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,240
Me too.

340
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,400
Stop it.

341
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
[quirky music]

342
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Huh?

343
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,320
The rain has stopped.

344
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,240

[gasps]

346
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,360
For real!

-[yawns]
-Lu Xia!

348
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,520
[Qiao Chen] Get up! Time for sunrise!

349
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
[breathes sharply]

350
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,920
Why isn't the sun up yet?

351
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,400
It's summer.

352
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,520
Why is it so cold?

353
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,440
Seriously. So cold!

354
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,720
Go and run several laps.
You won't be cold then.

355
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,080
Or you can do towel whips.
Whip for a hundred times.

356
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,640
You'll be able to raise
your body temperature

357
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
to between 37.5 and 38.

358
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,600
Zhiming, where do I find a towel
at this time of the day?

359
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,880
You can also use your bandana
if you don't have a towel.

360
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,120
Shut up.

361
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,640
Dachi, are you sure it's the right time?

362
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,160
[Yang Jiale] It was raining
so much last night.

363
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,400
Maybe we should come back some other time.

364
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Let's wait a bit longer.

365
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,360
We're here already.
It'll be a shame if we leave now.

366
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,200
All right.

367
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,160
The sun's out!

368
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
[lively music]

369
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
[Siyang] I don't know how much longer
my hand can keep working.

370
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,080
But since I am the team's captain,

371
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,160
I need to do my best

372
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,680
and lead Yu Qing to win every match.

373
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,200
That's my calling and responsibility now.

374
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,240
[Lu Xia] I will continue to play

375
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,560
in every match in the future.

376
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,240
I'm going to help Yu Qing win.

377
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,760
NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL BOYS TENNIS LEAGUE

378
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,480
[all] Be the champion.

379
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
[Qiao Chen] I had so much fun every day
since I joined Yu Qing.

380
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,880
I had burgers to eat and tennis to play.

381
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,840
I will become stronger later.

382
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
[grunts]

383
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm going to become better
and more powerful.

384
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
I will not give up any ball.

385
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,920
[shouts]

386
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,600
[Zhuo Zhi] It feels great to give our best
and I enjoy it.

387
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm going to be more serious about this.

388
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,240
[Yan Zhiming] My data need
to be updated constantly

389
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,280
to come up with the most effective
training strategies.

390
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,560
Yu Qing can be even better.

391
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,240
[soft chuckle]

392
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,800
[Gold Partners]
We are going to show everyone

393
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
we are the Golden Partners
who will never part ways.

394
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,320
[He Xinglong] Joining the team
is the best decision I've ever made.

395
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,560
I've gained courage and determination here

396
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
and the most precious friendship.

397
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,560
Burning!

398
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,800
Yu Qing will win.

399
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Yu Qing!

400
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
[all] Victory!

401
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Yu Qing!

402
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,680
[all] Victory!

403
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
While we hope that you can put on
the team uniforms,

404
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,760
we will not make it easy for you.

405
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,040
It won't be as easy as you think
to take back the team uniforms.

406
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,360
We will do our best.

407
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
[suspenseful music]

408
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
[rock music]

409
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
I'll show you today

410
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
the real power of the Golden Partners.

411
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,240
Then let us, Platinum Partners,
show you how it feels to lose.

412
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
Since when did you give us that nickname?

413
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,760
[chuckles]

414
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,480
I wouldn't have practiced that hard
for a doubles match.

415
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,080
I don't need it in the future anyway.

416
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,720
It seems like the opponents
are even rustier than us.

417
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,560
This should be my last time playing
doubles with you.

418
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,720
After this,

419
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,960
there'd be 89.37 percent chance
that you'd want to play more with me.

420
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
[scoffs]

421
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,760
That makes me...

422
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
ten percent?

423
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,920
That was only a two-digit subtraction.

424
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,520
You have to include the decimals.

425
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,880
No matter what happens today,

426
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,640
I am going to do my best.

427
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,080
[groans]

428
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,360
Still, it's not guaranteed
that you can match my speed.

429
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
[intense music]

430
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Dachi, are you all right?

431
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
You're sweating a lot.

432
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,320
I'm fine. Just not feeling so well.

433
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,760
[suspenseful music]

434

[fence clinking]

435
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,360
Bring it on.

436
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,480
I'm sorry, master.

437
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,280
I must win this game.

438
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,040
I will not lose either.

439
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
We forfeit!

440
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,960
Why?

441
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,480
-I can still play.
-No. You're obviously not feeling well.

442
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,200
The training yesterday
was exhausting enough.

443
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,920
Don't try to be a hero now.

444
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,800
It's okay if we don't get back
the uniforms.

445
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,600
We have the national leagues later.

446
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,120
But I can still play.

447
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,880
Dachi, listen to me.

448
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,600
Dachi.

449
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,680
Listen to Jiale. Take a break.

450
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,480
Not bad, Jiale.

451
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,440
You've learned to be decisive.

452
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,720
I learned it from Dachi.

453
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,600
-[Coach Qi] Very nice.
-[Tang Jiale] Coach.

454
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,760
We will not let you down.

455
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Don't worry.

456
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,720
[panting]

457
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,680
Zhiming, can't we finish
this match faster?

458
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,920
I thought we were supposed
to trust each other?

459
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,320
[grunts]

460
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,800
Baiyang and Yan are pretty close.

461
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,240
They really make a good pair.

462
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,680

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,200
[gasps]

464
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,080
Your snake-ball
is still not good enough for singles,

465
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,280
but definitely good at doubles.

466
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,640
I already knew that.

467
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,160
What's up with you?

468
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,040
I saw other pairs do high-fives like this.

469
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,440
We are not just a regular pair.

470
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,480
Our situation is different.

471
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,440
-[Baiyang] Coach.
-Mm.

472
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,520
What do you think?

473
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,720
What do you feel
about the doubles this time?

474
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,680
It wasn't as difficult to adjust
as I'd thought.

475
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,040
[breathes deeply]

476
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,080
[Siyang] Let's begin.

No wonder you're the captain of Yu Qing.

[light music]

481
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,160
Do you still think I can keep up?

482
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,960
Let's be clear about this.

483
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,320
Losing to you this time is only temporary.

484
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,240

-[squeaks]

486
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,680
[Weiming] Besides, we Yu Feng did not lose
to you Yu Qing.

487
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,160
I won't let you win the championship.

488
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,680
What makes you think you can "let" us win?

I lost.

495

You'll let down people who rely on you
if you live in the shadow of the past.

496
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,400
Leave the past in the past.
