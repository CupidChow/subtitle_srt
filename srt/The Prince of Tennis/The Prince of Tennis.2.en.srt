00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,480
that is our locker room.

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,320
[Siyang] You shouldn't be here.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,000
You can go now.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,520
[teacher] This question is
from the other day.

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
You've all seen it, right?

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,840
I will check your answers.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,600
Those who fail
will have to stay after school.

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,760
Lu Xia.

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,600
Answer this question.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,920
The answer is, "One-third times
the cube root of X. Wake up."

44
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,520
You know you should wake up?

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,720
Stay after school.

46
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,600
Lu Xia hasn't come out yet?

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,560
Hi! Can I practice here?

48
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
Okay, follow me.

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,680

[Xiuwen] Jing.
[chuckles softly]

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,080
Are you here to practice?

53
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,080
Why is he here again?

54
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,720
You have to pass the test
to practice during non-practice time.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,080
What kind of test?

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,400
[Huang Jing] The rule is simple.

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,640
-[gasps]
-If you can strike that can ten times,

58
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,280
then you can get ten drinks.

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,640
It's a good deal!

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,320
Ying, you're lucky you were not
punished for helping him.

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
-Mm-hmm.
-I was so scared.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
I didn't think that much.

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,000
I wonder if he's still in the classroom.

64
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,200
No way, he must be on the court now.

65
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,800
Come. Let's watch him play.

66
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,080
[Xiuwen] Go! Go! Go!

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,120
[Mu] Damn, I can't hit it.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,480
Just one more.

69
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
It's okay. You can have ten more attempts.

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,240
[Xiuwen] Go! Go! Go!

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Go...

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,840

[exhales sharply]
Almost there.

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,760
I've drunk some of it. Will this do?

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,800
-Okay.
-[Huang Jing] Okay what?

76
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,240
A rule is a rule.
You have to give us nine.

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,720
Isn't it one drink for ten attempts?

78
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
One drink for one attempt.

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,360
It's a scam.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
Strike the can if you can.

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,440

You again? Last time--

84
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
You lost to him twice.

85
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,440
Liar! There are stones inside the can!

86
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,680
[clangs]

87
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
You...

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,720
[Mu] What a smash.

89
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,040
If I hit it 100 times,

90
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,120
-will you give me 1,000 drinks?
-Kid.

91
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,200
How dare you strike my can?

92
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,680
I taught you how to play last time.

93
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,080
Haven't you learned?

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,200
What did you say?

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,600
Do you want to be beaten up?

96
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,480
-[Huang Jing] You...
-[Mu] What are you doing?

[clangs]

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,840
[Qiao Chen] Whoa!

99
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,360
I hit it on the first try.

100
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,640
We have such a good court.

101
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,520
You shouldn't fool around like this.

102
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,240
Qiao Chen.

103
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,880
Senior.

104
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
The freshmen are so passionate
about practicing.

105
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,160
You shouldn't bully them like this.

106
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,120
Yes.

107
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,200
I'm just joking around with them.

[Qiao Chen] Lu Xia, the freshman, right?

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
-It's Lu Xia.
-What did I say? I know he's here.

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,240
It was not fun to watch you play
with Huang Jing.

119
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,480
-Let's have a game.
-Okay.

120
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,760
Lu Xia, are you sure
you want to compete with him?

121
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,000
Qiao Chen is a main player in Grade 11.

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,520
-Which side?
-Backside.

123
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,560
Okay. Front side. You serve first.

[Ying and Peng panting]

Lu Xia can't beat Qiao Chen, can he?

126
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,280
Why did you give up the serve?

127
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,920
He can do the Twist Serve.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
Don't you want to see it?

129

-Oh.
-What is the Twist Serve?

Why so stingy?

I can only hit the ball...

Yes!

Qiao Chen managed to return it
with brute force.

[Qiao Chen] I can grasp the timing.

Now I have to control my strength.

Did he manage to counter
Lu Xia's serve so soon?

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,560
You fooled me with a drop shot.

170
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,880
[Qiao Chen] Again.

171
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,520
He's not worried at all.

172
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,920
[chuckles softly]

173
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,440
Even when playing against a main player,
he still performs well.

174
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Lu Xia is awesome.

175
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,120
-[chuckles]
-Mm-hmm.

176
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
[tense music]

177
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,120
[Qiao Chen] He changed to his left hand.

178
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,160
[scoffs]
Fine. I give up.

179
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,760
Why do you give up, senior?

180
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,200
He didn't even use his dominant hand.

181
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,120
[Mu] A left-hander?

182
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,960
[Qiao Chen] Luckily, we won't play
against him in the qualifying.

183
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,960
[Mu breathing heavily]

184
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,720
Lu Xia, Huang Jing admitted his defeat
and gave us these.

185
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,840
Kid, Yu Qing shouldn't be underestimated.

186
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,480
[Lu Xia] Fine.

187
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,200
Senior,

188
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,680
you still have the bandage on your foot.

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,760
The doctor said that it is almost healed.

190
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,720
I just need a while to recover.

191
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,680
But...

192
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,360
It's okay. He's pretty good.

193
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,320
He already knew my injury.

194
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,080
Did he know?

195
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,640
[snickers]

196
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,600
[sighs]

197
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
[playful music]

198
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,120
[grumbling]

199
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,200
[panting]

200
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,360
[exhales sharply]

201
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,400
What a bad day!

202
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,160
Shut up and do your work.

203
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,080
[Huang Jing] We have three floors to go.
The dean is going to check on us.

204
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,120
How can I make up
a 2,000-word self-criticism?

205
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,920
We wrote one before. We have a template.

206
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,360
But you paid your debt.

207
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
What debt?

208
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,920
One hit for ten drinks, right?

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,040
That kid hit the can ten times.

210
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,800
That's...

211
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,440
one hundred bottles of drinks.

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,080
How many?

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,440
One hundred bottles.

214
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,240
But I begged them for you...

215
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,560
with a bargain of 90 bottles.

216
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
-[Xiuwen chuckles softly]
-You...

217
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,680
I used your card. Here you go.

218
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
[comical music]

219
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Huh?

220
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,160
[Dayong] One, two.

221
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,480
One, two.

222
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,880
One, two.

223
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,800
-One two.
-Xiuwen.

224
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Xiuwen.

225
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,600
Huh?

226
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Get that ball for me.

227
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,800
[Xiuwen] Fine.

228
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,320
[grunts]

229
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
[thwacks]

230
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,240
[Xiuwen] A middle-aged woman?

231
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,880
[Dayong] One, two.

232
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,560
One, two.

233
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,880
[Siyang] Everyone, gather round.

234
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,480
Huh? Coach, you are back.

235
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Coach?

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,360
[Siyang] Let me introduce her.
This is our coach, Qi Na.

237
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,040
To prepare for the National
Junior Tennis selection,

238
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,120
she has returned
to coach us this semester.

239
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,680
[Coach Qi] After being away for a year,
I'm happy to see

240
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
so many familiar faces in our club.

241
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,280
And we also have some newcomers.

242
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,200
Anyway, our goal never changes.

243
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,600
We aim to win the national championship.

244
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,040
[Coach Qi] For you, studying comes first.

245
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,760
Only the hardworking students
can enter the qualifying.

246
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,800
You have to be good at schoolwork
and school tennis competitions.

247
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,960
Then you may have a chance
to compete for honors

248
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,440
for our school.

249
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,200
-Do you have confidence?
-[all] Yes!

250
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,040
The grouping details will be posted later.

251
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,880
You can have a look then.

252
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,880
Be prepared.

253
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,000
[Siyang] Keep practicing.

254
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,240
Huang Jing, come here.

255
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
[comical music]

256
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,040
You may not have been taught...

257
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,080
what to do and what not to do.

258
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll take responsibility for that.

259
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,200
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right.

260
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,400
Sorry, ma'am.

261
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
[Huang Jing sighs]

262
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,400
[Huang Jing] This coach is so tough.

263
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,520
How can I lead the team?

264
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,120
[Xiuwen] The coach talked to you alone,

265
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,560
which means she values you.

266
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,600
Many heroes in movies
have such experiences, right?

267
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
LU XIA
YAN ZHIMING

268
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,960
-[indistinct chatter]
-Hey. Look, they posted the list.

269
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,720
What's good about seeing
the same names as before?

270
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,280
It's Lu Xia.

271
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,440
[Mu] Lu Xia is in the qualifying.
[chuckles softly]

272
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,000
Lu Xia.

273
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
Is he a freshman?

274
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,680
LU XIA
YAN ZHIMING

275
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,920
Are you kidding me?

276
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,280
I can't lose it.

277
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,720
Bend your knees, straighten your elbow,
your shoulders are too open.

278
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,760
And your hair is too long.

279
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,920
What kind of advice is that?

280
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,880
[chuckles softly]

281
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,800
-Knees...
-[student 1] The list is posted. Come.

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,040
-[student 2] Siyang is in.
-[student 3] Really? Quick.

283
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Knees.

284
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,000
Ying.

285
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,440
Did you hear about it?

286
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,920
Lu Xia is in the qualifying.

287
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,400
He's going to play?

288
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
Yes. He's great.

289
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
Let's get ready, cheerleaders.

290
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,920
Why did she lie to me?

291
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
-[Peng] Quick, Ying!
-Okay.

292
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,160
Lu Xia promised to teach me how to play.

293
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,800
I may beat you someday.

294
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,040
When did I promise?

295
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,119
[gasps]

296
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,680
You are the freshmen's hope.

297
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,800
-You can be a main player.
-I've been practicing since summer.

298
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,000
You just lost to Lu Xia.

299
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,960
I...

300
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,319
[panting]

301
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,040
I have to wipe the floor. Bye.

302
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,960
I'm going to cram school. Bye.

303
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,440
I have homework to do. Bye.

304
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,480
[snickers]

305
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,760
[groaning]

306
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,840
[panting]

307
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,520
[Dayong] The school qualifying
is coming soon.

308
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,280
It's our monthly routine activity.

309
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,920
Players in Grade 11 and Grade 12
are divided into four groups.

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,480
The top two in each group,
with eight players in total,

311
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,480
will become the main players next month.

312
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,600
Only the main players
can play against other schools.

313
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,080
You just wait and see.

314
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,400
You can't seem to beat Lu Xia.

315
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,560
[students] Mm-hmm.

316
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,600
Lu Xia is our freshmen's hope.

317
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,320
Don't celebrate too soon.

318
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,640
Though Lu Xia can participate,

319
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,600
the sophomores are really good.

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,880
[Peng] Coach.

321
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,040
[Coach Qi] What are you doing here?

322
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,360
I want to show you something.
[chuckles]

323
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,040
-I'll leave them to you.
-Okay.

324
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,200
[Coach Qi] Come.

325
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,240
[Peng] Our slogan is,

326
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,240
"Striving forever, full of vigor."

327
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,560
-This dinosaur is our mascot.
-Mm-hmm.

328
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,680
What do you think?

329
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,400
Oh.

330
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,440
-Not bad.
-So, can we have a cheering squad?

331
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Uh, sure.

332
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,160
[Coach Qi] Tennis is quite popular
these days.

333
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,800
[chuckles]
You can count on us.

334
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,560
We will cheer for Yu Qing.

335
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,000
You mean cheer for Lu Xia.

336
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,800
[gasps]
For Yu Qing Tennis Club.

337
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,560
[inhales sharply]
How many members are there in your squad?

338
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,840
-Just the two of us.
-Mm-hmm.

339
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,840
Just the two of you?

340
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,800
You can join us.

341
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,800
Game over, 6-0. Lu Xia wins.

342
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,200
[student 4] This little freshman is great.

343
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,160
[student 5] Yes, he plays well.

344
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,960
See? He didn't sweat at all.

345
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,840
[Mu] Lu Xia, well done.

346
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,400
You'll play against
a main player, Baiyang.

347
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,160
The seniors may be hard to deal with,
but the sophomores might be easy for you.

348
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
Lu Xia, I'm talking to you.

349
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,160
Lu Xia, Group D, wins by 6-0.

INTEGRAL TABLE

352
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Lu Xia,

353
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,600
I was shocked when I heard
that you were playing in the qualifying.

354
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,800
But I was more shocked
when I saw you win two games in a row.

355
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,120
You can talk after eating.

356
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,440
Lu Xia, if you become a main player,

357
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
it means that I also have a chance, right?

358
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,680
[groaning]

359
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,120
Look, this is what we sophomores
really are.

360
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,720
You...

361
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,400
What happened to your eyes?

362
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,520
I got hit by Baiyang's ball.

363
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,240
Look at this.

364
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Even Huang Jing can't do it.

365
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
-[Mu] Never mind him.
-[Xiuwen gasps]

366
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,160
I'm going to the bathroom.

367
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,720
[Sha] Chief, I would like to cover
professional leagues.

368
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,520
How could it be school leagues?

369
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,920
[Sha's boss] Junior tennis is the future
of national tennis.

370
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Young reporters must participate more.

371
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,720
Okay.

372
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
Uh, kid.

373
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
-Do you play tennis?
-Mm-hmm.

374
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,080
Where's your team office?

375
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,280
There were two girls
who told me it's this way.

376
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
-That way?
-Mm-hmm.

377
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,760
-I just came from over there.
-Mm-hmm.

378
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,400
Fine.

379
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,040
Hand it to me.
You should get something to eat.

380
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,120
How is it going?

381
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,080
YAN ZHIMING VS YOU LIXIN, 6-0

382
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,520
[Yan Zhiming] As expected,

383
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,480
45 percent of players are able
to end games within 30 minutes.

384
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,800
Twelve percent of them
did not lose any game.

385
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,160
But...

386
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,160
LU XIA

387
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,960
...the freshman is stronger
than we thought.

388
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,920
He has won all games so far.

389
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Are you in the same group?

390
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Mm-hmm.

391
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,400
That kid is going to suffer.

392
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
Not many people know data-tennis.

393
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,560
[scoffs]
All right. Don't show this notebook.

394
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,040
I am still having nightmares.

395
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,440
[sighs]
However, before playing against me,

396
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,080
the freshman still has serious trouble
to deal with.

397
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,680
[Yan Zhiming] Baiyang.

398
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,200
[Zhang Baiyang scoffs]

399
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,000
Don't talk about me all the time.

What is that?

402
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,920
I have never seen such a return.

403
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,960
That same ball hit my eye. Snake-ball.

404
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,600
[Mu] This will be a tough game for Lu Xia.

405
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,480
It seems that freshmen still don't have
a chance to be the main players.

406
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,280
Don't look down on us.

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,840
The ball hits the same place every time.

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,840
What are you doing here?

416
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,960
Am I bothering you?

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,160
What's up?

418
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,400
The game is starting. Go for it.

Will you play against Baiyang later?

430
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,360
You must be careful.

This is the first game
between a freshman and a main player.

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,400
It will be an exciting game.

How long can Lu Xia last?

Lu Xia is much shorter than him.

Besides,

453
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120

After losing a lob shot,

he gave Baiyang a lob shot in return.

00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,840

[umpire] It's 40-30.

509
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,640
It's a very tricky angled shot,
but he can still return it.

510
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
But he fell into Baiyang's trap.

511
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,920
What trap?

512
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
[Qiao Chen] The Snake-ball
is just a cover-up.

513
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,400
It made Lu Xia run back and forth

514
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,560
and consume his energy.

515
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,080
He's being coiled by a "snake."

516
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,680
Struggle harder, suffer more.

517
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,920
It's like torture.

518
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,200
That's Baiyang's tactics.

519
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,520
The more he wants the ball,
the more energy he loses.

the hot weather gives him an advantage.

LU XIA VS ZHANG BAIYANG, 40-30

535
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,640
Senior,

536
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,480
you sweat a lot.

537
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
How about taking off your jacket?

538
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,200
[Baiyang] His shots aren't speeding up.

539
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,400
Am I slowing down?

540
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,320
To deal with deep baseline shots
like these,

541
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,000
he has to run to the baseline every time.

542
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,680
-[grunting]
-[Yan Zhiming] Bend his knees.

Prepare to hit.

544
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,080
So his physical exhaustion
is three times more than usual.

545
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,520
So, it's a trial of physical strength?

546
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
[Baiyang] Am I the one who's worn out?

547
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,840
I am coiled by a "snake."

548
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,040
[umpire] Lu Xia wins, 6-5.

549
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,240

Damn.

557
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,520
They are both exhausted.
But here's the difference.

558
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,920
One already saw through his opponent,

559
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
the other is worried
since his strategy didn't pay off.

560
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,840
[Siyang] So their mental states
are totally different.

561
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
I blew it.

562

But you are, too.

570
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,440
No one...

571
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,120
can beat me with willpower.

-This...
-A buggy whip shot.

574
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,320
A large range of motion from the bottom
makes the ball spin fast.

575
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,760
The centrifugal force
makes the ball spin back.

576
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,240
Many players around the world
take this as a weapon.

577

Are you Miss Qi?

You can call me Sha.

Oh. Okay, Coach.

00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,800
I will report on the National High School
Tennis Competition.

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,480
Uh, could you prepare
some materials for me?

585
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,600
What materials?

586
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,120
Some information on your main players.

587
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,720
Such as height, blood type,
family background,

588
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,200
and how they grew up.

589

Why don't you report
on the development of junior tennis?

What is this?

This one is neck and neck with Baiyang's.

But I can't remember.

[Lu Xia] After seeing you do it,
I had to try it.

It's really tough...

I'll never give up playing

Never.
