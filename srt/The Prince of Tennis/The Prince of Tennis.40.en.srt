Siyang, your expectations

You'll have to wait a few more years.

The Wind Stance alone
is enough of a headache,

his Fire Stance for a sudden attack.

Zilong must have never thought
he could be beaten using his own moves.

Now,

he will be afraid to reveal
his other two stances.

[umpire 1] Hai Guang won a point.
The score is 15-0.

349
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,680
Tian Zilong has been through
a lot of battles,

350
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,400
and he uses lob shots
to control the tempo.

351
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,520
It is an extremely precise lob
that only Zilong can make.

352
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,880
It is rarely seen in an actual game.

353
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,440
Because the success rate is extremely low.

354
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,480
Indeed, good ball control is required
to perform such a precise lob.

It's beyond what the data can describe.
