00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
[exhales sharply]

169
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
[grunts]

170
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,960
Don't mind him.

171
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,680
You can count on me in the next game.

172
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,400
Qiao Chen is going to play Qianshi.

173
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,960
Lu Xia, just wait for my victory.

174
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
We'll see.

175
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,160
[clicks tongue]
You don't even cheer for me.

176
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,800
You're bound to win,

177
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,280
so why should I cheer for you?

178
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,320
Right?

179
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,720
[soft chuckle]

180
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,440
Come on, Qiao Chen.

181
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
Come on!

182
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,120
[cheering]

183
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,200
I finally got to play
in the third singles,

184
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,920
but my opponent isn't Lu Xia.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,960
I'm sorry to let you down.

186
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,960
Oh. I didn't mean that.

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,960
-You are Qiao Chen, right?
-[sighs]

188
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,320
I know you are also great.

189
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,720
You can do the Vertical Smash.

190
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,240
Whatever you say, it's too late.

191
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,200
You nearly entered
the National Youth Team.

192
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,240
Let me see your skills.

193
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,200
[soft chuckle]

194
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
[umpire 2] Players, decide on the service.

195
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,680
Which side?

196
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
I'll serve first.

197
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,760
You have to choose the side.

198
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,280
Believe me. It's the north side.

199
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,720
[scoffs]
You are pretty confident.

200
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,920
Qianshi's intuition is never wrong.

201
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,760
I'll have the right to serve.

202
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,880
Eh?

203
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
[exhales sharply]

204
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,520
How lame.

205
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,520
I told you so.

206
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,800
But I'll let you serve first.

207
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,040
Today,

208
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,520
my luck is in the north.

209
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,440
I'll play on this side.

210
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Come.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,040
You even calculated this?

212
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,240
It's just a feeling.
[chuckles]

213
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,120
[sighs deeply]

214
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,640
Whoa! No wonder he's called Lucky Qianshi.

215
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,680
He really is lucky.

216
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,840
"Lucky Qianshi"?

217
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,400
There are so many people here.

218
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's see how Qiao Chen plays.

219
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
[thwacks]

220
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
He's doing my Bullet-serve?

221
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
[grunts]

222
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,920
That's powerful.

223
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,880
[thwacks]

224
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,680
[Qianshi] He moves forward.
Let me give him the right ball.

225
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,760
[grunts]

226
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
[Qiao Chen] It's so close.

227
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,680
This guy is almost as good as Qianshi.

228
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
[gasps]

229
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,640
Vertical Smash!

230
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,280
-[cheering]
-[camera shutter clicks]

231
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,840
[Qianshi] His instant explosiveness
is outstanding.

232
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,840
[thwacks]

233
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
[grunts]

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
[thwacks, whooshes]

235
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
[Qiao Chen] What?

236
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,680
[soft chuckle]

237
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,480
The same Vertical Smash as Qiao Chen's.

238
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,400
[Qiao Chen] He can do
a Vertical Smash, too.

239
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,360
He did all that for this moment.

240
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
[snickers]
That's right.

241
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,400
An eye for an eye.

242
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
This is a practice racket.

243
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,520
The strings are loose.

244
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,120
I can't speed up.

245
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,760
I'll change my racket.

246
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,000
Qiao Chen.

247
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,280
Hey!

248
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,920
Why are you making excuses?

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,840
Change your racket?
Are you imitating Zhuo Zhi?

250
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,040
What?

251
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Let me tell you.

252
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,280
You can only imitate the method,

253
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,320
but you can't imitate his skills.

254
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,880
One's mental state is important
in playing tennis.

255
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
Qiao Chen was attacked
by his adept Vertical Smash.

256
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,960
-Qianshi is a hidden genius.
-[sighs]

257
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,440
[thwacking]

258
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,320
[umpire 2] The score is 1-0.
Shen Qianshi leads.

259
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,840
I never thought such a strong player
like Qiao Chen

260
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,520
would be at a disadvantage.

261
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,760
He even lost the service.

262
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
Qianshi's attack was truly amazing.

263
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,240
Qiao Chen.

264
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,320
It's my turn to have some fun.

265
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,440
Okay.

266
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,680
Let's see who gets the last laugh.

267
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,000
[chuckles]

268
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,840
Here he goes.

269
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,120
He tossed it so high.

270
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,160
TIGER-ROAR SERVE

271
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,800
[grunts]

272
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,040
[Qiao Chen] What's going on?

273
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,040
[Yan Zhiming] What an astonishing leap.

274
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,000
He...

275
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,240
How can he jump so high?

276
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,720
[thwacks, whooshes]

277
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,160
So fast.

278
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm on fire.

279
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,400
What kind of service is that?

280
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,920
It's Qianshi's weapon.

281
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,000
The Tiger-roar.

282
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,480
-What?
-What?

283
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
-Tiger-roar?
-Tiger-roar?

284
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,360
It makes use of his small stature.

285
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,240
[Yan Zhiming] He pushed down
from a high hitting point

286
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,080
and broke Qiao Chen's midcourt
in the shortest distance.

287
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
I can't even see the ball's flight path.

288
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,760
[Zhuo Zhi] He really is something.

289
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,120
Just an insignificant skill.
[chuckling]

290
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
He is so crafty.

291
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,240
He intentionally let Qiao Chen taste
the sweetness first

292
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,800
before crushing his self-confidence.

293
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,440
He wants to destroy Qiao Chen
in one stroke.

294
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,000
Qianshi can subtly control the game.

295
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,080
[sighs]
Qiao Chen is in trouble.

296
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,280
Qiao Chen, you should be glad
that you made Qianshi do a Tiger-roar.

297
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,000
[grunts]

[snickers]

299
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,560
[Qiao Chen] Child's play.

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,680
-Yes!
-Yes! We scored!

301
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,400
It can't be. How did he receive it?

302
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
[action music]

303
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,760
There are so many undiscovered talents
in our club.

[Coach Tian] Qiao Chen
really is something.

[panting]

310
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,440
Qiao Chen totally saw through
Qianshi's Tiger-roar.

311
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
His efforts are worth it.

312
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
Hey, Lu Xia.

313
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
Bring me my lucky racket.

314
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,240
Fine.

315
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,600
[Qiao Chen] I have more luck than you.

316
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,720
I never lose when it comes to luck.

317
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,520
But is there such a thing?

He did it on purpose.

SHEN QIANSHI VERSUS QIAO CHEN

[Qiao Chen] I do have luck, right?

327
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,079
[umpire 2] That's 3-3.

328
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,920
[Qianshi] He has such strong willpower.

329
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,079
I thought I could make him panic
with my smash.

330

[groaning]

331
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,800
[Qiao Chen] It hurts.

[Coach Qi] This is bad.

333
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,440
He has cramps in his left foot.

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,120
He can't play like this.

335
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,120
[Qiao Chen] This is a really bad time.

336
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
[Dayong] He bore more load
than ever before

337
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,600
to return Qianshi's Tiger-roar service.

338
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,240
[shushes]

339
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,880
[Coach Qi] Maybe the exhaustion
caused temporary cramps.

340
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,520
It's not very severe.

341
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,040
But he will be at a disadvantage.

342
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,800
This game is really hard for Qiao Chen.

343
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,400
Qianshi has good luck.

344
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,160
It's not a game of luck.

345
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,760
Qianshi can play on this court

346
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,440
only because he is skillful enough.

347
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,920
[Coach Qi] He has the kinetic vision
that Qiao Chen doesn't.

348
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
"Kinetic vision"?

349
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,640
Is that what Lu Xia and I are good at?

350
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,880
They are different.

351
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,240
In Qianshi's eyes,

352
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,920
Qiao Chen's high-speed ball
was almost in slow motion.

353
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,360
Is it that amazing?

354
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,000
[grunts]

355

[groans]

356
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,480
[umpire 2] Game over, 5-4.

357
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,200
No. 3 High School leads.

[chuckles]

361
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Qianshi can see through
even the fastest ball.

362
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,760
[Coach Tian] Sorry for Qiao Chen,
he's got bad luck.

363
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
[groans]

364
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,040
[Qiao Chen] It hurts.

365
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
Qianshi's attacks are fierce.

366
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,160
I'm becoming more passive.

367
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,320
Qianshi can see through me.

368
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,560
I attacked so recklessly
and embarrassed myself.

369
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,240
Seems like he got cramps in his left foot.

370
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
We may lose.

371
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,080
Hang in there, Qiao Chen.

372
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,320
Please change courts.

373
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
You got cramps?

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
Lucky for me.

375
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,440
[Qiao Chen] Is it luck

376
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,360
or strength?

377
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,800
No.

378
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,600
It's so lame of me to think so.

379
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
[tense music]

380
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,440
[Qianshi] He endures the pain until now.

381
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,400
What unbelievable endurance.

382
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
[Lu Xia] The game is not over.

383
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
[thwacks, whooshes]

384
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,240
Qianshi is really relentless.

385
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,760
I can't lose.

386
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,840
[groans]
It hurts.

387
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,400
[Siyang] Qiao Chen.

388
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,560
[breathing heavily]

389
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,720
Your foot injury seems to have recovered.

390
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,080
But if you can't leave behind
the memory of being hurt,

391
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,240
you won't be able to exercise
your real power.

392
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,960
[gasps]

393
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Is Qiao Chen going to receive this one?

394
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,000
He can't. He has cramps in his left foot.
He even struggles to stand.

395
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,720
I am strong.

396
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,800
Look! He jumped with only his right foot!

397
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,160
[Qianshi] How can he jump?

398
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,840
CORE VERTICAL JUMP

399
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,800
[cheering]

400
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,360
Is that the Core Vertical Jump?

401
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,360
[Yan Zhiming] The predicament
makes Qiao Chen progress.

402
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,280
What is a Core Vertical Jump?

403
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,560
It's a very difficult backhand trick.

404
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,160
It pivots on your body's center.

405
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,080
[Yan Zhiming] Put your weight
on the front foot,

406
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,840
applying the pendulum principle,

407
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
and then jump to hit the ball in the air.

408
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,640
It's a trick

409
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,720
that's often used by professional players
who practice on muddy courts.

410
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,960
[exhales sharply]

411
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,840
A high school student can't manage it.

412
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,280
[grunts]

413
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,480
[Qianshi] I won't give up. I can do it.

414
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,280
[groans]

415
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,400
It's fast.

416
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,600
Shen Qianshi won't see through this ball
even with his kinetic vision.

417
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,040
I saw it.

418
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
[gasps]

419
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,600
Wonderful.

420
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,080
Qiao Chen's physical power
is unbelievable.

421
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,920
He finally made it.

422
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,000
Awesome.

423
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,000
How formidable.

424
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,560
He can make such a powerful hit
while his foot has cramps?

425
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,640
[sighs]

426
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,840
I have to beat him in this round.

427
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,880
Or else he'll be a big problem.

[exhales sharply]

429
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,360
Here he goes.

Huh? Where is she?

[Tang Jiale] Is this a promotion
for the supermarket?

510
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
I'll take one.

511

It's you?

512
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,880
I thought you were some salesgirl.

I'm sorry.

-Eh!

What are you doing here?

Hey.

518
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,400
You did a great job.

519
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,840
But it took so long. I was sleepy.

520
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,480
You didn't come for me.

521
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,800
You came here for Lu Xia, right?

522
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,200
[sighs]

523
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,040
I have nothing to do after the meal,
so I took a walk here.

524
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,800
It's a long way.

525
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,000
It's almost eight kilometers.

[chuckles]

527
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,840
Peng Xiang, are these masks for me?

528
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,440
These are for the cheerleaders.

529
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,480
We'll have one before the match.

530
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,600
We must be
the most graceful and beautiful.

531
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,600
Don't hinder me.

532
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,960
Okay.

533
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,200
I will be the most handsome cheerleader.

534
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,120
Mm-hmm!

535
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,080
You will be in charge of the recruitment
for the male members.

536
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,480
Everybody is responsible
for Yu Qing's victory.

537
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Good.

538
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,440
Peng Xiang, why are you here? I...

-This again?
-It looks just like you.

Little nitwit.

Not at all.

It looks like him.

I only have to win this game, right?

Yes.

555

It's over.

We had better give up.

560
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,880
Lu Xia will have a bad time.

561
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,520
I'm frightened
just by looking at his face.

562
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,960
Why aren't you frightened?

Don't cry if you get hurt.

He's not friendly at all.

Lu Xia.

570
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
If only we had more cheerleaders,

571
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,680
then we could have crushed
that prematurely gray-haired guy.

What is that aggressive guy doing?

00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,280
He's not willing to let go.

576
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,480
Are you worried about Lu Xia?

577

I believe in Lu Xia.

He will win if he wants.

It's just...

[He Xinglong] He had a gift in sports
ever since he was a child.

585

But he loves the pleasure of destroying
others more than the competition.

586
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,920
His family couldn't afford
the karate class when he was little.

587
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,920
He didn't want to be looked down upon.

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,600
He wanted to prove he's the strongest.

One day, Ya Jiuxin broke in
and beat all the seniors.

Now I understand.

Someone who doesn't want
to admit their weakness

is not in Ya Jiuxin's book.

He can fight back anytime.

That's the best thing about him.

he can even change the target base
