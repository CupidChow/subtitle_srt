00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,520
such a precious thing.

Ah.

170
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,680
Captain, can we drink it now?

[comical music]

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,760
I will drink it first.

173
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,160
Leave some for us.

174
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,280
[Dahai] That's enough.

please pay attention to food safety.

[Lu Xia] I am back.

188
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,520
[Xiangqian] Why did you stop practicing?

189
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,600
Is it because of the noise here?
Did I bother you?

190
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,560
No.

191
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,600
Are you hungry?
I ordered your favorite pizza.

192

There's no need.

and you will get to taste

You don't have to stick
with the old or the new,

Why hasn't Lu Xia come?

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
What's taking him so long?

[grunts]

213
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,040
After the match, we were all told to be
here at this time. Why are you late again?

214
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,880
That's right, and you are so late.

215
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,720
We were almost about to leave without you.

216
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
I'm only a few minutes late.

217
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,360
Actually, you're
31 minutes 36 seconds late.

218
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
[Yan Zhiming] It's still too early

219
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
to make a prediction
of the match result now.

220
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,840
But we already missed opportunities
to gather information about the opponents.

221
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,960
Okay. Let's go right now.

222
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,160
Xing Yao and Yu Cen
have begun their match.

223
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,640
If our next opponent is Xing Yao,

224
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
this match is a good chance to get
to know our opponent.

225
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,520
Ying, I heard that the cheering squad
of Xing Yao is wonderful.

226
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,640
Today, we can take a look for ourselves.

227
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,440
It seems we will have a strong
opponent soon.

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
Hmm.

229
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,400
Wonderful. We can finally compete
with Xing Yao.

230
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,320
Mmm.

231
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,600
This day has come at last.

232
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,560
After we defeat Xing Yao,

233
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,000
we can enter the national final.

Isn't it just the beginning of the match?

But Xing Yao has already overwhelmed
the opponents. They are really strong.

It is like a music concert.

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,440
We must be well prepared.

-We can't lose the momentum.
-Mmm.

Does he consider himself as a star?

261
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,320
In this match,

262
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,920
he is the star.

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,520
He really looks forward to
competing with our Captain.

264

in the future matches anyway.

Although Xing Yao has
made much progress this year,

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,520
Ji Jingwu is still not mature.

272
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,040

with them in the national league.

Yu Qing?

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,920
They are Xing Yao's opponent
in the next match.

278
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,200
Even they are here.

279
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,400
It seems they have treated Xing Yao
as their last opponent.

280
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,120
We will compete with Xing Yao first.

281

It is not sure who will be the winner.

These guys seem to

283
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,440
look down on everyone else.

289
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
Yu Qing, do your best in the next match.

290
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,560
Because it may be

291
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,960
your last match this year.

292
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,680
[Peng] These guys are so annoying.

293
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,600
But why do they all know about Lu Xia?

294
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
That is because Lu Xia is excellent.

295
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,040
As long as I am here,

296
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,960
you cannot win your third championship.

They are already gone.

[indistinct chatter]

302
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,040
Although Xing Yao

303
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
is a strong team,

304
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,720
we still need to believe in our
own strength.

305
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,160
Don't worry, Captain.

306
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,080
As well as entering the national league,
we also want to defeat Xing Yao

307
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,839
and get our revenge
for losing to them last year.

308
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,040
So we must win

309
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,480
the next match.

310
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,520
That's right.

311
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,200
I have an opportunity to play this year.

312
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,480
I will try my best.

313
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,240
The ranking competition has not begun.
We can't be sure you'll get in.

314
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,200
Baiyang, why do you have
to be so annoying?

315
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,160
Relax.

316
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,400
[Dayong] But there are 20 days before

317
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,440
our match with Xing Yao.

318
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
We must continue to work hard.

319
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,280
I hope we will not

320
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,800
have any regrets this year.

321
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,040
[all] Okay.

322
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,680
[Siyang] All right. Let's call it a day.

323
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,040
Have a good rest.

324
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,960
You're dismissed.

325
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,400
I'll go to the after-school class.

326

-Huh? Oh.
-Be careful on the way home.

-Bye.
-Bye.

328
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,200
Lu Xia, I will take my bike later.
Let's have dinner tonight.

329
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,560
I want to practice tennis first.

330
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,360
Okay, I will play with you
until you finish. We'll have dinner later.

331
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280

NATIONAL SENIOR HIGH TENNIS LEAGUE
PROVINCIAL PROMOTION COMPETITION

339
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,800
It has been a while since you joined
Yu Qing Tennis Team.

340
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,160
Then you should know

341
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,880
what Xing Yao means

342
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,120
to us.

343
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,000
I know.

344
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,040
Xing Yao is different from all
the other opponents we've played before.

345
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,960
Every one of them

346
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,440
is a very strong opponent.

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
And after Xing Yao,

348
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,800
we will be confronted
with Hai Guang High School,

in the past.

[Siyang] So now,

351

Yu Qing is going to face much
more serious challenges.

352

I hope you can become
the driving force for Yu Qing.

353

[Siyang] I hope...

you can shoulder more
important responsibilities.

When you truly know
the reason why you play tennis,

to overcome the obstacles.

When I am not in the team,

363
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,320
they need someone

to lead them.

what difficulties he is confronted with.

Your left arm is still in danger

because you didn't have
enough time to rest.

is not ideal either.

Do you still train hard every day?

when I am training.

403
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,360
The strain of muscles and joints
will accumulate.

404

So it is usually late

when you can feel the problem yourself.

The relapse of your left arm last year

[Coach Qi] I want to

talk to you.

525
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,200
[Coach Qi] I think

526
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
you should stop training for now

527
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,960

I must find my own way of playing tennis.

530
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
I can't stop training.

531
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,400
That's exactly why

532
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,280
I suggest you stop training for now.

533
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,520
I think you understand

534
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,480
how strong Xing Yao is.

535
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
Winning against them will be a tough task.

536
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,360
And if we defeat them,

537
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,600
we will be confronted
with an even stronger team afterward.

538
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
I believe

539
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
everyone can fight till the end
with our strength.

540
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,560

including you

542
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,520
can't demonstrate their full power
in the match,

543
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,720
it will be very bad

545
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,280

We have our training plan for the team.

is the time for yourself.

I am not saying

you should stop training and rest at home.

it is better
