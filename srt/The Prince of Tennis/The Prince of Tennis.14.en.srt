00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,120
Are you Lu Xia?

167
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,160
Do you want to talk to me?
I don't know you.

168
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,640
Do you play such a boring game every day?

169
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,040
What do you want?

170
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,560
[Ying panting]

171
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,480
Lu Xia, I have informed the security.

172
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,360
I hope you can get to the next round.

173
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,080
[Jiuxin]
So we can meet in the competition.

174
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,520
I will teach you a lesson there.

175
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
[tense music]

176
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,080
[thwacks]

177
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,320
[Xiuwen whimpering]

178
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,600
[Ying gasps]

179
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
[calm music]

180
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,200
[gasps]

181
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,880
-[breathing heavily]
-Don't worry, I am okay.

182
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,960
Lu Xia.

183
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Go and tell He Xinglong
to mind his own business.

184
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
[calm music]

185
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,280
Lu Xia,

186
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,600
bear with it for a moment.

187
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,560
-It will be quick.
-Mm-hm.

188
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,520
[sucks teeth]

189
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,200
Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

190
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,440
[sighs]

191
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,040
[sucks teeth]

192
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,880
[blows air]

193
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,480
Don't tell them.

194
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,600
Huh?

195
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,720
Tell them what?

196
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,760
[inhales sharply]

197
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,760
Ah!

198
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,800
Why can't I tell them?

199
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,440
It's just...

200
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,040
I don't want to tell them.

201
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,960
[laughs]

202
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,880
I know.

203
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,320
-Keep it a secret.
-Don't laugh.

204
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,920
[Ying laughs]

205
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,720
You saved me just now.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,320
I think, next time,
you should deal with it another way.

207
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,360
You don't have to be in conflict
with such people.

208
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,240
[Lu Xia sighs deeply]

209
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,120
Okay.

210
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,880
It is just a scratch.

211
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,320
[Qiao Chen] Senior,

212
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,080
Huang Jing told me Lu Xia was hurt
by someone.

213
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
[all] Huh?

214
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,000
No way.

215
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,440
Where did he get hurt?

216
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,120
Luckily, it's just a scratch.

217
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,280
But I heard it was a person
from No. 3 High School.

218
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
[ominous music]

219
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,280
If we defeat Ying Cai,

220
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,240
then we may compete against
No. 3 High School in the municipal final.

221
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,160
Mm-hm.

222
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,440
It is Shen Qianshi's high school.

223
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,560
I think we should tell the coach.

224
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,920
Uh...

225
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,240
Lu Xia, what happened to your face?

226
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,800
I slipped.

227
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,800
How can you be hurt like this
if you just slipped?

228
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,280
[Dayong] Shall we complain to the
National League Organizing Committee?

229
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,480
I just slipped and fell.

230
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,280
Xiuwen has told me the whole thing.
Don't pretend anymore.

231
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,160
[Dayong sighs]
Lu Xia, who was it?

232
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
[Dayong] Does the coach know?

233
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,480
Ah. See, this boy seems determined
to solve the matter himself.

234
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,800
Uh, how about this? I will pay.

235
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,680
[Tang Jiale]
Let's treat Lu Xia to a good meal.

236
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,720
What do you think?
Chi, Xinglong, will you join us?

237
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,040
I'm the first to agree.

238
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
Next time. I have homework to do.

239
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,760
Xinglong, you can go with them.

240
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,360
Thank you, but I already have
an arrangement tonight.

241
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
Uh, never mind, we can go together.

242
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,960
Let's go.

243
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
[ominous music]

244
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,520
Lu Xia, how about it? Are you happy now?

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,480
Yes.

246
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
[sighs]

247
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,600
Senior, don't mind the cost.

248
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,440
Lu Xia has been bullied,
just think of this as comforting him.

249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,520
[Lu Xia]
I said it was just because I slipped.

250
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,840
[gasps]
Wait a minute.

251
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,040
[Qiao Chen] Is that Xinglong?

252
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,000
It seems that the information
I have on Xinglong can be revised.

253
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,160
[Tang Jiale gasps]

254
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
[comical music]

255
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,640
[Qiao Chen sighs]

256
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,800
Xinglong looks different.

257
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,160
Mm-hm.

258
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
[foreboding music]

259
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
[Tang Jiale] Huh?

260
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,520
Who is that?

261
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,360
What are they doing here?

262
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,160
What's their relationship?

263
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,080
Yan, what are you writing?

264
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,360
The tiny things in life can also influence
the results of a tennis match.

265
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,000
[Tang Jiale sighs]

266
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,440
Ya Jiuxin, why do you want to quit school?

267
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,200
[MIn sighs]

268
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,960
Hey.

269
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,960
Xinglong seems to be familiar
with the guy who just arrived.

270
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,600
Shall we change seats? I can't hear them.

271
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
[Qiao Chen] Lu Xia.

272
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,640
-Lu Xia. Lu Xia.
-[sighs]

273
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,080
[He Xinglong] Your mother went through
a lot to raise you.

274
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,400
Don't you have a conscience?

275
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,080
When will you stop
sitting around like this?

276
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
-[Min gasps]
-[groans]

277

[gasps]

278
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
-He pushed it too far.
-[Tang Jiale grunts]

279
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,079
Don't you dare bully Xinglong!

280
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,079
Qiao Chen! Stop it!

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,880
Why are you here?

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,920
[clears throat]

283
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,440
[sighs]

284
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,200
He is a player from
the No. 3 High School Tennis Team.

285
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,000
If you hit him,
you will have to quit the game.

286
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,480
Are you the one who came to our school
and tried to start a fight?

287
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,599
You really think we are easy
to bully, right?

288
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
A bunch of idiots.

289
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,400
[inhales sharply]

290
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,720
I haven't introduced myself. I am Lu Xia.

291
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,640
If No. 3 High School can survive,
then you will be facing us.

292
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,440
I hope we can learn from each other
at that time.

293
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
[scoffs]

294
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,480
Okay.

295
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,200
Then I'll see you on the court.

296
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,960
I hope you won't get hurt anymore.

297
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
[tense music]

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
[Min] Sorry, everyone.

299
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,120
I didn't educate my son well.

300
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,120
-"Son"?
-"Son"?

301
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,560
So, Ms. Chen is really
the mother of Ya Jiuxin.

302
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,480
You can call me Min.

303
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,560
[clears throat]
Okay, Ms. Min.

304
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,720
Lu Xia,

305
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,760
about Ya Jiuxin, I apologize.

306
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,520
[sighs]
Xinglong, why are you apologizing for him?

307
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,320
Plus, he poured a drink on you.

308
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,560
Maybe he was annoyed by my words.

309
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,360
Because he has disliked being judged
since he was a child.

310
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,360
[clicks tongue, sighs]

311
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,720
Xinglong, how did you get to know
this kind of...

312
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
[Tang Jiale] This...

313
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,720
[inhales sharply]

314
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,200
[clears throat]

315
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,240
I mean, you care too much
about others' business.

316
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,600
Don't you think you are busy enough
with your own business?

317
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,040
[sighs]
It's my bad.

318
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,360
Xin suddenly said
he wanted to quit school.

319
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,440
I have no other choice
but to ask Xinglong for help.

320
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,960
I had him at a young age.

321
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
I don't know how to be a good mom.

322
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,280
It is my bad. I didn't educate him well.

323
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,720
-[sighs]
-I will definitely help you with this.

324
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,960
Ya Jiuxin and I have been good neighbors
since we were kids.

325
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,040
[He Xinglong]
Ms. Min has always been a single mom.

326
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,960
She has a lot of part-time jobs
and doesn't have time to look after him.

327
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,840
I used to be friends with him
when we were kids.

328
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,480
But eventually,
he didn't get in touch with me anymore.

329
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,520
[sighs]

330
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,240
[He Xinglong] I will convince him
not to quit school,

331
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,040
whether he listens to me or not.

332
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,760
[gasps]
No, Xinglong.

333
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,240
Xin has always treated you
like his friend.

334
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,720
He just has a bad temper

335
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,680
and he doesn't know
how to express himself.

336
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,360
If he can have friends like you,

337
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,560
maybe he will be as sensible as Xinglong.

338
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,920
Uh, ma'am, you praise us too much.

339
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,960
I don't need friends like him.

340
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,480
It is getting late, I must go now.

341
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,840
I will see you off.

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
No matter what, I am really sorry.

343
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,680
Goodbye.

344
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,920
[sighs]

345
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
Just see how I'll torture
No. 3 High School

346
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,200
when we compete with them.

347
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,600
[gasps]
That's right,

348
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,240
we must take revenge
for Lu Xia, Xinglong, and me.

349
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,880
Why do you want to take revenge?
[clicks tongue]

350
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,600
I was expecting some shocking love affair.

351
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,040
But it turned out like this.
Do you know how disappointed I am?

352
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,280
[sighs]
I must compete with that guy.

353
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,240
Anyway, we must win.

354
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,560
Why does that sound bad?

355
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,560
[Tang Jiale sighs]

356
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,640
YU QING

357
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,920
[student 1] Is Yan out of his mind?

358
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,960
Why should we run around the court
100 times?

359
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,320
[all panting]

360
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,240
Everyone must follow Yan's plan.

361
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
[Coach Qi] After running,
you will compete in pairs.

362
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,400
What?

363
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,040
[Siyang] Zhuo Zhi, Lu Xia, Tang Jiale.

364
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,800
We will carry out Yan's plan.

365
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,960
-Jiale, you have poor physical strength.
-Huh?

366
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,280
You need to prepare yourself.

367
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Oh.
[chuckles]

368
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,440
Captain, I know that. I will work hard.

369
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,080
Mm-hm.

370
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,480
Zhuo Zhi, Lu Xia.

371
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,400
Prepare yourselves for the competition.

372
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,320
Now?

373
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,760
Now.

374
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,880
Zhuo Zhi versus Lu Xia.

375
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,360
It would be a remarkable match.
I should tell everyone to watch.

376
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,680
Wait a moment.

377
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,080
Okay, get ready.

378
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,760
Lu Xia, take it easy.

379
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,000
I am competing with Zhuo Yu's
elder brother this time.

380
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,160
[pants]

381
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,840
It's surprising to watch
such a remarkable match.

382
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,560
Finally, we can watch such a great show
and see who is better.

383
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,520
I bet on Zhuo Zhi.
The one who loses should buy drinks.

384
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,440
I support Lu Xia completely.
He saved my life.

385
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
Who do you bet on?

386
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,480
Zhuo Zhi.

387
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
[playful music]

388
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,160
I bet on Zhuo Zhi.

389
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,920
Zhuo Zhi.

390
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,560
I prefer Lu Xia.

391
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,080
[scoffs]

392
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,720
[Qiao Chen] How long can you play
with Zhuo Zhi?

393
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,960
I really look forward to it.

394
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,240
Zhuo Zhi, don't be mad if I win.

395
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
[tense music]

396
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,600
He started with split steps.

397
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,880
He did that
when he played with Yan last time.

398
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,400
[thwacks]

399
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
[Zhuo Zhi] If you want to use
an attacking return,

400
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,280
then I will go left and right
to limit you around the baseline.

401

-[thwacking]
-[both grunting]

402
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,280
[Zhuo Zhi] It is funny.

403
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,080
Eh? You are here on time.

404
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,440
How is the match going?

405
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,600
He has a good start.
He is playing actively today.

406
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,320
But basically,
Zhuo Zhi takes advantage of it.

407
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,280
[thwacks]

408

[sighs]

410
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,440
Do you think you can
receive my three returns?

411
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,440
[both chuckle]

412
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,520
Maybe both sides are observing each other.

413
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,480
That's right. It just depends
on who attacks first.

414
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,240
[tense music]

[grunts]

417
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,800
[Zhuo Zhi] It is the B Drive.

418
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,480
Right now, the target is my left foot.

419
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,080
It is a volley aimed at the foot.

420
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,280
[Zhuo Zhi] I will make you
retreat to the baseline.

[Qiao Chen] Bear-growl.

430
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,840
It will totally eliminate the power
of an overhand smash.

431
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,800
[Siyang] You even used this technique.

432
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,400
Are you being serious now, Zhuo Zhi?

433
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
It is not something
an ordinary player can do.

434
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,200
That's why Zhuo Zhi
can be called a prodigy.

435
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,360
He made use of centrifugal force
to control the power.

436
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,080
[Yan Zhiming] He will absorb the power
of an overhand smash ball

437
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,000
and eliminate it.

438
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,880
Then he'll hit the ball to the backcourt,
which the opponent can't reach,

439
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,520
because the opponent approached the net.

440
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,160
[Yan Zhiming] This is one of Zhuo Zhi's
three returning techniques.

[gasps]

446
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,960
[Zhuo Zhi] It seems he...

447
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,600
really wants to counter my technique.

448
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,080
[thwacks]

449
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,240
Zhuo Zhi and Lu Xia seem to be happy
playing tennis together.

450
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,200
Yes, a strong player encounters
another strong one.

451
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,760
[Zhuo Zhi] Counter my technique
if you can.

452
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,880
Did Zhuo Zhi mean to do so?

453
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,080
[Siyang] You are declaring war, right?

454

[Ying] As long as Zhuo Zhi
uses his technique,

458
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
an overhand smash wouldn't work.

459
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,240
[Lu Xia] I must stop you from using that.

460
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,840
[Zhuo Zhi] Don't expect to defeat me.

He is as stubborn as a mule.

[Yan Zhiming] No matter
how he hits overhand smash balls,

465
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,400
the results are the same.
If Lu Xia doesn't change his strategy...

466
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,080
[Zhuo Zhi] He is indeed
a terrifying opponent...

Did he fail to return the ball?

It is kind of interesting.

476
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,760
Lu Xia can cause Zhuo Zhi
to make mistakes.

477

just by luck.

[SIyang] It seems that Zhuo Zhi's
technique has been countered.

490
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,120
Lu Xia can aim the ball at the net
and then smash it.

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,600
[He Xinglong] The ball will just go past
the net's upper edge.

Come back immediately.

I was about to win.

522

Things like this shouldn't happen again.

523
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,560
It is just training, not a competition.

524
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,000
[Coach Qi] Why did you continue to play
when it was raining hard?

525
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,600
If you get hurt, who will be the one
to take responsibility?

526
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,720
Coach, please take it easy.

I agree.

529
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,760
This was my plan.

530
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,320
I will let you have competitions
with one another after training

531
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,960
because Ying Cai trains a lot more
than we do.

532
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,240
We can't ignore them.

533
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,640
But there shouldn't be accidents
even if we add on the amount of training.

Huh? Speaking of which,

537
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,320
how much more is the amount
of training in Ying Cai?

538

It is much more than you can imagine.

defeating Ying Cai
will be a piece of cake.

542
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,200
Anyway, Zhuo Zhi and Lu Xia,
you have finished your training.

You had a chance to defeat me.

seems to have fully recovered.

of being hurt behind,

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,120
How do you know that?

651
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,560
No matter how long or short,
C is the best.

652
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,640
Oh!

653
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,760
Brilliant.

654
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
C.

655
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,880
Frankly speaking,
the library is comfortable,

656
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
quiet, and has an air-conditioner.

657
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,560
As long as Yan is not here,
I can stay here for a whole day.

658
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,160
Qiao Chen, Baiyang.

659
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,360
According to your grades,
the number of exercises you should do...

660
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,680
needs to double.

661
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,960
[Qiao Chen] I am finished.

662
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,080
I probably won't be able to play
in the competition.

663
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,880
[Tang Jiale sighs]
What can I do? I am so stressed.

664
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,400
Should we start to study now?

665
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,800
I think I tried hard
in the last monthly test.

666
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,320
I only failed two exams.

667
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,640
[scoffs]

668
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,280
We will win even if you are not playing.

669
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,080
-Then we can compete to see.
-All right, let's have a match.

670
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,080
Forget it. Don't do that.

671
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,680
If we fail the exam again,
no one can play in the competition.

672
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,480
[Tang Jiale] We have to review and study
instead of talking needlessly.

673
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,400
That is a good idea.

674
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,080
We can supervise each other.

675
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,680
-Anyway, it is the weekend tomorrow.
-Mm-hm.

676
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,800
I am going. Bye.

677
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,080
[Qiao Chen sighs]

678
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,120
Lu Xia, don't you have to study?

679
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,320
Why does there seem to be something wrong?

680
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,280
AN ALL-ROUND EXPLANATION ON LESSONS

EXERCISES FOR INDEPENDENT
SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAM

682

THE KNOWLEDGE POINTS
AND EXERCISE FOR SENIOR HIGH

683
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,520
[Yan Zhiming] I suggest that you take out
the five books in your basket.

684
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,560
Just this one will do.

685
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
You are all here

686
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,640
We need to review for the monthly test.

687
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,560
Why are you here, Lu Xia?

688
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,880
I am just wandering around.

689
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Oh.

690
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,200
Lu Xia, what did you get
in the last English exam?

691
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,760
I got 145. Why?

692
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,640
Yes! That's great! Come on.

693
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,880
Be quick. We had a deal.

694
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,720
-[yells]
-I know Lu Xia best. I won't lose.

695
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,600
[sighs]

696
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,960
Lu Xia, you got pretty low grades.

697
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,800
You had a total of 210 points.

698
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,160
[Tang Jiale] If English is 145,

699
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,080
then how much did you get
when you added the other subjects?

700
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,800
That's 65 points.
So, did he pass the exam?

701
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,320
No, Lu Xia is only in Grade 10.
He still has to learn all the subjects.

702
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,400
That means, apart from English,
he has eight subjects.

703
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,640
No way! He has broken Baiyang's record.

704
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,200
-[Qiao Chen] He's worse than Baiyang.
-Who are you talking about?

705
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,320
-[Baiyang] You are no better than me.
-I want to deal with the problem myself.

706
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,920
No, if you could deal with it,
why did you fail the exams?

707
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,160
It doesn't matter.
It is okay if you fail the exams.

708
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,040
-We can all help you.
-Mm-hm.

709
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,360
The problem isn't
whether you passed or not.

710
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,760
You didn't understand
what you learned at all.

711
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,800
You need to have a specific plan
for learning.

712
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,640
Start with basic knowledge.

713
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,680
Search for your deficiencies
and make up for it.
