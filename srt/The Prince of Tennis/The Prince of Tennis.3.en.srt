00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
and he uses that
like a game simulation in the match.

[grunts]

171
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,040
[Zhuo Zhi] His strength and technique
are not the best,

172
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,040
but he can corner his opponent.

173
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,360
Like playing chess.

174
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,320
He seems much stronger than Baiyang.

175

How did you know that?

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,640
Lu Xia can't be in the first team
if he loses, right?

180
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,360
Yes, he is bound to lose.

181
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,840
And you still enjoy watching it?

Yan is really tall.

185
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,520
He is like a wall to Lu Xia.

186
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,760
Lu Xia will find a way.

Mmm-hm.

197
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,200
That one was good.

198
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,000
Estimating my height and stretch,

199
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,120
you can always hit the ball
to an unexpected position.

200

Your skill is better than mine.

201

But...

no matter how many good shots you make,

203
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,320
I can always hit the ball back

204
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,160
when I can estimate the drop points.

205

I have to admit,

206
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
you will be a main player someday.

207
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,760
But this time...

208
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,320
[scoffs]
I will win.

209
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,400
It's good to be here.

210
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
I can beat so many master players.

212
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,160
You're pretty confident.

Who are you?

216
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
I'm a reporter.

Then left.

230
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Why is he shouting out the orientation?

231
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,480
You think Yan won't know
if Lu Xia doesn't?

232
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,080
Then right.

233
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,000

reacting faster.

[umpire 2] Out.

What a pity. I was impatient.

248
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,960
Senior, you knew this one
would be outside, right?

249

[Yan Zhiming] I have to update my data.

250
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,800
Lu Xia is using a split step.

251
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,600
When the opponent is returning the ball,

252
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,080
lift the heels a bit

253
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,120
and land on your toes.

254
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,400
So that you can react

255
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,960
and go on to the next step soon.

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,640
[Dayong] The bounce
from muscle contraction will help you run.

257
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,000
Your stretch can extend one more meter
if you are half-step faster.

258
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,200
A freshman can do a split step?

259
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,120
[Peng] Hm?

260
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,920
Of course.
This is Lu Xia we are talking about.

261
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,680

I must end the game

265
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,000
The split step is a basic skill.

266
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,880
But Lu Xia is doing...

267
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
He is...

268
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
landing on one foot.

269
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,280
[Sha] How can a freshman

270
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,280
master the skill so well?

It's 95% from the right.

275

[Yan Zhiming] Why did it go to the left?

279
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,160
Lu Xia is getting faster.

280
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,480
Can Lu Xia also anticipate
the drop points?

281
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
No, only Yan can do that.

282
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,680
I think Lu Xia makes a judgment

283
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,320
before he jumps.

284
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,120
He can't do this

285
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,880
without a good grasp of tennis.

286
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,640

he's playing with someone else now.

[tense music]

288
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,320
I may not be able to hit the ball

289
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
even when I can estimate the drop points.

290
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,840
But...

[exhales sharply]

293
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
There are cases where

294
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,280
you can't hit it back
by just estimating the drop points.

One is the legendary Cool Drive.

The other is what I'm going to do now.

297

[Yan Zhiming] Why is he changing hands?

298
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,240

[Yan Zhiming] Twist Serve.

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,200
He is left-handed.

311
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,600
How can he have

312
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,920
such a powerful right-hand serve?

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,720
[Yan Zhiming] Dealing
with a right-hand Twist Serve,

335
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
the success rate

336
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,040
will increase by 8.35%
with a lifting foot.

337
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,040
I will never play with you again.

338
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,320
[Coach Qi] Everyone showed great effort

339
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,840
in this qualifying.

340
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Now let me announce

341
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,080
the list for the first team.

342
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,920

Lu Xia.

350
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,800
[applause]

351
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,040
Here.

352
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,520
Lu Xia is amazing.

353
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,600
When can I be a main player?

354
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,200
Forget about it.

355
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,200
Just continue picking up balls.

356
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,640
[Coach Qi] All right.

357
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,320
The group match of the municipal contest
is about to start.

358
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,040
Everyone, do your best.

359
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,840
Don't make yourselves regret anything.

360
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
[all] Yes.

361
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,280
Dismissed.

362
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,720
[Mu] Hey, Lu Xia.

363
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,880
Could you teach me
how to play tennis next week?

364
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,000
NO. 199, ZHI CHUN ROAD

365
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
[light music]

366
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,040
[Siyang] Yan.

367
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,760
You still have a lot of opportunities.

368
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,240
Captain.

369
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,800
Are you comforting me?

370
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,600
[sighs deeply]

371
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,160
We have a different team this year.

372
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,480
You lost to Lu Xia and Baiyang,

373
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,680
but that doesn't mean you're incompetent.

374
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,760
Captain, I don't need
your comforting words.

375
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,320
I've calculated it.

376
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,560
If Lu Xia and Baiyang enter
the first team,

377
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,720
our odds in the regionals
will increase by 3.51%.

378
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,120
As long as our team wins,

379
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,800
I will do whatever it takes.

380
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,000
Yan, I hope you can help us
achieve a systematic training

381
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,120
with your data analysis.

382
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Please.

383
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,680
Mmm.

384
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,680
[Yan Zhiming] But...

385
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,320
I will never give up.

386
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,680
[school bell chimes]

387
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,200
[teacher] The class is over.

388
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,560
[student 2] I'm the only one
who can work out

389
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
that mathematical problem.

390
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,520
[Ying] That snail that you drew
is so cute.

391
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,480
GO!

392
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,200
[Peng] This is a dragon.

393
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,360
Our slogan is full of vigor,
just like a dragon.

394
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,040
-[Ying] How about this color?
-[Peng] Let's see.

395
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,680
[both laugh]

396
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,640
[presenter on TV] The Jiang Nan chefs
were racking their brains for it.

397
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,320
The best achievement is to take oil

398
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,920
-from crab paste and crab roe.
-[telephone ringing]

399
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,440
-Hello?
-[Coach Qi] It's me.

400
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,120
Hi, Coach Qi. What's up?

401
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,400
I may not have the time to accept
your dinner invitation.

402
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,360
[laughs]

403
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
[Coach Qi] He entered the first team
as a freshman.

404
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,320
Just like you did back then.

405
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,280
Oh.

406
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,480
-Really?
-[Coach Qi chuckles]

407
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,920
[Coach Qi] Why would I lie to you?

408
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
[laughs]

409
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,600
He is my son.

410
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,880
Like father, like son.

411
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,320
[laughs]

412
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,520
I...

413
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,840
[dial tone beeps]

414
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,160
He made it.

415
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,680
We should celebrate it

416
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,400
with my elaborately creative
Chinese cuisine.

417
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,480
[gasps]
What are you doing here?

418
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,120
[Peng] Look at what we made.
Not bad, right?

419
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,240
Mm. It's good. Thanks for your hard work.

420
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,840
Mm-hm.

421
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,240
How can we help you?

422
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,080
I am looking for Lu Xia.

423
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,960
He had already left.

424
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,600
-He left?
-Yes.

425
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,480
Please give him this.

426
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,360
[gasps]
It's the main players' uniform.

427
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,920
[giggles]

428
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,760
Okay. But it's Saturday tomorrow.

429
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,400
I might not see him either.

430
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,840
[Peng] It's okay.

431
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,280
You can count on us.

432
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,400
Mu asked Lu Xia to play tennis tomorrow.
We can give him then.

433
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,240
Thank you.

434
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,760
-Mm.
-Mm.

435
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,560
Bye.

436
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,480
He seems to be in a hurry.

437
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,720
Maybe we should give it back to Siyang.

438
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,600
No.

439
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,520
Don't you want to see
Lu Xia putting it on?

440
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,760
[soft chuckle]

441
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,880
[Peng] Just listen to me.

442
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,200
[Lu Xia] Dad, where are the chairs?

443
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,920
[Xiangqian] It's a hot day.
It's cool to sit on the ground.

444
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,000
How's your training?

445
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,000
I have a long way to go.

446
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,960
I know you weren't able

447
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,840
to become a main player.

448
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,240
But don't be disappointed.

449
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,040
I know you want to enter
the first team soon.

450
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,520
So I made creative Chinese cuisine
especially for you.

451
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,120
It's an Italian Harvest.

452
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,760
[sighs]
This again?

453
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,640
[Lu Xia] You put crayfish on pizza.

454
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
You ruined both of them.

455
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,120
It's your daddy's love for you.

456
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
[light music]

457
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,880
I got into the first team today.

458
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,520
That's great. Let's celebrate.

459
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
-Eat.
-I'm not hungry.

460
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,040
[sighs]

461
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,520
You don't even know

462
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,800
what your grandfather prepared for me
when I became a main player.

463
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm not interested.

464
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Okay, let me tell you.

465
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,760
Your grandfather
didn't like me to play tennis.

466
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,560
[Xiangqian]He unplugged the valve
of my bike,

467
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
so I had to run eight kilometers
to school every day.

468
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,120
[both laughing]

469
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,920
[grunts]

470
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,560
[Xiangqian] Everybody laughed at me.

471
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,520
-At last, he found such a big...
-Fine. I'll eat.

472
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,240
Dad, let's eat together.

473
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,160
You're a growing boy.

474
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,680
You should eat first. There's more inside.

475
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
[comical music]

476
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,040
[Ying] Lu Xia is playing tomorrow.

477
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
I will prepare him some food.

478
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,880
Tomatoes are rich

479
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,680
in vitamin C.
[laughs]

480
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,480
Mmm.

481
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,280
A carrot is good

482
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,440
for his vision.

483
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,640
[chuckles]

484
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,680
Finally, I should add some corns

485
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,800
and mushrooms.

486
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,560
Lu Xia is practicing every day.

487
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
He needs a lot of energy.

488
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,880
[chuckles]

489
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
[light music]

490
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,560
[Mu] Not bad, right?

491
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,320
[sighs]

492
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,080
Qi Ying and Peng Xiang
nagged me to bring them here.

493
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,800
And they're the ones who's late.

494
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's go first.

495
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,920
Where is Qiao Chen?

496
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,840
I don't know. They're not punctual.

497
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,040
[Mu's father] Hey, come here.

498
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,160
Dad.

-Mm.

-Just do not bother the others, okay?
-Okay.

[Mr. Huang] Coach.

I've been looking for you.

Fine. Uh...

You can go to section three.

508
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,440
Section three?
This section is good. Let's practice here.

509
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,960
[Mr. Huang] Take my bag.

510
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,480
Put it in the cabinet.

511
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,400
Be careful. It's new and expensive.

512
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,960
Who is he?

513
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,720
He is Mr. Huang, our regular customer.

514
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,280
He is always like this.

515
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,920
We are used to it.

516
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,040
We see people like that everywhere.

517
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,320
Dad, we can go to section three.

518
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,560
No, let me talk to him.

519
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
Mr. Huang.

520
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,040
What's taking you so long?
Put my bag away.

521
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,760
You're wasting my time. I paid for this.

522
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Be quick.

523
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,160
Let's go to section three.
We have to wait for Qiao Chen.

524
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
[Qiao Chen] Damn. Damn. Damn.

Hello, my dear fans.

the inside of my hostel.

528
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,360
It's in the new Chinese style.
Simple and comfortable.

529
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,360
And it's also quiet outside.

530
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,840
It's a wonderful to live here.

531
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,080
And there are almost no cars
on this street.

532
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,680
-Don't worry about...
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

Let me get some rest. I'm exhausted.

537
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,360
What? You can talk for half a day
but only play for a short while.

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,720
[panting]
Lu Xia.

539
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,200
There is a pitching machine.

540
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,880
Just play by yourself.

541
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,640
[Mr. Huang] Do you even know
how to play? Do you?

542
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,800
Hey. I won't pay you for this.

543
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,760
You're warming up for 15 minutes?

-Is this all you can do?
-[woman 1] What happened?

You will strain your muscles

Look at me.

547
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,240
I was a semi-professional player.

548
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,120
You have to meet my level. Understand?

549
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,160
But you will strain your muscles
if you don't warm up.

550
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Does your son only warm up in Yu Qing?

551
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,000
-You...
-[Mr. Huang] What?

552
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,280
-What kind of coach are you?
-[Mu] He's so bossy.

553
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,400
[Mr. Huang] You're wasting my 15 minutes.
You have to teach according to the level.

554
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,040
You're too slow.

555
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,320
I think you should teach an old man.

556
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,040
Why don't you teach Tai Ji?

557

-I'm telling you...
-Sir.

558
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,840
Could you teach me how to play tennis?

559
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,520
You see?

560
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,840
You're finished. Let me be the coach.

561
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,560
You want me to teach you how to play?

562
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,400
Okay.

Please show mercy.

Don't move.

00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,120
You're trying to frame me.

Shut up and pay for it.

You should pay me for my bicycle.

Is your bicycle that important, huh?
