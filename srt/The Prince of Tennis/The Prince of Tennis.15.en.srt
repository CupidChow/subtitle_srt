00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,880
CAN'T CONCENTRATE

167
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,560
You always get distracted
whenever you take an exam.

168
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,640
[Yan Zhiming] The time is all wasted.

169
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,560
[sighs]

170
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,240
Baiyang, you like working
on one problem forever.

171
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,560
If you get stuck on one question,
you will spend 20 minutes on it.

172
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,720
You can skip that question first
and answer the ones you can.

173
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,840
Qiao Chen, you are the opposite.

174
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,840
You haven't finished one question at all.

175
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,800
SCRATCH ON THE SURFACE

176
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,720
You have to try your best
to finish one question

177
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
before you do another one.

178
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,320
Don't just scratch the surface.

179
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,400
Zhuo Zhi, by the way,

181
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,760
you can answer many difficult questions,

182
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,160
FOCUS ON ONE AND IGNORE THE OTHER

183
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
but you will lose points
on some very simple questions.

184
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,960
The questions are all the same.

185
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,920
Do not focus on one and ignore the other.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,040
Mm-hmm.

187
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,080
[chuckling]

188
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,800
But I passed everything
in the monthly exams.

189
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
Hmm.

190
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,840
Ahh!

191
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,560
I've thought of a perfect solution.

192
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,000
It will definitely help us pass
the monthly tests.

193
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,200
Be quick. Tell us what it is.

194
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,240
We will first let the handsome Zhuo Zhi,

195
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,120
who can hand in the paper ahead of time,

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
attract the attention of the supervisor.

197
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,320
Yan will then send
the prepared cheat sheet

198
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,920
to the window using drones.

199
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,240
Hmm? What do you think?

200
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,800
I think it is okay.

201
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Uh-huh.

202
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,680
No, we can't cheat on the exam.

203
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,200
Have you ever thought of the consequences
if our captain knew about it?

204
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
[sighs]

205
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
It seems we have to depend on ourselves.

206
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,600
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

207
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,280
Huh. I tell you what,

208
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,840
good ideas will usually be ruined
by guys like you. Humph!

209
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,360
Carry on with the exercises.

210
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,520
[Tang Jiale sighs]

211
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,720
Am I right?

212
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Uh, almost.

213
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,200
What does "almost" mean?

214
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,160
[spits]

215
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,200
[groans]

216
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,440
How about we switch our textbooks?

217
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,640
I got the pages wet.

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I can remember better
when the pages are wet.

219
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,720
It is important to find a way
of improving how you study.

220
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,600
Eh? It is surprising that Lu Xia
is good at communicating with girls.

221
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Maybe he will be popular because of this.

222
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,480
[Qiao Chen] I don't know about Lu Xia,

223
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,280
but Yan is sure to be single forever.

224
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,360
-Hmm?
-[soft chuckle]

[scoffs]

226
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,240
If the question is very long,
divide it into small parts

227
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,640
and answer them one by one.

228
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,000
[sniffs]

229
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,720
Start from the easy ones
then answer the complicated ones.

230
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,560
[meows]

231
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,520
Pick the keyword.
Find out the key problem in the question.

232
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,000
Hmm?

233
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,200
Play for 15 minutes
after finishing each exercise.

234
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,760
WISH YOU GOOD LUCK ON THE EXAM.
COME ON!

Lu Xia.

241

[Siyang] This pen is unbreakable. Take it.

242
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,120
Answer the exam carefully.

243

[Huang Jing breathing heavily]

247
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
Why are you so energetic today?

248
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,800
[grunts]
I think it is about time.

249
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,200
What time?

250
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,480
The time I can show everyone my talent.

251
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,840
Are you thinking that,
if the top players fail the exam,

252
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
you will take their place?

253
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,880
[panting, grunting]

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,040
-Zhiming.
-Coach.

255
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,000
[Coach Qi] Everyone has been
studying hard these days.

256
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,360
And they all got good grades in the test.

257
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,400
They can prepare for the next competition.

258
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
[Yan Zhiming] Okay, Coach.

259
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,840
This is the competing order
between us and Ying Cai.

260
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,240
You can hand it out to everyone.

261
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,880
-Okay.
-Mm.

262
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,960
Xiuwen.

263
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,480
Come here.

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,320
It's okay.

You still have a chance. It's okay.

[player 1] Hurry up! We will be late!

270
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,160
Why haven't they come?

271
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
They said they are on the way.

272
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,960
If they are late, they'll lose by default.

-Why are we grouped with them again?
-That's right.

-We can't win.
-How is it? Who is grouped with us?

-Why are you so late?
-It is them again.

276
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,400
[player 2] That's right.

[inhales sharply]

278
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,360
If people from Yu Feng
don't come here by the set time,

279
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,720
they will lose by default.

280
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,360
That means...

281
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,240
we will qualify into the next round.

282
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,960

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,120

Why is that always the case
when you are here with us?

286
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,800
I want to play occasionally.

287
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm so bored.

288
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,839
Your luck makes the match so boring.

-That's right.
-I am lucky.

There is so much trash.

Jiuxin, where have you been?

299
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,800
Something serious has happened.

300
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,320
Yu Feng has only three players.

301
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,360
But the assembly time is almost up.

302
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,920
If they can't make it on time,
they will lose by default.

303
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,280
You should go to the match quickly
or you'll lose by default as well.

304
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,800
I hate it when someone orders me.

Jiuxin, where are you going?

306

Don't run away again.

This newcomer doesn't seem to be afraid
of Ya Jiuxin at all.

[sighs]

309
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,040
Since Ya Jiuxin came,
we have to sneak to practice tennis.

NAN JIANZHI
NO. 3 HIGH SCHOOL

I think it is great.
He is a brilliant player.

312
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,360
Let me check. I'll go see
if they aren't at the checkpoint yet.

313
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,520
Where have you been?
Be quick. Time is running out.

314
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,720
Eh.

315
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,080
What's wrong with your hand?

316

Nothing. Let's go to the assembly.

What happened?

We just had a traffic accident.

What? Is it serious?

320
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,280
[Ziping] Do you want to hide

321
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,120
such an important matter?

322
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,640
Do you want to play the match
with injuries?

323

[tense music]

324
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,640
Captain, I can still play.

325
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,040
Captain, don't blame them for this.

326
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,760
They don't want to let you down.

327
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,280
They are thinking about going to the match
in such terrible condition.

328
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
You are all an essential part of the team.

329
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,600
Who will take responsibility
if any of you are hurt?

330
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,600
Who will win the championship?

331
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,760
We don't take it easy during our matches,

332
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,240
we do our best instead, right?

333
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Captain.

334
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,360
-Captain.
-Captain.

335
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

336
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,480
Sorry.

337
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,560
Let's go to the hospital.

338
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,200
[Jiuxin] What a shame.

339
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
[tense music]

340
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,040
You can be so hot-blooded
when it comes to tennis.

341
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,560
[scoffs]

342
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
It is so disgusting.

343
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,960
Weiming.

344
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
What?

345
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,320
Are you afraid?

346
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,960
Don't fall for his trap.

347
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,480
If we fight here,
we will lose the right to compete.

348
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,920
[scoffs]

349
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,600
Let's go.

350
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,440
[Siyang] Captain Xu, are you okay?

351
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,080
Although we gave up the match,

352
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,000
I still remember our deal.
We will make it happen.

353
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,520
Okay, see you on the court again.

354
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,120
Mmm.

355
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,920
Yu Qing.

356
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,040
Don't you give up like them.

357
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,360
It is him again.

358
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,280
This time, we must win.

359
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
-The Yu Feng Tennis Team has given up.
-Really?

360
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,560
-Huh?
-Yes.

361
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,520
Their members came,
but they gave up the match?

362
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,760
Yes.

363
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
But all their team members gave up.

364
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,400
[scoffs]

365
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,720
I think you're terrifying.

366
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,600
-[sighs]
-Mmm.

367
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,160
[Qianshi] We should keep a low profile.

368
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
-Yes.
-Lucky!

369
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,920
We are sure to win.

370
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,600
[Jingtian] Defeat Yu Qing...

371
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,120
and have Ying Cai build a new era.

372
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,600
We were humiliated that day.

373
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,840
We are not the same as we used to be.

374
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,200
[Dahai] Thirty players were defeated
by one person.

375
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
We will never forget something like that.

376
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,240
We should thank him.

377
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,240
Hmm. Yu Qing is coming.

378
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,440
[all gasp]

379
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,400
[Jingtian] Why are you hiding here?

380
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,280
-And there--
-[Ye] Shut up!

381
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,840
That is the captain of Yu Qing, right?

382
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,040
He is Mu Siyang.

383
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,160
[Jingtian] I heard that the Chinese
tennis team is interested in him.

384
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,520
It seems we are not on the same level.

385
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,800
We should aim for someone else.

386
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,360
[Dahai] Chi Dayong and Tang Jiale,

387
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,200
the Golden Partners of Yu Qing.

388
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,880
They got good results in the National
Senior High Doubles Competition last year.

389
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,720
Is that true?

390
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,560
[Ye] That means we have to give up
on the first two matches.

391
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,560
But it doesn't matter,

392
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,120
we only have to win three matches
out of five.

393
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,240
[Jingtian] Look at these two,
one of them is Zhang Baiyang.

394
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,080
He likes to play tricks
on exhausted opponents.

395
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,680
And he is fierce.

396
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,360
The one beside him looks more gentle.

397
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,680
[Dahai] He is also from Grade 11.
He is Qiao Chen.

398
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,760
I hear that he used
his best smash technique

399
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,160
in his last competition with Guozi.

400
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,560
What?

401
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,240
[Ye gasps]

402
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,320
[Dahai] And that's He Xinglong,
he looks like someone easy to beat,

403
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,760
but as long as he holds a racket,
he is extremely aggressive.

404
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,920
He can serve balls with a speed
of 200 kilometers per hour.

405
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,240
He broke countless rackets.

406
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,440
And Zhuo Zhi,

407
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
known to be the second strongest player
in Yu Qing.

408
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,800
If all this is true,
then we have little hope of winning.

409
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,400
Nothing is impossible.

410
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,440
I heard that Yu Qing recruited students
from Grade 10 for unknown reasons.

411
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,400
And he is short.

412
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,480
[scoffs]

413
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,200
Grade 10?

414
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,760
Then we are sure to defeat him.

415
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,680
He is no match for us.

416
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,520
[Ye] I will deal with the boy
from Grade 10.

417
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
[playful music]

418
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,560
-[thwacks]
-[grunts]

419
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
Hello.

420
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,000
Why are you here?

421
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,320
-It is him.
-It is him.

422
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,360
It is him.

423
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,680
You have to admit defeat,

424
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,240
or else I won't return the tennis balls
I won from you last time.

425
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
[playful music]

426
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,680
Eh?

427
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,920
Dachi,

428
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,120
why do the team members
of Ying Cai look so serious?

429
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,520
We can't treat the match lightly,
depending on their momentum.

430
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,520
NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL MEN'S TENNIS LEAGUE
YING CAI VERSUS YU QING

431
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,360
[umpire 1] Both sides, shake hands.

432
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,400
[all groaning]

433
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
[Jingtian] Umpire, we can't play anymore.
We give up.

434
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,040
What's wrong?

435
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,480
[umpire 1] Ying Cai High School gives up.
Yu Qing qualifies into the next round.

436
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,440
Huh? We have won?

437
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,840
You pretend to be ill and give up
because you fear losing to Yu Qing.

438
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,440
Who are you talking to?

439
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Qiao Chen.

440
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,000
Ya Jiuxin, you went too far.

441
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,600
You should celebrate
for getting such a big advantage.

442
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,760
Oh, I remember.

443
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,000
You are going to compete with us
in the next round.

444
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,200
You will not be happy then
because you will lose for sure.

445
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,120
Qiao Chen, come back.
Don't get into trouble.

446
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,240
[sighs]

447
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,800
[Lu Xia] Hey,

448
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,320
you said we would meet in the competition.

449
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,800
Don't be so frightened as to give up now.

450
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,960
Okay.

451
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,640
I will deal with you in the competition.

452
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,200
You are far from being a match for me.

453
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,120
YU QING

454
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,440
[Coach Qi] The next competition

455
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,400
will be between us and No.3 High School
for the municipal championship.

456
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,560
It means a lot.

457
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,920
I hope everyone
can pay more attention to it.

458
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,800
Sorry, I am late.

459
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,400
I had something to deal with at home.

460
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Sit down.

461
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,760
Since everyone is here,

462
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,560
I will share information
on No.3 High School.

463
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,200
I summarized it into three points.

464
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,760
-Number 3 refers to--
-Because they are No.3 High School.

465
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,040
[inhales sharply]

466
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,400
[sighs]

467
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,400
[soft chuckle]

468
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,360
Number 3 refers to their third
singles player, Qianshi, the captain.

469
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,480
He is a legendary player.

470
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,960
He has good luck.
People call him Lucky Qianshi.

471
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,280
[Zhuo Zhi] I know him.

472
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,480
He was selected in the Teenager Trial
when he was in junior high.

473
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,960
He's an excellent player.

474
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,480
Number 2 refers to their doubles.

475
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,480
They even defeated our Golden Partners
last year.

476
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,800
You can imagine how good they are.

477
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,400
But it won't be the same this year.
Right, Dachi?

478
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,360
Mm-hmm.

479
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,520
Number 1 means

480
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,160
we can still win
even if we lose the doubles match

481
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,080
because No.3 High School
doesn't have a strong singles player.

482
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,520
But because Ya Jiuxin joined the team,

483
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,680
the advantage we had last year

484
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,600
has become a huge challenge
that we have to overcome this year.

485
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,200
If we count Yu Qing's advantages,

486
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,280
we'll have more than theirs.

487
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,440
What is it?

488
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,920
-It's 666 for awesome--
-Sit down right now.

489
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,120
[Qiao Chen clears throat]

490
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,200
Now, I will announce the competitors' list
I reported to the committee.

491
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
The second doubles,

492
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,040
He Xinglong and Zhuo Zhi.

493
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,320
The first doubles,

494
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,920
Chi Dayong and Tang Jiale.

495
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,800
The third singles, Qiao Chen...

496
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,920
Yes!

497
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
Qiao Chen, are you okay with it?

498
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,320
Of course not. I am hardworking.

499
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,560
[Qiao Chen]
I am the enemy of Lucky Qianshi.

500
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,400
Can you be silent for a while?

501
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,520
[chuckles]

502
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,000
The second singles
who will compete with Ya Jiuxin is...

503
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,960
Lu Xia.

504
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,080
I won't lose the match.

505
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,440
I will go to training.

506
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,320
Whoa! It is so rare for Lu Xia
to be so active.

507
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,400
It seems we can watch a great show
this time.

508
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,440
The first singles still goes to Siyang.

509
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,440
Okay. Everyone, please go to training.

510
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,200
-Be quick!
-[Tang Jiale] Let's go.

511
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,840
Coach.

512
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,120
Ya Jiuxin doesn't play in a normal way.

513
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,320
He often hurts his opponents
in competitions.

514
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
I am concerned that Lu Xia
won't be able to deal with him.

515
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,440
[exhales sharply]
That depends.

516
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520

[sizzling]

519
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,560
Maybe another cold dish?

520
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
There should be enough nourishment.

521
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,120
XINGLONG

522
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,200
Then I'll see you on the court.

523
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,840
[Jiuxin] I hope you won't
get hurt anymore.

524
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,480
Dad.

525
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,720
You are home early today.
Don't you have training?

526
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,040
I just wanted to come earlier to help you.

527
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,160
You don't have to worry about it.
Just play tennis well.

528
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,440
I know.

529
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,720
I will go to Mr. Lin's
to buy some soy sauce.

530
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,760
I will be right back.

531
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,640
Be careful when riding the bike.

532
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,440
Go away.

533
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,840
Don't interrupt my sleep.

534
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,600
[He Xinglong] Tomorrow.

535
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Don't hurt my friend.

[scoffs]

537
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,240
You should know it already.

538
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,160
I will always keep my promises.

539
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,000
Plus, I feel disgusted

540
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,880
to see you love and care
for each other so much.

541

Did those losers ask you to beg?

545
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,640
No. It is my own decision.

546
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,800
Go and tell your crap friends,

547
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,440
the one with a cap...

548
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,400
will surely lose tomorrow.

549
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,200
Ya Jiuxin, what do you want to do?

550
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,160
I will make him stop playing tennis.

551
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,720

You are not serious, are you?

What do you think?

555
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,520
Stop caring for others...

556
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,640
and take care of your roast geese.

557

Don't get it overcooked.

Great. That guy is practicing.

00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,440
I can finally watch the show
without interruption.

Lu Xia, stop playing!

Stop...

[Xiangqian sighs]

What's wrong with the TV?

572
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,760
You hit it too hard.

573

Are you satisfied?

574
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,800
Then I will go to bed.

575
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,719
Wait.

576
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,000
There will be a match tomorrow.
How about your preparations?

577
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,480
No problem.

578
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,360
The PIN number is your birthday.

A credit card?

Haven't you been hurt before?

581
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,120
If you get hurt in the match again...

582
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,520
you can use it.

583

[Lu Xia] A medical insurance card.

I don't need it.

-It's that way.

The match is about to begin

but a team member went to the toilet.

-[Dayong] He is here, ma'am.

at the last moment?

Lu Xia, you are here.

There are two Lu Xias.

There is a real and a fake Lu Xia?

I know Lu Xia will be late. So...

Lu Xia, if you are late again next time...

610
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,040
Lu Xia, is it because you helped others
on the way again?

611
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,160
I sent a pregnant woman to the hospital.

612
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,760
Anyway, I managed to be here
at the last minute.

Captain, don't tell me you suddenly
want to play again.

from Grade 10.

I must conduct a survey on it.

He's really 178cm.

656
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,520
Give me the real data.

657
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,640
-He's 168cm.
-Huh?

658
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,440
He is so short.

659
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,160
Almost as short as me.

660
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,600
I thought he was as tall as Ya Jiuxin.
[chuckling]

Okay.

Thank you so much.

I didn't expect you to know him so well.

The freshman
who became a regular in Yu Qing

665
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,840
turned out to be a shorty.

Thank you.

Are you on the tennis team?

Yes.

669
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,720
But I am just in charge of logistics
because I am too short.

[Tang Jiale]
Lu Xia, we should go to the court now.

671
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,120
I must go now.

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,520
Lu Xia?

673
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,000
Height is not the only thing that matters
when playing tennis.

It's 2-5.

No.3 High School takes the lead.

I didn't expect Zhuo Zhi and Xinglong
would be overwhelmed like this.

683
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,080
I don't know why,

684
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,320
but they haven't found a way
to break through.

685
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,920
Xinglong seems to be too defensive.

686
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,960
[Sha] No.3 High School
is good at attacking,

687
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,960
especially after Ya Jiuxin
joined their team.

688
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,720
They have a stronger offensive style now.

689
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,600
Yes. I saw Ya Jiuxin the other day.

690
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,360
He is not easy to deal with.

691
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,760
Huang Jing and the other two
competed with him.

692
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,760
But they couldn't even receive his ball.

693
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,080
Look, Jiuxin, Lu Xia is as short as me.

694
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,280
But he is already a main player.

Don't bother me with these losers.

Sorry.

Don't pick it up.

Isn't it bad to leave it here?

701
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,560
If you want to be like him,
you should go and practice tennis.

[soft chuckle]

703
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,920
Actually, I am not sure what I want to be.

00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,080
But I envy everyone in our team.

705
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,600
Look at you,
you are almost the same as that person.

Is there anyone like that?

If you want to be
the team's sidekick forever,

then leave me alone as soon as possible.

Jiuxin, why do you get angry so easily?

You should either practice tennis
or find something else to do.

I don't need a sidekick.
