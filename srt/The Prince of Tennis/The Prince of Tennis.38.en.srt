When facing Baiyang,

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,960
the point is to give him
a taste of his own medicine.

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,680
Their next player...

35

should be Qiao Chen.

[Yan Zhiming] It was you...

Hai Guang has very detailed data
on all Yu Qing players.

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,480
They're not too proud
and they take their opponents seriously.

That's why they can be the champion
of the eastern region for 16 years.

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,320
[Dayong] They had Baiyang use
his Snake-ball on purpose.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,960
Then they use the same technique
to return it.

43

They want to destroy Baiyang's confidence
in this way

by shocking and humiliating him.

Even Baiyang,
who is quite mentally strong,

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,080

Hai Guang is really good this year.

But...

[Qianshi] Qiao Chen is really going at it.

He's quite impressive.

Ever since the game started,
he's only been hitting the ball back.

[Qianshi] The more difficult
the situation is,

Chi Dayong.

333
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,680
He's trying to help Jiale's eyes

334
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,880
adjust to the speed of the ball
by hitting fast ones.

335
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
[scoffs]

336
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,680
That's quite clever.

337
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,920
[Tang Jiale] I have to keep my eye
on the ball.

338
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
[Sheng] See if you can hit this!

339
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,640
[audience] Nice!

340
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
-Yes!
-Go!

341
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,960
They hit the ball back!

342
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,320
Did they hit it?

343
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,640
[soft chuckle]

344
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,800
The Golden Partners
are starting to catch up.

345
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,320
Go, Yu Qing!

346
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,520
[audience in unison] Go, Yu Qing!

347
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,760
-Go, Yu Qing!
-[Sheng] Australian Formation.

348
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,960
-The point goes to Yu Qing, 2-2.
-[audience in unison] Go, Yu Qing!

349
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,520

-Go!

350
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Go, Yu Qing!

351
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,160
As long as Dachi and Jiale
can see the ball,

352
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,080
they'll be just fine.

353
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,840
They still have a chance.

354
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,760
I thought they were in trouble.
That's great, Ying!

355
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,240
-Go!
-Yes!

356
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,960
Strange.

357
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,400
Something's off.

358
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,840
Could they have another move
up their sleeve?

359
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
[ominous music]

360
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,160
[Yan Zhiming] I think...

361
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,240
If they can't see the ball,
they won't be able to hit it back.

362
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,880
Right, Wang Yaren?

363
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,440
[grunts]

364
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,640
[gasps]

365
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,680
That's right.

366
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,800
So, you practiced that move, right?

367
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,760
[audience in unison] Go, Hai Guang!

368
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,360
Go, Hai Guang!

369
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,560
I overlooked this.

370
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,720
I can't believe that Wang Yaren
can hit such a fast passing shot.

371
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,800
If they keep alternating fast shots,

372
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,360
they'll be invincible.

373
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
[thwacking]

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,800
[Tang Jiale and Dayong groan]

375

[panting]

380
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,480
They fooled us.

381
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,920
Both Lu Sheng and Wang Yaren
can hit fastballs.

382
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,960
So, are you going to give up?

383
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,440
Who once told me

384
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,600
that there are unlimited possibilities
in doubles?

385
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,320
Jiale.

386
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,320
[Tang Jiale] Hm.

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,720
[audience in unison] Go, Hai Guang!

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,120
Go, Hai Guang!

389
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,120
-Go, Hai Guang!
-[Sheng] Let's end this.

390
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,560
[Yaren] I'm going to go all out.

391
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,840
[Dayong] We can only win. We can't lose.

392
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,320
[Tang Jiale] We can only win.
We can't lose.

393
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,480
But...

394
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,240
we came here to win.

What are they doing?

397
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
Jiale, who plays offense,

398
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,360
switched positions with Chi Dayong,
who plays defense.

-[ball zooms]
-Jiale, it's out!

-[umpire] The point goes to Yu Qing, 15-0.

401
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,200
What kind of formation is that?

402
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,160
They're putting Chi Dayong in front,
he's the defense expert,

403
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
while Jiale stays in the back.

404
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,720
Chi Dayong analyzes the ball upfront

405
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,560
and gives hints to Jiale

406
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,920
so that he can speed up his defense.

407
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,560
By doing so,

408
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,200
they can hit back
one of the two Laser Balls.

409
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
[sighs deeply]

410
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,240
[Coach Qi] There's still time.

411
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,280
This is the Golden Partners'
Super Offense Formation.

412
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,520
[umpire] The point goes to Yu Qing, 3-5.

-Go, Yu Qing!
-The Super Offense Formation.

415
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,440

417
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,400

00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,560
-Go, Yu Qing!
-Keep going. Almost there.

420
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,800
[Sheng] That formation, behind Chi Dayong,

421
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,080
has become his defense area.

422
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,320
Lu Sheng.

423
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,960
This is our chance!

424
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,760
[Yaren] As long as there's space,
Lu Sheng's fast ball

425
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,600
-can still turn the tables.
-[Dayong] Oh, no.

426

Lu Sheng's hitting a fastball.

[gasps, grunts]

-Go!
-Don't give up!

432
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,880
[Coach Qi] If they get the point,

433
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,440
they might have a chance
in the service game.

434
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,960
[umpire] End of the game.
Hai Guang wins the set, 6-4.

It was so close.

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,080
Yes.

439
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,640
Who would guess
that we would be so close to victory?

440
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,880
What are you talking about?
Are you losing faith in Yu Qing?

441
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,600
No!

442
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
-Your battery is dead.
-Huh?

443
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
When did that happen?

444
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,080
-I don't know.
-Let's use yours for the next part.

445
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,320
The captain must be so worried.

Even though we won,
the situation is not what we expected.

I'll go call Bai Shiting.

Come on. Let's go warm up.

Hey, little guy.

00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,240
[Yuan Chi] What a coincidence.

461
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,160
Have Hai Guang's players blown your mind?

462
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
You still have a long way to go.

463
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,080
Stop.
