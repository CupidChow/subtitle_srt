why you retired.

Of course.

But he was just a child then.

to be main players in our team.

Apart from training,
the players should also get good grades.

focus on your own training,

329
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
but also know
when to ask your team for help.

330
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,920
Don't leave everything to yourself.

331
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,280
Oh, speaking of...

332
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,520
Yan has a unique understanding
of training.

333
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,240
So I would like him to participate
in making future plans for training.

334
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
What do you think, ma'am?

335
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
Mm-hm.
[inhales sharply]

336
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,000
I have seen Yan Zhiming's plan.
It is very good for the team.

337
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,200
So I would like you and Yan
to arrange the upcoming training.

338
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,040
I will be supporting you.

339
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,440
Thank you, ma'am.

340
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
[light music]

341
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,000
[Yan Zhiming] I have made
a new training plan.

342
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,120
Jiale, please help me demonstrate it.

343
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,200
-Hmm?
-Mm-hm.

344
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,160
No wonder you keep staring at me.

345
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,320
You want to use me as an example.

346
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,840
Everyone's techniques are different
from one another.

347
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,800
Jiale is a flexible player.

348
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
Dayong is good at defending and attacking.

349
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,320
Zhuo Zhi is a skillful player.

350
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,360
But no matter how confident you may be
about your skills,

351
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,120
the most important thing in a match
is the execution.

352
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,600
The execution depends
on physical strength and reaction time.

353
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,080
Mmm.

354
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,600
If you put these sandbags on each leg,

355
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,880
they will add one kilo to your weight.

356
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
[scoffs]
How can such a thing cause me any trouble?

357
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,200
You are underestimating me.

358
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,680
Don't brag about yourself
before trying it.

359
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,120
[Yan Zhiming] I prepared tennis balls
of different colors,

360
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,160
as well as cones
with corresponding colors.

361
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,960
When the machine shoots out the ball,

362
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,440
you should aim for the corresponding cone.

363
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,000
If you fail to do so, you lose.

364
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,840
Let's have Jiale show it to us.

365
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,160
Okay. Watch me.

366
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
[upbeat music]

367
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,880
Red.

368
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,640
[Tang Jiale] Hmm.

369
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,360
[whooshes]

370
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,000
Blue.

-[thwacks]
-[grunts]

372
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,200
Mmm.

373
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,920
How is that? Is he good?

374
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,280
He has good dynamic visual acuity.

375
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,080
You seem to know a lot.

376
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,560
But as for hitting speed
and reaction time,

377
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,280
nobody can do it better than Jiale.

378
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,160
Do you feel lucky to have
such a player with you on the team?

379
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,480
The effect of the added weight
is about to show.

380
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
[grunts]

381
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,040
It is starting to be a little difficult.

382
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,640
You are feeling the one kilo
on your feet, right?

383
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,560
Mm-hm.

384
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,680
Can I take it off?

385
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,840
Of course not.

386
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,800
Hmm. Okay.

387
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,680
Come on.

388
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,400
[whooshes]

389
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,680
Red.

390
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,920
-Shouldn't it be blue?
-Huh?

391
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,240
[gasps]

392
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,880
Huh?

393
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,160
Yan, that's impossible.
This is obviously red.

394
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,080
No matter what the color of the ball is,
you still didn't hit it, right?

395
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,720
But you were distracting me
from the outside.

396
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,120
If someone shouts "hook" in the game,

397
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,920
-will you do as he says?
-All right.

398
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,160
Along with physical fatigue,
your judgment will be poorer as well.

399
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,440
[Yan Zhiming]
No one can prevent this from happening.

400
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,320
The only way to deal with it
is to improve your physical strength,

401
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,960
so that you can have
precise judgment all the time.

402
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,960
[sighs]

403
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,200
I was wrong.

404
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,760
You can't just depend on training
to be stronger.

405
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,040
You should also...

406
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,600
take care of your nutrition.

407
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
[sniffs]

408
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,240
So, what is it?

409
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,760
Drink it and you will know.

410
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,600
Oh.

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,400

Here you are.

I forgot to introduce it to you.

418
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,160
[Yan Zhiming] This is my surprise for you,

419
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,560
my specially made vegetable juice.

420
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
We can call it "Yan-juice" for now.

421
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,400
It has bitter gourd paste...

422
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,680
and over 40 kinds of ingredients.

423
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,320
They are all good for our body.

The juice is pretty good.

426
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,720
You may feel dizzy after drinking this,

427
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,800
but you will gain lots of strength.

Consider your current condition.

on your spiritual status.

In a match,
one's spirit is very important.

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,920
It is beyond my expectations...

433

for Yan-juice to have such an effect.

-Okay.

[Siyang sighs]

498
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,880
Do you like it?

499
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
It is good.

500
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,240
-Yan.
-Hm?

501
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,880
[Siyang] I believe in your abilities

502
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,120
and I support you as well.

503
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,120
As for the juice...

504
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,520
it can be the team's regular
nutritional supplement.

505
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,080
But remember, only from time to time.

506
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,760
Okay, Captain.

507
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,400
Then, twice a week?

508
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,400
[gasps]

509
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,880
Once a week. We can discuss it.

510
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,200
[soft chuckle]

511
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,560
Taking a nutritional supplement
once a week is not enough.

512
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,440
Once a week.
There is no need to discuss it.

513
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,760
Okay, Captain.

514
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,640
Then, I will invent a concentrated one.

515
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,240
[Siyang groans, clears throat]

516
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,720
It seems the captain
likes this juice as well.

517
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,920
That's right.

518
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,720
-Hmm.
-[snickers]

519
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,360
[Yan Zhiming] Everyone seems
a lot more energetic

520
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,920
after drinking the juice.

521
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,240
Then I will continue
to talk about physical training.

522
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,760
Xinglong.

523
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,840
You always hold the racket loosely
when hitting balls.

524
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,520
You need to strengthen
your forearm muscles.

525
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,520
Baiyang, Dayong.

526
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,280
You should pay attention to forward
and backward movement.

527
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,360
Jiale and Zhuo Zhi should pay attention
to the left and right movement.

528
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,120
Qiao Chen, if you only use 70 percent
of your strength when hitting balls,

529
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,960
you will be more accurate.

530
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
Lu Xia, I think
you should drink more milk.

531
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,200
No matter how much milk I drink,
I will not get any taller.

532
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,080
Lu Xia, I think
you should take his advice.

533
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,120
Yan is so tall
because he drank a lot of milk.

534
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,680
As for Siyang, your problem is...

535
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,360
you always have a poker face.

536
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,760
You need to relax.

537

This is not about tennis at all.

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,840
To help everyone progress faster,

540
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,200
I will upgrade my Yan-juice.

No wonder you've been staying here.
You're reading this.

-That is a good thing.
-I can't give up.

Of course, you can't give up,
but you look so sleepy.

Can you still compete?

564
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,240
I already finished reading this book.

565
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,760
Is it useful for you?

566
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,480
A little bit. What about you?

567
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,320
I am okay. Can you lend me the book?

568

Yes, you can have it.

-I am just drawing.
-That's not a random drawing.

You are designing a formation
for tennis doubles.

[Lu Xia] Mm-hm.

579

Are you going to play doubles?
Who is your partner?

580

Qiao Chen.

Qiao Chen?

How's your training going?

583
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,520
Jiale, I have a question.

584
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,440
Players can't be around
the center of the court,

585
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,600
but they shouldn't be close
to the sides either, right?

586
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,640
Wouldn't the players' range be restricted?

587
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,080
It seems what I heard is true.
You were beaten hard.

588
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,200
Qiao Chen is the one to blame,
but we will definitely win next time.

589
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,200
There will be a next time?

590
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,840
I will not surrender.

591
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,480
Okay.

592
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,760
Then we, the Golden Partners,
will train and teach you

593
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,360
until you have perfected it.

594
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,800

[indistinct chatter]

596
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,560
What is the rope for?

597
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,640
[Dayong] It is a doubles training today,

598
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,960
and you will be tied together
while training.

599
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,640
This is Dayong, and this is
our unique training method.

600
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
It looks so silly.

601
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,800
A piece of rope won't restrain me, anyway.

602

[thwacks]

608
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,920
Man, how long have you played
doubles together?

609
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,920
[both] Two years.

610
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,160
Why do you play doubles?

611
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
When we first joined
the Yu Qing Tennis Club,

612
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
we were not doubles players.

613
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,760
So when I asked him to play doubles
with me,

614
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,360
he refused at first.

615
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,440

Chi Dayong, it is 3-0 already.

620
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,360
You have great movements,
totally unpredictable.

621
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,800
Are you willing to play doubles
with me now?

622
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,680
With you? What are you talking about?

623
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,440
You always play tennis the same way.
I know all your moves.

624
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,440
[snickers]

625
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,480
Back then, I was like Lu Xia
and I didn't like doubles.

626
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,199
[Tang Jiale] So I refused.

627
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
It was because you were old-fashioned

628
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,000
and didn't have your own style of playing.

629
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,199
I really couldn't understand
how I would lose

630
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
to such an old-fashioned person like you.

631
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,760
Chi Dayong, 6-4. Winner!

How come?

634
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,360
Wait, what happened just now
was a warm-up.

635
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,719
From now on, I will be serious.

636
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,880
[snickers]
Okay. Again.

637
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,960
Then I had a second thought.

638
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,679
I decided to get close to you
by forming a doubles pair with you.

639
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,840
That way, I could know you better
and defeat you more quickly.

640
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,480
Chi Dayong looks so ordinary
and doesn't appear to be fierce at all.

641
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,680
But why did I lose all the matches
we played?

642
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
[grunts]

643
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,640
Let's be doubles partners
until I defeat you.

647
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,800
Really?

648
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,480
During this time,

649
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,400
I will find out all your weaknesses

650
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,960
and defeat you in no time.

651
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,440
I thought playing doubles was my sideline.

652
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,840
I didn't expect that we would continue
to play for two years.

653
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,440
We even became the Gold Partners.

654
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,640
But I feel good about it.

[snickers]

659
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,720
You should never have this idea in mind
when playing doubles.

660
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,680
[Tang Jiale] Mm-hm.

661
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,120
Man, haven't you changed partners?

662
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,200
Hey.

663
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,920
What?

664
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,800
When Xing Yao High School defeated us...

665
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
You don't know the story.

666
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,360
[Qiao Chen] Last year,
we competed against Xing Yao High School

667
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,400
in the national league.

668
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,200
The committee at that time
was so stubborn, so they separated us.

669
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,320
I was in Grade 10 at the time.

670
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,040
I haven't become a regular
in the team yet.

671
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,840
Then what happened?

672
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,720
-As a result--
-We lost to Xing Yao High School.

673
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,800
Our way to the championship isn't over...

674
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,320
so the Golden Partners
will stay together this year.

675
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,880
[sighs]

676
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,440
I kind of expect to compete
with Xing Yao High School.

677
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,640
If we can play together,
we will be sure to win this time.

678
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,600
[exhales sharply]

679
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,320
Mm-hm. In fact, playing doubles is great.

680
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,040
There will be someone helping you

681
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,360
with the areas you can't reach
and balls you can't get.

682
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,480
[Tang Jiale] I'm relieved to be
your partner. What about you?

683
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,520
Mm-hm.

684
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,040
Doubles are quite different from singles.

685
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,080
[Dayong] Because your opponents
are two people,

686
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,840
if you can't coordinate with each other,

687
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,240
then it will be one versus two.

688
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,840
So remember, when you are in the match,

689
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,440
you are one, not two separate people.

690
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,240
[both sighing]

691
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,840
Hmm.

[Lu Xia and Qiao Chen groaning]

699
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,640
Hello?

700
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,680
[Qiao Chen] Have you forgotten something?

701
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,240
Set us free before you leave.

702
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,960
[Dayong] This is just the first step
to developing your coordination.

703
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,560
[Tang Jiale] Try to help
each other stand up.

704
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,800
Why not ask him? He might know about it.

705
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,520
He only has some bad advice.

706
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,680
Here you are.

707
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,400
Come on.

708
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
I just cooked this. Try it.

709
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,800
[Lu Xia] What's this?

710
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,680
Chang E. Flying to the Moon Fried Rice.

711
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,240
It is easy to make.

712
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,040
First, get durian pulp

713
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,960
and heat it in the oven.

714
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,560
Then smash it and make it into a ball.
Put it into the fried rice.

715
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,160
It cannot be seen from the outside.

716
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,480
But if you take a bite.
You will taste it in your mouth.

717
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
[Xiangqian] Come on, have a taste.

718
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,880
Are you not going to try?

719
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,120
[soft chuckle]

720
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
[comical music]

721
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,000
Yummy.

722
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,200
[chuckles]

723
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,000
[Xiangqian] It is yummy, right?
Some boys can't eat it

724
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,280
because they are thinking
about something else.

725
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,880
Oh, man.

726
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,480
-As for the doubles--
-I know doubles.

727
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,400
Oh.

728
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,720
The most important thing for doubles
is coordination.

729
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,840
Whenever the ball comes,
you have to be clear.

730
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,960
First, you should determine
who will hit the ball.

731
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,600
That's right. I tell you what,
if the ball comes from the middle,

732
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,440
the one with a forehand should hit it.

733
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,400
But sometimes the backhand is better.

734
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,040
[Qiao Chen] That's what I think.

735
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,760
But that is not doubles, right?

736
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,400
So, what should we do?

737
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,640
I don't know,
I haven't played doubles before.

738
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,640
Then why did you say you know doubles?

739
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,000
I read Lu Xia's book.

740
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,560
A Basic Course on Tennis Doubles
for Beginners.

741
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,600
It is difficult to not hit the balls
when you see them flying all over.

742
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,480
[sighs]

743
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,160
In fact, the simplest way

744
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,920
is to discuss who should do the hitting
with your partner.

745
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
How does that work?

746
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,200
For example, a signal or something.

747
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,840
-A signal?
-Mm-hm.

748

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
[both] No.

753
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,280
Look, you have a hidden understanding.

755
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,320
No, this way.

Yu Qing may qualify in the first round.

759

Other schools have no chance.

760

-Thank you.
-Come.

-Yes.
