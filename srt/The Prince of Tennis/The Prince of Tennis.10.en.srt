00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,240
Come on.

165
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,320
Siyang didn't even use
half of his techniques just now.

166
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,720
Fortunately, this is all
according to my plan.

167

[tense music]

168
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
Forget about Siyang.

169
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,600
There's another Yu Qing player
who deserves our attention.

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,880
[Jin Qiu student 1] Yu Qing
has gotten stronger compared to last year.

171
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,840
[Jin Qiu student 2] Every match is 6-0.

172
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,160
Damn it. They're our next opponent.

173
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,240
[Jin Qiu student 3] I've played
against them. They're really good.

174
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,080
To put it bluntly,

175
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,160
we're going to lose for sure.

176
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
[Jin Qiu student 3 sighs]
The pressure is real.

177
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
[Yue] Excuse me. Sorry to disturb you.

178
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,280
-Are you from Jin Qiu High School?
-[Jin Qiu student 1] Yes.

179
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,840
May I know who your captain is?

[Dayong sighs]

186
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,560
It's true. I'm not imagining it.

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,280
Prior to the match,
Jin Qiu studied Yu Qing's style.

188
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,560
It's no coincidence.

189
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,040
[snickers]
In any case,

190
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,280
they're not going to win.

Zhuo Zhi, Xinglong,
even though you've won at 6-0,

194
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,400
the match time was longer than usual.

195
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Right?

196
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,800
-Mm-hm.
-Yes.

197
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,800
It was a tough win.
Jin Qiu is not that easy.

198
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,760
They know our playing style well.

199
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
They always go for our weak spots.

200
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,880
Even though we didn't lose,

201
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,920
they still gave us a hard time.

202
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
[foreboding music]

203
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,720
Come to think of it,
where were you during lunch break?

204
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,520
To help us deal with Yu Qing later on.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
I did some homework.

206
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,600
Yu Qing seems a little off today.

207
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,920
Did you do something behind the scenes?

208
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,040
I can't claim to have

209
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,120
"done" something.

210
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,040
[Yue] All I did was test our theory
to find out if it works.

211
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,600
I'll go watch other matches.

212

What?

213
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,080
You're not staying for Yu Qing's matches?

214
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,880
I've already watched
the most crucial match.

It's finally over.

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,720
Yeah!

-For you.
-Well done.

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,400
Jiale.

230
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,040
Did you notice anything?

231
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,840
They played passively
and made a lot more mistakes.

232
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
Mm-hm.

233
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,520
They're well-prepared,
but not very well-trained.

234
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,280
To put it simply,

235
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
our playing style has been kept in check.

236
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,040
As the regional champions,

237
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
they've surely done their research.

238
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,640
[sighs]
It's okay.

239
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,920
We just have to make sure we keep winning.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,040
[Dayong] Mm-hm.

241
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,640
You must be that Yu Qing freshman
who became famous after a match.

242
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,520
Why didn't you use
your left hand today, Lu Xia?

-May I know who you are?
-[snickers]

You're new,
yet you're already a main player.

That's something.

have you already lost a match?

Are you the coach of Guo Zi High School?

I'm Guan Yue.

I've never had anyone
recognize me as that.

I'm a little flattered.

Don't you have to cheer for your team?

281
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
They should have won by now.

282

Second doubles, 6-3.

Third singles, 6-1.

285
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
In order to play against you
in the future,

286
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,920
we will work hard.

287
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
I have to remind you.

288
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,760
On the court, nothing is guaranteed.

289
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,240
If you make a mistake, you're out.

290
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,600
That is why...

291
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,440
I've always been careful.

292
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,680
Over-confidence...

293
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
is not a good thing.

294
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,880
Looks like you're rather concerned.

295
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,040
You're reminding me about so many things.

296
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,480
I shall return the favor
and make a prediction for Yu Qing's match.

297
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,360
[Yue] They should be having
the third singles match now.

298
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Lu Xia should win with a score of 6-0.

299
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,120
So, Yu Qing would win
with a total score of 3-0.

300
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,600
Before the match,

301
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
you told Jin Qiu High School
our weaknesses, right?

302
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,520
It seems like you also know that,
even if they knew our weaknesses,

303
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,760
they're still no match for Yu Qing.

304
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,880
That team is just hopeless.

305
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
However, Guo Zi High School

306
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
is different.

307
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,000
So, you wanted to find out

308
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,480
how we would react to an opponent

309

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,400
What were you up to, slowpoke?

331
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,760
Getting a soda.

332
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,880
Why did you take so long?

333
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,960
The roads here all look the same.

334
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,640

make you run laps later.

[Peng and Ying panting]

337
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,240
Finally, a familiar face.

338
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,800
[Peng] There are too many courts here.

339
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,480
-The roads here all look the same.
-[Peng] Mm-hm.

340
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,440
Really?

341
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
What is it?

342
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,440
Nothing. Let's go.

343
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,520
Where?

344
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,240
We agreed to watch Yu Feng play.

345
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,960
Qiao Chen, I have to practice.

346
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
Why can't you just follow the team?

347
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,000
[Yu Feng student 1] Go, Yu Feng, go!

348
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,920
[Yu Feng student 2] Yu Feng,
the champions!

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,800
[Yu Feng students] Go for it! Yu Feng!

350
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,240
Who won?

351
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,920
Yu Feng, of course.

352
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,840
Now, Yu Feng is no longer a dark horse.

353
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,800
They're a reputable team now.

354
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,040
I know, right?

355
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,360
We have to let Lu Xia learn from them
so that he can improve even faster.

356
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,560
Right, Lu Xia?

357
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,280
Lu Xia?

358
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
[Peng and Ying] Huh?

359
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,520
Huh?

360
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,960
Where did that kid go again?

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,960

[Weiming pants]

370

Compared to when we played against them,

371
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,440
Yu Feng has grown stronger.

372
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,440
Indeed. Shen Weiming has gotten faster.

373
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,280
[Sha] The 55th High players
could barely keep up.

374
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,480
But Shen Weiming hardly broke a sweat.

375
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,200
It's the same for us.

376
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,960
If we don't improve,

377
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,480
we will be left behind.

378
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Actually,

379
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,880
going by your performance today,
Yu Qing has improved a lot.

380
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Don't stress yourselves out.

[Tang Jiale] Mm-hm.

382
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,560
If we have to play against Yu Feng,

383
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,000
it's going to be a tough match.

I'm getting more drinks for them.

389

Isn't your brother competing?

Why are you here?

There's nothing to worry about.

399
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,160
Shen Weiming
already has full control of the match.

Who is Shen Weiming?

401
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,600
He's the one who was defeated by Baiyang
in the last competition.

Oh! He's a really good player.

they have to be punished.

[Coach Qi] Our opponent
in the quarterfinals

661
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,080
is Guo Zi High School.

662
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,360
If we win this match,

663
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,920
we'll officially be
in the qualifying round.

664
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,159
The line-up for this match
remains largely the same.

665
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,440
Third singles, Lu Xia.

Second singles, Zhuo Zhi.

667

-[Tang Jiale] Spies?
-[shushes]

683
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,440
[Yan Zhiming] During the last match
against Jin Qiu High School,

684
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,360
you might have noticed
that attacks on our players were targeted.

685
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,880
Each match was difficult.

686
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,360
This is because our rival has not only
gathered information on our players,

687
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,760
but they even knew
how to target our weaknesses.

688
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,000
You're making it sound too serious.

689
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,280
Didn't we win?

690
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,360
This is all because of him,

691
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,880
Guan Yue.

692
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
[Yan Zhiming] He's our next rival.

693
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,720
He's the strategist
and the soul of Guo Zi's team.

694
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,640
He's the one
who gathered information on us

695
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,640
and shared it with the Jin Qiu team.

696
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,120
Guan Yue has gathered outstanding players
from different places

697
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,640
to form this new team.

698
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,520
Guo Zi High School supports him.

699
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,680
A lot of good tennis players
have transferred to Guo Zi.

[tense music]

What does that mean?

702
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Does this Guan Yue
intend to steal Zhuo Zhi?

703
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,600
[Yan Zhiming sighs]

704
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,840
Actually, I intend to visit Guo Zi
to find out more.

705
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,960
Zhuo Zhi can go with me if he wants to.

706
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,240
It's okay.

707
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,440

Yan.

709
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,880
You've come all the way here
for information.

710
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,160
Are you happy with what you got?

711
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,440
Do you really think

712
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,720
that training hard
is enough to beat Yu Qing?

713
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,840
When it comes to individuals,

714
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,400
we don't have as many outstanding players
as Yu Qing.

715
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,880
But as long as
I know your weaknesses and strategies,

716
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,600
we can still defeat you

717

with what we have.

718
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,600
You being here doesn't faze me.

719
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,720
After all, the weaknesses I've learned
are not something you could overcome...

in a short time.

721
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,360
It seems like
my previous reminders were insufficient.

722
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,840
Even if you possessed certain data,

723
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,040
that doesn't mean you can defeat us.

724

And I'm speaking from experience.

it will be a total disgrace.
