I know you'll regret it
if you give up now.

But right now,
you have to listen to others.

to the hospital.

You have only ten minutes.

If the game doesn't end in ten minutes,
you have to give it up.

then the power of his grip has decreased.

Even if he can tell the distance,

276
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,120
he's not able to get the ball.

277
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,720
I never expected that Yu Feng High School
would have such a talented player.

[Coach Qi] He was ignored all the time.

Yiwu completely controlled
the timing of the paralysis.

[chuckles]
He is extraordinary.

281
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,840
He is concentrating
on Lu Xia's left corner.

282
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,840
He shows no mercy at all.

284
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,640
Is it okay to let him play
through the injury?

285
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,200
I will take him out when the time is up.

286

Win or lose.

287
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,760
I think he won't easily give up.

288
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,200
[Yiwu] The temporary paralysis
should affect your hand again.

It's good to get everyone's sympathy.

But just remember your own words.

I have to beat you soon.

Did he really figure out
how to deal with the temporary paralysis?

304
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,160

[Lu Xia] Have you ever seen
a double volley?

309
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,920
It's Lu Xiangqian‘s strategy.

310

[Ziping] His reflex is unbelievable.

Why does he keep doing the Down Spin?

Don't you play well
using Top Spin and Down Spin?

316
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
Keep doing those.

317
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,680
He cannot do a Top Spin
if the ball comes right at him.

318
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,080
So it's not because he doesn't want to,
he just can't.

He found a way
to break the deadlock so soon.

Did Lu Xia learn this strategy
from his father?

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,240
Yes, to be a real first-class player

322
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,760
is not only to get over the weak backhand,

323

but also to get over the obstacles.

This was the spirit that made Lu Xiangqian
get his own strategy.

It is not good for Lu Xia
to keep imitating his father.

329
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,160
Come on, Lu Xia.

330
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
There are only two minutes left.

[Lu Xia panting]

332
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,640
Yiwu, it's the critical moment.

333
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,320
Come on, Yiwu.

334
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,360
[Tienan] It can't end like this.

335
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,000
He's bleeding.

336
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,320
[Ziping] He still plays so well
despite the injury.

337
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,760
What an incredible freshman.

338
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,520
I will end this game soon.

339
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,240
Yiwu, win this one.

340
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,400
We still have a chance.

341
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
It's still early.

342
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,200
I will not let you win.

Great! Yiwu is not giving up.

348
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,240
He predicted Lu Xia's path.

349
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,640
Only 30 seconds left.

Right on time.

[both] Yes!

363
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,320
He made it.

Yeah!

Awesome! Lu Xia.

374
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
[Ying] Lu Xia is such a wonderful player.

375
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,040
[umpire] Players, shake your hands.

[cheering]

377
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,240
[Qiao Chen] What food
is good for the eyes?

378
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,000
[He Xinglong] Luckily,
he stopped bleeding.

379
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,440
[Zhuo Zhi] He will be fine.

380
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,400
[Tang Jiale] He will not go blind, right?

381
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
[Dayong] Lu Xia, hold on.

382
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,520
[Lu Xia] It hurts.

383
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,680
[Baiyang] Lu Xia, well done.

384
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,200
[Siyang] I'll let him take
a break these next few days.

385
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,800
Sorry to have injured your player.

386
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
But we will not lose again.

387
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,120
I hope we can meet at nationals.

388
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,520
I look forward
to playing against you next time.

[Qiao Chen] Lu Xia.

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,760
Let's go to the hospital.

391

[Lu Xia] What? Put me down!

[Yiwu] Captain.

395
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,600
I lost.

396
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,160
[all] Sorry.

397
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,040
It's hard in the beginning.

398
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,600
There's a first time for all of us.

399
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Don't be discouraged.

400
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,880
[Ziping] We can't lose next time.

401
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,480
Although we lost this game,

402
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,120
we are still qualified.

403
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,920
We've achieved what we promised.

404
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,000
It's a long way to nationals.

405
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,720
We have to fight on our own.

[doctor 2] Why are you
high school students

409
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,160
risking your lives for a game?

410
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,600
I have seen many of you
get your eyes and arms hurt.

411
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,120
Will this affect his eyes?

412
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,320
It's nothing serious.

413
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,120
It's just superficial
and a little bleeding.

414
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
[doctor 2] He'll be fine
in two or three days.

Kid, does it hurt?

416
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,600
Yes.

[comical music]

418
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,520
His injury is nothing serious.

419
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,000
[Siyang] But remember,

420
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,720
ensuring your own safety
is also important for the team.

421
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,840
Got it?

422
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,760
Got it.

423
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,000
Fine.

424
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's go.

Where am I?

[sighs]

428
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,960
Lu Xia bled for our team today.

429
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,200
We’ll make it up to you
at the celebration.

430
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,360
I'm not going.

431
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,680
Huh? You cannot escape.

432
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,320
You must come.

433
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,120
Our roasted goose is tasty.

434
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,520
I'll have my dad make you
some goose soup tonight.

435
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Yes, the goose is the best.

-Okay.

[Sha] Finally, I found you.

438
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,400
How is your eye?

439
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,440
Ah! He's fine.

440
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,600
[Sha] Uh...

441
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,360
Now that I've met you, let's take a photo.

442
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,480
Fine. Come on.

-Come on.
-[Sha] Come on.

444

Look here. Three, two, one.

[camera shutter clicks]

446
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,200
[Qiao Chen] Lu Xia,
you are the biggest hero today.

447
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,280
Chi, Jiale, and Baiyang also won, right?

448
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,160
Okay, boy.

449
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,720
I am so grateful that you said that
and that you think that way.

450
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,720
It's just a victory.

451
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,960
Right.

452
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,920
It is teamwork.

453
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,240
We are all heroes.

454
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,480
Mm-hm.

455
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,760
Here's a little secret.

456
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,360
Ying.

457
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,360
Who did you cheer for today?

458
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,640
I didn't.

459
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,600
We don't need to point it out.

460
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,000
We all saw

461
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,680
-who you were cheering for today.
-Mm-hm.

462
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,040
Jiale, don't talk anymore.

463
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,600
Then you talk more.

464
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,320
Stop it.

465
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
You all did a good job today.

466
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,560
Let's do our best

467
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,200
and achieve the final victory.

468
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,680
Yu Qing!

469
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,200
-Bound to win!
-Cheers.

-Cheers.
-Cheers.

471
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,720
Here.

472
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,200
Lu Xia, what else would you like?

473
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,880
My father cooks for our celebrations.

474
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,680
Help yourselves.

475
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,880
Yes, players can't win
on an empty stomach.

476
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,000
[Mr. He] Help yourselves. There's more.

477
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,200
Xinglong, take care of them.

478
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Okay, Dad.

479
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,120
[He Xinglong sighs]

480
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,840
Excuse me.

481
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,560
Okay.

482
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,440
You're all hungry, right?

483
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,560
-Let's eat.
-[Tang Jiale] Yes.

[somber music]

485
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,040
[Mr. He groaning]

486
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,920
-[Qiao Chen] Jiale, give me some goose.
-Hm?

487
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,840
Here.

488
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,000
[Qiao Chen] Thanks.

489
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,120
[laughs]

490
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,280
You eat like a horse
even though you didn't play today.

491
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,320
I saw Qiao Chen talking
with a girl from Yu Feng today,

492
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,320
and they looked happy.

493
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,440
Do you two know each other?

494
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,360
Really?

495

It's breaking news.

Qiao Chen, who is that girl?

497
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,560
What's your relationship?
How did you meet?

Um...

499
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
She is Xu Ziping's younger sister,

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
my middle school classmate.

501
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,800
I often borrowed her money
for hamburgers back then.

502
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,720
So we got to know each other
more and more.

[Tang Jiale] Hm?

Zhuo Zhi, what sauce is this?

509
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,240
Is it good?

What is it?

514
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,760
My newly made spicy sauce.

515
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,040
Xinglong! Bring me some water.

Just a minute.

-Zhuo Zhi.
-Mm?

520

Please tell me your recipe.

No.

[Siyang] Okay, everyone.
Go home and have some rest.

530

[Coach Qi] You look good.

Go to sleep.

Aren't you tired after the game?

You can leave it to me.

Aren't you tired, either?

558

You are too young to have a relationship.

It's just an accident.

I meant the characters on it.

Is it bad?

Could you concern yourself
with something else?

Something else?

574

Do you have any other injuries? Where?
