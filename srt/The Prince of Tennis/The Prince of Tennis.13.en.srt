No.

164
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,120
Your mom is cooking
your favorite roast pork.

165
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,760
[sighs]
I will get some of my things anyway.

166
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,000
It depends.

167
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,320
Forget it.
I will call to stop her from cooking.

168
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,960
-You don't like it anyway.
-Stop.

169
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,400
I just said I would go back
and pick some things up.

170
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,720
I am so hungry.

171
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,960
What's taking him so long?

172
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,080
Huh? What are you doing here?

173
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,400
We are waiting for Jiale.

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
He said he will treat us
to a meal if he loses.

175
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,480
Huh? But everybody is gone now.

176
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,440
What?

177
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
He escaped?

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
[sighs]

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,840
[Yu] Today, when you
were competing... Hmm...

180
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
[Zhuo Zhi] Was I handsome?

181
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,920
A little bit.

182
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey! Why are you taking photos of me?

183
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,520
It is so rare to hear you praise me.

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,360
I must record it, right?

185
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
[Yu groans]

186
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,160
[chuckles]

187
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,160
If it wasn't Guan Yue
who taught me Jump Smash,

188
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,240
would you still defeat him
with your full strength?

189
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,200
[snickers]

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,840
I don't have to use my full strength
to defeat him.

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,120
[scoffs]

192
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,240
It is true.

193
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,320
However,

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,640
playing in a match with full strength
must be a wonderful experience.

195
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,880
Yes, it was great.

196
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,960
No matter who you compete with,

197
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,840
even if it's with an invincible genius
and you know you will lose anyway,

198
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,160
you still hope the opponent
will do his best to compete with you.

199
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,080
So will you take every match seriously
like you did today?

200
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,640
If you are bullied...

201
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,960
[sighs]

202
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,640
I will.

203
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
[light music]

204
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,040
[Yu sighs]

205
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,600
[Tang Jiale grunts]

206
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,480
I should hit the last ball.

207
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,800
In this case, we can react more quickly.

208
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,480
[grunting]

209
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,160
It is so annoying.

210
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,080
[exhales sharply]

211
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay. So much for introspection.

212
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,800
Hmm.

213
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,440
[Dayong] I knew you would be here.

214
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Hey, Dachi, I came here alone.

215
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,760
[Dayong sighs]

216
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,400
Since we became partners,

217
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
we always come here for introspection
after losing a game.

218
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,000
How many times have we been here?

219
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,800
I can't remember.

220
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,360
I don't know how many times
we have lost to the seniors.

221
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,680
[both sigh]

222
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,000
I promise we will never come here again.

223
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,880
[sighs]

224
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
[light music]

225
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,280
[Tang Jiale] Next time,

226
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,160
we will start to sprint.

227
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,040
-What about the goal?
-Don't you know?

228
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,160
Of course, to win all the matches

229
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,360
and be the champion
of the future national competition.

230
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,880
[cat meows]

231
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,040
[meowing continues]

232
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,040
[Baiyang] Meow.

233
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
Meow, meow.

234
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,320
Meow.

235
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
Ahh.

236
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,800
I know what you like.

237
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,040
-[cat purrs]
-Meow.

238
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,680
Meow.

239
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,840
Meow.

240
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,520
YU QING

241
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,680
[school bell tolling]

242
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,880
[indistinct chatter]

243
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,600
Eh? Siyang, you are still here?

244
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,960
Oh. Coach.

245
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,280
[exhales sharply]

246
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,560
The last match just ended,

247
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,160
and you're already researching
about the next opponent.

248
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
[Coach Qi] Luckily, I came back here.

249
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,800
Otherwise, nobody will find out
that our captain is so hardworking.

250
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,160
We will gain more confidence
if we start earlier.

251
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,560
[inhales sharply]
So you will play in the next match?

252
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
[somber music]

253
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,880
[sighs]

254
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,080
How about your arm?

255
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,440
Please don't worry.

256
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,160
I won't force myself
if my arm is not okay.

257
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,320
[sighs deeply]

258
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,880
When you realize your arm is not okay,
it will be too late.

259
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,680
Each of our team members
has unlimited potential.

260
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,400
However,

261
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,880
they need time to grow up.

262
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
[sighs]

263
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,720
But I don't know
whether the successor in your mind

264
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,800
can grow fast enough to catch up with you.

265
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,080
[exhales sharply]

266
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,600
[Peng gasps]

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,760
This is actually fun to play with.

268
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,360
These are bouncy balls.

269
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
They are suitable for beginners like us.

270
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
We can practice playing tennis on our own.

271
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,400
Then we can use it to practice tennis
in the future.

272
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,800
[soft chuckle]

273
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,240
This is the first time
we bought tennis balls ourselves.

274
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,760
Should we draw something on the ball
as a mark?

275
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,640
Then let's draw Lu Xia.

276
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,200
[chuckles]
Okay.

277
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
[light music]

278
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,680
[chuckling]

279
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,480
Look.

280
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,040
[Peng] This is my drawing.

281
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,200
Hmm...

282
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,120
Hmm?

283
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,880
Hm!

284
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,640
[gasps]
How did you do this?

285
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,240
Help me draw one, please.

286
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,080
-Then you can have mine.
-Mm-hmm.

287
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,080
[chuckles]

288
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,960
[phone ringing]

289
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,840
[Lu Xia] I am on my way.
Don't call me anymore.

290
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,720
[Xiangqian] I know
you don't have many clothes.

291
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,520
So I want to buy some for you.

292
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,360
-But look at how you treat me.
-If there's nothing else, I will hang up.

293
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,320
[Xiangqian] Uh, if you get there early,
don't pick clothes by yourself.

294
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,480
If you get clothes
like the ones you have at home,

295
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,480
I won't pay for them.

296
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,880
Then you can buy some
and bring them back to me.

297
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,040
The Chinese saying goes,

298
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,080
"Better teach a man to fish
than to give him a fish".

299
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
[sighs]
Okay, I know.

300
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,480
[Xiangqian] Don't wear the team uniform.

301
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
[light music]

302
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,600
[Xiuwen] ...nor has a nice figure,

303
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,160
hm, nor has a dress sense...

304
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,480
[chief editor laughing]

305
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
[Xiuwen] She's also pretty careless

306
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,120
and ill-tempered.

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,480
[all laughing]

308
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,960
My question is,

309
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,760
who taught you to use GoPro
to record the tennis match?

310
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,480
[chief editor] You even deleted the photos
from the camera.

311
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,560
Eh?

312
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,560
Now, there is something surprising
as well.

313
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,240
-[chief editor laughs]
-[sighs]

314
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,400
Sir, please don't make fun of me.

315
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,560
It is so embarrassing.

316
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
But...

317
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,280
there hasn't been anyone

318
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,640
who recorded a sports match
like a documentary.

319
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
This kind of method...

320
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,760
is new in our field.

321
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,520
[chief editor]
Hey, maybe after we broadcast this,

322
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,920
the senior high tennis league
we are focusing on

323
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,600
will become more famous.

324
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,960
Okay.

325
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,600
[all giggling]

326
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,680
[Sha] I am totally ruined by those boys.

327
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,680
I am a professional.
I won't be looked down on.

I remember something.

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,760
My friend's niece
wants to learn how to play tennis.

497

What does it have to do with me?

498
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,160
I thought you could teach her.

I am not going. You can go if you want.

Oh, okay.

501

When you meet her, remember to be serious.
Don't be casual.

You can go yourself.

You already ate one.

Just do it to repay
my love and care. Okay?

Oh.

You're the niece of my father's friend?

515
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,800
My auntie said your father thought
we were passionate about playing tennis,

516
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,600
so he wanted to guide us.

Where is your father?
