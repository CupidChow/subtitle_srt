00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,000
to train their endurance and agility.

170
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,920
Chi Dayong and I will be a pair
to improve on his Moon-volley.

171
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,680
Lu Xia will be with Xinglong.

172
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,880
He has to learn more about dealing
with stronger players.

173
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,920
Xinglong has to enhance his ball control.

174
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,360
Zhuo Zhi will be with Baiyang.

175
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,240
Let them practice on their own
starting next week.

176
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,560
[Coach Qi] This will also be
a test for them.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,800
-[man 1] Good job!
-I will pay closer attention

178
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,480
to Tang Jiale and Qiao Chen's performance
when I get back.

179
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
[dramatic music]

180
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,960
[breathes heavily]

181
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,480
[Qiao Chen] Let's start training
if we can hit that can.

182
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Huh?

183
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
[Tang Jiale] It's too far.

184
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,640
How can we hit that can?

185
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,040
[chuckles]

186
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,640
[bottle clanks]

187
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,960
No way.

188
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,400
Ah.

189
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,520
[sighs]

190
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,440
I think we will be
the champions this year.

191
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
-Why?
-Think about it.

192
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,000
We beat Yu Feng,
and Yu Feng beat Xing Yao.

193
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
It is very important
that we defeat Xing Yao.

194
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Right.

195
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,200
You are so smart. Why didn't I realize it?

196
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,520
Now, there is no doubt
that we can beat Xing Yao.

197
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,560
[Qiao Chen] I can't wait.

198
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,160
What terrible weather.
I'm almost getting a heatstroke.

199
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,400
Right. We can practice swinging the racket
at home where we have air conditioners.

200
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,280
At least we can be spared from the heat.

201
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,840
I can swing the racket several more times.

202
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,800
Okay, let me try.

203
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,240
[grunts]

204
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,160
Did I just hit it too?

205
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,640
No, I guess.

206
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,400
[both chuckle]

207
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,400
-Definitely not. We made a mistake.
-Right.

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,440
-Have some cookies.
-Let me have one.

209
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,160
[Tang Jiale groans]

210
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,120
-[Tang Jiale] Mm.
-[Qiao Chen sighs]

211
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
[lively music]

212
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,040
[grunts]

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,520
Our appointment was at 10:30, right?

214
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,920
Hey, I got up too early.

215
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,560
Then I came to warm up
since I had nothing to do.

216
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
How long have you been here?

217
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,320
Less than two hours.

218
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
Tell me if you show up early next time,
I'll warm up with you.

219
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Never mind.

220
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,960
[panting]

221
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,120
[Baiyang] It's Saturday today.
We can use the court until dark.

222
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,520
[panting]

223
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,600
You have made progress.

224
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,080
Your average velocity of advancing
to the net increased by 0.36 seconds.

225
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,960
Hopefully, you will soon reach
your training goal.

226
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,400
There were obstructions
that I found hard to break through.

227
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,720
But I can always make great progress
according to your data.

228
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
The data never goes wrong.

229
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,120
That's it for today.

230
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,280
Yan, what are my chances
of beating Xing Yao?

231
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,160
I have to calculate yours
together with Jiale's.

232
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,240
He has to improve his physical strength.

233
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,120
As for you,
I will focus on your Moon-volley 2.0.

234
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Will the analysis be affected

235
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,760
if I'm in a bad state?

236
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,200
Of course.

237
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,320
The circumstances alter the results.

238
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,560
I was just asking.

239
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,760
Let's continue.

240
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,600
[panting]

241
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,800
Lu Xia, let's take a break.

242
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,520
Thanks.

243
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,520
You aren't as good as before.

244
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
[dramatic music]

245
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,400
Lu Xia.

246
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,920
I've admired you all this time.

247
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,000
You "admire" me?

248
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
You love playing tennis,

249
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,720
and you can do tennis-related stuff.

250
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're very talented.

251
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,319
You are just like Ya Jiuxin in some way.

252
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,240
You both like pursuing what you love.

253
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,040
I believe he will be...

254
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,880
a top-class professional player
if he doesn't give up on tennis.

255
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,440
That's something I can't achieve.

256
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,760
But I'm kind of blessed now.

257
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,840
As a high school student,
I already have two favorite things.

258
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,760
One is roasting goose,

259
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,320
the other one is playing tennis.

260
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,520
But gradually I found that...

261
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,840
I can't make them the priorities
of my life.

262
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,120
You do them both well.

263
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,560
[scoffs]

264
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Not at all.

265
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,800
Zhuo Zhi and I never won a doubles game.

266
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
[He Xinglong] Everyone knows
how strong Zhuo Zhi is.

267
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,240
He is a genius.

268
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,240
It is my fault that we lost.

269
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,360
You also said
that I am not as good as before.

270
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
I think you are good.

271
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
[He Xinglong chuckles]

272
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,760
My father always tells me
to focus on training.

273
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
[He Xinglong] He says it's not that busy
in the restaurant,

274
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,960
and he can do it on his own.

275
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,520
But I can often smell the medicine...

276
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
when I get back home.

277
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,040
Medicine?

278
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,040
He has a bad back.

279
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
A bad back.

280
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,680
[line beeps]

281
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,040
Hello, Jiale.

282
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,080
Yan Zhiming set
a new training goal for me.

283
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,480
This will increase our chances of winning
if I can make it.

284
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
How about your training?

285
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,200
Is it good?

286
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,000
[Tang Jiale] It's fine. Don't worry.

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,520
Quick, hang up. Cover me in the middle.

288
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,120
Chi, I have to go. I'll talk to you later.

289
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,960
-[line beeps]
-Uh...

290
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,360
[Zhuo Zhi] Take a break.
It's been three hours.

291
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,240
[panting]

292
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,680
-Zhuo Zhi.
-Hm?

293
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,400
I'll buy some drinks. What would you like?

294
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,280
-Something unsweetened.
-Fine.

295
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,320
-You are--
-I'm going to a faraway store.

296
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,920
So that I can also do some endurance
and weight training.

297
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,520
Don't worry. It won't take too long.

298
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
[soft chuckle]

299
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,960
[cell phone chiming]

300
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,680
Siyang.

301
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,080
What are you thinking?

302
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,520
[Zhuo Zhing] Playing until dark
on the first day.

303
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,160
You know that's not the best way for me.

304
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,320
[Siyang] What about it?

305
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,760
Nothing, it's fine.

306
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,680
I hope you can be at least half
as enthusiastic as Baiyang.

307
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,920
Am I not good enough for you?

308
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,200
No.

309
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,240
[Coach Qi] Siyang, it's your turn.

310
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,880
You are fine, right?

311
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,280
It's nothing. I have to hang up.

312
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,040
[line beeping]

313
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,000
Does it hurt?

314
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,160
It's all right.

315
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,120
Doctor, how is he? Is it bad?

316
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,760
Judging from his current situation,
it's not that bad yet.

317
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,200
But if you continue using your left arm,

318
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,920
you will hardly be able to
pick up balls in the future.

319
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,360
[doctor] Your recovery is slower
than expected.

320
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,800
If you continue
this high-intensity practice,

321
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,240
the outcome...

322
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,720
Anyway, stop any practice
involving your left arm.

323
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,600
If we do the surgery now,
can it recover right away?

324
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,960
If we do the surgery,
at least half a year is needed to recover.

325
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,040
[doctor] Surgery isn't an option.

326
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
-But if--
-[nurse] Doctor, we have an emergency.

327
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,760
[breathes deeply]

328
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Go check into the hospital
and start the rehabilitation therapy.

329
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,960
You are still young, kid.

330
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,200
Your rehabilitation won't take long.

331
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,000
Mm.

332
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,320
If you want to play in the future,
listen to your doctor.

333
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,880
The future of my left arm is unknown.

334
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,640
Whether I am able
to play or not remains unknown.

335
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,840
But I may regret it if I can't be there
in the competition.

336
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,240
You don't want to have regrets.

337
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,320
I know the High School League
is important for you.

338
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,640
It's your chance to expand your horizons.

339
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,600
Most national athletes start
from the High School League.

340
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,880
However, it's your arm.

341
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,640
I don't want to leave the club.

342
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,040
Then...

343
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,240
try using your right arm.

344
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,160
I will make a training plan just for you.

345
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,720
Practice with your right arm, okay?

346
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,440
[soft chuckle]

347
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,760
Coach, please keep it a secret for me.

348
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,960
I will.

349
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,360
YU QING

350
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,160
Yan, I finished my training.

351
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,800
-I'll go, then.
-Wait.

352
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,200
New rules, anyone who's late for training
will sweep the court.

353
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,800
I heard about that.

354
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,760
But I will practice with Chi
outside school.

355
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,720
I'll go, then.

356
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,320
We have a court here.

357
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,760
No.

358
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,600
It's a secret training
of the Golden Partners.

359
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,160
I will go now.

360
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,600
No.

361
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,080
The principles matter.

362
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,120
Yan, please?

363
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,520
The principles matter.

364
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,840
Yan Zhiming.

365
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,880
I can see through you.

366
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,520
You are unique.

367
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,760
You are the smartest man
in the Yu Qing Tennis Club.

368
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,920
Would you take an IQ test with me?

369
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,040
-An IQ test? With you?
-If you win...

370
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,440
I can be a trial member
of your Yan-juice for life.

371
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Think about it. All over Yu Qing,
no one besides Zhuo Zhi would--

372
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,200
Let's begin.

373
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Huh?

374
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,080
Aren't you curious about the consequences
if you lose?

375
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,640
No need, I won't lose.

376
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,680
You are confident.

377
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
-Questions, please.
-Listen up.

378
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,320
What animal in the world
is the most unfit audience for symphonies?

379
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,840
Snakes, because snakes
don't have external ears.

380
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,720
No, it's puppies.

381
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,080
Because puppies will be thinking,
"When will the conductor throw the wand?"

382
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,600
-So I'll get going.
-Wait.

383
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,040
I have a different interpretation.

384
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,040
Please.

385
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
For conductors,
puppies are the best audience.

386
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,920
Why?

387
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,880
Because if the conductor
does not throw the wand,

388
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,200
the puppies will stay
and listen all the way.

389
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,800
Okay, start sweeping.

390
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,720
Bye.

391
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,360
[Yan Zhiming] At 7:30 a.m. every day,

392
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,640
Yan-juice will be delivered to your home.

393
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960

[groaning]

395
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,080
-Still awake, Dad?
-You're back?

396
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,440
I left some soup for you.

397
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,840
-Remember to drink it.
-Thanks, Dad. Sleep early.

398
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
Yes, I am going to rest now.

399
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,920
[groaning]

400
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,320

SWELLING AND PAIN RELIEF TINCTURE

[pop music playing]

404
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,000
Do we have medicinal oil?

405
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,480
What? You've been playing for a whole day.

406
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,400
-What kind of oil?
-Medicinal oil for back pain.

407
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Huh?

408
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,800
Are you hurt? Where?

409
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm not.

410
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,360
-Why would you need that?
-I need it for other things.

411
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,880
That's weird. Wait here.

412
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,440
This is all we have.

413
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,040
Not so fast.

414
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,200
-Tell me, who is it?
-A friend's family.

415
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,000
A friend's family?
Are you so friendly with each other?

416
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Boyfriend or girlfriend?

417
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,480
It's for my teammate's father.

418
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,440
Team...

419
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
Brat, you don't even care
about your old man.

420
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,120
You care more
about your teammate's father.

421
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,040
You...

422
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,120
[sighs]

423
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,000
COURT P6

424
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
Specially made Space Grey Yan-juice.

425
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,440
Yan, that's not what we agreed on.

426
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,360
As I said, if you fail to achieve
your training goal,

427
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
you'll have to be punished.

428
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,080
Why is it always me?

429
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,560
You can't make me drink it
just because I'm nice.

430
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,320
[Tang Jiale]
I object to this horrible punishment

431
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,800
on behalf of everyone.

432
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,720
[panting]

433
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,080
Sorry, I didn't finish
your specially-made training plan.

434
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,480
Are you busy with your family lately?

435
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,240
I can change your training plan.

436
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,000
It's okay. I will figure it out.

437
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,600
[gasps]

438
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
[Dayong] During the group training,

439
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Baiyang's pair completed their training.

440
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,320
Yan and I also finished our training.

441
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,240
Look, he wore his jacket inside-out.

442
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,360
But other pairs didn't finish
their training.

443
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,040
[Dayong] The captain
and the coach are absent,

444
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,240
but we must act as if they're still here.

445
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,280
No slacking off.

446
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,600
No, we have to tell him.

447
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,160
It's hilarious.

448
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
[laughing]

449
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,880
-Tang Jiale!
-[gasps]

450
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,720
What? Why did you use my full name?

451
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,800
Aren't you listening to me?

452
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,640
Chi Dayong, your jacket is inside-out.

453
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Come on, let me help you.

454
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,840
[grunts]

455
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
[gasps]

456
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Sorry. Are you okay?

457
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,880
You pushed me!

458
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Let's call it a day.

459
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,760
Dismissed.

460
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,760
Chi Dayong, I was just kidding,
why were you so serious?

461
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,440
Are you okay?

462
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,480
I know what you are going to say.

463
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,680
Yan Zhiming has told me
that I have weak stamina.

464
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,560
But you should know
that it takes time to overcome it.

465
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,680
It worries me too.

466
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,040
You shouldn't have pushed me.

467
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,760
[Dayong] Okay, my apologies.

468
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,200
But you shouldn't act like that.

469
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,920
Wait.

470
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,400
-What? I'm going to the toilet.
-[shushes]

471
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,520
The captain and the coach are not here.

472
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,440
It is my responsibility
to oversee the training,

473
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,320
and keep you in good form.

474
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,360
[Dayong] So we can win the match.

475
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,120
[Tang Jiale] We have been working hard.

476
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,960
We've won the Municipal Championship.

477
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,440
What more do you want?

478
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,360
Can't you give me some time?

479
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,600
Do you remember
what we promised last year?

480
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,320
We will beat Xing Yao on the court.

481
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,520
Although we lost to Guo Zi.

482
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,640
Chi Dayong, what's your point?

483
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,920
We lost to Guo Zi, and you blame me?

484
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,040
You need to train.

485
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,960
I don't want to follow
your orders anymore!

486
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,440
Ah!

487
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,760
Chi, Jiale.

488
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,800
Uh, you're still here?

489
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,240
Okay, come to my place
and have some roast goose.

490
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,440
[He Xinglong] Have a nice meal.
You won't be tired after that.

491
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,000
I want to go too.

492
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,240
Yes, let's go together.

493
