[somber music]

We were just joking.

-You don't need to--
-Since we agreed to it,

225
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,680
we must do it.

226
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,040
Zhuo Zhi didn't lose.
He doesn't need to take it off.

227
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,360
We lost as a team.

228
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,520
We have to accept the fact that we lost.

Your uniforms stink.

234
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,840
Are you going to let Xingzi wash them?

235
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,440
Also, Lu Xia didn't play for the match.
It's hard for you to accept the defeat.

236
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,400
I can't change the result even if I won.

237
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,760
Everyone, do 50 laps each.

238
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
I will see you off.

239
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,400
Mm-hm.

240
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,360
The stunt you used just now was great.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
I think we are in good condition today.

242
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,400
-Yes, Let's buy a drink there.
-[Desen] Okay.

243
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,360
-[Kefei] What drink do you want?
-[Desen] Coke.

244
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,840
-Thank you.
-Forget it.

245
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,680
It was hard work putting on a show.

246
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,480
Nevertheless,

247
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,080
since we have accepted this,

248
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,880
like I said,

249
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,520
I will not return it so easily.

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,840
Okay.

251
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,800
We will win it back by our strength.

252
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,680
I will talk to Mr. Qi
about the training between two schools.

253
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,080
-See you then.
-[Ziping] Mm-hm.

254
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,360
[Siyang] I did expect them to be
in a bad condition,

255
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,400
but I didn't expect them to lose so much.

256
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Everyone, gather around.

257
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,120
From what I remember,

258
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,680
this isn't the first time
you lost recently.

259
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,080
Losing is not a frightening thing.

260
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,400
What's terrifying is
that we can't learn the lesson from it.

261
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Recently, the coach and I
have not been around.

262
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,640
Many things are going on now.

263
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,040
But I hope you can remember

264
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,000
why you insisted on training every day and
participating in a competition back then.

265
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,320
As the top players of Yu Qing,

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,080
you should take pride

267
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,880
and be responsible

268
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,640
instead of showing off.

269
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,120
It is my dream to lead us
to the national league.

270
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,720
But I can't do that on my own.

271
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,640
[Siyang] I don't want to
have to force anyone either.

272
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,119
You can make your own choices.

273
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,839
But when you make the choice,

274
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,520
I hope you can be responsible
for making such a choice.

275
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,599
The future matches will be even fiercer.

276
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,200
You should know

277
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,560
that you will lose for sure

278
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,640
if this condition continues.

279
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,760
If you don't understand what I'm saying,

280
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,000
you'd better give up right now.

281
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,400
I will give you a chance to choose.

282
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,720
Those who want to continue

283
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,840
can meet at the Qingniaotai Station
on the day after tomorrow.

284
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,720
The coach has arranged a training session
with Yu Feng outside school.

285
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,400
Those who don't want to continue

286
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,440
may give up right now.

287
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,800
That's all. You can go.

is for those brave enough to work hard.

Dad, I've mopped twice already.

It will be dirty again
when the guests arrive.

312
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,960
We'll be inspected tomorrow
for hygiene rating.

If we always clean this place like this,

314
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,040
we will get a better rating.

Can you use it as well as your left hand?

I'm not used to playing

Multiply that by 4, and we have 12 groups.

We're to train both in mornings
and afternoons.

Six groups in the morning.

Can we finish before lunch

We need to step up.

What's wrong with you?
I need to yell out to feel better.

If you can't hold on anymore,
you can rest somewhere else.

According to Baiyang's data,

the incremental plan today
is indeed too much.

537

[Yan Zhiming] I suggest that you give up
the 100 push-ups

or you won't be able to finish

You'll have to renew my data

If you yell like that,

it will make it hard for you
to catch your breath.

548
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,160
It will cost too much of your strength
too early,

549
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,200

is neither scientific nor efficient.

Why not try lifting more

It will definitely be more efficient
than your way.

You say I'm using my strength
the wrong and inefficient way.

I will succeed one day.

you can't win the match anyway,
