00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,040
Why did they go back
and take the key to the court?

338
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,440
Maybe they think they will
have a match with Xing Yao

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,080
so they want to practice together.

340
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
-[Qiao Chen] Oh.
-Then I will go and return the key.

341
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,480
Training?

342
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,240
Train at this time?

343
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,160
With Captain?

344
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,800
-Let's go training this afternoon.
-Lu Xia.

345
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,600
Can you keep a secret?

346
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,200
-Why?
-How about this?

347
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,360
You tell me a secret
and I will keep it for you.

348
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,720
I will tell you a secret
and you keep it for me.

349
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,680
No, I don't want to.

350
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,960
Hey.

351
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,520
I really can't bear it.

352
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,760
I am about to explode

353
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,280
if I can't find someone to talk to.

354
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,840
You can talk to Baiyang.

355
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
No.

356
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,240
The match with Xing Yao is about to start.

357
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
They are the main players,
can't be influenced.

358
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,960
Then you can find Huang Jing.

359
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,080
I am telling you

360
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,440
Captain's arm injury is serious.

361
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,160
He is not suitable to play with Ji Jingwu.

362
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
[ominous music]

363
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,880
[phone ringing]

364
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,720
Hello.

365
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,760
[man 1] Miss Qi.

366
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
Yes, sir.

367
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,320
[man 1] Oh. I have good news.

368
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,120
The application you sent for the
overseas learning chance has been relied.

369
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,440
What does it say?

370
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,200
[man 1] Mu Siyang has passed
the first check.

371
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,440
As soon as he pass the final review,

372
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,760
he can go abroad this month.

373
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,360
Zhuo Zhi, I have something
to discuss with you.

374
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,800
Did you play tennis with Captain

375
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,280
after the training yesterday?

376
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,080
[sighs]

377
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,000
Didn't I tell you not to tell others?

378
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,600
Zhuo Zhi, you know he hurt his arm,

379
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,240
why do you still play
with him at this time?

380
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,800
Did the captain win?

381
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,760
Why do you ask this?

382
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,320
If there is nothing wrong with his arm,
he definitely won't lose.

383
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,880
It is between Siyang and me.

384
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,120
I don't have to tell you.

385
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,680
As for the his injury,

386
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,440
you don't have to worry about it.

387
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,240
Really?

388
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,720
He will be playing for
the match with Xing Yao.

389
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,920
Great.

390
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,720
Zhuo Zhi, look at you.

391
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,200
Why not tell me earlier that he is okay?

392
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,560
-[Qiao Chen] I can't even eat these days.
-Okay, I am going.

393
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,720
Eh. Lu Xia.

394
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,320
[sighs]

395
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,160
[Qiao Chen] Lu Xia, wait a minute.

396
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,920
-You mean--
-Think about it.

397
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,960
[Lu Xia] Zhuo Zhi said we don't have
to worry about it,

398
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,240
but he didn't say Captain's arm is okay.

399
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,040
[coins jangling]

400
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,360
[Qiao Chen] Captain's hand...

401
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,240
No.

402
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,400
I can't bear it.

403
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,880
This thing should be known by more people.

404
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,920
I think it is better not to tell them
considering the situation now.

405
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,120
MUNICH TENNIS COLLEGE

406
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,600
[Siyang] Coach.

407
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,240
I know what you are going to say.

408
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,480
[Coach Qi] Listen to me first.

409
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,320
The country has spent a lot of
money and energy

410
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,040
fostering the future tennis players.

411
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,840
The sports committee

412
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,200
has backup of your material.

413
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,280
The national tennis training center

414
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,520
has found the best doctors

415
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,040
to treat your arm

416
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,400
overseas.

417
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,640
This time, if you go,

418
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,600
your arm will completely recover.

419
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,920
Everyone has been expecting

420
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,080
the match for a year.

421
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,880
Your arm injury

422
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,440
cannot be delayed anymore.

423
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,600
Coach.

424
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,920
I know you and the sports committee
have done a lot for me.

425
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I am clear that

426
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
this opportunity is everyone's dream.

427
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,640
-But--
-But

428
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,080
you should be clear that

429
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
even if you are not here,

430
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,360
they will try their best to compete.

431
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,280
It is a promise between
team members and me

432
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
that we will enter
the national tournament together.

433
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,640
It is also my belief.

434
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
I don't want to give up like this.

435
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,360
Even if the price is you can't
play tennis anymore?

436
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,680
[exhales sharply]

437
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,360
Qiao Chen, you are unbelievable.

438
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,240
You didn't even tell us about the matter.

439
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,960
[Qiao Chen] We are about to have a match
with Xing Yao

440
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,960
I don't want to influence your mood.

441
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,520
[Dayong] Don't worry.

442
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,160
Let's confirm it with the coach first.

443
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,920
Last time when I accompanied Captain
for the further consultation--

444
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
What? You already knew a long time ago?

445
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,960
The doctor said it was okay at that time.

446
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
And Captain looks normal when training.

447
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
So...

448
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,760
[Tang Jiale] You may not tell them,

449
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,960
but how can you not tell me?

450
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,280
[sighs]

451
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,520
[Coach Qi] This is the material about
the German hospital.

452
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,840
You can have a look.

453
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,400
You are more aware than

454
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,440
anyone else about your injury.

455
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,200
-[sighs]
-[Coach Qi] The most important thing now

456
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,680
is not about the promise you made.

457
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,240
It is whether you can

458
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,920
play in the future.

459
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
[somber music]

460
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
You all...

461
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,600
finished training?

462
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,920
Everyone knows about

463
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,360
Captain's arm injury.

464
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,280
Oh.

465
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,440
Is that so?

466
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,880
Not just like this.

467
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,080
[Qiao Chen] We wanted to confirm
with the coach.

468
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,520
But we heard the coach tell Captain that

469
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,320
the school wants him to train
and treat his hand abroad.

470
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,360
Isn't it captain's purpose

471
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,800
to lead Yu Qing to enter National League?

472
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,160
Everyone is clear about
Ji Jingwu's strength.

473
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,000
If captain plays with him

474
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
then his arm...

475
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,520
Even if the captain won't play

476
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,160
we are not bound to lose right?

477

YU QING XING YAO

478
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,720
If the captain is not here,

479
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,160
the chances that we defeat Xing Yao is...

480
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,680
[gasps]
What are you doing?

481
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,360
What do you expect to see?

482
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,760
If the captain is not here
and we can't defeat Xing Yao,

483
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,880
will you quit the match?

484
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,600
We can ask the captain

485
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,480
if we should play or not.

486
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,160
I agree.

487
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Why not ask Siyang?

488
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,600
After all,

489
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
none of us can decide his life for him.

490
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,360
Isn't it?

491
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,080
Captain, we just heard that
your left arm--

492
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,760
What is the punishment for being late
for training without a reason?

493
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Twenty laps.

494
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,480
But we heard that the school
wants you to go abroad--

495
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,760
Do you want to find excuses

496
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,280
to avoid punishment?

497
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,040
Okay.

498
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,600
We have already delayed the training.

499
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,320
As for the punishment,

500
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,560
we can carry it out after the training.

501
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,800

Last year, we stood here.

Till now.

546
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,840
we had been through a lot.

547
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,040
I can still remember the moment

when we lost last year.

549
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,240
But if I think carefully,

550
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,000
we are just one step

551
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,000
from the goal we set at that time.

552
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,960
We are about to have another
match with Xing Yao.

553
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,960
If we can take it,

554
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,640
we will be qualified for
the national league.

555

The goal we set

556
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,240
is never as close to us

557
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,040
as it is now.

558
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,400
Captain.

559
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,560
In this year,

560
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,440
we kept training and

561
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,520
experienced a lot
to finally come to this far.

562
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,520

than entering the national
league with you all.

Can you play the next competitions
with it?

Are you giving up tennis?

You can convince me.

572
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,760
can you convince everyone?

[Siyang] If I can't,

579
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
I will give up.

580
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,720
I will accept the result
and receive treatment.

581
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,520
And

582
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,120
I never thought of giving up.

583
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,160
Anyway,

584
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,280
we will enter
the national league together.

to keep the promise we have made

00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,960
to defeat Xing Yao before captain is on,

602

you didn't say a word.

Why?

604
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,240
You must have done the math

about the chances we can defeat Xing Yao

I have a new one. Here you are.

But I have tested all kinds of hand grip.

can best help me perform steadily
in statistics.

It wouldn't cost you anything
if you try the new one.

I still believe my data.

when we competed with Di Liu High School?

You said that

620
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,040
you will defeat the opponent
in your own way.

621
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,600
That is your tennis.

I am the same.

I don't want you to give up your
data-based tennis.

624
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,600
Just like I won't give up
my way of playing tennis

because of your words.

the words you said to me.

I depended on you too much

in the past.

637
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,160
It brought lots of pressure to you.

638
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,360
I don't blame it on you.

639
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,240
Of course, you can't blame it on me.

for the next competitions.

to my ideas?

Yes.

00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,600
In fact, Yue Yang in Xing Yao

is the same type of player like us.

[Tang Jiale] The only thing
is they will first...

[Dayong] The help I can offer Jiale
is less and less.

In fact, if I were not here,

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,840
once the player is...

671
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,360
[Xiangqian] Once the player is hurt,

672
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
it will influence the psychology.

673
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,800
Once it affects the psychology,

674
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,360
his gestures will be out of shape.

675
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,200
Once the gestures are out of shape,
he will fall behind in the scores.

676
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,840
ONE DAY TO GO BEFORE THE MATCH BETWEEN
YU QING AND XING YAO

677
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,800
[panting]

678
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,760
[grunts]

679
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,240
I know everyone has been
devoted in practicing

680
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,320
because we will have a battle
with Xing Yao tomorrow.

681
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,440
[Coach Qi] But this is not enough.

682
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,240
Before the match, we should

683
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,440
have a good rest
and prepare ourselves for it.

684
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,560
Then we will be able to try our best.

685
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,160
We must win

686
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,600
in tomorrow's match.

687
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,760
Understand?

688
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,120
-Yes!
-Yes!

689
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,160
Come on!

690
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,480
[all] Come on!

691
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,520
Come on!

692
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,960
Lu Xia.

693
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,840
[Huang Jing] Here you are.

694
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,440
Please replace me
to be the second substitute.

695
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,360
But you have been expecting to play.

696
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,880
Yes. But to be frank,

697
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,800
I want to be the substitute
in these clothes more than anyone.

698
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,160
I am excited just by seeing

699
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,200
how everyone is working hard
for the match.

700
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
However,

701
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,760
for the benefit of Yu Qing,

702
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,040
I know how far I am from the main players.

703
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,320
I still think that...

704
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,440
What?

705
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,480
The final chance

706
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,560
should be yours.

707
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,560
Even if you say so,

708
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,000
Captain won't agree.

709
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,360
[Siyang] What are you doing?

710
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,400
Captain.

711
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,800
I want to give my substitute
qualification to Lu Xia.

712
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,880
Why?

713
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,680
It is not because
I think the match is hard.

714
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,840
I am just afraid that...

715
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,760
I can play for Yu Qing at any time.

716
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,120
Then we shouldn't let Huang Jing down.

717
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
I am for it.

718
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
I am for it too.

719
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
I am for it.

720
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,960
[Yan Zhiming] Me too.

721
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,800
I will cheer for everyone as well.

722
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
[sighs]

723
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,600
The drink must be tasty.

724
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
[light music]

725
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,920
[light music continues]

726
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,040
[Huang Jing] He made me lose face
as soon as he came to our school.

727
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,320
So if I can get the evidence that
he is in a relationship,

728
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,800
the main player must be me.

729
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,160
Why are you so full of vigor today?

730
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,920
I think it is about time.

731
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,320
-[Huang Jing wails]
-[Xiuwen yells]

732
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,520
Qingniaotai. Our chance is coming.

733
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,560
[umpire 1] One! Two!

734
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,440

735

[light music]

736
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,920
[Huang Jing] We must be stronger.

737
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,280
Stronger.

738
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The stronger, the better.

739
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,800
[heavy sigh]

740
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,400
[Huang Jing grunts]

741
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,520
I am sincerely convinced.

742
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,680
[Huang Jing] Lu Xia.

743
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,000
You must defeat Xing Yao for me.
