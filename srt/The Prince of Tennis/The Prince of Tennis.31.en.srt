In this way,

183
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,680
Xinglong has two opponents,
Ji Jingwu and Hua Chonghong.

Xinglong plays an earthquake smash.

Good job, Xinglong!

201

[Yu Qing students] Come on, Yu Qing!

207
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,760
This skill makes arms bear a heavy load.

208
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,440
I am afraid it cannot be used frequently.

209
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,560
Somehow,

210
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,640
I'm getting a bad feeling.

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,840
Shi Tienan from Yu Feng
plays earthquake smash with a single arm.

212
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,080
But Xinglong uses both arms.

213
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
The advantage is easing
the pressure on the wrist.

214
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,240
However, it is far

215
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,840
from playing a real earthquake smash.

216
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,240
It is similar to collecting materials.

217
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,160
Xinglong is making progress.

Why can't you make any breakthrough?

You are just a dabbler.

It also has a higher velocity.

A normal guy cannot persist
so many rounds.

335
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Naive.

336
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,400
It is impossible to defeat Chonghong
with brute force.

I don't want to see it.

I still want to join the national league

Since you decided,

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,320
you should keep doing what you want to do.
Stick with it.

Hua Chonghong was the first to break.

371
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,800
Did the one from Yu Qing

take advantage of
Hua Chonghong's ability to imitate others?

[Liangliang] He made the opponent
play with a single arm.

374

[Jingwu] The result depends on which side
is unable to persist with a single arm.

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,040
Your opponent is skillful.

500
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,000
[umpire 3] Zhuo Zhi from Yu Qing
serves first.

501
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,240
I want to go back to sleep.

Wow, which kind of serve is it?

508
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,880
He may intend to take the opponent
by surprise.

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,880
My serve can disappear.

[rock music]

513
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,880
What a strange server?

514
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,720
How can it disappear without a trace?

515
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,520
He becomes serious as he enters the court.

516
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,120
Amazing! He is really good
at that technique.

517
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,360
No wonder he is the most handsome boy
in Yu Qing.

518
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Zhuo Zhi performs his skill
when the opponent is unprepared.

519
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,520
It is my first time to see
an underhand serve that disappears.

520
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,120
[chuckles]

521
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,480
Did you see that serve?

522
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,800
[gasps]
He is fabulous.

523
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,080
I told you that before.

524
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,720
Are you still...

525
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,960
dreaming?

00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,360
Ji Jingwu.

527
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,960
You are not joking. He is fabulous.

528
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,560
[Song Ci] He is amazing!

529
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,480
It is not easy for you.
You finally woke up.

530
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,320
They'll definitely have much
to talk about.

531
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,600
Jiale. Have you ever seen
this kind of serve?

532
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,240
I have not.

533
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,760
How can the ball disappear?

534
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,800
I thought it was just
a simple underhand serve.

535
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,240
-How can it--
-That is not an underhand serve.

536
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
That is a slice serve.

537
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,320
[Yan Zhiming] An ordinary slice serve

538
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,080
uses the forepart of the racket.
That's all.

539
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,120
But Zhuo Zhi spins the ball with his hand.

540
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,720
It changes the contact spot.

541
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,680
[gasps]

542
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,200
[Yan Zhiming] That is why

543
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
the ball accelerates itself
while reaching the opponent.

544
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,760
So the ball seems like it disappeared.

545
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,440
So that explains it.

546
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,800
[umpire 3] Zhuo Zhi from Yu Qing scores.
The score is 40-0.

Zhuo Zhi is amazing.

He is serious once he enters the court.

[whirrs, thwacks]

554
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,600
I should hit the ball back
before it disappears.

[grunts, gasps]

Can he win this game easily?

He aimed at a target before hitting.

596
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,880
He has a specific aim before hitting.

597
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,560
No matter the ball's position and angle,

598
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,320
Song Ci is able to handle it flexibly.

599
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,840
[Yan Zhiming] It seems that all balls

600
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
come directly to his racket.

601
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,840
Ah.

602
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,080
Really? So his skill
is the same as our captain.

603
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
[Yan Zhiming] Not really.
There are some differences.

604
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,400
The captain's skill depends on
the spinning of the ball.

605
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,200
Song Ci is different.

606
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,960
But the effects are the same.

607
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,800
His skill is similar to a foreign player,
John Patrick McEnroe, Jr.

608
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,160
Due to the amazing flexibility
of the wrist,

609
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,760
he could hit back the ball freely
at any position.

610
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,000
Moreover,

611
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,000
at the moment of receiving the ball...

612
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,920
[thwacks]

613
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,560
he could change the angle of the racket.

614
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,040
[Yu] I was defeated by Song Ci
with this skill.

615
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,680
Wonderful!

616
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,560
If I lost my service game,

617
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,160
the captain would punish me.

618
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,920
[Xing Yao students] Xing Yao will win!

619

Is this the gap between their quality?

625
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,680
He was strictly refrained at the baseline.
It makes him unable to serve-and-volley.

626
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,480
This is troublesome.
I can't serve-and-volley.

such an incredible player of the same age.

However...

Why is the ball flying so high?

Sending the ball so high

689
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,760
is an unusual fault for Zhuo Zhi.

What happened just now?

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,000
A surprise backhand spinning lob.

712
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,840
[Yan Zhiming] The sudden fall.

713
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,080
The most incredible part

714
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,360
is the moment when it hit the ground,

715
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,560
the spinning ball returns to the server.

716

Oh, I see.

717
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,280
So he takes advantage of the position
against the wind.

718
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,960
But did the slack wind help?

719
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,200
[Siyang] Yes.

720
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,160
The wind speed
is within his consideration.

721
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,240
When Zhuo Zhi is serious about the game,
he is really a formidable player.

Mm-hm.
