[Siyang] They haven't gotten along
since the first day of school.

169
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,400
[Baiyang] I swing more than you.

-I won't lose.
-I already won.

You're a loser.

[umpire] It's 2-1. Yu Qing is leading.

174
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,800
They're playing well.

175
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
Better than when we were training.

176
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,520
Because they're archrivals.

177
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,200
When they play,

178
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
they want to bring out their best.

[Qiao Chen] Different means to an end?

182
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,720
That's a low ball,
which Baiyang is weak at.

[grunts]

184
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,720

They've broken our pattern.

No, not yet.

190
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,200
Qiao Chen is great at lobs.

191
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,600
[Yue] However,
to score with a cross-corner,

192
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,320
they still have to get past Baiyang.

193
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,400
Finally, Snake-ball!

Hey, Baiyang.
Why didn't you do the Snake-ball?

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,200
Shut up.

199

Your left foot moves
before picking off a shot.

200
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,160
That obviously looks like
it's not going away.

201
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,600
It's obvious he wanted
to do the Snake-ball.

they've done thorough research.

205
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,960

I know that too.

206

But that makes it more interesting.

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,240
Seems like this match is like I expected.

208
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,200
It's a tug-of-war.

Usually, the more Jiale is attacked,

Instead of using
the optimal part of the racket,

he uses its tip to hit the ball.

-[Peng] I don't know.
-[Yu Qing students] Go, Yu Qing!

329
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,080
[Yue] This formation...

330
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,560
Jiale's on the centerline.
The flanks are exposed.

331
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,560
[Ze] Is it a strategy?

332
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,880
Something's up.

333
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,560
Send the ball to the side.

334
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,560
[grunts]

335
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,200
[Liang Tian] Oh, no,
it went the other way.

336
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,520
-[gasps]
-[Yu Qing students cheering]

337
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,600
Could that be...

338
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,840
The Australian Formation?

339
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,080
The score is 15-0.

340
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,320
-Go!
-Go!

341
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,320
The plan doesn't contain
everything you want to know.

342
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
[rock music]

343
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,040
No, Jiale, it's not like that.

344
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,640
This Australian thing you're talking about
is too difficult.

345
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,560
The Australian Formation.

346
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,680
[Yan Zhiming]
A versatile formation like this

347
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,440
requires the players to move in sync

348
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,920
for it to work well.

349
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,240
-I'll try my best to keep up.
-Not just you.

350
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,080
Jiale has to try his best
to understand you too.

351
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,320
This formation is the best one
in an actual match.

352
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,000
Jiale, who's in front,
intentionally leaves some space

353
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,240
for Dayong to rush forward for a hit.

354
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,720
Great teamwork.

355
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,200
[Yu Qing students] Go! Go! Go!

356
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,600
Go! Go! Go!

357
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,160
Go! Go! Go!

358
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,320
Go! Go! Go!

359
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,040
[Ze] Would it be on the left or right now?

360
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,240
In any case, they only run sideways.

361
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,200
[Yu Qing students] Go! Go! Go!

362
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
[Ze] They didn't move.

363
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,840
Huh?

364
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,920
[grunts]

365
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,640
[Ze] Damn it. Too weak.

366
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,640
[soft chuckle]

367
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,640
Mm.

368
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,880
[shouts]

369
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,600
[Ze] I was playedlike a fool.

370
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,320
This is a doubles formation
that allows more room for changes.

371
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,120
Guo Zi did not expect this from us.

372
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,280
[Yan Zhiming]
Naturally, they're at a loss.

373
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Then Dayong and Jiale moved side to side

374
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,760
to intensify it.

375
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,120
They're dominating the court.

376
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,720
[Ze] How?

377
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,200
Their teamworkis phenomenal.

378
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,080
How can we break this powerful formation?

379
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
Guan Yue did not warn us.

380
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
[Yue]
The Golden Partners' greatest strength

381
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,560
is that both Jiale and Dayong
can take the lead.

382
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,800
However, Jiale is physically weaker.

383
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,320
He has poor stamina.

384
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,840
So we have to destroy Jiale first.

385
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,640
Mm.

386
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,760
[Ze] If it was a singles match,
I would have defeated him long ago.

387
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,680
We wouldn't be in this situation.

388
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,600
Captain.

389
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,560
Are you done tying your shoelaces?

390
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,960
Why? What's the hurry?

391
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,840
I have a humble suggestion.

392
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
[Liang Tian] Should I share it?

393
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
Shut up. Don't.

394
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,640
No. For the sake of the team, I must.

395
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,840
Qiao Ze, this is a doubles match.

396
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,440
[Liang Tian] You have two opponents.

397
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,760
Rather than tying your shoelaces here,

398
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
we should be thinking about
how to work together.

399
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,280
[sighs]
I feel better after yelling.

400
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,520
Liang Tian, where are your manners?

401
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,120
Captain, they're using
the Australian Formation.

402
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,520
[Liang Tian] I learned about that
during my research.

403
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,360
Their weaknesses can't be covered
by fancy formations.

404
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,440
I'll lead for now.

405
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,040
[Ze] You're very observant.

406
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,120
Watch Chi Dayong.

407
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,360
And then?

408
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,120
Find his weaknesses and engage him.

409
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,360
[Ze] Just watch Chi Dayong

410
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,920
and bring us to a tie.

411
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,560
Leave the rest to me.

412
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,080
Okay.

413
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,600
[umpire] The match continues.

414
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,360
[exhales deeply]

415
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,480
-Is it on the left or right now?
-We still can't predict their next move.

416
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,480
[Liang Tian] From the previous two serves,

417
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,720
I noticed that Jiale moves sideways
when he serves

418
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,680
and Chi Dayong moves forward diagonally.

419
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,480
Got it!

420
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,600
[gasps]

421
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,920
[umpire] Out.

422
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,720
[Yu Qing students cheering]

423
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,360
Sorry, Captain.

424
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,280
I hit it too hard.

425
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,800
Chi Dayong.

426
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,720
I think...

427
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,240
he's on to something.

428
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,120
I didn't expect them
to have such hidden talents.

429
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,960
After all, a good story

430
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,160
is full of twists.

431
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
[Yue] In the team,

432
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,320
Liang Tian is an outsider.
He seldom trains with us.

433
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,360
No one pays attention to him,

434
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,720
-sometimes not even our players.
-[grunts]

435

-I'm the only one who knows
-[snickers]

436
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,360
that he's the rare researcher type.

437
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
He's knowledgeable

438
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,720
and knows a lot about strategies.

439
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,840
Hey, Liang Tian,

440
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,600
give them a lob.

441
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,000
Work with me.

442
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,040
-Yes, Captain.
-Mm.

443
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,600
Chi Dayong, this is the moment.

444
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
That's right.

445
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,200
It's showtime.

446
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,760

[students cheering]

450
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,400
How could they have hit that ball?

451
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,400
[scoffs]
We can't shake them.

452

[groans]

453
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,000
You have to pace yourselves.
Brute force isn't working.

454
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,880
They're something.

455
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,400
It's getting interesting.

456
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,960
Stop acting like it's nothing.

457
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,880
You're just as tired.

458
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,440
Just look at your sweat.

459
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,600
You train so hard,
but you're still so weak.

460
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,720
[coughs]

461
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,720
[sighs]

462
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,320
That's because you play badly.

463
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,520
If it wasn't for me,
we would have lost already.

464
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
Are you done?

465
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,760
Were you the only one on the court?

466
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,920
Enough, both of you.

467
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,720
Save your strength for the match.

468
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,120
Coach.

469
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm drained.

470
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Coach, I'm not.

471
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,240
-That's because you're not playing hard.
-What did you say? You snake--

472
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,400
Enough.

473
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,680
The opponents' skills and teamwork
are far better than ours.

474
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,400
Given this situation,

475
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,840
what's your plan?

476
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,360
Physical strength.

477
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,680
Mental strength.

478
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,160
Your chemistry is just...

479
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,640
[both] Non-existent.

480
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,320
Well, when it comes to hating each other,

481
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,000
you're on the same page.

482
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
So for the next match...

483
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,400
[both] We'll win.

484
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,280
[both scoff]

485
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
[playful music]

486
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,440
[Zecheng] Hey.

487
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,880
According to our plotting teammate,

488
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,800
and according to data analysis,

489
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,040
we will win with a score of 6-2.

490
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,400
So you're not allowed to score again.

491
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,160
Guan Yue's plan is scarily accurate.

492
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,720
Another prediction down.

493
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
I think the first doubles...

[laughs]

495
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,520
Mr. Wang, who runs a breakfast shop
next to my place once told me,

496
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,120
because he loves to sleep in,

497
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,800
his breakfast shop has to close down.

498
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,040
Who cares about that?

499
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
My point is...

500
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,000
Guan Yue's words are like Mr. Wang's.

501
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,400
They have nothing to do with us.

How can you compare Guan Yue's words
with Mr. Wang's?

505
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,960
[both] Shut up, Donald Duck.

The score is 6-5. Guo Zi is in the lead.

510
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,520
They're working better together now.

511
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,560
[Yan Zhiming] Guo Zi is fighting back.

512
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,120
Where are you going?

513
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,200
[Lu Xia] I'll get a drink.

514
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,960
Can the match go on like this?

515
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,800
[He Xinglong] Jiale, wipe yourself.

516
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,960
Thanks, Xinglong.

517
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,280
Jiale is physically drained.

518
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,600
Let him rest.

519
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,720
Recharging is not unexpected.

520
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,480
While Jiale is off the court,
I'll hold the fort.

Will this be too loud?

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,760
No. Mu, give it your all!

531
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,640
Yes, I will.

532

I've played percussion
for two years in my neighborhood.

Let go.

[umpire] Time is up.
Players, please return to the court.

Captain, let's strike
while the iron is hot.

542
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,040
Though Guan Yue predicted that we'll win
with a 7-6 score,

543
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,160
I won't let them score 6 points.

544
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
I want it to end with 7-5.

Jiale's strength was greatly drained

549
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
because of his opponent's tactic.

550

The afterimages?

[Zhuo Zhi] Winning by attacking
an opponent's weakness.

Is that how Guan Yue trained Zhuo Yu?

[Liang Tian] Though one player is down,
they're still not giving up.

00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,760
Their sportsmanship is admirable.

568
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,560
Precisely because of that,

569
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,360
I want to defeat you.

570
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,760
[Dayong] I have to keep going.

571

He's too close. It's a trap.

you won't recover in time.

just for the sake of recovery.

However, when the score is 6-6,

00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,200
with a score of 7-6.

657
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,760
The winner is Guo Zi High School.

658
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,320
It's really 7-6, just like you predicted.

659
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,600
Are you tired?

660
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Let's go and take a break.

661
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
[both] Mm-hm.

662
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,320
[Yue] Winning is great, of course.

663
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,120
But their Australian Formation

664
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,520
and Jiale's revival

665
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
are not part of the plan.

666
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,240
There shouldn't be any accidents
on the other side.

667
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,440
Look.

668
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,680
We had it all predicted.

669
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,360
[Zecheng] It's 7-6.

670
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Hey.

671
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,240
Just so you know,

672
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,360
tennis doesn't follow a script.

673
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,240
[scoffs]

674
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,680
Sorry.

675
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,000
It's all my fault that we've lost.

676
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,200
Don't say that.

677
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,240
Guo Zi's lineup is just too strong.

678
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,240
[Dayong] We've fallen into their trap.

679
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,560
No, I have poor stamina.

680
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,200
That's always been my weakness.

681
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,560
Jiale, don't blame yourself.

682
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,800
Drink some water.

683
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,440
-Thank you.
-It's okay, Jiale.

684
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,880
We haven't played yet.

685
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,120
Let's go.

686
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,920
Let's get some rest.

687
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
-Thank you.
-Mm.

688
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,680
Come on.

689
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,840
Come on.

690
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,600
Baiyang, do your best.

691
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,720
Mind your own business.

692
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,320
Guo Zi has requested a time-out.

693

[suspenseful music]

694
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,920
What? We're just getting our momentum!

695
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,040
What's your problem?

696
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,800
Apologies.

697
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,000
You sweated too much
and made the court wet and slippery.

698
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,520
[Yue] I'm clearing it up

699
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,360
before it affects
the outcome of the match.

700
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
You...

701
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,720
What a shame, Yan Zhiming.

702
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,760
I understand how you feel.
You know my scheme,

703
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,120
yet you can't react in time.

704
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,800
As of now, the results

705
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,360
are still within my expectations.

706
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,480
[Yue sighs]

707
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,880
[Yue] If you hadn't lost
in the heats in school,

708
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,280
we might have been able to compete here.

709
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,840
Compete in what?

710
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,400
-Advising the players?
-[chuckles]

711
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,360
My teammates need no advice.

712
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,560
Unauthorized personnel, off the court.

713
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,600
Okay.

714
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,680
This is the only time

715
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,840
you can be stubborn.

716
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,760
Hey.

717
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,920
Thank you.

718
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,480
Did we miss anything?

719
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,160
The match continues.

720
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,800
-Go!
-Go, Guo Zi!

721

-Champions!
-Go, Guo Zi!

722
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,880
They're still attacking our weaknesses.

723
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,160
To counter Qiao Chen's Vertical Smash,

724
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,200
I put in a lot of effort.

725
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,400
Jerk.

726
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,200
I told them not to hit the ball high.

727
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
The only person who can force
both of my players' hands

728
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
is Baiyang.

729
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,960
But...

730
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,840
[Yue] I've already trained the players
to counter Baiyang's Snake-ball.

731
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,880
It's a watertight plan.

[Yu Qing students cheering]

734

When you do a Snake-ball,
they will be ready to react.

735
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,000
It's like they've had special training.
