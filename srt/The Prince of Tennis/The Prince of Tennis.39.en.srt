Zhuo Zhi may have lost his eyesight.

What?

344
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,880
The ball hit him on the head.

345
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,080
It may have caused
a temporary visual impairment.

346
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,240
I don't think he can see clearly now.

347
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
He went too far.
How could the match continue?

348
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,360
The point here is whether
he can continue the match or not.

Why were you hiding your true strength?

Were you taking into account
those players who aren't as gifted as you?

before we can enter
the national tournament.

501
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,600
Come on, Lu Xia!

502
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,640
Ying, what's going on with you?

503
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,040
You seem different from your usual self.

504
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,320
We cheerleaders are part of Yu Qing.

505
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,920
[Ying] I have seen so many matches,

506
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,320
so I have also grown up.

507
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,200
Right. Both you and Lu Xia have grown up.

508
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,960
The captain is going to undergo
his surgery.

509
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,760
I'm sorry.

510
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,480
We can't blame it all on you.

511
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,600
Anyway,

512
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,600
if we don't focus on the match,

513
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,120
winning our third championship
is going to remain a dream.

514
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,200
I never thought Yu Qing

515
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,520
could be this strong.

516
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Don't worry.

517
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,200
Zilong never lets anything distract him

518
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,080
when he's on the court.

519
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,320
The only thing in his head now

520
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,080
is beating his opponent

521
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
for good.

522
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,680
I heard you are the best.

523
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,720
I hope you will not let me down.

524

[Zilong] I'll show you
how you will be defeated.

526
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,760
TIAN ZILONG FROM HAI GUANG
VS LU XIA FROM YU QING

527
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,440
Lu Xia is still fearless
even in this situation.

528
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,920
That is what Yu Qing should be like.

529
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,720
[Zilong] I will make you suffer.

[Lian] This Lu Xia...

What is it?

536
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,640
This is the state...

537
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,600
[Yuan Chi] Which is the same
as when he was playing against me.

538
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,520
Lu Xia is...

539
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,040
So this is Lu Xia's new style?

540
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,800
I would say

541
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,040
it's a new state rather than a new style.

[zaps]

It's none of your business.

Didn't you see that?
That was my Vertical Smash.

568
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,600
This boy is unexpectedly using
so many techniques.

569

Has he managed to master all those moves?

Just keep going like that.

It went so well. Maybe we can win.

This match has been way too easy.

586
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,960
Tian Zilong is the second-strongest player
in Hai Guang,

587
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,480
only behind Bai Shiting.

[Yan Zhiming] His style is to win at once.

Even if we look
at all the information I have,

590
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,400
he is definitely much stronger than this.

No.

592
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,480
I have seen Tian Zilong's matches.

593
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,280
He is much stronger than this.

594
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,960
He would not let his opponent win easily.

595

[tense music]

No.

It was too fast.

going to use that?

These are collectively called

This makes both his offense
and defense powerful.

He has beaten all his opponents
with these skills.

620

His style is to win at once.

00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,680
But it needs extraordinary abilities.

622

Once he starts attacking,

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,360
his opponent
will stop having the will to fight.

This boy is hard to deal with.

669

Compared to the time he played against me,

670
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,880
his state is more stable now.

671
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,080
He is indeed hard to deal with.

But he can't slow me down.

[Lu Xia] It disappeared again.

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,440
That's the real speed of fast as the wind.

689

It was three times faster than before.

No.

691

Lu Xia is at a disadvantage.

[Baiyang] How can Lu Xia fight back?

He has already used
all his strength in defense.

Lu Xia's playing style
isn't just about defending.
