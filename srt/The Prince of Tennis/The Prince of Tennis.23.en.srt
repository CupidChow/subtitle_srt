Siyang, get ready.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
I don't want to

170
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
see you knocked out before the final.

171
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
See you in the final.

172
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,280
[scoffs]

[tense music]

174
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,640
It seems you are very

175
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,160
confident this year.

176
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,560
Our goal this year
is to become the national champions.

177
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,160
The championship
will only belong to Xing Yao.

178
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,720
[Jingwu] What you should worry about

179
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,440
is how to compete with Hai Guang.

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,880
Yes. There is Hai Guang High School.

181
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,200
HAI GUANG HIGH SCHOOL

182
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Siyang.

183
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,760
Does Yu Qing have a way
to defeat Hai Guang?

184
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,800
[Liangliang] You don't need
to think about that.

185
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
In Yu Qing,

186
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,320
only Siyang can play tennis well.

187
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
[scoffs]

188
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,080
The opponent for Hai Guang

189
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,560
will just be Xing Yao.

190
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,320
You can save this after

191
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,640
you can defeat us.

192
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,960
Really?

193
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,920
Don't you have the same players

194
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,120
as last year?

195
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,520
[Jingwu] Sit here.

196
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,080
We had better compete with
Yu Qing and Yu Feng.

197
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,960
Don't mind them.

198
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,800
We are different from last year.

199
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,840
[Siyang] Let's go.

200
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,120
[camera shutter clicking]

201
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,840
Miss Sha, hello.

202
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,320
[Sha] Hello.

203
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,600
I will be reporting
the National Tennis League.

204
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,520
Mm-hmm.

205
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,760
I heard that you are the best player
in Hai Guang.

206
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,000
We are determined to win

207
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,880
our third championship.

208
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
But Yu Qing has an excellent
new player this year.

209
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,760
You should know that, right?

210
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,480
[Sha] Plus they have their captain Siyang.

211
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,360
They are full of strength now.

212
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,840
We don't need to try hard to defeat them.

213
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,800
Siyang is great as an individual player.

214
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,480
But as a team, Xing Yao is better.

215
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Xing Yao may cause more trouble for us.

216
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,160
Plus we also have

217
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,840
brilliant new members.

218
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
[action music]

[thwacking]

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,480
But Lu Xia did it

223
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
more naturally.

224
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,280
That is because he has played
with 38 people.

225
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,760
[exhales sharply]

226

[thwacking]

227
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Those are all old members of Hai Guang.

228
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,560
We invited our seniors
to come back and play.

229
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Yuan Chi can concentrate much better
than ordinary people.

230
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,520
[player 2] When I first met him,

231
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,000
I was confused

232
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,640
because ordinary people can hardly
concentrate fully for a long time.

233
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,560
He is gifted.
There is no other explanation for that.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,440
Does that mean he is better than you?

235
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,640
[scoffs]
You are kidding me.

236
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,360
[player 2] It will take him ten years
to be as good as I am.

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,360
[gasps]

238

[sighs deeply]

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,560
It is about time.

240
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,560
We should go and attend the draw.

241
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,840
I don't know which team Yu Qing
will play with.

242
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,160
You seem worried about them.

[Jingtian] Whoa!

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,800
Even Guo Zi High School is here
to attend the draw.

246
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,640
It seems the competition this year
is worth more expectation than last year.

247
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,560
There are so many teams here.

248
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,920
You don't have to look for him.

249
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880

and Xing Yao High School

were the winning teams last time,

You are so eager.

you go up the stage instead of me.

Do you want me to do the draw?

Yes.

282
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,120
Last year, you picked Xing Yao.

283
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,360
According to the conservation
laws of luck,

you won't pick the strong team again
this year.

285

So you should go up there.

Anyway, we'll face them sooner or later.

00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,480
Yan. Are we still far
from reaching your standard

667
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
according to the current statistics?

668
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,880
Jiale has improved his strength quickly.

669
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,560
He went beyond my expectation

670

and he has reached the standard.

671
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,160
But the percentage of you missing
the balls have increased

-Is it because you have been too tired?

No.

675
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,680
In fact, the main reason
for missing the balls

676
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,960
is that Jiale is much faster than before.

677
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,920
But if you don't move faster

678
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
when approaching the net,
it will influence

679
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
the coordination between you and Jiale.
