must defend the whole court.

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
If one can't score within five returns,

169
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,800
it's a loss by default.

170
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,600
The attacking players can only win

171
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,120
if they can score
within five balls, right?

172
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,320
Right.

173
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,040
So the defenders win

174
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
if they can successfully return
five shots.

175
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,080
Mm-hm.

176
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,240
Huh?

177
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,960
That sounds like fun.

178
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,760
If the ball touches the net
or falls in the wrong area,

179
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,120
the player loses immediately.

180
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,680
Mm-hm.

181
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
Losers have to...

182
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
drink this cup of Yan-juice.

183

That doesn't sound fun at all.

[Tang Jiale chuckles]

187
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,680
[Peng] Your aunt must be happy.

188
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,640
We have so many talented players now.

189
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,960
Even an ignored player like Xinglong

190
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,280
can change a lot in the game.

191
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
Baiyang, too.

192
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
He seems tough,

193
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,520
but he's reliable at the vital moment.

194
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,440
Half-court or all-court,
it makes no difference.

[Dayong] It's too bitter.

[Dayong groans]

224
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,080
[Coach Qi] The result of the
qualifying is here.

225
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,520
The passing schools are good.

226
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,520
But...

227
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,520
only four of them
can get in the next round.

228
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,720
Yu Feng will play against Xing Yao
before we do.

229
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,960
We have to beat our opponents
before meeting our greatest enemies.

230
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,320
Yes, we aim to win
the national championship.

231
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,640
[Coach Qi] All right, dismissed.

232

-Auntie.
-Yes.

233

We agreed to go at 2:00 tomorrow, right?

Oh.

I forgot about it.

236
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
[Coach Qi] I can't make it.

237
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,680
I have another appointment.

238
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,000
Ahh. I'll have to fix the racket
on my own?

239
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,880
But I don't know much
about fixing a tennis racket.

Okay. Can you accompany Ying
to have her racket fixed?

[Lu Xia] Let's play a game
when I come back.

Don't stay with me all the time, okay?

You can go out, make some friends
and walk your cat.

I'm not interested.

And after that?

Why? Doing your favorite things

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,480
Huh...

334
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,200
Get some rest.

335

[groans]

337
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
Mmm.

338
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,720
[sighs]

339
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,440
You practice every day
after working at the restaurant.

340
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,680
Mm-hm.

341
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,480
It's busy at the restaurant.

342
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,800
So I practice every second I can.

343
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,440
What's more, the match is coming up.

344
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,760
I want to practice more.

345
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,800
I don't want to be a burden.

346
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,440
Thank you for practicing with me.

347
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,960
I always practice alone.

348
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,480
I rarely feel this excited.

349
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,080
You can't do rallies when you're alone,
but you can if you play with others.

350
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
[chuckles]

351
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,840
And not just that.

352
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
I was practicing alone all the time.

353
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,280
I worked really hard
on some unique skills.

354
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
I felt good about myself.

355
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,160
Then I entered the club
and practiced with others.

356
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,800
[He Xinglong] I realized
those skills are useless.

357
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
[chuckles]

358
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,560
But they couldn't handle the strength
I was already used to.

359
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,400
[groans]

[grunts]

362
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,280
The coach's advice and the other players

363
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,520
made me a stronger player.

364
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,480
Otherwise, I would still be
practicing my unique skills here.

365
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,520
[chuckles]

366
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,760
Anyway, two is better than one.

367
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,560
We can help each other
and find each other's weaknesses.

368
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,920
I just...

369
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,240
want to play tennis with everyone.

370
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,440
So I always...

371
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,280
want to be on the court
and win the game for us.

372
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,120
For us?

Do you think playing with me is helpful?

376
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
Sure. I rarely play with strong players.

377
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,480
[gasps]

378
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,640
We can practice together
if you don't mind.

379
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,880
Great. I would like to ask...

380
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,440
-Uh-huh?
-why do you play tennis?

381
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,400
"Why"?

382
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,880
There's no reason. I just enjoy it.

383
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Enjoy it?

384
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,160
[stomach grumbles]

385
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
[He Xinglong] I'm sorry,
you didn't have your supper.

386
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,360
Don't mind it. Tennis comes first.

[He Xinglong] Try this.

What took you so long?

Lu Xia,

396
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,920
my father cooks better than me.

397
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,720
He teaches me how to cook.

398
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,360
Will you run a restaurant in the future?

399
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,760
[He Xinglong chuckles]
Take your time.

400
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,760
It was a small store when my father
took it over from my grandpa.

401
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,720
I saw him do all the work.

402
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,120
Gradually,

403
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,040
he developed that small store
into this big restaurant.

404
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,240
He named me after the restaurant.
[chuckles]

405
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,720
Do you admire your father?

406
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,040
Yes.

407
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,240
I'll be like him.
I'll be a wonderful cook.

408
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,800
You should do better than him.

409
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Mm-hm.

410
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,080
I will do better than my father, too.

Does the brat know his old man
is crying miserably for food?

413
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,400
Does your father also play tennis?

414
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,680
Yes, but he never plays with me seriously.

[soft chuckle]

416
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,360
You are lucky to have
someone to play with.

I really hope to beat him someday.

Buy me two crullers

and a cup of soy milk
with two spoonsful of sugar.

It's not like you.

Who? A boy or a girl?

We have to start with Lu Xiangqian

I understand, but you know,
he is quite stubborn.

not to develop a relationship.

Yes. I fix your auntie's rackets
and Lu Xiangqian's rackets too.

As well as Lu Xia's rackets.

I should take credit for them.

that you practiced a lot.

Hello.

You guys are not acting
the way Yu Qing students usually do.

Sir, don't worry.

Lu Xia won't become a bad student
on our watch.

Oh.

You just came back from abroad.

But I don't know much about you.

And it seems that you don't want to talk
about your father.

I can understand why you don't.
There must be a lot of pressure

when you want to surpass
your father's achievements.

Why do you suddenly talk about this?
