[woman 1] Hey, the one who's leading
the team is the captain.

No way.

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,600
They are the top players
in Yu Qing High School?

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,560
I saw them play last time. They are good.

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,280
That is singles.

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,400
If they play doubles...

54
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,800
You are right.

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,440
[man 2] They're a team from this school.

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,920
-Yu Hang is the top three in our city.
-[man 2] Is that true?

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,840
Why do you think our captain
isn't playing this time?

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,600
Is he saving some strength
for next season?

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,520
[Yan Zhiming] This is the final list
of competitors.

Our captain is not really playing?

It is understandable.

Look at this. This is something important.

Yes.

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
It exceeds my calculations
of winning chances.

65
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,960
I heard it is their own idea.

66

before the application.

It depends on their luck, hm?

[announcer] The rules are as follows.

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,840
There are five rounds altogether.

77
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,360
The side that wins will move on
to the next stage.

78

Besides, it is the first match
for Yu Qing.

79
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,840
So all five rounds should be completed,

80
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,880
whether the result comes out
ahead of time or not.

Lu Xia is lucky to become
a top player in Yu Qing,

even though his skills
are not good enough to play singles.

97

He is better off playing doubles.

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,760
Then we must practice more

99

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,920
Ying.

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,960
Peng Xiang.

165
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,600
[soft chuckle]

166
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,360
[Wu Quan] Do you really believe
a few days' practice

167
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,760
is enough for you to master doubles?

168
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
Doubles is not as simple as you may think.

169
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,120
Really? But we are geniuses...

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
[Qiao Chen] We learned it fast.

171
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
Lu Xia. Let's try it.

172
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,400
What are they going to try?

173
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,840
Maybe our Yu Qing

174
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
is going to have another golden partner.

175
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,280
[chuckles]

176
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,920
-You mean them?
-Yes.

177
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,000
[Tang Jiale] They are gold comedians.

178
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,200
What could they figure out
in such a few days?

179
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,200
[scoffs]
They are bluffing.

180
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,600
[Wu Quan chuckles]

181
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,000
Lu Xia, don't be soft-hearted.

182
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,520
Bear that in mind.

183
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
Let's choose the midcourt line.

184

-Hmm-Ha strategy. This is new.
-[Huang Jing] I can't cheer for him.

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,320
-It will make him proud.
-It is a new strategy.

It was impossible last time...

196
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
Well done, boy.

197

Ha!

-[grunts, gasps]

204

New doubles stars are rising.

205
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,960
This all depends on my powerful brain.

206
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,440
Turn off the music!

207
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,600
[Xiangqian] Hmm. Ha! Hmm. Ha!

208
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,720
Hmm. Ha!

209
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,600
[Qiao Chen] "Ha" means hit.
"Hmm" means quit.

210
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I have an idea.

211

[laughing]

212
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,200
I earned this score.

213
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
How sharp.

214
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,520
I didn't expect them to coordinate
with each other so well.

215
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,640
The midcourt line isn't working.

216
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,800
It seems like it has something to do
with what they're yelling.

217
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,320
[Wu Quan] Don't be nervous.

218
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
They will show their flaws later.

219
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,400
Hit the ball to the back
of the midfielder.

220
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,520
Yes.

Yes.

Lu Xia and Qiao Chen

237
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,960
have zero coordination
aside from the midcourt zone.

[Bu] They showed their flaws as expected.

246
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,040
[Wu Quan] In just a few days,

247
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,800
they just learned how to deal
with the balls that land in the middle.

[Ying sighs]

249

As expected, when they start playing,
they are the same as before.

250
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,160
It doesn't matter.
This is just the beginning.

don't always win doubles.

254
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,160
Both players approach the net.

That's right.

in the national league.

This is obviously a strategy for doubles.

It is no use to team up in a haste.

You have used around 50% of your strength
as much as the players do.

[Yan Zhiming] Have some energy drinks

All the ingredients are carefully
selected and tested.

It has a lot of nutrition.

Try it.

Is Xu Ziping your brother?

Wonderful!

301
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,040
Is there such a big difference
between singles and doubles?

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,040
This is the formation
of the basic doubles.

303
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,640
[Yan Zhiming] The shadowed areas
are the defending zones.

304
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,520
But now Lu Xia and Qiao Chen
are both expanding their defending zones.

305
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,640
If the zones get too big,

306
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,640
such a situation will appear.

307
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,440
[Yan Zhiming] Both of them
will run after the ball.

308
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,160
It is easy to expose your empty zones
and help the opponents score.

309
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,880
Shouldn't I hit that ball?

310
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,720
Please be clear.

311
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,920
The ball was from the frontcourt.

312
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,960
I suggest that you stop
hitting the balls so often.

313
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,320
What do you mean by that?

314
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,120
Now you blame it on me
because we are losing.

332
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,520
Is this how you play doubles?

333
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
And you still asked me
to allow you to play doubles?

We failed to coordinate with each other.

We have a clear mind, but a slow reaction.

336

You ruined every shot to hit the ball.

I haven't talked about your problems yet.

338
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,920
My suggestion is that

339
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,240
you must find a corner
on the court and stay put.

340

What do you mean by that?

341
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,560
Someone was so eager to show off
and hit almost every ball on the court.

342
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,760
Enough. Shut up both of you.

What are they doing?

396

to play doubles.

[Yan Zhiming] Dividing the court

can make the defending zones smaller.

In this case, they don't have to watch

491
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,840
[Mu] Lu Xia was great.

492
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,360
They actually won?

493
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,800
[sighs]
They only played doubles in the midcourt.

494
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
What on earth was their style?

495
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,520
Real men should play...

496
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,760
Tennis doubles.

497
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
Your way is not professional at all.

498
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,760
We told you we are geniuses.

499
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,160

If you want to play doubles,

-you're welcome at the tennis court.
-Thank you.

[groaning]

504
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,240
Do you want to piss me off?

505
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,840
You played doubles like that.

506
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,320
-What will people think of me as a coach?
-But we won.

507
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,960
Do you think just winning
the match is okay?

508
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,080
Auntie shouldn't do this.

509
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,960
They have won the match.

510
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,200
Why should they be punished?

511
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,680
If she really wants to punish them,

512
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,440
she shouldn't do it here.

519
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,960
I don't want to play doubles anymore.

520
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,640
Me neither.

521
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,240
[umpire 2] Now the match
of the first pair starts.

Did it take 15 minutes?

531
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,040
They really are
the golden partners of Yu Qing.

532
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,560
The last pair cannot represent
the level of doubles in Yu Qing.

[panting]

534
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,480
We represent the level.

[Yu Qing students] Yu Qing, come on!
Yu Qing, the winner!

[tense music]

It's okay. We lost the doubles,
but we still have singles.

about the racket.

as long as he's holding a racket.

[Peng] They have already won.

567
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,560
Why did the coach still punish them?

568
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,040
Plus, I think it was great.

569
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,800
There is nothing humiliating.

Why are they so angry?

574
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,400
[Ying] The coach punished them
by banning them from competitions.

575
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,320
No wonder they are so unhappy.

00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
But the coach
is not serious about it, right?

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,960
I will go and check.

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Uh, I think you shouldn't.

580
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,040
I think we should leave them alone.

How come there are shooting stars
in the daytime?

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,920
Are you suffering from an oxygen deficit?

I did.

[Qiao Chen] Is the match
on the other side over?

617
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,520
Which school will we compete with
next time?

618
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,520
It must be No. 40.

619
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,880
They came second
in the preliminary contest last year.

620
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,320
Uh, which school
are they faced with today?

621
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,360
Yu Feng High School.

622
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,280
Yu Feng?

623
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,440
The school of your junior high classmate.

624
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,000
Yu Feng was the school that got rejected
from the competition last time?

625
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
Yes.

626
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,840
Then it should be No. 40 High School.

627
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,760
Seems like the next match
will not be as easy.

628
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,240
[Xiangqian] Hello.

629
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,400
Hey. Why do you look upset?

630
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
[Xiangqian] Do you feel bad
about being a substitute?

631
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,680
But I remember you told me
you would play doubles today.

632
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,320
-Did you lose your match?
-No, I didn't.

633
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,920
Losing is only normal.

634
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,080
You were not born to play doubles.

635
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,800
You must have been beaten up hard
when you were on the court, right?

636
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,680
I didn't lose.

637
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,280
My son, losing is normal.
Don't take it seriously.

638
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,720
You just need more practice.

639
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,160
But don't forget to study as well.

640
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,400
Studying and playing tennis
should be perfectly balanced.

641
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,840
You shouldn't miss any of them.

642
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,840
Last year, Yu Feng left the competition
because of this?

643
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,160
[man 9] Yes.

644
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,320
The principal was willing
to accept interviews.

645
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
We got the news by ourselves.

646
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,160
I thought they were too weak
to participate in the match.

647
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,440
[man 9] This is our social news.

648
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,960
Later on, there were no more reports

649
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,880
because it had a bad influence on society.

650
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,040
This year their opponents
are from No. 40 High School.

651
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,840
I remember No. 40 won the second prize
in the district preliminary contest.

652
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,080
Did they lose it to Yu Feng?

653
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,080
[man 9] This is your news about
the Senior High School Tennis League.

654
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,160
What's the point of reporting the tennis
match of some senior high students?

655
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,080
Uh, then please tell me something
about the news last year.

656
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,800
Something about
Yu Feng High School, right?

657
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,600
[man 9] Okay.
[sighs]

658
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,400
I heard that a team member
had a big fight with the coach.

659
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,040
It caused their tennis club to dissolve
and quit the competition.

660
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,200
The one who caused these problems
is the captain of Yu Feng Tennis Club now,

661
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,440
Xu Ziping.

662
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,520
[Sha] Thank you.

663
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,720
[man 9] You are welcome.

664
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,440
[Sha] Yu Feng High School

665
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,920
turned out to be like this.

666
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,320
YU QING

667
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,600
[ticking]

668
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,080
[student 1] See you tomorrow.

669
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,720
-[student 2] Okay, bye.
-[student 1] Bye.

670
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
You should hit balls like this
when playing tennis.

671
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,440
XU ZIPING, YANJIANG
SIMA YIWU, SHI YINAN

672
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,480
[Yan Zhiming] Yu Feng became a black horse
and they defeated No. 40.

673
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,120
This is the material I worked on all day.

674
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,520
Please take a look, everyone.

675
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,440
Yu Feng was the team that couldn't enter
the competition last year.

676
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,840
[gasps]
Oh! I remember.

677
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Their coach had a really bad temper.

678
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,080
Last time in the restroom,
I heard their coach cursing people.

679
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,320
Mm.

680
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,080
But the Yu Feng Tennis Club
has just been formed recently.

681
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,080
So the background information
is not enough.

682
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
[Yan Zhiming] Now,
besides Captain Xu Ziping,

683
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,080
the other team members
are from the Grade 11.

684
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,840
The coach has changed too.

685
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,120
It is Xu Ziping who works
as the coach as well.

686
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,240
He is the spirit of the team.

687
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,720
I think...

688
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,800
this is also the reason
why No. 40 High School lost.

689
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,159
It sounds like it will be a tough match.

690
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,440
[sighs]

691
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,679
I hope you brace yourselves

692
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,679
before the announcement
of the competitors.

693
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,040
Don't look down on the opponents.

694
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,560
The competition of Lu Xia
and Qiao Chen yesterday

695
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,719
-was a lesson learned.
-But we won.

696
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Just shut up.

697
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,120
Now I will announce
the list of competitors.

698
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,159
The second doubles pair
are Zhuo Zhi and He Xinglong.

699
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,960
I hope you can get it done quickly.

700
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
The first doubles pair
is the golden partners.

701
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,560
Don't let me down.

702
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The third singles player is Baiyang.

703
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,639
The second singles player Lu Xia.

704
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,400
The first singles player is the Captain.

705
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,560
Congratulations, Lu Xia.
You are finally playing singles.

706
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,560
No problem.
They are far from a match for me.

707
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
[action music]

708
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:14,840
[Yu Qing students] Yu Qing, come on!

709
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,760
[grunts]

710
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,480
I heard about something.

711
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,480
Yu Feng just has some unknown players.

712
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,920
How could they compete with Yu Qing?

713
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,120
[scoffs]
Just a piece of cake.

714
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,680
We are sure to win with little effort.

715
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,160
Oh. That's right.

716
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,120
Lu Xia is sure to...

717
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,600
[ball thumping]

718
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
[foreboding music]

719
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Technically speaking,
our Yu Hang High School...

720
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,800
is okay.

721
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,600
Mu Siyang.

722
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
I am the captain of Yu Feng Tennis Club,
Xu Ziping.

723
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,600
XU ZIPING, YU FENG HIGH SCHOOL

724
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,560
Hello.

725
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,800
We will try our best for the competition.

726
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,200
SIMA YIWU, YU FENG HIGH SCHOOL

732

[ball thumping]

733
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,560
[chuckles]
He is the guy who never surrenders.

734
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,080
[Yan Zhiming] The doubles match
when he was a substitute

735
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,760
has already made Lu Xia irritated.

736
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,480
[Ziping] The one from Grade 10.

737
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,520
See you later in the court.

738
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,680
Okay.

739
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,400
Let's go.

740
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
You seem to be interested in that boy.

741
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,480
[ball thumping]

742
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,480
[Yan Zhiming] Don't forget.

743
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,440
You should take off your sandbags
before the match.

744
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,720
Our training

745
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,680
is finally paying off.

746
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
[Qiao Chen] Xing Zi.

747
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
How are you? Are you going to play today?

748
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,480
Of course, I am the third singles player.

749
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,640
Mmm.

750
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,160
[announcer] Now third singles player,
Zhang Baiyang,

751
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,720
from Yu Qing High School. Get ready.

752
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,840

[sighs]

754
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,640
Why? Have you changed your name
to Zhang Baiyang?

755
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,560
Uh, I forgot.
I am the second singles player.

756
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,880
[announcer] The second singles player,
Lu Xia. Please get ready.

757
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,720
[Xing Zi chuckles]

758
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,640
Continue your acting. Good luck.

759
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,600
Zhang Baiyang.
[grunts]

760
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,960
You aren't the substitute, are you?

761
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,800
How could that be possible?
I will play on the court today.

762
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Mm-hm.

763
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,000
Qiao Chen. Get ready.

764
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,480
As a substitute,
if anything happens all of a sudden...

765
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,680
-[snickers]
-Dachi...

766
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
[Qiao Chen sighs]

00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,480
-[laughs]
-[sighs]

768
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,280
Your feet haven't recovered yet, right?

769
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,760
-Uh, yes.
-Okay.

770
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,120
Then Huang Jing will be the substitute.

771
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,240
Get some rest.

772
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,200
Okay. Let's enter the court.

773
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
[comical music]

774
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,960
[Yan Zhiming] You have to be prepared
even if you are a substitute.

775
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,800
I think you will do well as a substitute.

776
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,560
-Come on, substitute.
-[Xing Zi snickers]

777
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
Hey. Hey!

778
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,680
You really are a substitute?

779
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,760
-[sighs]
-[bag thuds]

780

YU QING WILL WIN

782
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,560
[Peng] Let's sit here.

783
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,440
[man 10] There are just a few left.
Blow them and it is done.

784
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,680
[background chatter]

785
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,000
YU FENG HIGH SCHOOL, COME ON!

786
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,280
Qi Ying, today, our cheering squad
will make our first appearance.

787
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,440
We can't lose.

788
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,200
There are few people in the cheering squad
of Yu Feng High School.

789
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,640
Mm.

790
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,200
They left the competition last year.

791
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,480
I heard from my classmate that

792
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,600
the tennis club hasn't gained
much attention at Yu Feng High School.

793
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
[Ying] Hm.

794
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,520
However, this is just a chance for us
to showcase our strengths.

795
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Okay. Let's cheer for our team then.

796
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,720
Yes.

797
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,640
Even though I won't be playing this time,

798
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,120
Yu Qing is going to win anyway.

799
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,600
It depends on the two clubs' strengths.
Yu Feng will not surrender either.

800
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,120
Okay, just wait for my match next time.

801
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,760
Okay. Bye.

802
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,360
[sighs]

803
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,600
[umpire 5] Now He Xinglong, Zhuo Zhi,

804
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,800
Shi Tienan, Yanjiang.
Please enter the court.

805
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,280
[Zhuo Zhi scoffs]

806
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,000
Let's just be light-hearted.

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,360
[He Xinglong] Let's finish it quickly.

812
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,160
My father cooked roast goose for everyone.

813
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,880
-I'm looking forward to it.
-[chuckles]

[He Xinglong gasps]

817
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
-Good shot.
-Good shot.

818
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,040
[Yu Feng students] Come on, Yu Feng!

819
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,040
That Top Spin was full of power.

820
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,320
Seems like it wasn't because of luck
that they had beaten No. 40 High School.

821
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,800
[Ziping] I didn't expect Zhuo Zhi
to be the second doubles player.

822
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,640
I thought he would be paired with Yiwu.

823
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,880
Never mind.
It doesn't matter who we are against.

824
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,320
[Yiwu] We will win anyway.

825
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,640
-They are in good momentum as well.
-Yes.

826
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,520
[Yu Feng students] Come on, Yu Feng!

827
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,800
[Xing Zi giggles]

828
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,840
Huh? Why won't their captain
watch the match?

829
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,640
Maybe that means he is confident.

830
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,800
[scoffs]
Are you confident?

831
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,160

833
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,760
Are you the captain
of Yu Feng Tennis Club, Xu Ziping?

834
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,240
Who are you?

835
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,080
I'm a journalist
from Tennis Monthly.

836
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,080
My first name is Sha.

837
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,440
It is said that
Yu Feng Tennis Club had a fight.

838
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,800
Do you know anything about it?

839
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,640
Why have you changed so much?

840
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,960
You were in the northern league.

841
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,720
Why did you transfer
to Yu Feng High School?

[Yu Feng student 2 thuds, groans]

You seem to know a lot.

845
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,720
There are a lot of rumors about it.

846
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,560
People have different opinions
on this matter.

847
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,360
I would like to know it directly

848
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
from the person concerned.
