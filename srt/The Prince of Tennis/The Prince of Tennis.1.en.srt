And then come to the indoor stadium

508
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,320
to have basic training.

I'm not done with that boy.

-[pants]
-Hey.

516
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,600
[Huang Jing] You see that bag?

517
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,240
Is it Lu Xia's?

518
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,400
Huh?

519
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,400
[Dayong] Could we divide the players
into four groups?

520
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,400
The result of the school contest

521
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,760
will determine the main player
for the regional qualifier.

522
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,480
I'm afraid

523
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,200
it's a little delicate.

524
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

525
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,480
[Dayong] Eh?

526
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,160
Someone's here?

527
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,400
Coach, welcome back.

528
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,880
I was only gone for a year.

529
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,080
It's hard to get everything settled.

530
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,400
-Oh.
-Coach, why are you back?

531
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm not welcome?

532
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,840
She just finished studying abroad.

533
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,200
She's still our coach this semester.

534
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,760
Really? That's great!

535
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,880
I heard you talking about
the school contest.

536
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,120
Have you picked the candidates already?

540
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,680
I told you about a newcomer.

541
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
Have you met him?

542
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,600
You mean...

543
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,600
Nothing.

544
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,720
I just came back.

545
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,800
You know the team better than me.

546
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,200
It's up to our captain.

[grunts]

[Mu] Eh? Lu Xia, Lu Xia.

549
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,360
You're done running?
Come and swing the racket.

550
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,640
Swing it 100 times.

551

[Huang Jing] Kid.

552
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,560
You are really brave.

553
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,560
How dare you come without your racket?

554
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,760
Do you despise our swing practice?

555
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,000
I can play with you again

556
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,920
if you are so confident.

557
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,520
But you don't have a racket.

558
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,800
What should we do?

559
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,040
Here's a new one.

560
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,440
[Huang Jing sighs]

561
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,120
Victory is for those who are prepared.

562
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,160
Is this from the lounge?

563
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,920
Eh. This Huang Jing,

564
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,120
he's doing it again!

565
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,800
He's bullying the newcomer.

566
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,680
Shall we stop him?

567
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,000
No need.

568
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,200
The captain will handle him.

569
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,960
What? You don't have the balls?

570
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
There's a lot of useless

571
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,200
but self-righteous people.

572
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
[Mu] Eh. Lu Xia, Lu Xia,
does the racket still work?

573
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,120
What did he say? Is he mocking me?

574
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,080
Hey.

575
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,080
Shall we start?

I'm looking forward to it.

[tense music]

Come on.

581
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,880
I'll beat you for good.

582
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,800
[gasps]
It's Lu Xia.

583
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
I knew he would be here.

How can he play with such a racket?

589
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,960
He's bullying Lu Xia.

590
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,920
[Huang Jing] Hey.

591
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,560
You were so arrogant.

He can't control the direction
with this racket.

600
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,280
He can't play like this.

[sighs]

602
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,560
He won't be able to spin the ball
with this racket.

603
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,639
He won't be able to fight back.

Lu Xia can control its direction now.

609
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,760
[Huang Jing] Impossible.

610
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,000
His waist strength drives the ball.

611
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,280
That was pretty good.

612
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,400
It's still too slow.

613
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,160
Lu Xia, come on! Lu Xia, come on!

614

-Is she one of our cheerleaders?
-[Peng] Come on, Lu Xia!

She's Lu Xia's cheerleader.

-Yes!

Rackets make no difference to a genius.

623
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,280
He's fighting back.

-Xiuwen.
-Yes?

638
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,600
[Huang Jing] Let's practice
more on swinging.

639
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,560
[Xiuwen] Okay.

640
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,520
You said,

641
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,640
"Let's finish this game."

What do you think?

644
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,520
No one can break the rule.

645
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,680
All of them should run laps.

646
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,200
The main players too?

647
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,640
Sure.

648
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,080
We did a good job.

649
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,440
Our first priority
is to make Lu Xia popular.

650
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,840
Then Yu Qing Cheerleader Squad will rise.

651
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,480
I heard that Lu Xia played well

652
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,600
when he was abroad.

653
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,440
You know so much about him.

654
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
No.

655
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,800
My auntie told me so.

656
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,360
[Ying] I wonder if he can be
a main player.

657
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,880
But...

658
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,840
No freshman ever played in the qualifier.

00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,520
Hmm?

How is it going? Is it finished?

Don't disturb him.

He's cute.

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,400
[Peng] What book is he reading?

687
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,600
Peng, Ying, you are here.

-Hello.
-Hello.

00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
[Ying] I'll have this.

691
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,800
This?

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,640
-Mm-hmm.
-[sighs]

693
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,520
[Coach Qi] A birthday gift?

694
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,800
My birthday was three months ago.

695
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,040
[Ying] You just came back.

696
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,240
Is there anything I can help you with?

697
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,960
I heard that

698
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,760
-the qualifier is starting soon.
-So what?

699
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,800
I also heard that

700
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,080
the freshmen can't participate.

701
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,280
Would you like to make it clearer?

702
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,080
I think this rule is unfair.

703
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,120
Some players are freshmen,

704
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,240
but they are really good.

705
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,040
Isn't it a pity if they can't participate?

706
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,120
[exhales sharply]
You are right.

707
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,520
Auntie, you once said

708
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,160
that you always want
to have some excellent freshmen.

709
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,120
So we can adjust the players as required.

710
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,840
I can't make the decision on my own.

711
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,040
How about you ask for Siyang's advice?

[groans]

713
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,520
Okay. I'll talk to him.

Wait.

715
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,440
Where's my gift?

Hi, I'm Lu Xia's classmate.

I would like to

725
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,440
ask if you can let Lu Xia participate
in the school qualifier.
