is that he made use
of his shipbuilding skills

to make a kind of long tennis racket.

Is it against the rules?

104
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,800
The main point is that for a normal racket

105

the length should be 29 inches.

510
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,480
No return spin, this is not effective.

511
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,520
It does not work on the unspinning ball.

512
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,200
Swallows-return makes use of the topspin
and returns the ball

513
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,600
with a slice.

514
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,960
For the balls that are not spinning...

How did he strike it that way?

525
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,200
He used a Sliding Strike.

The ball turn spin,

that's how.

528
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,760
[Yan Zhiming] In this way,
he turned the ball into a spinning one.

529

He hit the ball with a slice.

[Mu] Even if the ball does not spin,
swallows-return is possible.

He likes to put pressure on himself.

677
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,600
He is enjoying the pressure
during the match.

He is not normal.

679

It's time for him to make a change.

DI LIU HIGH SCHOOL KUI JIAN'S MATCH RECORD

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,960
So many matches ended with seven to five.

He is countering his opponent's strength.

He is really strong.

But he is not winning by a big margin.

714
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,800
Baiyang must have mastered the snake-ball.

715

So, he should--

716
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,840
No, we shouldn't think that way.

717
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,240
According to Kui Jian's style,

718
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,960
if he pressures himself,

719
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,000
there is a possibility that he will win.

His level of concentration is remarkable.
