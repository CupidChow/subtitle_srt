It's a part of the tennis competition,

I heard that you scolded

The truth is...

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,200
[Ziping] I joined Yu Feng Tennis Team
as a transfer from Grade 11.

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,360
But I found out
that the team wasn't for me.

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,040
You said that

if we can defeat the senior team members,
we can be the top players.

Leave me alone.

62
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,360
If you want to be on the team,
follow the rules and pick up balls.

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,680
[Ziping] The ones with real strength
couldn't even play on the court.

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,280
I wanted to form my own team
with members from Grade 10.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,320
But we were pressured
by the senior students and the coach.

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,600
Grade 10 students only deserve
to pick up balls here.

67

You don't deserve to be the coach.

Although the principal pressured us a lot,

87
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
we are strong enough.

[Zhuo Zhi] The next point is important.

166
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,640
If we can earn this point,

167
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,840
it will be beneficial
for the following matches.

But you know your arm can't bear the load.

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,520
If you get hurt because of this,
you won't be able to play tennis anymore.

174

Don't use the stunt anymore.

There is no other way.

If we use this stunt,
we have to defeat them all.

Mm-hm.

181

they might get hurt.

[Yan Zhiming] Zhuo Zhi,
how will you deal with it?

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,640
[Zhuo Zhi] We can't lose this score.

196
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,800
[Tienan] Forget it, Zhuo Zhi.

197
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,680
You can never hit my Wave Ball.

The Wave Ball broke the racket.

Luckily, the racket broke.

How unlucky.

apart from the racket.

you should go to the hospital
to have it checked,

can coordinate with agile Jiale.

Why not adding one more ball?

330
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,320
It should be more interesting.

331
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,040
[both exhale sharply]

332
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,840
The show is just beginning.

333
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,880
[Baiyang] Let's meet at the court.

334

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,600
[gasps]

337
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,440
[thwacks, whooshes]

338
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,120
[umpire 1] This round is over.
Yu Qing wins.

339
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,960
[cheering]

340
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,480
Good.

341
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
[relieved sigh]

342
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
-Great!
-The golden partners are so wonderful.

343
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,640
Jiale is so handsome.

344
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,280
I think Dayong is more handsome.

345
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,720
Lu Xia is the most handsome one.

346
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,320
Hmm.

347
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,760
[giggles]

348
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,280
[both panting]

349
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,920
How was that, Coach? Did we do well?

350
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,440
Good. You coordinated very well.

351
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,480
You are indeed our golden partners.

352
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,600
Thank you, Coach.

353
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,400
[Tang Jiale chuckling]

354
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,720
[Tang Jiale] Yes!

355
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,360
[both] Sorry, Captain, we lost.

356
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,960
[exhales sharply]

357
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,240
[Ziping] You have already
played very well.

358
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,400
In the district preliminary contest,

359
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
you are the only ones who got two points

360
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
from the golden partners.

361
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,520
Work harder next time.

362
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,520
[both] Yes.

363
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,360
[Kefei] Thank you.

364
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,040
The captain is really sharp.

365
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,360
How do you feel about the event?

366
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,080
The Senior High Tennis League
is full of stories, right?

367
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,960
If someone can make team members
fully trust him,

368
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,120
then he is not just a captain,

369
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,080
but he is also a spiritual leader.

370
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,120
I think this is the secret reason

371
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,960
why Yu Feng is such a strong team.

372
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,000
[announcer] Now the third singles player,
please enter the court.

373
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,760
Please get ready.

374
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,200
He looks relaxed even though
he will compete with Baiyang.

375
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,360
This guy is listening to music

376
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,280
while moving to keep his body warm.

377
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
This is meant to stop his muscles
from cooling.

378
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,760
He is already on a war footing.

379
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,760
Hey, Baiyang. It is your turn.

380
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,920
Keep your voice down. I heard it.

381
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
[tense music]

382
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,920
Good luck.

383
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,680
Don't let Yu Qing down.

384
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,520
I don't need you to remind me.

385
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,200
[inhales sharply]

386
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
The third singles player, Shen Weiming,

387
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
and the second singles player, Sima Yiwu,

388
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,720
are said to be stronger
than the previous doubles players.

389
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,360
Xu Ziping himself is not ordinary either.

390
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,560
[breathes deeply]

391
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
[tense music]

392
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,360
I heard that you have a stunt
called Boomerang Snake.

393
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,840
Does it mean that the balls you hit
like to crawl on the floor?

394
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
The match is about to begin.
What are you doing?

395
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,080
You are here for revenge.

396
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,480
But you are swift at swinging.

397
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,720
Baiyang!

398
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,440
[scoffs]

399
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,240
Sorry.

400
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
[tense music]

401
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,320
Shen Weiming is a fast player.

402
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,840
So the shutter should be adjusted to...

403
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,000
[Sha] Look at me.

404
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,760

-[thwacks]
-[grunts]

406
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,080
[Weiming] I will approach the net
after I serve,

407
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,640
then I will finish you with a stroke.

408
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,960
[grunts]

409
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,920
The speed is so fast.

410
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,080
This guy is skillful.

411
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
He is good indeed.

412
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,040

[Yu Feng students cheering]

414
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,800
Try and catch up with me.

415
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,960
[Yu Feng students]
Come on, Yu Feng! Come on, Yu Feng!

416
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,120
Stop talking nonsense.

417
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,720
[both grunting]

418
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,480
[thwacks]

419
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,960
[Baiyang] Here's my chance.

420
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,280
BOOMERANG SNAKE

421
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,440
[thwacks]

422
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,640
He is already there.

423
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,760
[thuds]

424
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,600
[Baiyang] How could that be?

425
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,920
He is so fast.

426
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
[gasps]
Baiyang, be careful!

427
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,880
[Peng] The opponent is too fast.

428
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,200
These kinds of spinning balls with angles
should be fatal.

429
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
What a pity.

430
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,600
Baiyang's Boomerang Snake
was easily blocked by the opponent.

431
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,560
-We are sure to win.
-Yes.

432
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,600
It seems like you are confident
with your speed.

433
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,640
If you are unwilling to surrender,
you can try doing it again.

434
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720

-[thwacks]
-[grunts]

436

[Baiyang] I am even more energetic.

437
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,080
Boomerang Snake with a backhand.

438
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,280
Still too slow.

439
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,800
[grunts]

440
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,320

[gasps]

443
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,280
[Yan Zhiming]
Baiyang has been overpowered.

444
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,320
If it were somebody else,
he would be running from left to right.

445
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,200
-As a result, he would be exhausted.
-[panting]

446
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,800
However, I never paid any attention
to the speed of the Boomerang Snake.

447
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,720
[Baiyang scoffs]

448
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,400
[panting]

449
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,800
He knows the Boomerang Snake very well.

450
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,640
Shen Weiming is simply the invincible
opponent for Baiyang.

451
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,760
Yes.

452
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,480
If the Boomerang Snake is caught
by the opponent,

453
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,760
the opponent will hit the ball back
with the most cunning angle.

454
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,920
[Dayong] Boomerang Snake
is a double-edged sword.

455
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,600
[both panting]

456
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,240
He hurt his arm and not his leg.
[sighs]

457
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,040
I ran in vain.

458
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,560
How dare you say that?

459
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,280
I would have been there earlier.

460
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,080
[thwacks, whooshes]

[grunts]

462
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,720
[Baiyang] The trump card of speed?

463
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,040
Don't be funny.

[grunts]

465
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,000

look down on me.

[yells]
Baiyang, you are so great!

469
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,400
That was a brilliant around-the-net ball.

470
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
[Siyang] Baiyang.

471
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,880
He made the ball fly around the court.

472
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,000
How is that possible?

473
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
-[man 4] How did that happen?
-[man 5] I don't know.

[panting]

475
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,800
[Baiyang] I unconsciously hit
the Boomerang Snake.

476
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,120
It turned out to fly around the net?

477
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,920
Did you see the ball just now?

478
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,080
[Xiuwen] It is like a boomerang.

479
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,360
Is it the Boomerang Snake?

480
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,560
It requires high tennis techniques.

481
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,320
[Yan Zhiming] The ball goes into the court
from beside the net.

482
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,320
This is my first time
to see such a sharp stunt.

483
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,440
I will record this in detail.

He just happened
to hit the around-net ball.

503
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,320
Don't be afraid of him, Weiming.

[cheering]

512
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,040
Yu Feng is a really strong team.

513
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,280
Now the situation doesn't look so good.

514
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,160
Boomerang Snake is useless.

515
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,000
There are no new stunts to help.

516
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,440
If we can't make a breakthrough,

517
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,960
we may lose the match.

518

Come on. Get some rest.

Everything is favorable to you now.

If you keep doing this, I bet he won't win
in any of the following rounds.

No problem.

But the Boomerang Snake
he just did really surprised me.

526
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,320
-[Kefei] Mm.
-[Desen] Mm-hm.

527
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,760
Your speed is faster than usual.

[Ziping sighs]

529
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,320
But improving the speed
will waste more energy.

530
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,800
You will fall into their trap this way.

531
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,160
Captain, Weiming's condition is great.

532
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,760
-Yes.
-[Yanjiang] Yes.

533
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,760
I told you to be careful
of the Boomerang Snake

534
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,200
and control your speed.

535
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
Baiyang, what are you afraid of?

536
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,080
Is it useful to swing
your racket randomly?

537
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,440
[Coach Qi] Aren't you ashamed?

538

Coach.

539
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,520
Do you only have one stunt?

540
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,600
Don't you have other ways
to defeat your opponent?

You don't have to remind me.

Baiyang is not as lost as he was.

But the situation
is still unfavorable to him.

Baiyang won't surrender easily.

[Lu Xia] Of course, he won't.

You said you would get better

I can help you make a training plan.

It will definitely make your
Boomerang Snake more stable.

with the player from Grade 10.

Then I will win it. Just wait and see.

[Lu Xia] Deal.

661
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,200
I have a deal with someone
so I must defeat you.

Why are you here?

You can recognize me?

It is because of your hat.

Didn't you know?

This is the limited edition
of Hua Chenyu's products.

This is something only loyal fans can get.

I am not.

He's starting with a Twist Serve.

It is a powerful start.

It went for the face.

[umpire 3] It's 40-0.

710
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,080
Lu Xia has appeared fierce
since the beginning of the match.

711
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,720
He who strikes first gains an advantage.
Well done!

712
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,400
But the opponent isn't weak either.

713
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,760
Twist Serve.

He didn't even make an effort
in hitting Sima's return.

The game has just begun.

He has already won the first round
just by serving.

730
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,160
[Weiming] No wonder Yu Qing let him be
the second singles player.

-Hmm.
-[Yiwu] Thank you.

You are overqualified
for the second singles player.

to win the first round so quickly.

Are you going to give up?

the strength of Yu Feng.
