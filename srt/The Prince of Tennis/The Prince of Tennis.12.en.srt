That's right.

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,800
If it's a singles game,

There's another key reason,

which is that both of them
are hot-headed guys.

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,800
So?

168
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,600
[Guo Zi students] Go, Guo Zi, go!
Guo Zi is our champion!

169
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,640
Go, Guo Zi!

170
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
[Yu Qing students]
Go, Yu Qing, go! Go, Yu Qing, go!

171
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,760
Go, Yu Qing, go! Go, Yu Qing, go!

172
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
[panting]

173
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,040
Next time, be more selective.

174
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,920
Don't just help anyone.

175
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Who's playing now?

176
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,360
-Um...
-[Yan Zhiming] Lu Xia versus Zhuo Yu.

177
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,160
You're still here.

178
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
[students screaming]

179
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,720
[Yan Zhiming] Zhuo Yu, Zhuo Zhi's brother,

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,240
has faced left-handers 16 times.
His victory rate is 100 percent.

181
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,720
That's why he's known
as the "left-handed killer."

182
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,000
One can say that his style
is designed to defeat left-handers.

183
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,960
-[lady 1] Look, that's Zhuo Zhi's brother.
-[lady 2] So that's him...

184
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,280
[Yu] Everyone keeps talking
about Zhuo Zhi.

185
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm not Zhuo Zhi's brother.

186
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,240
Today, I will prove
that I am my own person.

187
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
I heard you're Zhuo Zhi's brother.

188
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm curious to find out who's better.

189
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,400
[groans]

190
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,520
The match begins now.

191
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,480
[Yan Zhiming] Normally,
compared to right-handers,

192
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,640
left-handers' hits and turns
are all reversed.

193
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,960
So, it's a problem for their opponents.

194
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,160
However, for Zhuo Zhi's brother,
even when playing against left-handers...

195
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,000
-[Guo Zi students cheering]
-...he has no issues with that.

196
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,520
Looks like Zhou Yu's half volley
has gotten worse.

197
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,840
-Half volley?
-Mm-hm.

198
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,760
A half volley is when

199
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,160
the player hits the ball before it reaches
its highest point.

200
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,800
These shots are fired relatively early,
so the opponent cannot react in time.

201
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,440
[Zhuo Zhi] That's the advantage.

202
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,520
Your brother is doing well.

203
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,400
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

204
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,680
[clamors]

205
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
[panting]

206
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
[rock music]

207
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,280
He switched to his left hand.

208
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,040
Looks like Lu Xia is getting serious.

209
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,240
Isn't Zhuo Yu the "left-handed killer"?

210
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
Why did he switch his hands?

211
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,360
He had no choice.

212
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,840
In order to play well,
he has to use his dominant hand.

213
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,400
He's powerful.

214
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,640
[Yue] But, when facing Zhuo Yu,
it's futile.

215
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,200
[Lu Xia groans]

216
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,680
[Guo Zi students cheering]

217
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,920
Whoa!

218
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,440
What was that?

219
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,360
SUPER HALF VOLLEY

220
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,120
[Yan Zhiming]
Smash right after the bounce.

221
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,240
This way, one can counter twists.

222
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,560
To counter Lu Xia's twist so easily...

223
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,120
This is the Super Half Volley.

224
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,440
[Yu] This kid wanted
to see my half volley,

225
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,320
so he served me a twist on purpose.

226
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Guan Yue was right.
This freshman is something.

227
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,760
Well done, Zhuo Yu.

228
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,680
[Yue] We can't let Lu Xia
get near the net.

229
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,160
His twist and close shots
are the most powerful.

230
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,800
Plus, he's a natural
at the single-foot movement.

231
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,520
He's not an easy opponent.

232
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,920
Just make sure he can't use his technique,

233
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,760
then you would win.

234
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,920
He's anxious too.

235
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
[Yue] After you defeat Lu Xia,

236
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,520
I will take over.

237
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,000
I will face your brother,
who you look up to,

238
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,760
and crush him.

239
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
He's trying to do an outward spin.

240
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,000
It's a risky maneuver.

241
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
[grunts]

242
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,760
[Yu] Come on! I can counter all that!

243
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,800
[pants]

244
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,000
After playing against me,
he has become faster.

245
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
[gasps]
Lu Xia is quite good.

246
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,800
He caught up with him so soon.

247
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,920
Compared to regionals,
he's even more focused.

248
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,760
We seldom see Zhuo Zhi so serious.

249
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,560
Zhuo Yu might have left Yu Qing,
but he has learned a lot in Guo Zi.

250
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,920
He is Zhuo Zhi's brother.

251
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,520
-He's a prodigy.
-[student 5] Wait.

252
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,160
Isn't this Zhuo Zhi's brother?

253
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,840
Where are you going?

254
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,040
An application form.

255
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,640
Do you even need to apply?
You're Zhuo Zhi's brother.

256
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,200
The brother of a prodigy!

257
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,200
-Exactly.
-You will get in because of Zhuo Zhi!

258
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,240
Enough!

259
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,800
We're not the same person.

260
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,280
[students grumble]

261
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
[Yu] No.

262
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,320
I can't admit defeat, not like this.

263
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Are you the brother of Zhuo Zhi?

264
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,680
[scoffs]
So, what if I am?

265
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,200
Sometimes, a nobody in a movie
becomes a superhero

266
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,120
in another movie.

267
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,240
[Yue] It all depends on the script.

268
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,080
As long as you're committed,

269
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,160
I promise you, I will make you great.

270
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,680
We will get everyone at the stadium
to remember your name.

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,200
Think about it.

272
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,080
[Yu] I want to be known for my skills.

273
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,640
I want to be known as Zhuo Yu,

274
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,560
and not Zhuo Zhi's brother.

275
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
[tense music]

276
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,120
CELESTIAL DRIVE

277
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
[Guo Zi students clamoring]

278
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,359
[Lu Xia] That is...

279
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,240
That is a driven shot that is as powerful
as a Twist Serve.

280
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,560
You used this technique after all.

281
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,920
This is the secret weapon
I prepared for Zhuo Yu.

282
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
[Yue] Well done!

283
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,599
[Guo Zi students clamoring]

284
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,480
Lu Xia.

285
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,480
Lu Xia, hang in there!

286
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,520
Hang in there!

287
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,360
First, the half volley,

288
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
to rattle the opponent.

289
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
[Yue] Followed by the Celestial Drive.

290
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,200
It was a foolproof double attack.

291
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,840
Let me see what else you've got.

292
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
[groans]

293
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,400
The Celestial Drive,

294
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
you should not overuse it.

295
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,520
You want your opponent
to give you easier shots.

296
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Is this all Yu Qing's got?

297
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,320
If you insist, you might get hurt
before facing Zhuo Zhi.

298
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,240
I mastered the Celestial Drive
in order to defeat my brother.

299
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,960
Even if my arm ended up paralyzed,
I would have no regrets.

300
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,400
Is defeating him your only goal?

301
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,440
Even if it means
you can't play tennis anymore?

302
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,320
Don't you have someone
you have to defeat no matter what?

303
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,880
Because I do.

304
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,640
[Lu Xia] There has to be a way.

305
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,840
[Siyang] Lu Xia.

306
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,680
What will you do after beating him?

307
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,000
What will you gain after that?

308
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,840
When you truly know
the reason you play tennis,

309
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,040
you'll have the ability
to overcome the obstacles.

310
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,800
You'll be stronger on the court.

311
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
[intense music]

312
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,360
Now!

313
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Lu Xia approaches the net.

314
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,760
He's approaching!

315
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
[umpire] Out!

316
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
[Yu] He played a half volley too.

317
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,440
I know how to do it now.

318
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,720
[Lu Xia] I have to bring the racket lower.

319
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
[chuckles]

320
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,760
Could Lu Xia be learning during a match?

321
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,640
[Yan Shiming] Would there be a surprise?

322
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
[Yu] To fire a half volley,

323
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,960
the racket and the ground
must be at a precise angle.

324
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,920
He can't possibly do it.

325
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,360
I've been pressing my attacks.

326
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,360
Why doesn't he look fazed at all?

327
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,760
A half volley isn't that easy to do.

Perhaps Lu Xia wasn't going
for a half volley?

He didn't slow down this time.

Lu Xia has improved.

338
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,720
That technique combines sliding, dashing,

339
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,360
and jumping with no pause.

340
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
It's impressive indeed.

Lu Xia is so awesome.

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,440
He turned the match around
and created a new technique!

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,320
This technique is called...

B Drive.

346
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,840
This match is so exciting.

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,680
You have much to improve on.

[Lu Xia] You just want to be
as good as your brother,

I will report to Guo Zi tomorrow.

Why?

I don't want to be known

During the regionals,

368
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,320
Lu Xia's left eye was hurt
by a broken racket.

369

That should have scarred him
psychologically.

Besides, it's a reflex to duck.

Why? Can't you do that?

372
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,560
Didn't part of your training focus
on targeting your opponent's left?

373
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
So, the reason you gave me
that training was so that--

374
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,680
Is it against the rules
to target your opponent's weakness?

It's time. Go.

If you fail today,

you'll always be known
as Zhuo Zhi's brother.
