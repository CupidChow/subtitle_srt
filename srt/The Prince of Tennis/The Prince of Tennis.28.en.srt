Don't you think you are being too noisy?

Can you stop making so much noise?

173
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,800
I can't even watch TV.

You're tired, right?

Did you call him?
Did you text him on WeChat?

187
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,680
I've been calling for some time,
but no one answered.

188
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
The court is big enough,

but why are you guys stuck
at the entrance?

190

Where on earth is Lu Xia?

-Xiao Sha.
-Yes?

Can you try to buy Lu Xia some time?

I'd like to interview you
for some editorial coverage.

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,160
An interview about what?

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,800
[stuttering]
That is...

200
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,400
Could you please simply

201
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,400
introduce the 20 years of history

202
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,480
of the Yu Qing Tennis Club in detail?

203

"Simply introduce in detail"?

"Twenty years of history"?

205
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
We will be

by the time you finish your introduction.

It's not easy to break strings like this.

-You must have made some improvement.
-Uh-huh.

Xiuwen,

234
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,880
have you ever read Lu Xiaofeng?

235
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,800
Yes, so what?

236
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,400
Nothing.

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,920
I'm just thinking.

238
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,880
At the decisive battle
between Ximen Chuixue and Ye Gucheng,

239
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160
if Ximen hadn't appeared,

240
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,840
Ye would have been extremely lonely.

You don't understand how I'm feeling now.

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,960
I know.

243
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,960
The only thing that is worse than death

244
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
is to be sentenced to death.

[comical music]

How many times do I have to tell you this?

I'm not afraid at all.

248
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,800
At this very moment,
if Lu Xia appeared all of a sudden here,

249
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,800
I'd be fully confident
about defeating him.

[Siyang] You don't have to.

According to our rules,

anyone who's late
to the school's qualifying competition

259

will be disqualified.

The qualifying competition

264
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,040
is to select the top players
to play against Xing Yao.

This is an opportunity
that everyone dreams of getting.

if you can't even arrive
at the court on time,

268
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,920
how can you say that you are qualified
for this competition?

I'll accept the result.

274
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,120
[Lu Xia] But I've decided

275
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,680
to fight with everyone
to the end no matter what.

276
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,760
This is what I long to do now.

277
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
[Siyang] Okay.

278
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,360
You're part of Yu Qing, no matter what.

Though you can't play in the match,

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,320
there's something else for you to work on.

281
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,320
All right, everyone else

282
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,120
can go back to the court
and continue with the match.

In fact...

It's for his own good.

I'm looking forward to that.

Let's try and see.

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
By the way,

remember to run 0.25 seconds

when approaching the net,

301
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,600
so that you can get

It seems that
Yan put him at a disadvantage.

It's not Qiao Chen
who isn't performing well.

It's because Yan has improved.

[Siyang] Over these two months
before the match,

315
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,240
Yan not only collected data
from our opponents to help us,

316
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,520
but he, in fact, collected our data, too.

This is the list of players
against Xing Yao.

325
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,040
Qiao Chen and Huang Jing

326

are on the bench list
to be number one and two.

You haven't fully recovered
from your injuries,

328
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,760
so I arranged an extra main player

according to the results
of the qualifying competition.

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
[Lian] Isn't this place quite familiar?

337
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
[gasps]

338
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Liu Lian?

339
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm not late, aren't I?

LIU LIAN
HAI GUANG HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER

[sighs]

342
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,320
Hmm. Exactly on time.

343
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,400
You already knew it was me, didn't you?

344
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,000
When I saw your ID,

345
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,600
"Pavlov's Dog,"

346
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,600
I was pretty sure that it was you.

347
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,320
I didn't expect

348
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,360
that the one interacting with me
would be you.

349
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,920
I tried to drop hints in different ways.

350
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,160
For example,

351
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
why I chose this café.

352
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,480
This was the park

353
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,160
where we played a match for the last time.

354
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,960
If I hadn't moved,

355
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,800
the competition between us

356
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,040
would have continued until now.

357
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
[light music]

V, GO DOWN FIGHTING

361
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,640
Do you remember these?

362
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,920
How could I not remember?

363
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,920
And this.

364
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,160
[Lian] In fact, I quite miss
the tennis court.

365
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,480
For this ball,
the odds of going right are 73.2%.

366
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,640
The angle is about 65 degrees.

367
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,360
-[thwacks]
-Wrong.

368
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,200
The odds should be 81.9%.

369
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,240
And I'll get one point with a drop shot.

370
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
5-4. I got one more point than you.

371
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,240
No, your calculation is wrong.

372
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,600
[chuckles]
Let's go.

373
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,480
[young Yan Zhiming sighs]

374
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,320
You can't calculate like this.

375
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,840
That should be normal distribution.

376
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,640
You see, that's 81.9.

377
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,080
It can't be.

378
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,000
-[chuckles]
-That should be binomial distribution.

379
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,960
You see, that's 73.2.

380
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
[light music]

381
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,800
Zhiming, why don't we stop here today?

382
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,080
Why?

383
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,600
The match isn't over.

384
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,120
Go home and do the math.

385
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,760
Let's continue the match next time.

386
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
We'll see who's the winner.

387
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,880
-The next time will be the decisive match.
-Right.

388
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,680
Right.

389
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,680
[sighs]

390
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,120
I can't believe we still have a chance

391
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,920
to come back to this tennis court.

392
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,160
Do you still remember

393
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,480
the unfinished match?

394
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,800
Seven years, two months, and fifteen days.

395
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
I can still remember it.

396
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,600
[sighs]

397
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,520
Hai Guang High School.

398
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,640
If we hadn't met today
and we both beat our opponents,

399
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,440
we would have met
in the provincial finals.

400
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,600
Let's keep our promise

401
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,120
to fulfill the unfinished match.

402
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,600
Is this what you're thinking?

403
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
[light music]

404
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,800
Of course.

405
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,520
[Young Lian] Don't forget
to keep your word.

406

[Qiao Chen] Xing Zi!

410
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,320
What are you doing here?

411
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,360
What a coincidence.

412
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,240
And why are you here?

413
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm thinking here.

414
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,040
"Thinking"?

415
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,240
People use brains to think.

416
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,120
I use my stomach.

The national tournament is coming up.

419
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,480
Why aren't you training?
Why are you staring blankly here?

420
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,200
[exhales sharply]

421
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,960
I lost
at the qualifying competition yesterday.

422
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,440
I can't play the match against Xing Yao.

423
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,320
Isn't your goal the national tournament?

424
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,440
You can't play this time,
but there's still next time.

425
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,040
I tried really hard this time.

426
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,680
But I didn't expect the others
to make so much progress.

427
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,280
Is it only because
the others made much progress?

428
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,600
Mm-hm.

429
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,200
No other reasons?

[sighs]

431
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,320
All right.

432
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,240
How about playing a match with me?

433
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,000
With you?

434
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,920
Mm-hm.

Is it kind of bullying?

438

Watch out. I'm going to serve.

[groans]

442
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,840
[Qiao Chen] It's surprising
that the slim Xing Zi

443
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,360
can hit such a powerful serve.

444
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,960
It seems that

445
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,800
I can't judge an opponent's shots
by their appearance.

446
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,920
If I make a wrong judgement,
I'll feel nervous.

447
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,040
In any situation,

448
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,440
being unobservant at any moment is fatal.

449
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,840
I should always treat my opponent
like a heavy rock.

450
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,560
I should always be keen
to face challenges.

[romantic music]

457

[Coach Qi] Do you know
that what you've done

458
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,520
is an irresponsible act for yourself?

459
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,000
[Siyang] I know.

460
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,440
The injury on your left arm
isn't fully recovered.

461
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,560
You disobeyed the medical order
and started training.

462
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,600
Do you want to permanently injure
your left arm and stop playing tennis?

is Lu Xia.

as a teacher,
I decided to give you a present.

YOU SHIXING

501
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,680
[Tang Jiale] Why does no one invite us
to a photoshoot for a magazine?

502
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,120
This person doesn't look like this.

503
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,320
-[Qiao Chen] That's right.
-The photo looks much better.

504
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,720
It's just like faking photos.

505
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,400
[Coach Qi] This isn't a fashion magazine.

506

-[Tang Jiale gasps]
-[all] Coach.

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,240
[Coach Qi] Have a seat.

[gasps]

509
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,680
Yue Yang and You Shixing

510
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,560
are always the first doubles players
of Xing Yao.

511
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,280
It's their version of golden partners.

-Mm-hm.
-You've already played against them,

513
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,240
so I won't talk about them much today.

514
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,200
Coach, only Dachi has played
a match against them

515
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,520
because we were split.

516
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,880
So, this year, is it....

CHI DAYONG, DOUBLES NUMBER ONE

518

Yes! Dachi, that's great.
[laughs]

519
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,720
What are you doing?
I'm not done. Why are you so excited?

520
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,080
Huh? Coach, it's because

521
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
the surname starting with "T" on our team

522
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,880
is mine, right?

523
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
So clever.

524
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,040

CHI DAYONG AND TANG JIALE,
DOUBLES NUMBER ONE

527
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,040
Coach, you really scared me.

528
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,720
Dachi, that's amazing.

529
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,440
We can finally play tennis together.

530
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,840
-[Tang Jiale laughs]
-[Dayong] Yes.

531

MU SIYANG, SINGLES NUMBER ONE
ZHOU ZHI, SINGLES NUMBER TWO

532
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,720
Why did you leave the third singles blank?

533
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,080
You, Baiyang, and Yan Zhiming.

534
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,560
In fact, you three are better
at playing singles.

535
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,360
I'm going to pick two out of you three

536
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,360
to form the best doubles for us.

537
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,480
But I haven't thought it through.

538
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,600
Coach, Baiyang and I

539
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,720
can be the second doubles players.

540
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
[upbeat music]

541
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,280
I burned the midnight oil last night
to make the game plan.

542
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,560
For the second doubles against Xing Yao,

543
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,600
the odds of playing against Hu Liangliang

544
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,720
and Feng Zhiyuan are 83.5%.

545
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
[Yan Zhiming]
Feng Zhiyuan's hurricane serve

546
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,560
is the fastest among all players
in the national tournament.

547
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,720
If you let me and Baiyang play the match,

548
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,120
we'll give up the first quarter
of their service game.

549
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,800
We can then use my high-speed serve,
along with Baiyang's Boomerang Snake,

550
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,760
to go from defense to attack
and win our service game.

551
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,600
In the second quarter,

552
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,280
-we--
-Are you saying you will deliberately lose

553
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,720
in their service game?

554
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,160
Isn't it too risky?

555
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,640
No matter who plays the match,
even if it's not Baiyang and me,

556
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,520
if we don't adopt this way,
it'll be riskier for us.

557
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,280
[sighs]

558
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,240
Come on, Yan.

559
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,400
Since we've been chosen
to be the doubles players,

560
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,080
you can, of course, question my tactics.

561
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,840
You can also propose
your training plan, as usual.

562
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,640
Let's try together to see if it works.

563
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,720
But I have to remind you

564
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
that this is all useless.

565
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,040
The one who takes offensive action
wins the match.

566
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,520
Why are you so certain
that I can't return his serve

567
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,680
with my Boomerang Snake?

568
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,000
It's hard enough to hit a Boomerang Snake
when the match just starts.

569
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,080
Not to mention returning a serve
that is hard to reach.

570
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,880
-The failure rate can be--
-So, you can try to use

571
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,040
your high-speed serve.

572
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,640
[Baiyang] By the way,

573
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,360
take off the lead bags on your arms.

Mm! Since it has been decided

577
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,840
that we'll play the doubles match,

578
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,239
you can, of course, propose your plan,
just like how we usually do.

579
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,840
I can cooperate with you
to see whether it works.

580
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,199
However, I should remind you

581
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,920
that if you aren't active enough
this time,

582
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,320
Yan Zhiming and his partner will outdo us.

583
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,639
You've improved so much over time.

584
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,239
Without me to lead the training,

585
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,199
you should be able
to handle the opponents well.

-[grunts]
-What do you mean by that?

You're not leading the training?

588
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,320
I think your strategies
should be better than mine.

589
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,159
If you have some ideas,
I'll try my best to do it.

It doesn't work out this way.

I've told you

601
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,200
that considering the number
of special serves,

Let me ask you something.

Don't you think Chi Dayong's behavior
has been quite weird recently?

Has it?

I'm not joking.

Don't you think Chi Dayong
looks like he's under a lot of pressure?

Hey. Tell me.

What can make a teenager
in his golden years

who has huge potential feel so depressed?

"In his golden years"?
"Who has huge potential"?

622

It's surprising
that you care about Dachi so much.

623
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,160
Could it be love?

[Tang Jiale] It can't be love.

This is impossible.

He's been helping me review lessons.

630

of the pressure of the tournament.
