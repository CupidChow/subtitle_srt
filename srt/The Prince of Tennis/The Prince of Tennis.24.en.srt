00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,680
Why did you ask him to play yourself?

170
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,200
I met him the other day.

171
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
He seems like a good player.

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,360
I was curious
and wanted to have a game with him.

173
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,080
I was curious too.

You seem to be in a bad mood.

That's all.

178
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,640
It's nothing.
It's just that I can't get a drink.

It's just stuck.

You will win.

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,200
I mean, you will win at the court.

I have faith in you.

If a problem is put aside for a moment,
it can be solved in the end.

195
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
For example, if you can't figure out
a math problem,

196
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,040
you can do the Chinese first.

197
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,440
Maybe you'll know how to solve
the math after that.

198
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,640
Maybe.

I feel troubled
seeing you standing like that.

Oh.

Coach. Please.

208
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,240
Have you seen Chi Dayong and Jiale's game?

209
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,000
You mean Dayong's conditions?

210
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,000
Did you notice as well?

211
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,080
He always has a stomachache.

212
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,360
Once I saw bottles
of stomach medicine in the trash bin.

213
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
[sighs]
That boy bears all the burdens alone.

214
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,000
I've found out
about his stomachache long before.

215
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,920
What's your plan?

216
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,360
Has he been to the hospital?

217
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,040
Yes.

218
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,120
The doctor said
he has neurotic stomach cramps.

219
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,680
That means he will get a stomachache

220
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,320
when he is nervous and under big pressure.

221
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,480
But I think the stomachache has nothing
to do with his current conditions.

Yan.

225
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,960
[Yan Zhiming] But the percentage
of you missing the balls have increased

226
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,760
by 7.35 percent compared to before.

227
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
In fact, the main reason
for missing the balls

228
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,000
is that Jiale is much faster than before.

229
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,000
But if you don't move faster

230
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,840
when approaching the net,
it will influence

231
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,360
the coordination between you and Jiale.

232
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,360
Do you understand?

Nothing.

[Xiangqian] Listen.

238
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,080
I found a cookbook in a hardware store.
And there's a good recipe in that book.

239
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
It's called
Spicy Mental Seafood Celery Stew.

240
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
It's fierce. You can tell from the name.

Listen, I'll improve it when we get home.

I believe you will make great progress
with tennis after eating it.

I can also make great progress
with my cooking skills.

No, I didn't mean that.

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,160
I mean, after all these years,
you still do morning exercise every day.

you'll meet different types of players.

Is this what you called "for real"?

335
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,040
I'm not tricking you.

336
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
I'm really serious.

337
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,480
Trust me.

338
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,960
Let me finish.

339
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,640
Yes, I can't see anything now.

340
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,920
So I have to use all my other senses
to know your moves.

341
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,120
Honestly, in consideration
of your current level.

342
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,640
I can't help losing intentionally
without this blindfold.

343
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,000
So you can do what you like now.

344
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
[XIangqian] Bring it on.

345
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,680
You can take off your blindfold
if you can't receive my serves.

346
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,960
[Xiangqian] Twist serve.

What do you think?

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,200
This is your dad.

-[thwacks]
-[groans]

351
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,440
Wait.

352
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,240
Do you know why I can still receive
your serves while wearing the blindfold?

353
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,640
Because I'm not strong enough.

354
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
When you rely more on your skills
than your senses,

355
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,880
you'll be vulnerable.

356
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,600
What's your point?

357
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,040
Here's the question.

358
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,880
What is your first thought

359
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,640
when playing tennis?

360
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,760
I think about you.

361
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,560
It shouldn't be me,

362
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,280
but yourself you think about.

Can I borrow it?

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,000
[student 2] You can keep it if you like.

Morning, Jiale.

371
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,760
The math class we just had was difficult.

372
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,240
So was our English class.

373
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,720
I didn't quite get it.

374
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,000
You can ask Lu Xia for help.

375
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Right.

376
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,680
[chuckles]
Oh, let me help you.

377

No, thanks. I'm almost there.

Oh.

379
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,800
See you at the training.

380
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,560
See you then.

What a pity.

385
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,400
Try an overhand serve.
A straight serve shouldn't do.

386
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,480
Oh.

387
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,200

I don't think I can serve like you do.

394
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,160
My arm power is weaker than you.

395
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,240
But I will keep practicing.
[chuckles]

396
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,120
As long as you can figure out
why you are losing,

397
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
I will not be able to beat you.

398
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
But have you figured it out?

399
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,800
The ones that belong to you
are the best ones.

400
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,920
If you don't give it a try,
you will never know.

401
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,320
You don't think I can do it?

402
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,760
You don't need to learn from me.

403
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,200
You have your own way.

404
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,560

Excuse me.

Wait.

414
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
I want to talk to you.

415
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,200
Could we go to your place?

416
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,560
[quivers]

417
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,800
[Yan Zhiming] I've had training plans
for everyone,

418
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
except you.

419
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,960
I'll follow the old plan.

420
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,480
I never write useless stuff
on my training plan.

421
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,840
First, you are now in the midst
of transformation.

422
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,720
The previous training plan
may hinder your improvement.

423
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,720
Second, you won't follow it anyway
even if I write one.

424
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,080
I will.

425
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,120
I know you will finish the training plan.

426
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,760
Training is not the purpose.

427
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,760
Your purpose is to grow up
and strengthen yourself.

428
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,520
If we don't discuss these two problems,

429
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,680
your training will have no effect.

430
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,280
Then what do you ask of me?

431
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,520
Lu Xia.

432
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,240
We are a team.

433
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,440
Sometimes you should trust us more.

434
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
I trust you.

435
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,480
There is no shortcut to success.

436
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,320
We can learn from others' training plans.

437
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,040
[Yan Zhiming] You can research others,

438
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,440
and then change your point of view

439
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,040
and have a look at yourself.

440
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,840
What do you think?

441
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,400
Fine.

442
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,480
-[Yan Zhiming] Sir.
-Yan is here.

443
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,080
I don't know what I should bring.

444
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,520
So I brought you two bottles
of my newly developed Yan-juice.

445
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,760
Ooh, I'm very grateful.
[chuckles]

446
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,800
Try some.

447
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,600
Come, try it.

448
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,880
Dad, I'm not going to drink it.

449
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,920
He made an effort to bring some here.

450
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,800
It's impolite if you don't drink, right?

451
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
[Xiangqian] Watch me.

452
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,800
Lu Xia cherishes his life so much.

453
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,880
Ahh. Go on.

454
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,400
Dad, I want to talk to Yan alone.

455
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,880
Go on.

456
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,440
[laughs]
This...

457
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,440
Fine. I will leave you alone.

458
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,120
It's bitter.

459
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,160
[thuds]

460
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,560
-Shouldn't we help him?
-No, keep talking.

461
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,360
Fine.

462
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,600
Let's start
with Qiao Chen's training plan.

463
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,440
What is his unique skill?

464
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,480
Vertical smash.

465
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,120
Qiao Chen is tall
with a good leaping ability.

466
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,840
He learned fencing before.

467
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,000
[Yan Zhiming] So my plan for him
consists of 200 sets of leaping

468
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,320
and shot practice per day.

469
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,040
He has to strengthen

470
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,480
his leaping force and physical power

471
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,960
if he wants to be stronger.

472
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,160
Then let's talk about Baiyang.

473
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,000
Snake-ball.

474
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,920
Baiyang has a one-track-mind.

475
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,280
[Yan Zhiming] He is quite stubborn.

476
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,560
The one who has 10,000 of tricks
is not formidable,

477
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,960
but the one who is a master
at one trick is.

478
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,760
And he also has strong willpower,

479
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,680
so his training plan
will be really effective.

480
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,720
His training plan consists

481
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,760
of running five kilometers
and doing 200 sets

482
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,480
of dumping towels per day.

483
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,800
You think it's too much?

484
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,920
Originally, it was double the amount.

485
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,560
Because I know he will double it himself.

486
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,720
So...

487
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,120
I have few data about Zhuo Zhi.

488
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,680
[Yan Zhiming] But he knows
how to train himself well.

489
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,040
So my plan for him consists
of practicing some basic receives

490
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,640
and swinging the racket.

491
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,400
TRAINING PLAN FOR YU QING HIGH SCHOOL

492
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,240
Xinglong is a strong player.

493
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,880
[Yan Zhiming] He uses the wave ball.

494
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,160
-Burning.
-[Yan Zhiming] No one

495
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,120
in Yu Qing can match Xinglong in strength.

496
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,280
He gives us a sense of safety.

497
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,840
That's what Xinglong does.

498
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,280
That's him.

499
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,080
So his training plan aims
to strengthen his leg muscles.

500
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,360
Only stronger and more stable leg muscles

501
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,160
can make his wave ball more powerful.

502
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,200
The next is Jiale and Dayong.

503
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,720
I can't entirely separate
Dayong's and Jiale's training.

504
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,640
They have some joint training
as well as some individual training.

505
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,680
[Yan Zhiming] As a guard,
Dayong's good at viewing the whole court.

506
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
His unique skill is the moon-volley.

507
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,800
He has to increase his running speed
to deal with the emergency at the court.

508
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,640
Jiale's skill is the acrobatics tennis.

509
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,120
His responses are quick.

510
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,640
He has to enhance his endurance.

511
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,920
So I made him do
some long-distance running.

512
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,040
That's it for the others.

TRAINING PLAN FOR YU QING HIGH SCHOOL
LU XIA

514
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,080
What about the captain?

515
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,120
The captain is different.

516
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,160
What do you mean?

517
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,000
[Yan Zhiming] He is above his peers.

518
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,200
So he and I made
his training plan together.

519
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,480
I referred to professional players'
training methods.

520
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,840
The captain is a powerful player.

521
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,400
So are you.

522
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,280
So I want to do the same
for your training plan.

523
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,120
But before that,

524
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,280
I want to talk about your ideas.

525
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,240
What is your view of tennis?

526
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,880
[Yan Zhiming] Think it step by step.

527
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,720
Let me say what I think of you.

528
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,840
We have to discuss
whether my judgment is right or not.

529
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,400
What do you think of me?

530
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,400
You show extraordinary talent.

531
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,440
[Yan Zhiming] You are even stronger
than Siyang when he was your age.

532
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,880
But the talent brought you
not only advantages

533
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,680
but also hidden dangers.

534
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,080
The hidden dangers...

535
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,920
lie in your theory.

536
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,960
So you mean my theory doesn't suit me?

537
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,480
I can't say it's totally unfit.

538
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,240
But it didn't make the best use
of your advantages.

539
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,160
Because you and your theory
haven't been fully united.

540
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
How do I become fully united?

541
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
Others understand you differently.

542
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,120
You have to find your own theory,

543
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,520
and that will be your own view of tennis.

544

[playful music]

545
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,960
[Xiangqian] Am I bothering you?

546
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,000
Not at all.

547
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,520
-Sir, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

548
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,920
Yan, your Yan-juice has quite a kick.
It's strong.

549
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,800
[Xiangqian] I love it.

550
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,760
I made you some special drinks.

551
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,760
Try it.

552
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,760
Thank you, sir.

[Xiangqian] Lu Xia, help him.

[Yan Zhiming] No, it's fine.

Are you teaching kids?

No, they're for me.

566
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,040
You are quite skillful, right?

567
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,080
Not enough. I have to think.

568
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,080
Playing tennis is easy.

What's there to think?

570

I want to start from scratch.

571
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,320
You should stop
rather than start from scratch.

572
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,360
Play when you are well prepared.

Hey, what are we doing?

We have to do the same as they do

579
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,240
if we want to become main players.

580

Let's act like one first.

581
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,680
Skills are important if we want to be one.
What's the point of wearing a hat

or a kerchief or shouting "burning"?

Are you pretending to be like Yan?

He looks just like Yan.

593
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,840
Lu Xia is already a main player.
He doesn't need to pretend.
