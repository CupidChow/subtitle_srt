[sighs]
Okay.

333
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,400
When I was three years old,

334
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,680
my Uncle Toni

335
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
took me to the World of Tennis.

336
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,160
Toni?

337
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
I was a right-hand player,

338
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
but I switched to left-hand

339
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,760
-under my uncle's advice.
-Wait.

340
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,200
Isn't that Nadal?

341
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,200
Don't interrupt.

342
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,640
[Xiangqian] At school,

343
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,240
I participated in two events.

344
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,520
-One is tennis, the other is...
-Soccer.

345
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,200
How did you know?

346
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,160
[chuckles]

347
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,960
That's Federer.

348
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,440
What should I talk about
when you know everything?

349
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
It's boring.

Why do you play tennis?

I have a goal.

What's your goal?

391
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,200
A man.

392
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,520
Your goal is to just beat a man?

393
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,360
That's not a good reason.

all I want is to focus...

[doctor] You can't play
high-intensity games for now.

406
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,320
And you can't use your skillful chip.

[Siyang] To win the game,

415
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,680
you have to be stronger.

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,000
When you truly know
the reason you play tennis,

417

you'll have the ability
to overcome the obstacles.

418

You'll be stronger on the court.

Look at her now.

She's too tough,
the kids are afraid of her.

Ah. You kept this, too?

433
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,680
I just put it there.

[Dayong] Captain, have a seat.

It's just a game.

I'm not that tired.

Captain, it's not just a game.

443
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,760
I've seen it all.

444
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,600
Why did you take such a risk?

445
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,720
What if your injury gets worse?

446
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,960
This game is meaningless

447
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,840
if I didn't do so.

448
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,200
That's all I can do for him.

[Dayong sighs]

00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,520
Captain, do you think Lu Xia
will get back up?

451
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,960
It's right to do so,

452
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,040
but he must be really frustrated.

a game before.

[Dayong] By the way,

456
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,640

Why are you so late?

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
You had a date?

you'll have the ability
to overcome the obstacles.

465
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,760
You'll be stronger on the court.

Don't let Siyang down.

Why didn't Lu Xia and the captain come?

What's the problem?

475
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,400
[Qiao Chen] Did they really get sick?

476
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,360
[groans]
No. He can't be sick.

477
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,080
I asked Mu today.
He said Lu Xia is doing well.

478
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,200
He doesn't seem sick.

479
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,800
You are annoying.

480
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,840
Aren't you hurting?

481
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,440
Not a bit.

482

Why are you trying to be brave?

483
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,720
The X-ray shows that your injury

484
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,760
is much worse than last time.

485
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,720
You must have overused
your hand these days.

486
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,880
It caused a recurrence.

487
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,680
As far as it goes,
how long will it take to recover?

488
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,880
So far, your recovery
is not totally wasted.

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,480
But I can't help you if you don't listen.

[Xiangqian] Don't you have training?

You look so serious.
