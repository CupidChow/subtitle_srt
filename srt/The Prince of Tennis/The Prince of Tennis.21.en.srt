00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,800
Dad, where are you going?

172
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,920
[He Xinglong] I haven't even gotten on.

173
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,920
Dad!

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,360
[Mr. He] Do what you like.

175
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
Don't miss the opportunity.

[sighs]

178
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
Coach, these are enough.

179
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,360
It even makes me vomit
seeing these biscuits.

180
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,280
[Coach Qi] I don't ask you to eat it now.
Take them along.

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Or you'll have nothing
to eat this afternoon.

182
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Oh. Fine.

183
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,280
Coach, you asked us
to take our belongings.

184
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,840
[Qiao Chen] It's not training, right?
Where are we going?

185
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,000
Is it a wilderness survival test?

186
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,720
It is in the wild.

187
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
But it's a treasure hunt.

188
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,240
Treasure hunt? What treasure?

189
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,480
The training this afternoon
is to look for a secret to winning

190
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,640
on the mountain.

191
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,760
[Tang Jiale] How can you believe
such a thing?

192
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,360
Don't waste time.

193
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,960
I prefer training than this.

194
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,760
Right. We seldom have training like this.

195
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,160
We shouldn't waste time.

196
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,800
[Coach Qi grunting]

197
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
It's no use to train.

198
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,880
It's the same as studying.

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,800
If you rely only on rote learning
for the exams,

200
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,080
you will forget
everything after the exams.

201
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,280
Hm? Coach, but why should we remember
what we studied when the exams are over?

202
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,520
Right. Why?

203
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
[gasps]
Don't hit my face.

204
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,840
Playing tennis is the same as studying.

205
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,160
You have to remember
the reason why you train so hard.

206
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,000
It's not to finish the plan,
but to strengthen the whole team.

207
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,320
Then we can make it
to the end in the national league.

208
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Hm!

209
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,360
[Coach Qi] Don't worry.

210
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
There is really a secret.

211
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,040
Every team can do well
in the national league

212
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,800
if they can get the secret.

213
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,760
It does sound superstitious,

214
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,160
but I still hope you can find
the secret together.

215
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,080
Then you will realize
the elders' good intentions.

216
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,680
Trust me.

217
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,760
It's not a waste of time.

218
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,400
Okay. Take your tools

219
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,520
and walk up the mountain in groups.

220
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,560
Find it before the sunset.

221
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,400
It's a treasure hunt,
so how can we find it without clues?

222
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,960
There is an eye-catching tree
beside the secret.

223
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
And also some big rocks.

224
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,760
-[Zhuo Zhi] Big rocks?
-Big rocks?

225
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,760
-Is it a magic art?
-Wait.

226
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,360
That's not important.

227
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,080
Coach, you mean

228
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,080
we have to find a tree in the forest?

229
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,720
A very big tree.

230
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,320
-[Coach Qi] Okay.
-Oh.

231
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,760
You've got your clues.

232
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,040
Go on then.

233
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Take care.

234
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
[upbeat music]

235
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,640
[Coach Wi] It's a lush forest.

236
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,400
They had to find some special place

237
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,240
for identification.

238
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,920
I heard they chose a big eye-catching tree

239
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,360
with big rocks next to it.

240
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,960
They buried the secret there.

241
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,800
But it depends on you to find it or not.

242
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,040
[sighs]

243
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,560
Damn.
[panting]

244
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Why am I back here again?

245
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,960
[groans]

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,840
If they want to bury something
on the mountain,

247
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,560
they would find an easy way to uphill.

248
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,200
According to my analysis
of the contour lines,

249
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,280
this is the path where the contour lines
are most sparse.

250
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,840
So technically,
it's the easiest way to go up.

251
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,920
Baiyang, don't go in a straight line
all the time.

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,720
You may reach a dead end.

253
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,240
It's just like playing tennis.

254
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,040
If you don't make a change,
you are not far from a dead end.

255
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,960
You're really annoying.

This way.

You can go that way if you want.

259
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,120
I will go this way.

260
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,680
Baiyang, that's a dead end.

I delivered some food nearby.

Anyway, I don't have money to go back.

I heard you are here.

I wanted to borrow some money
to take a bus.

She said that you are up here.

298

Then why don't you borrow money from them?

-[Qiao Chen] Mm-hm.

At such a critical moment--

500
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,200
Xinglong, say it.

501
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,520
Let's open it first.

502
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,960
Okay.

"Let's separate for a while,

But it won't be long.
I'll win in three months.

What the hell?

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,360
[scoffs]
As stupid as you.

526
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,360
Shut up.

It's their group photo.

531
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,000
So these are the secret to winning?

532
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,800
[Coach Qi] What do you think?

533
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,480
Are you disappointed?

534
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,440
Coach, you already knew what it is.

535
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
-[chuckles]
-It's too old-fashioned.

536
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,520
You kept them really well.

537
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Shut up.

538
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
[chuckles]

539
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,000
Although I didn't know
what they buried here,

540
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,400
I heard about something then.

541
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,520
At first, Yu Qing was not good at tennis.

542
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,080
No one ever put great hopes...

543
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,560
on tennis club.

544
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,360
[Coach Qi] But that year,

545
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,640
the students were enthusiastic
about winning the national championship.

546
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,920
They wouldn't let anything
influence their determination.

547
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,800
So they buried
their most important items here.

548
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,680
And they agreed to get them back

549
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,240
after winning
the first national championship

550
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,960
for Yu Qing.

551
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,240
At last, their wishes were fulfilled.

552
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,000
These are what they buried then.

553
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,120
But they still kept them here

554
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,960
even they won the national championship.

555
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,960
And then it became

556
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,640
a secret for you to discover.

557
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,400
So it is.

558
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,720
We really found the legendary myth.

559
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,040
[Zhuo Zhi] It's amazing.

560
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,840
Maybe we can win
the long-lost championship for Yu Qing.

561
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,800
They must have faced more difficulties
than we do now.

562
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,240
Whatever happened,
they believed they would win in the end.

563
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
That's why they overcame all difficulties.

564
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,320
-Do we have such determinations?
-Yes.

565
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,080
-[Siyang] Do we?
-[all] We do!

566
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,760
It's not only them
who have a secret to winning.

567
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,480
Lu Xia is right.

568
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,880
Let's make our own winning secret.

Shall we put something for him?

Let's play the truth game.

It can make you closer.

-Fine. The truth game.
-Come on.

Okay, okay, okay.

Fine, only one question.

together with a boy. Who is he?

-Photo? What photo?

Shen Weiming, did you look at her phone?

-Uh...

Hey.

00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,360
Isn't he your captain?

-Captain?
-Our captain?

My brother had
a different character, appearance

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,840
and playing style
before coming to Yu Feng.

701
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,720
[Xing Zi] He was the top player
of the No. 5 High School.

[groans]

He was an aggressive player
known for his fierce attacks.

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,440
-Huh?
-Oh.

707
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,880
-It doesn't look like him.
-I can't even imagine it.

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,520
-Yes.
-Right.

[clicks tongue]

710
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,600
It's a pity.
We may not see that in the future.

711
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,920
Why?

712
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,760
Because my brother hurt

713
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
the opponent's eyes...

00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,880
-[thwacks]
-[grunts]

[Xing Zi] ...by accident
in a game three years ago.

00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,880
-That boy nearly got blind.
-[boy grunting]

-Your eyes!
-Call an ambulance!

718
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,280
[Xing Zi] My brother got a haircut
out of guilt.

719
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,680
He even decided to stop playing tennis.

720
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,640
He didn't join Yu Feng's tennis club

721
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,720
until that boy's eyes recovered.

722
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,600
Oh.

723
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,320
Don't be like this.

724
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,920
My brother got reinvigorated
and started playing tennis.

725
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,760
All thanks to you guys.

726
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,200
You gave him confidence and courage.

727
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,360
You changed him.

728
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,320
He is shy of saying that to you.

729
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,560
But he decided to thank you

730
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,320
in the way of becoming your captain

731
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,560
and leading you to victory
in the national league.

What?

[Ziping] Why are you staring at me?

734
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,400
Captain, short hair
makes you look capable and skillful.

735
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,200
[Yiwu] It underlines
your leadership quality.

736
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,560
And it’s easier to take care of.

-If your fringe...
-Captain.

We will keep going with you.

00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,400
We won't give up either.

We have the same confidence as you do
in achieving the championship.

743
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,880
We vow here, that's all Yu Qing players

744
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,520

Only keeping up this spirit

can we ensure
100 percent chance of winning.
