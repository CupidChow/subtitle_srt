00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,520
They can't even acknowledge
their own problems.

167
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,160
They always use friends as an excuse.

168
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,720
I am not lying.

169
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,760
Which friend? Why don't you invite him?
I can talk to him in person.

170
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,280
Not everyone is always
as available as you.

171
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,560
-Please help me figure it out.
-Okay.

172
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,560
Let me try to solve it for your friend.

173
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,120
In a match, what's the key to winning?

174
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,840
To hit the ball somewhere
the opponent can't reach.

175
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,440
Not bad.

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,640
You've improved a lot.

177
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,880
So just go and tell your friend.

178
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,680
If he insists on a certain shot or style
when playing tennis,

179
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,840
he's doomed to lose
from the beginning of the match.

180
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,960
[Xiangqian] A really good tennis player
is not restricted

181
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,440
by certain moves or styles.

182
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,160
It's always changing on the court.

183
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,920
Even if you're playing with an opponent
that has lost to you many times,

184
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,280
he may exceed all your expectations
on the court.

185
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,440
So, as long as you play seriously,

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,480
you can find a way to defeat the opponent.

187
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,480
The rest is...

188
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,280
to have faith in yourself.

189
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,520
Myself? It's not me.

190
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
I told you it's my friend.

191
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,240
Okay. Have faith in himself.
Is that okay now?

192
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,920
[Xiangqian] Then please tell your friend

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,960
to rely on his muscle memory
when returning every shot.

194
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
How about now?
Does your friend still have questions?

195
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
No.

196
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,960
Oh.

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,440
[Dayong] Thanks for your encouragement
and supervision,

198
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
we, from Yu Qing,
finally regained the will to fight.

199
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,520
So, today, I invite everyone
to have a barbecue.

200
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,800
Yan, have you finished arranging the seats
based on everyone's preference?

201
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,800
Mm.

202
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,200
Qiao Chen doesn't want to sit
with Shen Weiming.

203
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,840
[Yan Zhiming] Jiale must stay with you.

204
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,200
Zhuo Zhi has to sit next to Zhuo Yu
and stay away from Guan Yue if possible.

205
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,400
But Guan Yue wants to stay
with Zhou Yu too.

206
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,240
Ji Jingwu wants to stay alone,

207
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,800
but someone has to sit at the same table
to grill meat for him.

208
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,760
[Dayong] How about Lu Xia?

209
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,040
Is he late again?

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
[Lu Xia] I'm here.

211
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
[quirky music]

212
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
This is a self-service
barbecue restaurant.

213
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,120
Just help yourself.
Eat as much as you can.

214
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,080
Let's dig in.

215
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Wait.

216
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,040
Eating alone is no fun.

217
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,320
How about this?
Let's hold a big eater contest.

218
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,960
Each school selects one representative.

219
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,440
The one who loses the contest
has to drink...

220
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,520
Yan Zhiming's specially made juice.

221
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,000
Jiale, why are you proposing the contest?

222
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,400
[whispering]
Aren't you curious

223
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,880
about Ji Jingwu's reaction
when he drinks the juice?

224
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,040
Opportunity only knocks once.

225
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,040
[chuckles]

226
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,200
[Tang Jiale clears throat]

227
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,440
Okay.

228
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,280
Everyone from Yu Qing
has reached a consensus.

229
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,680
Our representative is...

230
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,800
Qiao Chen.

231
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,960
Good.

232
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,320
[Qiao Chen] You can say
I'm not the best player,

233
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,800
but you can't say I'm not a big eater.

234
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,840
Yes!

235
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,800
Hua Chonghong, go.

236
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,920
Roger.

237
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm on behalf of Di Liu High School.

238
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,400
Luckily, I just finished farming,
and haven't eaten anything.

239
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,800
It's hard to say.

240
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,120
When it comes to a contest,
I am always the lucky one.

241
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,320
The captain isn't here, so I'll go.

242
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,000
Regarding eating meat,
no one can ever keep up with me.

243
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
Zhuo Yu.

244
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,960
Yu had the stomach flu when he was little.
He can't eat too much.

245
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
So Guo Zi High School
is exempted from the contest.

246
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,160
Okay. That's it.

247
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,640
I hereby announce the beginning
of the contest.

248
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,920
Come on.

249
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,000
[sizzling]

250
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,800
Grill more meat.

251
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
It smells good.

252
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,000
[Tang Jiale] Come on.

253
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
[lively music]

254
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
-Have this.
-Have this.

255
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,280
Since you rely on me to give you advice,
this is your payment.

256
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,840
[clears throat]
Let me grill the meat. You two just eat.

257
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,160
I've had a big steamed bun
before coming here.

258
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm stuffed.

259
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
-[Dayong] Have this.
-Okay.

260
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,200
[Jian] Come on, bottoms up.

261
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,080
[sniffs]

262
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,400
Mm.

263
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
You're really good at grilling.

264
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,320
You grilled that one yourself.

265
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,680
Did I?

266
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,880
Look, I'm really curious as to why
you are afraid of drinking the juice.

267
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,800
[Qianshi] Isn't it just a vegetable drink?

268
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,760
No matter what, win or lose,
I'll try the drink.

269
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,200
[Jingwu] Hua Chonghong,
you've eaten quite a lot.

270
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,960
[Chonghong] I need to be full
to have the energy to play tennis.

271
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,440
Come on, don't just eat vegetables.

272
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,800
[Chonghong] Senior,
I'm not eating these meats.

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,360
They have too many calories.

274
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,040
It might affect my recent training plan.

275
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,080
[Jingwu] I have to say,
you're really a data geek.

276
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,560
You need a well-designed diet
to defeat a big eater.

277
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,880
-I don't think it's too awful.
-Why not try my newly developed Yan-juice?

278
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,880
[groans]

279
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,240
[thuds]

280
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,040
-But since...
-[Qianshi] Bitter!

281
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
This is the prime beef you ordered.
Please enjoy it.

282
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,360
-What is this?
-Chateaubriand beef.

283
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,760
The dish requires a certain part
of beef tenderloin,

284
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,160
and one beef cattle
can only provide 600 grams of it.

285
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
In the beginning, a foreign politician

286
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,520
named François-René de Chateaubriand
asked his chef to make it for him.

287
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
[Yan Zhiming] Later, it was named
after this politician.

288
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,680
It's beautifully tender, just like art.

289
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,920
[gasps]

290
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,880
-You know a lot.
-This is not a Chateaubriand.

291
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,080
Because I like it very much,

292
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,560
I can tell whether it's real or not,
simply by looking at the marbling.

293
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,360
So...

294
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
Zhiming,

295
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,800
you've never eaten
this kind of beef before, right?

296
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,160
[sniffles]

297
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,200
Eh...

298
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Fair enough.

299
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,680
When it comes to food,

300
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,600
theories alone can't be applied.

301
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
[quirky music]

302
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,440
...65, 66, 67, 68.

303
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,480
[sucks teeth]

304
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,560
[clears throat]

305
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,880
The one who loses the contest is...

306
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,240
-Qiao Chen.
-Come on.

307
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,280
I was preventing others
from tasting our treasured juice.

308
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,120
Based on how much you eat daily,
you can still eat more, right?

309
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,400
I was just thinking

310
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,680
that the match with Hai Guang
is the day after tomorrow.

311
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,480
[Qiao Chen] I wanted to take it easy.

312
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
I can't risk getting sick
just to win this contest.

313
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Yu Qing can't play their trump card
in that case.

314
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,120
Eating is not as fun as playing tennis.

315
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
[comical music]

316
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,080
[retches]

317
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,320
[groans]

318
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
[Jian groans]

319
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,200
Thanks for treating me to this meal.

320
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,359
[Jian] The provincial finals
is the day after tomorrow.

321
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,560
Hai Guang is a tough opponent,
but I have greater faith in you.

322
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,560
The captain wants me to tell you

323
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,599
that you represent not only yourselves,

324
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,319
but Yu Feng, who lost to Hai Guang.

325
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,079
As well as all the schools beaten by you.

326
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,359
You'll walk the last mile
with your dreams, expectations,

327
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,359
and unwillingness to lose.

You don't have to worry about me.

is truly very aggressive.

among the national top eight.

No matter how good Hai Guang is,

I don't want to put
too much pressure on you.

But on second thought,
I decided to come and stop by,

in case you need it tonight.

-Where are you going?
-I'll walk you home.

It's not necessary.

[young Lian] Yan Zhiming,
let's have a real battle tomorrow.

498
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,880
I'll wait for you on the court
on Sunday afternoon.

DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHOSE DATA IS BETTER?

FROM LIU LIAN

See you tomorrow on the court.

Don't put your head on my shoulder.

504
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,160
It's hot.

[panting]

506
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,480
It's your fault.

507
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,480
If you could run faster,

508
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,600
I wouldn't have to slow down
to wait for you.

509
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,280
I didn't need you to wait for me.

510
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,680
I have too much energy to use.

Stop denying that. Let's run one more lap.

No problem. Come on.

You're just a replacement.
Why are you working so hard?

520
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,920
Dad, my strength is my only power.

521
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,000
No matter whether I can play or not,
I have to be well-prepared.

522
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,080
I can't afford to lose.

Hm?

531
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,640
Xu Xingzi came to me,

532
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,320
and she told me about her brother.

533
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,440
I'm a little worried about you.

534
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,280
You two.

535
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,040
How is Xu Ziping now?

[chuckles]
He's fine now.

537
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,400
But Xingzi told me that I must tell you

538
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,440
to be careful with the match
against Hai Guang.

539
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,720
Thank you, for the last time.
Thank you for sharing it with me.

540
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,000
It's nothing.

541
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,680
I don't even know why I say these.

542
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,000
I've found the moment.

543
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,040
The moment you mentioned it.

544
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,760
The moment that one finds his real love.

with our cute faces and momentum.

yet we look so different.

It's probably a ritual they do
before the match starts.

So that means
they're really geniuses, right?

His defensive range
is really unbelievable.

Ke Jie has a really wide defensive range.

629
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Because of his overwhelming

many players
can barely make winning shots.

Okay.

[retreating footsteps]

654
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,880
[door opens]

655
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,320
WE'RE IN THE LEAD IN THE FIRST SET.
DON'T WORRY. JUST REST TO RECOVER.

656
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,160
ALTHOUGH YU QING IS PRETTY GOOD,
HAI GUANG WON'T LET ITS GUARD DOWN.

657
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,760
THIS IS THE VIDEO OF THE TENNIS MATCH.

659
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
[light music]

660
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,080
[Zhuo Zhi] Don't worry.
We're entering the court.

661
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,840
We'll play to the fullest.

662
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,280
[audience in unison]
Hai Guang, winner! Wentai, genius!

663
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,640
Hai Guang, winner! Wentai, genius!

664
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,520
Because he wanted
to get the upper hand first.

665
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,720
Then, the opponent is dominant now.

666
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,720
They must be mentally disturbed.

667
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
And it will cause them to be impetuous.

668
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,320
[nervous gasp]

669
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,120
If Baiyang had hit a Snake-ball,
they wouldn't have been tied up.

670
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,200
It's said that your Snake-ball is good.

671
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,560
Why don't you hit one?

672
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,560
[Wentai] But it'll be returned,

673
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,040
returned by Ke Jie.

674
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,880
[audience in unison]
Hai Guang, number one!

675
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,240
Mm.

676
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,280
[audience] Hai Guang, number one!

677
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,560
[grunts]

678
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,840
[Qiao Chen] Are they really hitting
a corner shot?

679
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,040
How do they know
where the Snake-ball goes?

680
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,880
The odds of a return to Baiyang are 92%.

681
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,360
-Wait, Baiyang.
-Cut the crap!

682
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,280
[yells]

683
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,720
[Jie] It's easy.

684
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,880
[Baiyang] Could it be...

685
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,920
The odds of Ke Jie making
a winning return...

686
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,160
are 100%.

687
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,640
[all gasp]

688
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,360
[umpire] Hai Guang wins the point.
It's 15-0.

689
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,280
[Qiao Chen] Sure enough,
they've done some profound research on us.
