168
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,800
That's the way it should be. Come.

169
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,040
Fast attacks can show their true strength
if I also do some slow ones alternately.

170
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
[umpire] Ya Jiuxin
from the No. 3 High School won.

171
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,440
It's 4-3.

172
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,720
He can change his pace in this situation.

173
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,120
He is remarkable.

174
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,440
You won't lose to me

175
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
if you keep practicing karate.

176
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
Say that when you really have
a chance to win.

177
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,240
Now it depends on their faith.

178
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,920
The one who has the longest breath
will win the game.

179
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
Lu Xia.

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
It's the most important time.

181
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,520
[grunts]

182
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,440
[groans]

183
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,480
[He Xinglong] As a tennis player,
Lu Xia is really marvelous.

184
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
He could hardly keep up
with Ya Jiuxin's pace.

185
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,680
Then Ya Jiuxin showed
a stronger capability,

186
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
and scored a lot.

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,040
He is even stronger
after taking that coach's advice.

188
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,440
An ordinary person would

189
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,840
have been upset and worried.

190
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,240
But Lu Xia's faith in fighting
has never changed.

191
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,040
[Zhuo Zhi] Right.

192
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,560
He has been fighting bravely.

193
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,080
[audience screaming]

194
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,280
I never thought
you could make it until now.

195
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,480
But I thought of it.

196
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,320
This is our strength gap.

197
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,520
[scoffs]

198
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,520
You even have the guts to say that.

199
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,080
At this stage of the game,

200
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,200
I can't estimate the result
based on my data.

201
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,400
Come on!

202
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,800
Only one ball to win!

203
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,200
[Jiuxin] The last ball? So what?

204
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,280
You can't beat me.

205
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
[suspenseful music]

206
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,000
I just remembered
that I'm not done with you.

207
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,480
[all] Super half volley.

208
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,960
This one is for Xinglong!

209
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,000
Bring it on!

210
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,040
This one doesn't work on me.

211
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,680
Can Lu Xia hang in there?

212
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,200
The mentality in a high-pressure situation
is like a string.

213
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,880
All strings will be broken at last.

214
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,640
[ball clacks]

215
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,760
[audience] A Drive.

216
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,680
[groans]

217
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,080
[all gasp]

218
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,520
He can return the ball very closely.

219
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,440
This one is for all the team members
you bullied in Yu Qing.

220
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,440
He mentioned me.
Finish him with a smash, Lu Xia.

221
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,080
-And me.
-Me too.

222
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,160
[Jiuxin] Vertical Smash.

223
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,640
[gasps]

224
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,240
Damn.

225
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,120
[all] What?

226
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,280
[Coach Tian] This kid can change
his swing position in the air,

227
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,200
and change the smash for a short shot.

228
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
[rock music]

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,040
[umpire] Game over.

230
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,600
The score is 6-3.

231
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
Lu Xia from Yu Qing won.

232
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
[cheering]

233
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Ying.

234
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,640
Great!

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,560
[breathes deeply]

236
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,240
Little Lu Xia.

237
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,400
You are the best.

238
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,280
[whimpers]

239
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,800
What a pity.

240
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,760
But it's okay.

241
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,160
Ya Jiuxin.

242
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,360
Ya Jiuxin.

243
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,920
It's your first loss.

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
It feels bad, right?

245
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
You can only realize

246
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,160
the boundless possibilities in you
after failures.

247
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,760
What do you think?

248
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,040
-Playing tennis is not that boring, right?
-It's boring.

249
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,960
I won't participate in future games.

250
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,800
[Jiuxin] Being able to play

251
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
with this kid on this court

252
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,440
is enough for me.

253
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,120
Is this too much for him?

254
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,720
[SIyang] That was a really hard game.

255
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,160
Right.

256
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Our opponents
will be stronger and stronger.

257
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,320
We'll have a lot of risks
in the following games.

258
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,920
[Coach Qi] You can't take them lightly.

259
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,240
[Jiale] Don't be like this.

260
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,880
We're finally having some fun.

261
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,800
We ought to enjoy the victory now.

262
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,200
-Happy time.
-I agree.

263
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,440
[Jiale laughs]

264
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,360
Fine.

265
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,720
Of course, you can be happy.

266
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,800
But we still have a long way
to go for the nationals.

267
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,440
Don't despise your opponents.

268
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,480
So can we eat Xinglong's goose later?

269
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,240
Okay.

270
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,120
[Jiale chuckling]

271
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
What are you doing here?

272
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,319
Ya Jiuxin, don't stop playing tennis.

273
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,400
[scoffs]
Boring.

274
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,680
Are you frightened by one failure?

275
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,040
Don't you always say
that it's boring to win all the time?

276
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,720
Now you finally have some challenges.

277
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,440
Ya Jiuxin,

278
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,359
I could never go beyond myself
no matter how hard I tried.

279
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,960
So I can't understand

280
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,720
why you would give up so easily
when you have the talent.

[foreboding music]

282
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,120
You don't know a thing.

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,640
No, I don't.

284
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,320
Ya Jiuxin.

285
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,960
I just hope you can find
your favorite thing.

286
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,560
At least I know what I want

287
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,200
and what I don't.

288
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,800
How about you?

289
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,200
I lost,

290
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,520
and I'll take the consequences.

291
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you know why you can't make
a breakthrough?

292
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,560
[Jiunxin] Because you can do well

293
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,080
on neither toasting goose,
nor playing tennis.

294
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,800
A man like you

295
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,160
will always drag others down.

296
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,560
It's better to reflect on yourself

297
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,200
than to judge my life.

-I'm not--
-You don't need to say that.

Because I will win every time.

I will congratulate you
on every single game.

and win every time.

Please, Ya Jiuxin.

Don't quit the tennis club.

318
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
You will extinguish your possibilities...

if you follow my example.

as a tennis player.

[man 1] Now let me proclaim
the list of provincial qualifying.

334
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,320
The No. 3 High School,
Ying Cai High School,

335
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,040
Yu Feng High School,

336
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
and package winner, Xing Yao High School.

337
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,040
[audience in unison] Xing Yao!

338
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,880
Xing Yao!

339
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Xing Yao!

340
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,160
As expected.

341
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,360
It's said Song Ci from Xing Yao
is formidable.

342
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,720
He knocked out Zhuo Yu within 15 minutes.

343
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm sleepy.

344
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,840
[sighs]
I'm so sleepy.

345
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,960
SONG CI, XING YAO HIGH SCHOOL

346
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,720
[Siyang] Xing Yao's players
in the game against Yu Feng

347
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,040
are all substitutes except Hu Liangliang.

348
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,160
That's why they lost with a score of 0-3.

349
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,800
They can't compare
with Xing Yao's main players.

350
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,280
We will have many other schools

351
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,600
as our opponents except for Xing Yao.

352
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,400
We did get into the next round,

353
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,360
but every qualified school is strong.

354
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,360
Don't be careless.

355
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,680
Understand?

356
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,880
[players] Understood.

357
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,680
Stop playing with your phone.
Have some soup.

358
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,080
-Your goose.
-Thanks.

359
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,840
[woman 1] Try it.

360
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
It's good.

361
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,160
Here's your cold dish.

362
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,080
[Mr. He] Thanks.

363
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,000
-[man 2] I like it.
-[He Xinglong] Dad.

-Let's have this.
-I'm back.

365
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,480
-This one?
-Is your game over?

366
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,640
What's the result?

367
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,600
-We won.
-[Mr. He chuckles]

368
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,440
That's my boy.

369
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,160
You must be tired. Get some rest.

370
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,880
Dad, I'm not tired.

371
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,440
I didn't play today.

372
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,320
-Huh?
-Let me help you.

373
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,520
Fine, I'll let you.

374
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,320
There are two more tables.

375
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Dad, can I only help you
when I'm not playing tennis?

376
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,880
Should I just quit the club

377
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,520
if that's so?

378
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,280
I'd love that.

379
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,440
But will you tell me
that you also want to quit school later?

380
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,960
[chuckles]
Okay. It's quite busy.

381
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,400
Serve here. I'll be in the kitchen.

382
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,160
[man 2] Let's have this, okay?

383
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,440
Only this?

384
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,920
-[man 2] Yes.
-I want to have something else.

385
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
-Fine.
-You can lose weight anytime.

386
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,080
I'd like this too.

387
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,200
It looks good.

388
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,040
[man 2 sighs]

389
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,400
[He Xinglong] Here you go.

390
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
-[man 2] Thank you.
-Enjoy.

391
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Thanks.

392
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,280
Hey.

393
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,800
Where are Qiao Chen and Lu Xia?

394
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,640
I went to the toilet and they were gone.

395
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,000
They went to reserve the seats first.

396
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,880
-Quickly, let's go.
-Okay, faster.

397
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,840

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,680
Don't go away.

401
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,720
Why won't you eat? Hmm?

402
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Follow Qiao Chen's example,

403
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,080
and eat some more.

404
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,440
Huh? Is that Baiyang?

405
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,560
Baiyang?

406
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,800
[Jiale] Is he petting a cat?

407
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Look at him.

408
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,320
Look at his loving smile

409
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,680
and gentle touching.

410
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,920
Is he the Zhang Baiyang we know?

411
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Why won't you eat? Hm?

412
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,720
You don't want
to be like Qiao Chen, right?

413
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,040
Then set me as your example.

414
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,600
Be a strong cat.

415

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,320
Whoa. This guy is holy amazing.

500
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,960
EAT MOST HOT DOGS WITHIN THREE MINUTES

501
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,000
What are you reading?

502
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,920
Guinness World Records.

503
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,160
This guy ate 12 hamburgers
within 3 minutes.

504
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,560
That means four per minute,

505
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,480
which is half of the hamburgers
that I can eat.

506
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
You're quick with the figures now.

507
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,720
[chuckles]

508
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,880
I will try it.

509
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,120
A man would put so much energy
and passion in one thing.

510
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,200
Why would they do that?

511
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,560
There is no money

512
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,920
or material reward for setting
a Guinness World Records.

513
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,160
[Qiao Chen] It is designed
to inspire humans' potential.

514
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,160
However small something is,

515
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,720
you can do your best to do it
as long as you are

516
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,240
interested and brave.

517
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,760
You don't need any reason.

518
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,320
[chuckles]

519
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,240
You're just like him.

520
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,040
Huh? Who?

521
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,280
My younger brother.

522
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,880
Does success really matter?

523
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,000
Of course.

524
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,240
A man is living to challenge himself.

525
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,280
Honestly, I do appreciate these people.

526
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,160
[Qiao Chen] What they do may be
a bunch of dumb things to others,

527
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,240
but they do it anyway
without asking for reasons and results.

528
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,000
That's called passion, right?

529
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,920
[chuckles]

530
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,040
It's making me hungry.

531
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,280
I'll go to the Hamburger Challenge now.

532
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,560
YU QING

533
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,560
YU QING CHEERLEADING SQUAD
CALL PENG XIANG

534
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,400
[Peng] Please fill in
the application form.

535
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,920
Is the tennis club the only one
that needs to have a cheerleader squad?

536
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,360
What are you talking about?

537
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,000
Our club participated in the nationals.

538
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,120
Right.

539
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,400
Just get some people and shout loudly.

540
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,840
A cheerleader squad? Really?

541
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,840
[Mu] Give it back.

542
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,840
You...

543
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,800
What's wrong with him?

544
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,400
Peng Xiang, don't be upset.

545
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,880
Come to think of it.

546
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,160
You, Ying, and I,

547
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,160
we are always here.

548
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,880
We came through such difficult games.

549
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,560
Goddess.

550
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,960
What?

551
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,080
-[bleating]
-[snickers]

552
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,000
[Peng] You are so childish.

553
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,680
Why don't they pay attention to tennis?

554
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,120
And why aren't they willing to join us?

555
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,040
-This...
-Look over there.

556
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,640
-There they are.
-Quick.

557
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
-Let's go.
-There.

558
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,280
Peng Xiang.

559
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,280
Can we register
for the cheerleader squad here?

560
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,200
We'd like to apply.

561
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,480
-Yes, we'd love to.
-Of course.

562
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,680
You played well
against the No. 3 High School.

563
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,720
Could we go to the scene someday?

564
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,400
We would love to cheer for our school.

565
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,200
-Sure, here are the forms.
-Give us one too.

566
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,360
-I'll have one.
-Me too.

567
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
-[Mu] Everyone will get a form.
-[Peng] Don't worry.

568
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,640
Please fill in the form.

569
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,760
-Here's the pen.
-Here.

570
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
-Where do we write?
-Yes.

571
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,720
-Here.
-Here, right?

572
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,240
Mu.

573
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,080
Am I daydreaming?

574
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,360
-It hurts.
-[Peng] Really?

575
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,240
Yes.

576
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,680
[chuckles]

577
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,120
Everyone is in good form
after the municipal qualifying.

578
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,480
Yes.

579
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,840
-I'm only worried about your hands.
-Coach.

580
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,400
Nobody can relax
before the end of the nationals.

581
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,720
[heavy exhale]

582
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,280
It's comfortable in the gym.

583
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,080
It has an air conditioner,
and no one has to sunbathe.

584
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,160
I can do this for two more hours.

585
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,840
As long as Yan is not here.

586
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,120
-[Jiale giggles]
-Jiale.

587
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,480
[gasps]

588
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,920
You have to double
your physical training today.

589
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,000
What? Why?

590
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,360
Don't worry. It's not a random decision.

591
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,720
I've seen your training video again.

592
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,240
You have to enhance your physical ability.

593
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,280
[Yan Zhiming] This is my plan.

594
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,440
Listen.

595
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,760
Wait.

596
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,960
I'm having fun...

597
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,760
-I...
-Hm?

598
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,800
I mean I've already trained for two hours.

599
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,440
I might go into shock
if you train me for so long.

600
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,200
Then do you need a cup of Yan-juice?

601
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,160
No, don't bother.

602
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,640
Some protein powder would do.

603
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,000
Mm, fine.

604
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,960
Five sets with 30 repetitions
of deep squats.

605
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,200
Run 2.5 kilometers
with incline 2, speed 7,

606
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,560
10 sets of equipment,
5 sets of shoulder and back training,

607
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,320
-5 sets of leg lifting.
-Wait.

608
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,240
[Jiale] Yan.

609
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,480
Are you training a tennis player
or a bodybuilder?

610
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,080
Believe in my data.

611
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,159
[gasps]

612
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,440
And please send me
your training video every day.

613
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,920
I will check it with our captain.

614
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,920
Okay.

615
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,600
[scoffs]

616
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,000
-[line beeps]
-Chi. Help me.

617
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,280
-Yan is killing me.
-[Yan Zhiming] There is a 100% chance

618
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,600
that you will ask Chi for help.

619
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,280
So I kept his phone.

620
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,199
Train yourself well.

621
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,960
-[line beeps]
-[sharp exhale]

622

[scoffs]

624
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,679
Is there anything that can defeat me?

625
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,800
Mm.

626
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,360
Good. Speed up.

627
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,920
Hey, what are you doing?

628
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,920
Nothing.

629
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,160
I just want to practice
your unique skill, Snake-ball.

630
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,560
So I'd like to record your motion
as my reference later.

631
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,680
I'll study it.

632
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,800
You want to practice Snake-ball?

633
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,960
Hm.

634
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,400
It's a strong skill.

635
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,920
[gasps]

636
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,560
What's your point?

637
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,080
Are you hating on speed players?

638
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,080
Listen, I've been hanging out at the gym.

639
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,400
Look.

640
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,120
What do you think?

641
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
[cell phone ringing]

642
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,920
Hello?

643
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,760
[Yan Zhiming] Don't play tricks.

644
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,760
What?

645
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,800
[Yan Zhiming] Why are you
recording Baiyang's feet?

646
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,080
What? How did you know that?

647
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,480
[Yan Zhiming] I can see whatever you do
in the monitoring room.

648
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,880
Train yourself well.

649
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,160
[gasps]

650
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,120
Protein powder, right?

651
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,960
Fine, I'll drink it.

652
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,960
[sighs]

[breathes heavily]

654
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,200
I've been to the hospital.

655
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,080
The doctor gave me this.

656
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,680
I told you.

657
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,080
My left hand has already...

658
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,960
Are you still using your left hand?

659
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,880
You will be disabled
if you keep doing this.

660
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,080
Do you understand?

661
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,440
[panting]

662
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,720
Chi.

663
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,400
I'm worried about you.

664
