00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,560
I think doubles is more suitable for me,

169
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,520
while singles easily reveal my weakness.

170
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,040
Doubles?

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,280
Who will be your partner?

172
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
[quirky music]

173
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Do you mean me?

174
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,280
Have more confidence in yourself.

175
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,000
[sighs]

176
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,160
We have no confidence in ourselves.

177
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,360
Don't worry.

178
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,160
I found some tips
for improving tennis skills.

179
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
[quirky music]

180
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,520
What do you see in this picture?

181
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,480
I see people and a dog.

182
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,360
[clicks tongue]
You are so simpleminded and weak.

183
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,640
Don't you realize how they developed
chemistry with each other?

184
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,240
[Huang Jing] What can you see
in Dachi's eyes?

185
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,280
It's concentration.

186
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,680
It's supreme concentration.

187
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,720
He's observing this dog

188
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,280
because the dog is cooperating with Jiale
like a mushroom growing after the rain.

189
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
[gasps]
Mushrooms...

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,640
Aren't they my favorite springtime food?

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,200
No.

192
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,760
Dachi is learning from this dog.

193
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,120
Don't you feel ashamed? Huh?

194
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,120
Why can't you learn from this dog?

195
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,080
Go along with me.

196
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,440
[sighs]

197
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,440
I agree with you.

198
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,400
You know yourself well.

199
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,120
[sighs]

200
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,120
What's wrong? Why are you silent?

201
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,120
I'm just thinking...

202
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
if I should first train a dog as they did.

203
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,080
I think it is better
to train ourselves hard.

204
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,200
You are wrong.

205
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,120
We can't catch up to others
by just training hard.

206
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Those who can become official players
must have secret ways of training.

207
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,640
What kinds of secret ways?

208
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,440
Think about it.

209
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,560
Captain loves fishing.

210
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,000
Yan Zhiming loves juicing.

211
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,160
Baiyang loves running.

212
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,960
Xinglong loves cooking.

213
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,960
Dachi and Jiale love playing frisbee.

214
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,960
Zhuo Zhi loves his younger brother.

215
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,160
Did you find any commonalities?

216
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,520
No.

217
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,960
They have other hobbies besides tennis.

218
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,160
Maybe these hobbies have some connections
with tennis.

219
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,680
Do you mean that we can't play tennis well
because we don't have any hobbies?

220
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,960
You said it!

221
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,840
But Lu Xia doesn't have any hobbies.

222
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,760
[Huang Jing] Hey.

223
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,280
That's because he's good at pretending.
No one knows yet.

224
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
So we have to have hobbies.

225
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Don't worry. I made preparations.

226
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,560
This is our starting point
of becoming the main players of the team.

227
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,640
Mm-hm.

228
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
[doorbell rings]

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
[playful music]

230
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,120
[Xiangqian] Wait a minute.

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,040
Who are you?

232
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,920
Hello, is Mr. Lu Xiangqian home?

233
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,480
Huh?

234
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,800
-Are you Captain Siyang?
-Are you okay?

235
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm fine. We'll eat hot pot tonight.
I'm making charcoal.

236
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
-Oh.
-[Xiangqian] Why are you here?

237
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,440
Why didn't you go to school today?

238
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,880
I asked for sick leave.

239
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
Mr. Lu, I want to talk to you
about Lu Xia.

240
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,000
Okay. Please come in.

241
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,080
Mm-hm.
[coughs]

242
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,560
[Xiangqian] Hurry up and eat.

243
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,120
Mm-mm.

244
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,320
Don't eat it if you don't like it.

245
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,160
Put the pineapple down.
It is not cooked thoroughly.

246
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
[quirky music]

247
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
Well...
[clears throat]

248
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,960
are you going out tomorrow?

249
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,640
If you'll stay at home,

250
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,320
I want to build a cat kennel for Karubin
in the backyard.

251
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,000
If you are free, come and help me.

252
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,720
I will go train tomorrow.

253
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,880
Your captain is absent.
It's okay to fool around.

254
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,720
You can practice at home.

255
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,240
We have to train together
under such circumstances.

256
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,640
We can't make the captain worry about us.

257
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,280
It's not like you.

258
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,960
[Xiangqian]
Oh. It seems that you enjoy it a lot.

259
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,760
You were feeling blue before.

260
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
I like playing tennis.

261
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,880
Is it wrong?

262
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,800
No. You're right.
I will do it on my own tomorrow.

263
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,000
Then after training,
will you go fishing with me?

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
No, I won't.

265
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,160
Okay. Anything you say.
It's tomorrow noon, right? It's a deal.

266
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,400
[Xiangqian] If you are done,

267
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,800
let's drink and then you can go to sleep.

268
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,800
[sighs]

269
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,040
The watermelon is fully cooked.
Why don't you give it a try?

270
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,880
Hey, Siyang.

271
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,360
How about going fishing
tomorrow afternoon?

272
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,680
[Lu Xia] Are you ready?

273
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
Are you ready?

274
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,560
[Xiangqian] I'm ready!

275
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,120
[chuckles]
I'm ready.

276
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,040
Let's go.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,960
Why are you going fishing
with my tennis bag?

278
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,240
I think I can practice tennis with you
when I take a break from fishing.

279
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,200
Here.

280
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,360
Did you wash your hands?

281
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,360
How dare you say that!

282
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,840
Are my hands dirtier than your bag?
Take it.

283
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,800
[sighs]

284
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Let's go!

[Xiangqian groaning]

287
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,560
The watermelon was not cooked thoroughly
last night.

288
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,760
I'm old. I can't eat raw food.

289
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,480
I have a stomachache.
[groaning]

290
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,920
[Xiangqian]
Go assemble the fishing rod first.

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,120
I will go soon.
[groaning]

292
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,480
I wouldn't dare overexert myself.

[groans]

294
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,200
Go!

295
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Are you okay?

Lu Xia?

302
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,560
My father fooled me again.

303
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,560
[sighs]
Have a seat.

304
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
You don't seem to know how to fish.

305
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,560
He fooled me into coming here.

306
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,600
You also came to Yu Qing
because of your father, right?

307
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,160
I joined Yu Qing to break his record
at the national tournament

308
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,800
and earn his recognition.

Did you surpass him?

It doesn't matter now.

312
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,520
I played tennis
because I wanted to defeat him.

313

failures and setbacks,

318

no matter if I can defeat him or not,

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,000
I can't give up tennis.

It might be too late to say so,

330
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,400
but I want to be Yu Qing's pillar.

331
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,320
Can you tell me how to do it?

332
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
[exhales sharply]

333
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,560
Look at the fishing rod.

334
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,160
Without a holder,

335
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,320
the fishing rod wavers in your hand.

336
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,640
What you need to do...

337
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320
is to find your holder.

338
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,520
[gasping]

339
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
I didn't bring it.

340
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,200
[chuckles]

341
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,680
Let's go. Let's go find your holder.

342
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,080
YU QING

343
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,320
[Lu Xia] Is your arm okay?

344
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,080
If you mean my right arm,

345
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,880
it is okay.

346
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
[upbeat music]

347
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,280
Captain, it is fair this way.

[Lu Xia grunts]

350
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,320
[clicks tongue]

351
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,680
I wonder if Lu Xia can catch
any fish today.

352
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,480
Forget it. It depends on him.

353
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
[somber music]

354
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,600
[Siyang sighs]

355
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,600
[Siyang] Lu Xia,

356
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,520
please remember.

357
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,000
Don't let your record hold you back.

358
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,440
It's already in the past.

359
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,520
You need to think about
how to break your record

360
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,080
using your past experiences.

361
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,360
Someday, you can play tennis
in your own style.

362
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,880
Next time, you have to defeat me.

363
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,280
When can we play tennis again?

364
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,880
[exhales sharply]

365
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,480
Lu Xia, you will become Yu Qing's pillar.

366
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
[light music]

367
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
[clicks tongue]

369
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,400
Do you really think that drawing
is going to help us play tennis?

370
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,120
Of course.

371
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,640
If Lu Xia defeats me next time,

372
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
I will publish a comic book
with him as the villain.

373
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,160
I can't defeat him in a match,
but I can in my drawings.

374
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
[chuckles]

375
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,320
[sighs]

376
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,120
Don't move.

377
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,120
It distracts me from the composition.

378
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,480
You've been drawing me for a whole day.

379
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,440
I can't endure it anymore.

380
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
It's almost done. One final touch.

381
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,840
[exhales sharply]

382
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
[quirky music]

383
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,920
How is it? Isn't it good?

384
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,480
Is this me?

385
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Yes. What's wrong?
Doesn't it look like you?

386
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
[Huang Jing] They're very alike. Huh?

387
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,800
I used techniques of realism.
How vivid it is!

388
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,760
You drew pretty fast.
Let me have a look. Quick.

389
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
[Xiuwen sighs]

390
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,480
Mm-hm?

391
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,240
[coughs]

392
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,440
[Huang Jing] Xiuwen, I think that...

393
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,760
we are not suitable for the arts.

394
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,360
[boy sobbing]

395
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,360
[sobbing continues]

396
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
[boy whimpering]

397
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,080
Hey kid, why are you crying here?
Be tough like a man.

398
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,520
I'm still young,
so I can cry when I feel unhappy.

399
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,680
[boy] I had confidence
in my abilities in sports,

400
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,440
however, he suddenly showed up
and made a mess of me.

401
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,320
I don't want to join the race.

402
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
Hey, hey, hey.

403
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,560
Hey, be a man and accept the result.

404
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,280
Even though you lost this time,
you can win next time.

405
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,320
You don't understand
how important this race was to me.

406
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,600
[boy] I could have won the championship.

407
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,680
I could have joined
the track and field team.

408
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,720
I have practiced a lot for this day.

409
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,840
Do you like running so much?

410
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,280
Of course.

411
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,560
I don't spend my free time
on animations and games,

412
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,880
[boy] I spend it on practicing running.

413
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,480
Because you love running so much,
you must not give up so easily.

414
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,920
Let me ask you. Why do you like running?

415
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
I've been running fast since I was young.

416
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,080
[Baiyang chuckles]
That's it.

417
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,560
You like running because you run fast.

418
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,160
For those who really love running,
even if they naturally run slow,

419
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,240
they will run faster and become stronger
because of their love for running.

420
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Do you mean people run fast
because they love running?

421
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,520
Mm-hm.

422
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,880
Hey, is there any sport you like?

423
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,040
Me?

424
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,640
[soft chuckle]

425
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,080
[Baiyang] Here you are.

426
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,240
Can you teach me
how to play tennis next time?

427
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,000
[Baiyang] I will teach you
after you win first place in the marathon.

428
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
[traffic noise]

429
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,040
It really is different.

430
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,760
[Siyang] You need to think about
how to break your record

431
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,240
using your past experiences.

432
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,360
Someday, you can play tennis
in your own style.

433
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,200
[Ying] Aunt, I'm in the office right now.
Where is your package?

434
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,560
Okay, I will find it on my own.

435
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,680
Why are you here?

436
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,280
I came to pick up a package for my aunt.

437
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,400
There it is.

438
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,160

[thwacks]

440
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,240
You can leave the key.
I will lock the door.

441
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,160
It's okay.

442
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,960
I will wait for you.

443
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,440

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,960
Can you get my jacket?

447
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,760
-This one?
-Please put it on.

448

The girl you like?

452
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,200
[Qiao Chen] The girl you like.

[inhales sharply]

455
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,440
I want to ask you a question.

456
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,040
You can return it tomorrow.

457
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,120
I don't mean this.

458
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,480
On the way to school on that day,

459
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,560
I saw you and Qiao Chen.

460
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,080
You seemed to be
talking about a girl, right?

461
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,520
What's wrong?

462
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,680
Hmm. I overheard your conversation.

463
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,840
Well...

464
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,440
Well...

465
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,440
What happened to you and her?

466
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,840
I just confirmed it with him.

467
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,880
What did he say?

468
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,200
He didn't reply to me clearly.

469
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,600
[gasps]

471
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
That must happen all the time.

472
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,320
Don't take it to heart.

473
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,720
Mmm.

474
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,480
Even if he leaves now,
he will return to the club someday.

475
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,800
Huh?

476
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,320
The tennis club?

477
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,160
Who are you talking about?

478
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,640
I mean the captain.

479
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,280
[giggles]

480
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,400
I'll leave the keys and your jacket here.
I shall leave now.

481
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,520
Don't put on...

482
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,960
[giggling]

483
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,560
I see.

[Jingwu] Your appointment in the hospital
will be in ten days.

488
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,040
I arranged the accommodations
and bought a plane ticket for you.

489
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,840
Someone will pick you up at the airport.

490
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,480
[Siyang] Thank you.

491
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,760
[sighs]

492
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,000
[Dayong] Are you really going abroad?

493
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,280
Yes.

494
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
Though the situation
was stable temporarily,

495
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,840
I still want to use my left arm...

496
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,640
and join the national tournament
with you all.

497
