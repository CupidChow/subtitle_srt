returns it,

it somehow becomes magnetized to you.

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,640
it has been two years
since we last entered the nationals.

164
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,920
The provincial qualifiers
was as far as we could go.

165
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm not.

166
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,360
I just want to say that entering
the national competition is enough.

167
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,920
But we have to lead Yu Qing further
through hard work.

168
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,280
Further?

169
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,880
That is wonderful.

170
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,760
The national competition
is just the beginning.

171
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,880
We're sure to be national champions.

172
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,520
It's a deal.

173
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,800
Siyang.

174
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,160
You are left-handed?

175
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,120
Yes.

176
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,400
I can play tennis with my left hand.

177
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,880
You've always used your right hand
to play with the seniors, right?

[soft chuckle]

[Dayong chuckles]

181
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,480
[Dayong] At that time, I was so determined
to go further with Siyang.

182
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,200
But things aren't as easy as we thought.

Aren't you left-handed?

189

Why did you use your right hand?

190

You think you don't need to use
your left hand to play against me?

but you're so unreasonable.

Dachi, I'm sorry.

206
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,920
We had better quit the tennis club

207
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,320
if the seniors bully the newcomers.

208
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,560
Actually, Siyang had been playing that way

209
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,400
just to cater to our seniors.

210
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,200

It's nothing.

That's good.

216
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,800
[Dayong] Didn't you say

217
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,800
that we were going to
lead Yu Qing further?

218
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,520
If you quit the team,

219
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,680
then I'll do the same.

220

So what should you do?
You friend is giving up.

223
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,560
[Dayong] Captain Dahe.

224
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,760
I did an investigation.

225
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,040
I know you were wronged.

226
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,200
[Dahe] The school has addressed
what happened.

227

-He wants to apologize personally.
-That's not necessary.

228

A determined person

229
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,640
has more energy than you can imagine.

230
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,960
If you don't think
the club is good enough,

231
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,560
then why not make it better
instead of giving up?

232
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,480
[Dahe] If you want to achieve a goal,

233
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,280
then you can't think of giving up at all.

234
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,960
Although, as captain,
I'm not doing anything special,

235
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,240
I want to lead Yu Qing to success.

236
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,480
I have never given up, even for a moment.

237
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,000
Since you have such talent and strength,

238
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,840
I hope you can become
the pillar of the Yu Qing Tennis Club.

Does he want to finish the game

I've seen how you protect your arm.

If this continues, your arm will break.

332
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
He didn't use his special move

333
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,600
because he wants to exhaust Siyang

334
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,320
so that his arm tires out.

JI JINGWU, 5
MU SIYANG, 7

338
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,240
[Jingwu] I have waited for a year

339
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,200
since I lost to you.

340
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,240
I had four professional players
on the court

341
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
and told them to play like you.

342
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,040

344
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,760
I thought of my opponent as you.

345
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,440
[heavy breathing]

346
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,120
[Jingwu] I did all of that
just for this day.

347
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
[tense music]

348
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,000
[sighs sharply]
One more time!

349
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,920
[Jingwu] I've gone through
enough failures.

350
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,240
This match can determine whether
Xing Yao can enter the nationals or not.

351
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,480
Whether this match
is for me or Xing Yao...

352
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,040
[Xing Yao students] Xing Yao!

353
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,320
I will defeat you.

354
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,960
[Xing Yao students] Xing Yao!

355
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,000
Let me see how long
your left arm can last.

356
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,680
[Jingwu] Even if this match lasts
for two hours, I'm ready.

357

[ominous music]

358
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,720
It really is a battle of strength.

359
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,840
He probably decided
to set his plan in motion

360
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
when he found out Siyang
wanted to end this quickly.

361
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,680
But Siyang's injured arm
can't last for long.

362
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,040
There's not enough time.

363
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,080
Siyang promised to end this in 30 minutes.

364
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,640
[Dayong] There's only three minutes left.

We are already taking control
of the situation.

369
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,840
But the captain is being too considerate.

370
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,320
This match is a disadvantage
to him as well.

371

[panting]

372
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,960
[Jingwu] Siyang still plays brilliantly.

373
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,320
Every time he hits a ball,

374
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,960
he forces me into the far end.

375
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,440
[umpire 1] Out.

376
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,760
I hope you can become
the pillar of the Yu Qing Tennis Club.

[heroic music continues]

379
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,960
[Jingwu] Playing a match this long will
cause permanent damage to your injury.

380
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,640
Give up now.

381
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
Make the attack.

382
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,200
As long as you attack,
I can see your weakness.

383
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,840
[Xing Yao students] Xing Yao will win!
Xing Yao will win!

384
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,880
[Jingwu] Impossible.

385
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,760
What's wrong with the captain?

386
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,400
Why didn't he take the opportunity
and attack?

387
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,080
Was he too tired to notice?

388
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,720
If you noticed it,
how can the captain not notice it?

389
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,320
[grunts]

390
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,240
[Jingwu] No!

392
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,760
[umpire 1] It's 15-40.

393
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,720
It seems

394
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,080
you have won this battle of strength.

396
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,560
It's been 30 minutes.

397
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Captain.

398
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Lu Xia.

399
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,400
Please be Yu Qing's pillar.

400
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,240
Is this what makes the pillar of Yu Qing?

[Zilong] Doesn't he care
about his tennis career?

404
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
He even chose Yu Qing's victory over it.

405
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,720
Mu Siyang is stronger than I imagined.

406
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,480
He is so admirable.

407
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,560
Don't lose, Captain.

408
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
[upbeat music]

409
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,640
I will quickly defeat my opponents
in the next matches.

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,280
But anyway,

411
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,960
Yu Qing must defeat Xing Yao
in the next match.

412
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,840
[Zhuo Zhi] I should have
figured it out earlier.

413
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,520
It's not about ending this quickly.

414
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,160
It's clear that you're willing
to sacrifice anything

415
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,240
to win the game for Yu Qing.

Hmm.

425
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,280
Is the captain hesitating?

426
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,160
The competition lasted for an hour.

427
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,040
If Siyang really has an arm injury,

428
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,440
his limits will soon show.

will lose the whole competition.

are ending our journey here.

but I'm passing the title to you.

He's Xing Yao's captain.

He can't lose this match.

aimed at the opponent's wrist
to make his racket drop.
