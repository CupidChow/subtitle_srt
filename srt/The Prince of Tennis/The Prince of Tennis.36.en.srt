as the one who made that deal before.

174

You just said

175
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
you wanted to win this game
no matter what.

176
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
So did I.

177
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,560
I also wanted to win

178
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320

[Zhuo Zhi] Finish all of this.

That should do.

It's not as easy as you say.

196
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,920
It's just a math test. It's easy.

You can do difficult things easily.

as well as you can

you can do everything well.

Why did you run to me?

215
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,200
Then why do you say sorry for me
every time?

216
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,040
[young Zhuo Zhi]
Because I'm your big brother.

with Chi Dayong and Xinglong.

338
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,200
Lu Xia will play
against Xinglong and Chi Dayong.

339
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,880
Xinglong will attack
with Earthquake Smashes

340
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,040
while Dayong will defend Xinglong.

341

[sighs]

342
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,240
That sounds horrible.

343
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,280
I especially made this training plan

344
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,440
for dealing with Tian Zilong
from Hai Guang.

345
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,560
[Yan Zhiming] He is a formidable opponent

346
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,120
who possesses both strength and speed.

347
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,760
You can imitate his attacks
with this training.

348
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,640
That sounds good.

349
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,400
Mm-hm.

350
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,280

You will play against Baiyang,
Zhuo Zhi, and Qiao Chen.

353
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,880
Huh? Why do I have to deal
with three players?

354
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,400
Because you have to improve your speed.

355
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,520
Ah.

There's no time to think
about how to return it.

Oh, I almost forgot.

This is a special training,
so I will score it.

The team with the lower score

must try the Energy Special Yan-juice

You are much faster than before.

All right, the next group

00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,960
is Baiyang and Qiao Chen's
cooperation training.

412
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,960
[Yan Zhiming] You have already
played doubles together before,

413
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,160
so I don't need to say much.

414
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
What's wrong with you?

415
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,520
Let me read the training plan.

416
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Let's do it the usual way.

417
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,000
I make the plan
and you supervise the training.

418
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,040
What do you think?

419
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,720
Well, you better be careful
if you're going to slack off.

420
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,200
I will not let you go
if you don't finish the plan.

421
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Just wait and see.

-Go.
-Go.

-You are good at going.

horns on your head? My head hurts.

[Baiyang] You have horns
on your head, right?

Zhuo Zhi.

428
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,880
I also made a training plan for you.

429
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,120
Huh?

430
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,840
This is what you made for me?

431
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,000
Right.

432
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,480
I adjusted this pitching machine
to Yuan Chi's speed.

433

You can give it a try now.

It's up to you.

I believe you can have

438
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,000
the same speed as Yuan Chi after this.

439

That sounds interesting.

Those achievements are in the past.

about how to make a breakthrough

with your experiences.

466

507
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,760
Then it will be an instructional match.

508
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,480
[Yuan Chi] We will show them
what tennis is.

509
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,080

Hey. You're the little one, right?

00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,280
You just can't avoid your enemy.

512
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,280
I can show you what tennis is right now.

513
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,160
The final round is coming soon.

514

We will fulfill our promise.

515

We will keep being unstoppable

516
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,320
and enter the nationals.

517
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,840
[Zilong] Then we will achieve
our third consecutive championship

when you return.

It's on the day of the match.

Don't worry.

524
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,040
We will end the match before your surgery.

525
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,400
And we will bring you
the provincial championship trophy.

You must not lose

[Sheng] Yuan Chi, the captain messaged us
to go meet them.

I can beat him in 15 minutes.

And we won't disturb the other patients.

[Jie] Don't worry.

00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,560
We have done practical training
for the national tournament.

They are on the way.

-I'll go check on them.

training and resting,

670
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,600
you will be in a bad state.

671
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,440
I will find a way. I will win.

672
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,840
Every success requires patience.

673
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,400
I have told you before.

674
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,440
You can ask a veteran for help

675
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,760
if you have any problems in the court.

676
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,240
It will be better than practicing alone.

677
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,960
I want to play my own tennis.

678
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,760
Other people's experiences can't help me.
