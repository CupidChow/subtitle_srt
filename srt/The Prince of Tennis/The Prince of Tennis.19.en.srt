169
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,960
Also, Lu Xia has no fixed partner.

170
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,040
So from Monday to Friday,
according to the set schedule,

171
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
he will join a different team each day.

172
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,120
He can also monitor the others.

173
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,200
Next, we will have team training.

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
In addition,

175
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,080
in preparation for the future matches,
we need an aggressive player.

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,160
I suggest selecting someone
among all top players

177
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,240
to enhance our strength.

[teacher] You caused trouble
on the first day.

I'm in charge here.

Go and mop there!

Why? I don't want to.
I just want to mop here.

If you can't jump, don't jump.

Your snake-ball is often out of bounds.

I think you both are the ideal candidates.

The coach's training plan
not only betters your strengths

but helps overcome your weaknesses.

256
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
We can improve our competitiveness
before the provincial tournament.

257

For everyone, this is crucial.

So, you're working out here?

Since I volunteered to join the selection,
I should train myself.

You can never be an aggressive player.

Pairing up with you

is the best.

305
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,480
Let me tell you first.

306
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,800
Even if you want to split up
with your Golden Partner Dayong,

I can't be your doubles partner.

Who said that I'll split up with him?

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,119
Did the coach say that?

311
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,359
You care about this so much.

312
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,440
Why don't you try harder?

313
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,760
Although Dayong will support you,
you still have to work hard.

314
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,960
Ah.

315
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880

Are you my friend?

Yes, I'm your friend.
That's why I came to talk to you.

If you really split up with Chi Dayong,

you wouldn't have time to rest here.

Trying hard is useless.

I can't run faster than others.

because Chi Dayong wasn't my partner.

As long as we are partners,
we can definitely win a match.

[Tang Jiale] I was saying that

Yes.

Ah! No problem.

00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,280
[Lu Xia] The captain is back.

673
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,600
If he was here now,

674
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,000
would you say that?

Hey,

678
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,400
based on the ability of our team,

679
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,640
is it possible for us to enter the final?

680
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,280
I don't think there's a problem.

681
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,560
Everyone is active
and practices every day.

682
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,440
If we keep this up,
we will enter the final.

683
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,680
I have faith in ourselves.

684

It's all thanks to you

for taking on the responsibility
of Yu Feng.

By the way, don't let them know.

Otherwise, it won't work.

Don't worry.

That's how Yu Feng does things.

I bought it. What do you think?

Didn't you have dinner with your teammate
whose family has a roast goose restaurant?

I wanted to eat it, so I bought some.

Can you eat them all by yourself?

What? Do you want some? Aren't you full?
