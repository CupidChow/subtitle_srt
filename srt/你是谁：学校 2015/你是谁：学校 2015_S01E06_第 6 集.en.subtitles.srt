1
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,140
What?

2
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,558
KONG TAE-GWANG
SEKANG HIGH, SECOND YEAR

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,475
School?

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,644
It's no fun.

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,398
That's why I'm always looking
for something fun.

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,194
Gosh. I died.

7
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,238
But want to know something?

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,117
This interview
is even less fun than school.

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,161
Please leave.

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,840
What is it?

11
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,009
Actually...

12
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,929
I have a problem.

13
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,723
I don't want to hear your problems.

14
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,100
Find someone else.

15
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,020
When I was in Tongyeong,

16
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,359
there was an infamous outcast in my class.

17
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,781
She was the class president
and popular in junior high,

18
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,661
but she didn't know her place
and her life was ruined instantly.

19
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,710
I mean, friends can fool around.

20
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,713
But she killed herself.

21
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,385
So, I had to transfer
when I did nothing wrong.

22
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,312
So?

23
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,815
What do you want to say?

24
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,859
Can someone who died...

25
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,821
come back from the dead?

26
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,575
Pretending to be someone else

27
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,578
and fooling everyone around her.

28
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,379
So, I want to look into
whether that outcast

29
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,257
died or is still alive.

30
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,556
Your friend died...

31
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,268
and that's all you can think of?

32
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,272
I feel sorry for you.

33
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:34,070
Since the day
you transferred to my grade school,

34
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,865
I have been feeling sorry for you.

35
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,881
I knew you would say that.

36
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,759
Our little outcast.

37
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,304
You haven't changed a bit.

38
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:03,892
Hey.

39
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,518
Lee Eun-bi.

40
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,062
It's been a while.

41
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,243
Do you have any idea

42
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,662
what I went through
in Tongyeong because of you?

43
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,167
You little...

44
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,055
Do you have a death wish?

45
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,600
Gosh.

46
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,937
I hate being woken up from a nap.

47
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,026
Sorry.

48
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:00,782
I have...

49
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,410
something to tell you as well.

50
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,707
About my twin sister,

51
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,585
who lived in Tongyeong

52
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,672
who you mentioned, Lee Eun-bi.

53
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,635
My friends here don't know about her.

54
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,888
I only recently found out myself.

55
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,519
I went to Tongyeong
because I heard she died

56
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,230
after being bullied in school.

57
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,488
So, it was you.

58
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,750
What?

59
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,671
I know...

60
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,800
everything that you did.

61
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,220
What...

62
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,724
should I do with you?

63
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,231
I need to think it over.

64
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,835
Next.

65
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,338
For example what?

66
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,050
It's about the movie
you guys like, Twilight.

67
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:30,723
"Realizes." Become aware.
What did she become aware of?

68
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,518
Want me to tell you a secret too?

69
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,563
Don't believe anything I say.

70
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,191
I'm a total liar.

71
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,734
It comes after "that".

72
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,071
You know...

73
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,615
my name is...

74
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,660
Ko Eun-byeol.

75
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,789
The moment Bella finds out that Edward

76
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:59,919
has a superpower...

77
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:05,466
"Much less" is lesser than "much"...

78
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,386
It is dramatically lesser than something.

79
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,639
"In the book..." In the book there is...

80
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,307
Gi-tae

81
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,684
Has Tae-gwang gone crazy?

82
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,520
-Isn't he always crazy?
-This one also...

83
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,106
He's actually paying attention
to the class.

84
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,484
"Leaves out."
This one is a very easy idiom.

85
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,610
You're right.

86
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,281
Kong Tae-gwang,

87
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,491
"Leaves out." What does that mean?

88
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,379
That's more like it.

89
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,966
Park Min-jun?

90
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,635
To exclude something.

91
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,013
Right. To exclude this and that.

92
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,515
So, what did they exclude? Let's find out.

93
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,808
To exclude.

94
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,023
They excluded something
from the book. What was it?

95
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,031
Hey.

96
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,201
Eat with me.

97
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,706
Sure. Why not?

98
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,389
Do you think the new girl likes Tae-gwang?

99
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,936
I feel bad for her. He's a total madman.

100
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,521
Right?

101
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,192
What are you thinking about?

102
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,402
Nothing.

103
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,911
What I said earlier...

104
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,125
It was a bit ridiculous but interesting.

105
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,173
Have you told anyone by any chance?

106
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,592
Don't worry.

107
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,054
You must not know me yet.

108
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,973
I'm an infamous madman here.

109
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,308
No one would believe a word I say.

110
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,605
Really?

111
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,401
I would like to ask a favor.

112
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,737
Please pretend you didn't hear anything.

113
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,907
But you know,
I am not the one you should ask.

114
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,035
Do you know what kind of temper
Eun-byeol has?

115
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,705
No one in school can touch her.

116
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,375
You'd better fix things with her soon.

117
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,505
You said you wanted to eat with me.

118
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,132
Why aren't you eating?

119
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:52,925
What a waste.

120
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,523
Su-mi, I have a favor to ask.

121
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,774
What is it?

122
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,943
Go to House of Love

123
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,030
and get me something
with the outcast's handwriting on it.

124
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,241
That's easy. Okay.

125
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,295
I'll give you five minutes
before calling you up.

126
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,172
Yes, sir.

127
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,768
NEW MESSAGE
CONGRATULATION

128
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,896
-What's wrong with you?
-Hey.

129
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,067
-What are you doing?
-Mr. Kim.

130
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,945
Oh, my gosh. I got it.

131
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,656
I'm going to be in an advertisement!

132
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,573
What?

133
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,826
-Wow!
-Congratulations!

134
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,663
-It's real!
-Congratulations.

135
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,248
Well, congratulations.

136
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,126
Since you're up already,
come and do the quiz.

137
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,336
Excuse me?

138
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,484
Hey.

139
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,821
I know you have a lot of questions for me,

140
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,156
but can you hold off?

141
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,534
I have nothing to ask you.

142
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,202
Then why are you following me?

143
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,248
You are so full of yourself.

144
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,668
I'm going home after school. My home.

145
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,505
But my home isn't this way.

146
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,341
What do you want to know?

147
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,803
Gosh.

148
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,763
I said, that's not it.

149
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,683
I'm not curious about anything.
I'm not interested.

150
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,977
Then why are you following me around
and getting on my nerves?

151
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,186
Because I'm worried!

152
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,399
Or not...

153
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,278
Me? What?

154
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,821
Why would I...

155
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,907
Why would I worry about you?

156
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,378
You've been saying
"next month" for months now.

157
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,881
I'm really sorry.

158
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,048
If you can't afford it,

159
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,092
you shouldn't have renewed
the rental contract.

160
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,928
I raised it by only ten million won
because I felt bad.

161
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,016
You can't get a house like this
for such a low deposit.

162
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,186
I really mean it.
I'll get it to you next month.

163
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,355
This is the last time!

164
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,274
I'm sorry. I'll give you a call.

165
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,567
Dad.

166
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,402
Hey.

167
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,531
What's going on?
She's raising the deposit again?

168
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,825
No, it's nothing.

169
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,368
You don't need to know these things.

170
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,120
Let's go in and eat.

171
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,747
Aren't you hungry? Come on.

172
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,880
I think this is the highlight
of the national competition.

173
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,132
The two swimmers' duel is almost over.

174
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,011
-Go. That's it. Almost there.
-Is it I-an or U-jin?

175
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,889
-Nice turn. A little more.
-It's Han I-an versus Kim U-Jin.

176
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,935
-That's it. Yes. The gold medal!
-Han I-an comes in first!

177
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,103
Han I-an in lane three has won the gold.

178
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,022
-Good job.
-This will be a new record.

179
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,566
-Good job, my son.
-This is an incredible record.

180
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,027
I-an, play it back for me.

181
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,154
-Again?
-Yes.

182
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,240
How many times is this already?

183
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,701
I can watch it 100 times
and I won't get sick of it.

184
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,624
Son, can I look forward
to the competition in May?

185
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,210
Of course. Whose son am I?

186
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,670
Good.

187
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,132
-I think this is the highlight.
-Yes, that's it. Nice spurt.

188
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,261
-We only have few more meters left.
-Go. Nice. Turn.

189
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,930
-Nice turn. A little more!
-It's Han I-an versus Kim U-Jin.

190
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,488
LEE SANG-YUN
K-AD

191
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:29,702
We can't find a rising star athlete
who is as popular as you.

192
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,997
Please call me if you change your mind.

193
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,882
Hello?

194
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,175
This is Han I-an.

195
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,511
Yes.

196
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,015
About modeling in that ad you mentioned...

197
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,685
Yes.

198
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,357
Eun-byeol, let's go.

199
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,775
Where are we going?

200
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,029
On a date.

201
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,781
Let's go.

202
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,201
Why am I so happy that training is over?

203
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,912
What should we do? Computer game?

204
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,748
I have somewhere to go. Sorry.

205
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,626
Are you going to see Eun-byeol again?

206
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,420
See you later.

207
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,556
Eun-byeol.

208
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,226
Isn't this totally your style?

209
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,519
What?

210
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,273
Yes, it's pretty.

211
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,321
I'll try it on.

212
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,740
No.

213
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,534
What you have on now looks good too.

214
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,079
Get what you like.

215
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,502
Just a minute.

216
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,550
HAN I-AN

217
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,710
I was surprised
that you wanted to meet here.

218
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:43,836
Do you remember now?

219
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,465
Did I come to this library with you often?

220
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,926
Yes. Our grade school is next door.

221
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,095
We had classes here too.

222
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,472
I see.

223
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,566
By any chance...

224
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,485
Before I went missing,

225
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,491
did I ever mention being followed
or harassed by anyone?

226
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,120
No, why do you ask such a thing?

227
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,461
By the way,
you know the wound on your neck?

228
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,964
I think you got it just before
I saw you on the school trip.

229
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,384
Really?

230
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,012
What is it?

231
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,806
Nothing.

232
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:42,770
Whatever it is, if anything happens,
you have to tell me right away.

233
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,188
Got it?

234
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,606
Okay.

235
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,649
Come with me.

236
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,454
You don't remember?

237
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,748
No, I don't.

238
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,211
Wait a minute.

239
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,875
-No way.
-Yes!

240
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,836
Hey, just...

241
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,799
What are you doing?

242
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,891
Hey!

243
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,276
I-an, I'm sorry.

244
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,944
For what?

245
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,738
For making two people's memory

246
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,242
a memory only one person remembers.

247
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,919
That's why I said to bring this to normal.

248
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,254
Hey.

249
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,258
Hey, Eun-byeol.

250
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,722
You don't need to remember.
I will tell you everything.

251
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,934
Even if you get sick of it, bear with me.

252
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,896
It will take time to fill you in
on ten years of memories.

253
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,735
Gosh...

254
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,559
Min-jun, let's eat!

255
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,063
-Min-jun.
-Coming.

256
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,824
Aren't you going to say hi to your dad?

257
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,202
Good morning.

258
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,536
Morning, punk.

259
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,664
Don't call him a punk.

260
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,208
You must respect your child
for them to be successful.

261
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,086
We gave him the master bedroom
so that he can focus on his studies.

262
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,671
I can't watch TV because it's too loud.

263
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,300
I can't breathe too loudly
in case I bother him.

264
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,219
How much more respect can I show him?

265
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,472
You have no right to say that.

266
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,642
You know I make all the money
thanks to Min-jun.

267
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,187
What a great family.

268
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,524
A girl named So-yeong
transferred in, right?

269
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,608
How did you know?

270
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,153
Her mom heard of me and contacted me.

271
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,572
If you lose to a kid from the countryside,

272
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,366
it will be a disgrace, got it?

273
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:25,993
Okay.

274
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,415
I couldn't say a peep when I was
around women with successful husbands,

275
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,418
but I get to walk tall thanks to my son.

276
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,131
Here. Eat up.

277
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,914
What are you doing?

278
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,502
Hi, Min-jun.

279
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,963
I dropped something.

280
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,884
-You're here early.
-Yes.

281
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,513
I woke up early.

282
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,599
Really?

283
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,949
HOUSE OF LOVE, RULE OF CONDUCT

284
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,498
Oh, my gosh.

285
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,042
They're exactly the same.

286
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,595
I'm so thirsty.

287
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,183
Hey.

288
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,144
Stop taking from others. Buy one yourself.

289
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,229
Gosh.

290
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,524
Hey! Kongtae!

291
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,275
Just sleep like you usually do.

292
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,612
Why do you keep bothering people?
Give it back.

293
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,365
Hey.

294
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,910
You know that the same charges
repel each other, right?

295
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,478
A crazy person won't go

296
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,189
near another crazy person.

297
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:04,901
Got it?

298
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,905
What is he babbling about?

299
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,033
He's so weird. Let's go.

300
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,207
Okay, that is all.

301
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,293
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

302
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,962
-Hello.
-Hello.

303
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,303
Guys, I have a shoot today.

304
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,097
-What shoot?
-A shoot?

305
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,808
I have to go. Sorry.

306
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,020
It's not even TV.
It's a magazine ad. Give it a rest.

307
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,230
My Hae-na is much prettier. Right?

308
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,857
Hey, Gi-tae.

309
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,902
You start in magazine ads
and work your way up to TV

310
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,112
and movies. That's how it works.

311
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,741
Once I'm in the ad,
agencies will be calling me non-stop.

312
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,534
You've got to be joking.

313
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,452
That's funny.

314
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,872
-Song-ju, good luck.
-Bye.

315
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,000
-Good luck.
-Go for it.

316
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,210
Crush them all.

317
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,016
Hello.

318
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,309
Hello.

319
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,353
Hello.

320
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,856
Hello.

321
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,323
I-an, thank you so much.

322
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,366
-My pleasure.
-Good luck.

323
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,577
What? I-an.

324
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,121
What are you doing here?

325
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,207
I have a shoot.

326
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,292
Really? Me too.

327
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,339
Maybe we'll be partners. That's awesome.

328
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,885
-Okay! Let's get started!
-Okay.

329
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,762
Everyone take your places.

330
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,764
Please wait over here.

331
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,099
Yes, this way.

332
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,185
Ga-yeong is in the center.

333
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,230
-The uniform is so pretty.
-Is it? Thank you.

334
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,731
It looks tailor-made.

335
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,736
I-an! Please come this way.

336
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,821
Okay.

337
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,156
-See you later.
-What?

338
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,825
Okay.

339
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,910
Say hi to each other.

340
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,287
-Hello.
-Hello.

341
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,456
Hey you. Go change, and do you see them?

342
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,000
Wait there with them.

343
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,418
Okay.

344
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,213
Okay, be confident.

345
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,798
Let's go.

346
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,175
Smile. Have fun. Look happy.

347
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,846
Good. Looking good. You're having fun.

348
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,140
Nice.

349
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,392
Give me a bigger smile.

350
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,102
In the back. Smile.

351
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,939
Wow. I-an, you look so charismatic.

352
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,359
Ga-yeong, you too.
The main models are doing great.

353
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,612
Okay, have fun. Big smiles.

354
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,990
Pose a little now.

355
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,284
Okay, good.

356
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,287
Hey, you back there. Smile.

357
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,748
Smile. Hi.

358
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,793
Hold on. Cut!

359
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,004
Who is she? Hey!

360
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,173
Hair Bun!

361
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,091
You!

362
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,138
-Yes?
-Did you step on some poop?

363
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,265
What's with the look?

364
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,893
I'm sorry.

365
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,271
Our main models looked great,

366
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,482
but we have to redo it because of you!

367
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,860
I'm sorry.

368
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,029
That weirdo.

369
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,657
I-an, I'm sorry. We'll be done soon.

370
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,785
I'm fine.

371
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,838
Let's go again. And cue!

372
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,131
Okay. Wait!

373
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,425
Hey, Hair Bun! Smile!

374
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,970
Okay, good.

375
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,639
Hey.

376
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,140
Give me some of that.

377
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,602
Go get your own.

378
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,021
Just give me some.

379
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,278
Eun-byeol.

380
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,035
Let's talk.

381
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,968
You punk.

382
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,095
You haven't learned your lesson yet?

383
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,849
Sorry.

384
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,229
What was that? Is he now scared
because he got beaten up a bit?

385
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,816
It is the power of my punch.

386
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,406
What I said last time wasn't everything.

387
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,286
I don't know what your sister told you,

388
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,956
but I'm the bigger victim here.

389
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,044
So?

390
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,422
I'm sure it was hard for you too.

391
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,551
But what happened to Eun-bi
breaks my heart too.

392
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,887
I was hurt too.

393
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,184
So, let's just bury it.

394
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,811
"Bury it"?

395
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,565
You think it's that simple?

396
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,569
Then what?

397
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,530
What will you do?

398
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,495
I have to think about it.

399
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,540
I haven't decided yet.

400
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,596
Not because you have something to hide?

401
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,817
Why don't you two just come clean?

402
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,444
Eun-byeol admits to having a twin,

403
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,739
and you admit to being a bully
and getting transferred.

404
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,743
What do you think? It's fair, right?

405
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,247
Do you want me to call others
and tell them?

406
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,295
What?

407
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,089
Should I tell them yours first?

408
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,645
See you later.

409
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,402
She's so annoying.

410
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,112
Hey!

411
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,823
You started it together,
so end it together!

412
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,825
I can't stand being curious!

413
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,329
Call me whenever you see her from now on.

414
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,206
Got it--

415
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,456
We've prepared special lunch.

416
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,375
Let's eat and get to work.

417
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,669
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

418
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,297
-This looks so good.
-Oh, this is tuna kimbap.

419
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,592
-Is yours tuna kimbap? Can I have some?
-Let me have some too.

420
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,760
I don't have much either.

421
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,803
Director, will you excuse me?

422
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,597
Sure. Enjoy.

423
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,098
Thank you, you too.

424
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,939
-This is so good. I wasn't even hungry.
-Put it here.

425
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,148
-I have more here.
-Give me then.

426
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,524
Just go.

427
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,153
This is more insulting.

428
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,114
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

429
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,115
Is it not good?

430
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,119
-Go ahead.
-This is the best kimbap I've ever had.

431
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,913
-It's big.
-I'm still hungry.

432
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,959
-It's so delicious.
-Isn't that a little spicy?

433
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,543
-Let me have some.
-Eat up.

434
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,838
Just eat it in one go.

435
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,300
-This kimbap is so good.
-Seriously.

436
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,557
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

437
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,351
Why?

438
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:03,398
I bragged to the kids
about becoming a model.

439
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,943
You deserve it, Cha Song-ju.

440
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,739
I-an.

441
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,660
You're so lucky.

442
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,537
For what?

443
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,083
You have a dream, and you're talented.

444
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,460
You're so blessed.

445
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,590
When you first learn how to swim,

446
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,010
you only get familiar with the water.

447
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,972
You practice holding
your breath underwater.

448
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,226
Then you learn how to breathe,
float, and kick.

449
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,230
If you skip one,
you can't advance to the next.

450
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,610
So, consider this
learning how to hold your breath

451
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,654
to become a great swimmer.

452
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:56,909
You know...

453
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,708
Your poses were pretty bad
during the shoot.

454
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,128
I just couldn't show what I got today,

455
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,755
but I'm much better than you.

456
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,882
What did I say?

457
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,010
I'm just saying.

458
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,220
Fine, Hair Bun.

459
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,722
You too?

460
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,225
He doesn't even have hair. He's so...

461
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,031
-Tae-gwang...
-Hey.

462
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,616
Save it.

463
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,242
Go inside.

464
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,646
Why are you coming from there?

465
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,068
Don't call Eun-byeol out tonight.

466
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,988
Hey, Tae-gwang.

467
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:17,949
What is it?

468
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,451
Did something happen to Eun-byeol?

469
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,370
That's none of your business.

470
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,345
-Hello.
-Hello.

471
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,848
Prosecutor Kang Il-san, correct?

472
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,516
-Yes.
-It's nice to meet you.

473
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,937
Please take good care of my daughter.

474
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,605
Dad.

475
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,941
What? Isn't that So-yeong?

476
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,653
I'm grateful to have
an honor student join our school.

477
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,322
-I wonder how she knows the director.
-Thank you.

478
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,824
-Let's go inside.
-Sure.

479
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,413
It's time to change seats.

480
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,416
The previous seating arrangement
isn't working,

481
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,003
so I figure we'll use
an old-school method.

482
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,964
Come up and take one
starting from the back row.

483
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,675
What are we, little kids?

484
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,093
-Get moving.
-It's such a bother.

485
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,386
Old-school. It's nice.

486
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,036
Did you all check your new seats?

487
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,329
Yes!

488
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,955
Then take your stuff and move.

489
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,167
Let's go.

490
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,002
Gosh, I'm so stressed out.

491
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,671
I love it.

492
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,852
Darn it.

493
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,272
I'm here. Nice.

494
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,315
This is nice.

495
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,370
Stay in the designated seat. No switching.

496
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,831
Okay, that's all.

497
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,959
Bye.

498
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,133
Can you do anything else
other than swimming?

499
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,176
What about you?

500
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,928
Shorty.

501
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,349
-Here, here!
-Hey.

502
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,559
-What?
-What are you doing?

503
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,503
-It hurts.
-What was that?

504
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,756
Stop him!

505
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,429
-Nice!
-Pass the ball!

506
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,180
Don't be greedy.

507
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,559
-Gi-tae, pass it to me!
-Go away.

508
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,894
-Hey!
-No!

509
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:35,980
You're not a girl.

510
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,005
Give it up.

511
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,591
I'm just getting started.

512
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,134
Why? Are you tired?

513
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,428
Fine, let's do this.

514
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,637
Do it right.

515
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,598
-Gosh! What are you doing?
-Nice!

516
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,391
-Yours!
-Song-ju, here!

517
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,601
-Quickly. She'll get hit.
-Okay!

518
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,437
-What do I do?
-Quickly!

519
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,730
Watch out!

520
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,190
Throw it right away.

521
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,816
Hey, Eun-byeol!

522
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,369
What's wrong with them?

523
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,412
Are they filming a romance movie
or something?

524
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,873
It's a mini-series.

525
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,211
-I can't see her.
-I feel bad for her.

526
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,046
-What is this?
-I can't see.

527
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,006
-She's so tiny.
-Wow.

528
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:48,427
Look at them drooling over I-an's picture.

529
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,137
No, we're not. Look.

530
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,015
-Who is it?
-Cha Song-ju.

531
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,433
Cha Song-ju...

532
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,852
-Isn't this something?
-Wow. Unbelievable.

533
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,314
You guys are more incredible
for finding this.

534
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,691
I thought she was doing something huge.

535
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,652
Even I could do this much.
Don't you think?

536
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,738
-I know, right?
-The first person to find Song-ju

537
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,490
will win a 10,000 won gift card

538
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,534
for the school snack bar.

539
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,701
Find Song-ju!

540
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,286
I must do it for 10,000 won.

541
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,830
-Isn't this her?
-Wrong.

542
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,956
Isn't this Song-ju?

543
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,667
The one sitting here
with her forehead out.

544
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,794
Here's Song-ju.

545
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,213
Here she is. The bald-looking girl.

546
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,548
She's here.

547
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,842
Hide it.

548
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,772
-She's pretty. She's my type.
-She's cute.

549
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,197
-Song-ju.
-Song-ju.

550
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,410
Give me some time.

551
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,037
I just want to be alone right now.

552
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,831
Don't come after me.

553
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,390
Are you okay?

554
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,727
Would you be okay?

555
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:26,442
The first time I walked into our classroom
when I transferred here,

556
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,529
you were all I could see
because you were so pretty.

557
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,865
Whatever.

558
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,454
You're much prettier than that main model.

559
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,581
Stop it.

560
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,504
My uncle runs J Entertainment.

561
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,423
Do you want me to introduce you?

562
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,554
He's been asking me

563
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,307
if there is anyone
with potential at this school.

564
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:01,769
Really?

565
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,149
Song-ju.

566
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,151
Are you feeling better?

567
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,488
I'm better.

568
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,282
I wouldn't let something like that
get me down.

569
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,451
That's our Song-ju.

570
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,329
The pay was tiny,

571
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,248
but this is some delicious stuff,
so eat up.

572
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,290
-Okay.
-Okay.

573
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,088
-It's so good.
-Hi, I-an.

574
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,257
-Hi.
-Hi.

575
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,843
-Why are you so late?
-Sorry.

576
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,763
Order what you want.

577
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:38,764
Want some of this?

578
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,683
Have some of this.

579
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,064
There she is.

580
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,691
Who?

581
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,360
What?

582
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,779
Sorry, I'm late.

583
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,782
It's okay. I-an just got here too.

584
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:00,911
Sorry.

585
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,247
But I'm going to go.

586
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,833
What? Eun-byeol.

587
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,501
Eun-byeol!

588
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,547
Sorry. I'll see you tomorrow.

589
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,426
I-an! Han I-an!

590
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,429
What's with them?

591
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,472
I shouldn't have come.

592
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,392
I don't think Eun-byeol likes me.

593
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,353
It's okay. Let's just eat by ourselves.

594
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:28,939
"By ourselves"?

595
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,653
You never hide it when you're upset.

596
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,822
Your old temper is coming back.

597
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,992
What do you hate so much
about the new girl?

598
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,578
What? Does she get better grades than you?

599
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,246
Does she?

600
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,586
What's wrong?

601
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,838
Something's wrong, isn't it?

602
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,799
No, nothing is wrong.

603
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,178
I said to tell me first
if anything happens.

604
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,137
Please.

605
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,598
Don't ask.

606
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,642
-Eun-byeol.
-I-an.

607
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:09,271
There are things I can't tell you,
and things I don't want to tell you,

608
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,732
and things I don't want you to find out!

609
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,819
So please, don't ask me anything!

610
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:20,866
Do I...

611
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,745
Am I that meaningless to you?

612
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,249
What can't you tell me?

613
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,210
What do you have to hide from me?

614
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,253
Is our relationship so insignificant...

615
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,590
that a few words can change it?

616
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:05,828
Eun-byeol!

617
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,622
-Eun-byeol.
-Did you sleep well?

618
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,540
Yes.

619
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,458
-He looks so bad, right?
-Right.

620
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,627
-Exactly.
-Oh, Really?

621
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,170
There's Song-ju.

622
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,174
Right.

623
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,678
So-yeong is introducing her
to an entertainment agency.

624
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,889
Her uncle runs it.
I think she's auditioning tomorrow.

625
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,601
Hey, stop that.

626
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,980
Why are you doing that?
Are you teasing me?

627
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,282
Song-ju.

628
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,075
I'm sorry about yesterday.

629
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,785
Forget it.

630
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,415
I hear you have an audition tomorrow.

631
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,293
-Yes.
-Is that place okay?

632
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,753
Did you look into it?

633
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,967
What are you trying to say?

634
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,552
I mean...

635
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,096
I'm just worried.

636
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,056
Eun-byeol.

637
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,434
Stay out of it.

638
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,769
So-yeong...

639
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,690
She may not be someone you can trust.

640
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,567
Hey, Eun-byeol.

641
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,736
Enough already.

642
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,698
You're not the type to split friends up.

643
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,409
Stop disappointing me.

644
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:44,843
Eun-byeol,

645
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,888
Song-ju must have been very hurt.

646
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,892
I just set up a meeting for her...

647
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,395
because it's something she wants so bad.

648
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,814
If you hurt Song-ju,

649
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,651
I won't forgive you.

650
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,439
Gosh. I'm so tired.

651
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,524
Eun-byeol!

652
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,652
What took you so long? Let's go eat.

653
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,655
No, I don't have an appetite.

654
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:47,990
You should go.

655
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,449
Okay.

656
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,505
Mr. Kim.

657
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,551
What are you doing?

658
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:53,805
What?

659
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,353
Nothing.

660
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,579
Why aren't you having lunch?

661
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,249
Just...

662
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,460
I wanted to be alone.

663
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,049
Hey.

664
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,136
I really want to be alone this time.

665
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,263
Exactly.

666
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,600
Really, Tae-gwang.

667
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,144
You're really bored, aren't you?

668
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,688
Hey.

669
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:49,152
Should I just leave this boring school?

670
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,450
But if I quit school,
you'll miss me too much.

671
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,833
Why did I hate you so much before?

672
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,459
You said I was pathetic,

673
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,962
and that saying hi to me
was a waste of time.

674
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,131
I did?

675
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:10,757
Rude brat.

676
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,053
What? Is this also a total waste of time?

677
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,138
No.

678
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:21,143
I think now I can understand
why you are like that.

679
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:29,234
I didn't want to be hated,
so I tried to be angry, hold back,

680
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,611
and just about everything else.

681
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,114
Just like you.

682
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,083
Don't say things like that to others.

683
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,170
Don't look at me like that either.

684
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,980
What is it?

685
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:11,401
What's going on with my request
to withdraw from school?

686
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,780
You signed it so confidently.

687
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,615
What's wrong?

688
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:26,708
What are you doing?

689
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,793
Don't worry.

690
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:33,215
Even if I cause trouble here,
nobody knows that I'm your son.

691
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,342
Let's talk at home.

692
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,718
I've...

693
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,305
changed my mind.

694
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,391
I won't study abroad.

695
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,187
That matter is already settled.

696
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,105
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL FORM

697
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,318
KONG JAE-HO

698
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,363
I'll just go to school here.

699
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,614
Why?

700
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,158
Humiliating me until now wasn't enough?

701
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,078
Think what you like.

702
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,957
You must be afraid someone will see us,

703
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,417
so I'll go now.

704
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,301
-Did she kill her then?
-Oh, my gosh.

705
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,636
-Did she die?
-That's insane.

706
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,972
-She was bullied, so she killed herself.
-She died?

707
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,266
She doesn't look that way though.

708
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,476
-I got goosebumps.
-There was a reason she transferred here.

709
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,478
-What on earth?
-How frightening.

710
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,316
She's got some nerves.

711
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,819
-What a thick skin.
-Tongyeong, right?

712
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,404
Yes. Look at this.

713
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,574
-Noori High School. That's it.
-She's horrible.

714
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,741
-It is her.
-Noori High School.

715
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,911
She was forced to transfer out, then.

716
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,790
-N High School? right?
-Yes.

717
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,545
People say this is you.

718
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,589
TONGYEONG N HIGH SCHOOL,
BULLIED GIRL COMMITS SUICIDE

719
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,177
It isn't, is it?

720
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,182
Good morning... Or not.

721
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,648
What?

722
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,280
What is it?

723
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,198
-Was it you?
-What?

724
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,575
The one who started the weird rumor.

725
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:25,911
What rumor?

726
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,248
You and Eun-byeol
are the only ones who know.

727
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,334
Right.

728
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,171
Should I say Eun-bi,
pretending to be Eun-byeol?

729
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,843
Hey. She is Eun-byeol.

730
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,054
You're so strange.

731
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,890
You want me to introduce
my psychiatrist to you?

732
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,146
Look at this.

733
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,194
HOUSE OF LOVE, RULE OF CONDUCT

734
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,113
They are Lee Eun-bi's
and Eun-byeol's handwriting.

735
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,911
BE NICE TO YOUR FRIENDS

736
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,705
FOUNDATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF CIVILIZATION

737
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,668
They are exactly the same, aren't they?

738
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,755
I'm going to ask my dad
to get it verified.

739
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,050
Given what happened,

740
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,387
I guess I should come clean,
just like you said.

741
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,222
Right?

742
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,766
That's only fair.

743
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,124
Yes, you're right.

744
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:59,004
I don't know you
and you don't know me either.

745
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,882
It's fair. That's nice.

746
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,266
Want me to tell you a secret too?

747
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:12,892
You know,

748
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,395
my name is...

749
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,523
Ko Eun-byeol.

750
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,577
Hey.

751
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,662
What's wrong?

752
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,373
Eun-byeol, let's skip school today.

753
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,044
No. Have you lost your mind?

754
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,010
Just come with me.

755
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,597
Hey! What are you doing?

756
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,766
Hey, Tae-gwang. Have you lost your mind?

757
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,185
Let go of me! Hey!

758
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,696
What is it?

759
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,783
Tell me, now.

760
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,538
Later. A little later.

761
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,480
Hey.

762
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,316
You can have

763
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,069
at least one person, right?

764
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,158
Someone to call you by your real name.

765
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,580
Can I...

766
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,421
be that person?
