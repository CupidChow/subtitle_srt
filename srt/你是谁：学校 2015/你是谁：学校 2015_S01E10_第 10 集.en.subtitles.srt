1
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,691
She was bullied, so she killed herself.

2
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,734
-She killed herself?
-Yes.

3
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,277
Really?

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,653
A murderer is a bit harsh.

5
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,822
So-yeong didn't kill her though.

6
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,534
She died because of So-yeong,
so it's murder.

7
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,618
It's murder.

8
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:56,556
The high school men's
400m freestyle finals will begin shortly.

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,852
Competitors, please make your way in.

10
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,566
I-an.

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,236
I'm going to expose Eun-byeol
for who she is.

12
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,615
Too bad, you're going to miss a good show.

13
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,451
Good luck on your race.

14
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,213
-Hello, Miss K.
-Hello.

15
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,340
She's here.

16
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,008
She is the worst kind.

17
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,803
-Hello, Miss K.
-Hello.

18
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,679
-Hello.
-Miss K.

19
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,848
-Look at Miss K.
-Hello, Miss K.

20
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,017
-Hello, Miss K.
-Hello.

21
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,685
Freak.

22
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,521
So funny.

23
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,573
Guys.

24
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,869
You've been enjoying
bad-mouthing me lately,

25
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,579
haven't you?

26
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,580
You're quick.

27
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,248
It's so much fun.

28
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,666
What is she saying?

29
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,794
-We are enjoying it so much.
-What a thick skin.

30
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,588
-What's wrong with her?
-So much fun.

31
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,630
She is disgusting.

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,133
That's good.

33
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,051
Yes.

34
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,179
The N Girls' High in the article

35
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,224
is Noori Girls' High School
that I went to.

36
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,227
And I am that Miss K.

37
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,022
-See?
-Wow. Insane.

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,190
I knew it.

39
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,401
-Everyone knows.
-What is up with her?

40
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,288
You should be careful.

41
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,890
Hurry! Get off!

42
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,106
But...

43
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,819
about that outcast who supposedly died...

44
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,574
Don't you want to know

45
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,035
what she looked like?

46
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,621
Do you want me...

47
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,127
to show you?

48
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,838
-What?
-Show us.

49
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,591
-Give it to us.
-Let's see.

50
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,517
Are you okay?

51
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,810
-He's hurt.
-Are you okay?

52
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,979
-Call 911.
-Are you okay?

53
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,606
Call an ambulance. He's hurt.

54
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,525
Are you okay?

55
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,903
-Is he okay?
-He's moving.

56
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,071
He seems badly hurt.

57
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,952
Someone who looks
exactly like that outcast...

58
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,830
is in our class.

59
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,084
-What?
-Who is it? I can't see.

60
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,377
-What?
-Who?

61
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,049
Who is that?

62
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,634
Let me see.

63
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,723
Isn't that Eun-byeol?

64
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,474
The name is different.

65
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,101
-What is this?
-What on earth?

66
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,853
-Let me see.
-What is this?

67
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,479
This is crazy!

68
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,606
Look at it!

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,775
She looks just like Eun-byeol.

70
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,863
-She's right.
-My goodness.

71
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,032
-They're identical.
-Is this fake?

72
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,326
Hey, So-yeong.

73
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,874
How many days has it been

74
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,709
since you transferred here?

75
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,135
How much do you know about Eun-byeol?

76
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,928
How much?

77
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,476
Hey, Tae-gwang.

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,020
What game are you playing?

79
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,229
"Game"?

80
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,690
A game...

81
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,715
Eun-byeol.

82
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,886
It's your family matter,
so you explain it yourself.

83
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,004
-Why is he here?
-What about the competition?

84
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,631
The competition...

85
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,435
You texted me

86
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,270
to pull this garbage?

87
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,322
Eun-byeol doesn't have her memory back,

88
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,284
so I'll tell you for her.

89
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,660
Who are you to say anything?

90
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,330
Does anyone here know Eun-byeol
better than I do?

91
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,000
No.

92
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,377
-Do you?
-No.

93
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,837
-No.
-No one.

94
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,261
There is something Eun-byeol

95
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,638
hasn't been able to tell you.

96
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,644
She was adopted by her mom
when she was five.

97
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,981
She only recently found out

98
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,484
that she had a twin sister.

99
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,488
-So they are twins.
-They look identical.

100
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,031
-What was that?
-It's like a movie.

101
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,449
That again?

102
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,827
The victim in the article
you're looking at

103
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,455
was Eun-byeol's twin sister.

104
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,502
-Wow, that's crazy.
-That's crazy.

105
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,086
Twin sister?

106
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,048
-I'm getting goosebumps.
-What?

107
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,218
Then, Eun-byeol's sister
died because of So-yeong?

108
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,387
Hey, I'm not done talking.

109
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,264
That's not it!

110
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,641
That little...

111
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,060
Hey, So-yeong.

112
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,854
Don't twist your words and answer her.

113
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,275
Is Lee Eun-bi, who died because of you,

114
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,071
Eun-byeol's sister or not?

115
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,793
I said Eun-bi isn't dead.

116
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,213
No?

117
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,716
Then who died?

118
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,010
Who died

119
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,638
in her place?

120
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,322
That's...

121
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,548
What is she doing?

122
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,302
How can she act so proud?

123
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,887
Finish what you were saying.
It's annoying.

124
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,349
But why are you so arrogant
toward Eun-byeol?

125
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,228
I know. She needs to learn a lesson.

126
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,521
Damn it.

127
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,356
No.

128
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,485
Lee Eun-bi isn't dead.

129
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,447
She isn't dead!

130
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,164
What? Is she crazy?

131
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,915
What was that?

132
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,045
I think she is crazy.

133
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,258
What an evil witch.

134
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,426
But they really look the same.

135
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,594
How did you know?

136
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,512
What?

137
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,807
-They look like the same person to me.
-The same.

138
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,267
I'm so confused.

139
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:58,949
I-an!

140
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,076
Han I-an!

141
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,245
I-an!

142
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,205
Han I-an!

143
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,069
Hey, Tae-gwang.

144
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,530
Hey.

145
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,658
I warned you.

146
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,536
I asked who would be worse off
if both of you came clean.

147
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,958
If you insist she's Eun-bi,

148
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,751
then Eun-byeol is the one who died.

149
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
If you say Eun-byeol died because of you,

150
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,339
they would be even more hostile.

151
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,634
What will you do?

152
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,527
He ruptured his rotator cuff
and damaged his labrum.

153
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,073
It seems that when his shoulder
struck the windshield,

154
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,244
the tendon in his shoulder ruptured

155
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,955
and damaged his labrum as well.

156
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,251
But I see signs of injury
before the accident.

157
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,086
Didn't you know about it?

158
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,672
It must have been quite painful.

159
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:44,847
How long will it take for him to recover?

160
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,350
If he begins physical therapy
a week after surgery,

161
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,228
you're looking at about a year.

162
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,824
He said it will take a year.

163
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,743
What will happen to him?

164
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,330
There is no guarantee
that he'll recover fully.

165
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,456
Sir.

166
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,292
I-an is a strong kid.

167
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,962
I'll do my best to help him with rehab.

168
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,297
Let's have hope and support him.

169
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,490
ROOM 601
HAN I-AN

170
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,923
No, don't get up.

171
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,094
Hey.

172
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,555
Are you okay?

173
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,140
Dad.

174
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,393
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

175
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,061
It's okay.

176
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,480
But...

177
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,316
what happened?

178
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,194
I don't know.

179
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,906
I heard my friend was in trouble,

180
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,950
and I ran out without thinking.

181
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,204
I'm sorry, Dad.

182
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,040
Don't be.

183
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,127
Hey.

184
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,839
I don't know what it is,
but the world didn't come to an end.

185
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,132
Relax.

186
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,762
You're only 18.

187
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,851
It's okay to cause trouble
when you're upset

188
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,853
and act recklessly without thinking
like other kids.

189
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,481
It's okay.

190
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,984
Is that right?

191
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,404
I never told you this,

192
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,658
but this is nothing compared
to the stuff I pulled when I was your age.

193
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,205
So don't think about anything

194
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,751
and use this opportunity to take a break.

195
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,210
Got it?

196
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:21,921
Okay.

197
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,131
Good.

198
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,674
Get some rest.

199
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,259
I need to go to the administration office.

200
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,271
HAN I-AN

201
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,426
Si-jin!

202
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,429
You're really not going to talk to me?

203
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,183
Can you believe Eun-byeol?

204
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,643
What about?

205
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,103
Think about it.

206
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,897
How could we not know something
that even Tae-gwang knew?

207
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,274
What about me? Were you bad-mouthing me?

208
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,318
Stay out of it.

209
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,197
I-an will be okay, right?

210
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,492
He cares so much about Eun-byeol.

211
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,828
He gave up his competition
and ran right over.

212
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,664
They've been friends for ten years.

213
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,457
Isn't I-an cool?

214
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,126
Cool? You've got to be kidding me.

215
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,545
Hey, Tae-gwang.

216
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,007
Can't you be half the man I-an is?

217
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,800
-Hey!
-Oh, my.

218
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,593
I was talking nicely.

219
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,472
You and I just cannot get along. Let's go.

220
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,524
Yes, I know it's a lot of money,

221
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,944
but how could
a one million won consultation

222
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,738
be the same
as a ten million won consultation?

223
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,034
The consultation that your kid gets
will determine his college and future.

224
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,370
You shouldn't trust anyone
because it's cheap.

225
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,918
You heard about my students, right?

226
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,795
Of course.

227
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,466
I have the know-how of teaching my kid.

228
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,052
Don't worry and trust me.

229
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,763
I'll leave it in your hands then.

230
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,225
When are you free?
We'll have to meet often.

231
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,226
Honey!

232
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,562
How many kids do you have?

233
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,566
Word about what happened
spread all over school.

234
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,443
How could you act
like it doesn't concern you?

235
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,446
If So-yeong gets in trouble,

236
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,032
do you think it won't affect you?

237
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,872
She says she will never do it again!

238
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,502
Regardless, we can't let
So-yeong and that girl

239
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,254
go to the same school.

240
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:11,965
Fine.

241
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,385
Then, I'll take care of it myself.

242
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,933
What did Dad say?

243
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,185
Don't worry.

244
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,354
I'll meet with the director.

245
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,690
Really? Thank you, Mom.

246
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,154
I won't do anything
to cause you or dad trouble again.

247
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,366
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,930
HAN I-AN

249
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,674
Why aren't you coming in?

250
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,858
Does it hurt a lot?

251
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,068
Not really.

252
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,655
Can I help you with anything?

253
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,616
No.

254
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,704
Thank you

255
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,665
for what you did yesterday.

256
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,251
I didn't do it for you.

257
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,088
Thanks, whatever the reason may be.

258
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,799
If you're done talking, just go.

259
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,680
-I'll take that.
-Okay.

260
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,560
I'll go after I see you eat.

261
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,479
I'm fine, just go.

262
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,945
Give it to me.

263
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,031
Tae-gwang.

264
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,532
You leave too.

265
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,996
I've had hospital food a lot,
so I know how it is.

266
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,957
It's terrible.

267
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,460
But you have to eat to get better.

268
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,670
I said get lost, you punk.

269
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,046
-Why, you--
-Tae-gwang.

270
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,444
Are you that worried about I-an?

271
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,781
He got hurt because of me.

272
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,658
How could I ignore it?

273
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,910
I said I'll stay here. You just go home.

274
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,954
I want to be here.

275
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,836
Should I wait with you

276
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,338
until you want to go?

277
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,134
No.

278
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,690
A year may sound like a long time.

279
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,401
But once you recover,

280
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,903
you'll realize it's nothing.

281
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,448
How many famous athletes

282
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,576
never suffered a serious injury?

283
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,744
Right?

284
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,289
It's hard enough to improve my time
when I take a day off.

285
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,585
How could a year be insignificant?

286
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,171
So what?

287
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,381
You plan to give up?

288
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,175
Do you?

289
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:28,263
Unless you plan to quit swimming forever,

290
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,932
stop being so weak, got it?

291
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,852
You need to shake it off
and get back on your feet.

292
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,569
So why did you run out before a race?

293
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,696
No matter how important it was,
you shouldn't have done it!

294
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,037
You fool.

295
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,523
Do you want another bottle of water?

296
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,650
Are you stupid?

297
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,445
You're not welcome here.
Why do you keep coming?

298
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,785
I-an.

299
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,080
Don't say my name, and get out of my face!

300
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,752
I don't even want to look at you.

301
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,488
Let's have a quiet, uneventful day

302
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,117
without any problems.

303
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,202
-Gi-tae.
-Yes?

304
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,370
Peace.

305
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,372
Tae-gwang!

306
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,082
Peace.

307
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,376
Got it?

308
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,503
That will be all.

309
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,138
I'm going to be absent today.

310
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,891
Please don't tell my mom.

311
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,440
Kong Tae-gwang, Kwon Gi-tae, and Han I-an.

312
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,109
I-an is in the hospital, right?

313
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,071
It's too bad.
I wanted to give him the good news.

314
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,157
Your group had the highest score.

315
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,620
Ms. Ahn.

316
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,415
We exceeded your expectations, didn't we?

317
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,252
Yes, until ten minutes ago.

318
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,629
But then...

319
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,758
I saw a logo in the middle
of your brochure.

320
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,969
Your group name is "We're Done For."
Who is "Green Ad"?

321
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,143
If it weren't for Ms. Jeong's eagle eyes,

322
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,063
I would have been completely fooled.

323
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,357
Your group gets a zero!

324
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,943
Wait, did you say Ms. Jeong?

325
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,576
Gosh.

326
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,455
I didn't know Eun-byeol
was this popular at Sekang.

327
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,499
Right?

328
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,336
But don't get the wrong idea.

329
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,047
You're not Eun-byeol.

330
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,133
So-yeong.

331
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,469
You're almost as famous.

332
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,681
There can't be many students
who don't know you now.

333
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,724
Hey.

334
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,352
I don't know how you brainwashed I-an,

335
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,688
but how long do you think
he will keep it up?

336
00:28:56,151 --> 00:29:00,238
I bet he won't care
what happens to you soon enough.

337
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,198
Watch me.

338
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:07,328
I'll make sure everyone near you
leaves you one by one.

339
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,210
You should worry about yourself.

340
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,531
The contract is ready.

341
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,368
Submit your parental consent form
and call us.

342
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,459
Mr. Kim.

343
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,503
Would you take a look at this for me?

344
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,380
Sure.

345
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,134
It looks good overall,

346
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,220
but I think this can be left out.

347
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,098
And this is important, so put this first.

348
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,100
And fix the alignment.

349
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,770
This is harder than teaching a class.

350
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,357
You'll get the hang of it in no time.

351
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,567
You really think so?

352
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,776
I do.

353
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,748
No dating among teachers.

354
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,125
"Dating among teachers"?

355
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,002
That would be so exciting.

356
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,646
HIGH SCHOOL MATH

357
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,582
JEONG SU-IN

358
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,510
What brings you here?

359
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,307
Do you know what this is?

360
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:15,975
What is it?

361
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:16,935
A year ago,

362
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,772
it was on Jeong Su-in's desk
on the day she died.

363
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,576
JEONG SU-IN

364
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,288
Why are you bringing this up now?

365
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,082
I'm not the one that's doing that.

366
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,669
You know I have no right to.

367
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,214
-If not you--
-It must be someone who was there.

368
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,430
I told you to take responsibility
and accept the punishment back then.

369
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,975
Or else, we'll be punished
every time we remember this

370
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,477
for the rest of our lives!

371
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,961
Detective Park.

372
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,255
Hello. It's Kong Jae-ho.

373
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,049
I wanted to check something.

374
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,095
Jeong Su-in's case from a year ago.

375
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,974
Eun-byeol, is I-an okay?

376
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,308
What?

377
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,980
Not yet, but he'll get over it.

378
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,150
All he knows is swimming. Poor guy.

379
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,735
Take good care of him.

380
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,777
Hey, Si-jin.

381
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,405
If you're so worried,
you take care of him.

382
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,241
You think she and I are the same to I-an?

383
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,201
Why would you be different?

384
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,370
You're making me exhausted.

385
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,831
You psycho, why are you picking on me?

386
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,083
Do you...

387
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,962
like me or something?

388
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,051
I have to go. Bye.

389
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,803
Where to?

390
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,848
The hospital?

391
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,684
-Yes.
-Hey.

392
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,603
You're going back there?

393
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,814
Why? What for?

394
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,692
Let's talk later.

395
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,487
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

396
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,329
Don't follow me.

397
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,334
What?

398
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,211
What?

399
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,577
Do you want to take a walk?

400
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,332
It's really nice out.

401
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,796
The fresh air may make you feel better.

402
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,258
Do you feel sorry for me?

403
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,218
Hey.

404
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,845
I-an.

405
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,933
Or do you feel bad for tricking me
all this time?

406
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,395
I don't even know what to call you,

407
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,397
and I'm afraid to look at your face.

408
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,233
I'm so pathetic that I am losing my mind.

409
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,904
So stop it.

410
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,623
Okay.

411
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,167
I'll leave.

412
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:54,921
I'm sorry.

413
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,761
But...

414
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,972
no matter what you say,

415
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,767
I'll be back tomorrow.

416
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,937
So...

417
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,024
if you don't want to see me,
get well soon.

418
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,303
I-an.

419
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,392
Remember you asked me

420
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,813
why I didn't tell you the truth

421
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,110
when I got my memory back?

422
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,949
I must have known that if I told you,

423
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,910
we would end up like this.

424
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,163
So...

425
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,083
maybe I wanted to pretend

426
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,213
for just one more day.

427
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,385
Yes.

428
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,763
I feel bad.

429
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,809
I also feel so sorry for you.

430
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,858
But that's not why I keep coming.

431
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,403
So...

432
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,825
So...

433
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:25,780
ROOM 601
HAN I-AN

434
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,639
I-an.

435
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,517
Welcome back.

436
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,313
But how could you refuse visitors?
I was hurt.

437
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,524
I'm sorry.

438
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,903
You're depressed about the injury,
aren't you?

439
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,200
I know I'm your teacher
and you're my student,

440
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,662
but when I see you do your best
to pursue what you want,

441
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,789
I'm the one learning from you.

442
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,873
Mr. Kim.

443
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,334
Stop acting out of character.

444
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,879
Right? That felt weird even to me.

445
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,219
I-an.

446
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,889
Here is what I think.

447
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,184
It's okay to take things a bit slow,
to take a break,

448
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,103
and to make wrong choices.

449
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,649
It may be difficult now,

450
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,529
but you'll realize afterward
that it wasn't all bad.

451
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,700
Okay?

452
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,244
Hang in there. Be strong.

453
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,041
That speech didn't work either?

454
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:04,879
Fine.

455
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,631
I get it.

456
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,428
Mr. Kim, wait for me!

457
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,721
Take your bag already!

458
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,031
Min-jun.

459
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,867
An unexcused absence is unlike you.

460
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,248
Where did you go?

461
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,419
To the library.

462
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,171
What?

463
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,673
I had so much time,

464
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,218
but nowhere to go.

465
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,184
When I'm studying, time flies.

466
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,063
Two or three hours fly by

467
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,941
when I'm not even halfway done.

468
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,987
So I went to the library and studied

469
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,282
so that time would pass.

470
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,829
Min-jun.

471
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,166
If it's too hard for you,

472
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,087
do you want me
to meet with your mom again?

473
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,269
REPORT ILLEGAL HIGH-PRICED TUTORING

474
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,153
If anyone wants to talk about
the laptop incident,

475
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,155
come to my office by 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

476
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,115
I'll work with you

477
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,701
to find the best way to handle this.

478
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,036
It's not true, right?

479
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,830
Your teacher is mistaken, right?

480
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,750
They don't have proof yet,

481
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,294
so keep your mouth shut.

482
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,474
Song-ju.

483
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,769
What is it?

484
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,772
Make it short.

485
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,747
Song-ju.

486
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,250
I thought you and I were real friends.

487
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,878
How could you do this to me too?

488
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:34,922
"Friends"?

489
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,884
Did you really consider me a friend?

490
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,805
You didn't use me to harass Eun-byeol?

491
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:46,850
Song-ju.

492
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,103
If I were harassing Eun-byeol,

493
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,356
would I have asked my busy uncle
to give you an audition?

494
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,905
My uncle said he wanted to
sign a contract with you.

495
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,451
Do you want me to ask him for you?

496
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,204
Really?

497
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,959
Go ahead then.

498
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,511
Hi, Uncle.

499
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,972
I heard you wanted to sign up

500
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,516
my friend, Song-ju.

501
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,644
Just a minute.

502
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,021
He wants to set a date.

503
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,485
I can't sign with you.

504
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,613
Why not?

505
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,576
Ask So-yeong yourself.

506
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:51,707
I...

507
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,960
really want to become a celebrity.

508
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,548
But I'm not low enough
to betray my friend.

509
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,635
Making people leave Eun-byeol one by one?

510
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,890
That won't be easy.

511
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,842
Who are you?

512
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,677
We're from
the Gangnam Office of Education's

513
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,888
private institution supervising committee.

514
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,725
You've been reported
for illegal high-priced tutoring.

515
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,737
How much are you involved?

516
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,406
Your name is all over the investigation.

517
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,410
I know I'm not much,

518
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,079
but I'm still your husband.

519
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,375
How could you do this
when your husband is a police officer?

520
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,126
Was it...

521
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:20,837
really Min-jun?

522
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,755
Yes.

523
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,801
Your son reported you, you foolish woman!

524
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:57,791
Wash up.

525
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,794
Eat and study.

526
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,081
Where is the vice principal?

527
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,125
He's over there.

528
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,550
May I help you?

529
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:53,096
I'm Class Three's Kang So-yeong's mother.

530
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,016
May I see the director?

531
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,104
The director?

532
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,191
You can't go in there!

533
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,819
You can't barge into the director's office
without an appointment.

534
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,446
I'll be brief.

535
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:14,409
You can't do this. What is wrong with you?

536
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,287
I'm sorry, sir.

537
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,123
I told you so many times...

538
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,086
I was in such a rush
that I forgot to call in advance.

539
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,798
I'm Prosecutor Kang Il-san's wife.

540
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,675
Oh, yes.

541
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,555
Hello. I'm Kong Jae-ho.

542
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,606
I heard briefly from Prosecutor Kang.

543
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,074
This is the girl.

544
00:49:55,701 --> 00:50:00,455
She harassed my daughter in Tongyeong
and was expelled.

545
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:05,127
I hear her twin is in So-yeong's class,

546
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:09,089
and she's been bothering my daughter
about her sister.

547
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:15,554
They can't stay
in the same class, can they?

548
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,181
If what you say is true, of course not.

549
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,935
I don't care if she gets
expelled or transferred.

550
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,980
Just get her out of this school.

551
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,902
I'll look into it and get back to you.

552
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,904
Okay.

553
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,656
Please do, Director.

554
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,120
Does your shoulder hurt a lot?

555
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,122
It's fine.

556
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:08,982
I-an.

557
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,278
You're right-handed,
so it must be hard to eat.

558
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,113
You're right.

559
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,907
It's hard using chopsticks, isn't it?

560
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,265
Hey, Tae-gwang.

561
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,060
What's with you now?

562
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,144
Did I do something wrong?

563
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,854
I'm helping.

564
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,233
Right, but it's scary when you do it.

565
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,442
Damn it.

566
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,031
I'll put it away.

567
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,659
I'll do it.

568
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,090
SEKANG HIGH DEATH INCIDENT

569
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:21,054
These are the people who were there
during Jeong Su-in's incident.

570
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,056
Thank you.

571
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:29,729
You, me, Mr. Kim Jun-seok,
Su-in's mother, and the paramedics.

572
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,899
Altogether, it's eight people.

573
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,401
KO EUN-BYEOL (STUDENT IN THE SAME CLASS)

574
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,863
Ko Eun-byeol was the only student there.

575
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,536
There may be plenty of other witnesses.

576
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,789
But why do you ask about a year-old case?

577
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,292
Did you say Ko Eun-byeol?

578
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,501
Yes.

579
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:55,714
Excuse me.

580
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,304
Please get me Ko Eun-byeol's
class' attendance book.

581
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,558
What happened with the laptop incident?

582
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,934
Did you find out who did it?

583
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,061
Not yet.

584
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,564
This is all because we made the kids

585
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:15,150
focus on their grades too much.

586
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:19,029
That's why people are suggesting
an absolute grading system

587
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,531
to give the students a goal to pursue.

588
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,490
Yes.

589
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,451
If everyone does well,
they should all be first.

590
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,286
Must you rank them?

591
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,878
Mr. Kim.

592
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,422
May I see your class attendance book?

593
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,175
Pardon? Why do you want to see it?

594
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,218
The director wants to see it.

595
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,475
May I bring it to him?

596
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,644
Would you?

597
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,228
Yes, I'll be right back.

598
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,400
By the way...

599
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,638
Hello.

600
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,224
I'm the student teacher, Jeong Min-yeong.

601
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:30,809
Hello.

602
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,020
ATTENDANCE BOOK

603
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,773
You wanted Class Three's attendance book?

604
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:37,899
Thank you.

605
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,947
SEKANG HIGH DEATH INCIDENT

606
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,562
Hi, Mom.

607
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,399
Hang in there.

608
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,944
We're almost there.

609
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,621
STUDENT IDENTIFICATION CARD
NOORI HIGH SCHOOL, LEE EUN-BI

610
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:40,587
She harassed my daughter in Tongyeong
and was expelled.

611
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,175
I heard her twin is in So-yeong's class,

612
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,387
and she's been bothering my daughter
about her sister.

613
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:54,726
They can't stay
in the same class, can they?

614
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,073
NOTICE OF TRANSFER

615
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,574
KO EUN-BYEOL

616
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,416
NOTICE OF TRANSFER
KO EUN-BYEOL

617
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,461
You're behind this, aren't you?

618
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,463
What do you think you're doing?

619
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,965
It's as you can see.

620
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,842
You know this makes no sense.

621
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:32,013
Eun-byeol did nothing
to deserve being kicked out.

622
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,558
She left the school trip
without permission.

623
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,143
She threatened a karaoke place owner.

624
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,523
And there's the theft issue as well
which caused the SVPC to meet.

625
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,275
I think there are plenty of reasons.

626
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,735
Sir.

627
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,321
I think it would be best for her

628
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,365
to get her parent's consent
and transfer out.

629
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,709
Hey, get on.

630
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,134
Get on.

631
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,845
Hey, we're at school.

632
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,514
So what?

633
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,724
Rock, paper, scissors?

634
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,560
The loser carries it to the bus stop.

635
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,067
Rock, paper, scissors. What?

636
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:27,944
Rock, paper, scissors.

637
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,697
You can't just...

638
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,614
Rock.

639
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,534
-Rock.
-Forget it.

640
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,790
I'm just kidding.

641
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,377
