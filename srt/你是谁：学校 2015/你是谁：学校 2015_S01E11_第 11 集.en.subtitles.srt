1
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,986
This is the high school male
400m freestyle finals.

2
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,031
As expected,
the two of them are neck and neck.

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,742
It's close. Han I-an in lane three.

4
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,788
This will be the highlight of the day.

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,082
The two players only have
a few meters left.

6
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,877
They only have a few meters left.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,880
It's between Han I-an and Kim U-jin.

8
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:51,009
Will it be Han I-an or Kim U-jin?

9
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,343
HAN I-AN - 33.95, FIRST PLACE

10
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,089
NOTICE OF TRANSFER
KO EUN-BYEOL

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,092
You're behind this, aren't you?

12
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,389
Eun-byeol did nothing
to deserve being kicked out.

13
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,684
She left during the school trip
without permission.

14
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,311
She threatened a karaoke place owner.

15
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,649
And there's the theft issue as well
which caused the SVPC to meet.

16
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,485
I think there are plenty of reasons.

17
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,070
Sir.

18
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,531
I think it would be best for her

19
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,699
to get her parents' consent
and transfer her out.

20
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,373
Rock, paper, scissors.

21
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,710
You can't just...

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,628
Rock.

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,214
Forget it.

24
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,635
LEE EUN-BI

25
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,011
KO EUN-BYEOL

26
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,853
I-an!

27
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,109
Why are you here with your cast on?

28
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,696
Are you hurt badly?

29
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,364
How are you doing?

30
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,616
I'm fine.

31
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,702
And...

32
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,999
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,834
There's no need to apologize.

34
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,044
Good luck with your rehab.

35
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,629
But seriously,

36
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,715
what was so important

37
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,301
that you ran out of a competition
and got into an accident?

38
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,260
Stop it.

39
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,846
Okay, go on.

40
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,515
Look at yourself now.

41
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,809
You treated the national competition
like some local swim meet.

42
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,687
Look at you.

43
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,689
What?

44
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,774
You think I'm upset

45
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,611
about not winning a medal in
the relay race because you weren't there?

46
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,071
No.

47
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,657
I don't want people saying
I went to college thanks to you!

48
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,076
But if you have received
all that special treatment,

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,828
it's your obligation to show its worth.

50
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,954
Please stop.

51
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,497
We'll be late for training.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,834
You and I are now both losers.

53
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,086
We're the same now. How nice.

54
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,796
Hang in there.

55
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,258
Being a loser
will teach you a good lesson.

56
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,136
Let's go.

57
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,821
Tae-gwang said he will take the bus
to school from now on.

58
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,699
He seems to be in a good mood lately.

59
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,910
Thank you.

60
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,833
Who was...

61
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,836
that student you left school with today?

62
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,381
Gosh.

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,550
Now you care whom I'm friends with.

64
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,348
-Thank you.
-Is she just a classmate?

65
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,393
What's gotten into you?

66
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,604
You don't need to worry about it.

67
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,482
I won't fight with her
and get sued from her.

68
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,943
As long as I don't need to worry
about her, everything will be fine.

69
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,293
I'm sorry this happened
just out of the blue.

70
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,544
It's fine.

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,838
But...

72
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,758
I would like to know
why this has happened.

73
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,220
-Well, that's--
-It's as we said.

74
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,888
Of the events that you mentioned,

75
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,266
none of them were clear enough.

76
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,562
None of them applied to Eun-byeol alone.

77
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,773
I don't know what to say.

78
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,693
If she did something wrong,
she should deal with consequences.

79
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,236
But...

80
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,116
this feels like the school
wants to get rid of Eun-byeol

81
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,579
and is forcing these reasons
to give itself grounds to do that.

82
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,080
Am I wrong?

83
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,918
-I'm sorry.
-Mr. Kim.

84
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,503
Why are you sorry?

85
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,215
Every school has its rules.

86
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,843
A student who breaks them
must be punished.

87
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,762
But why are you apologizing?

88
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,097
Is that right?

89
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,726
You mean she must be punished.

90
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,686
That's right.

91
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,566
Then...

92
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,861
call all the students she was with
at the karaoke place

93
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,654
to the disciplinary hearing.

94
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,158
And call back the student

95
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,328
who lied about Eun-byeol abusing her.

96
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,205
As for the school trip...

97
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,585
I will make sure

98
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,589
to hold the school accountable
for failing to oversee a student properly.

99
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,341
What? I...

100
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,886
Please, that's not what I meant.

101
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:27,887
Isn't that...

102
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,015
how the system works in this school?

103
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,518
Great.

104
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,062
Let's do this.

105
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,148
Wait.

106
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,025
Excuse me. Ma'am.

107
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,740
This is crazy.

108
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,784
What's wrong with Class 2-3?

109
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,910
What's wrong with our class?

110
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,495
-What's this?
-It's just Eun-byeol.

111
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,247
-My goodness.
-What is this?

112
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,833
-Did Eun-byeol cause trouble?
-I guess so.

113
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,711
DISCIPLINARY HEARING

114
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,797
SECOND YEAR CLASS 3 MS. KO

115
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,343
Who was that student
you left school with today?

116
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,012
As long as I don't need to worry
about her, everything will be fine.

117
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,641
-Move.
-Hold on.

118
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,395
What is this?

119
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,772
What rule did Eun-byeol violate?

120
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,783
Kongtae.

121
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,762
Poor thing.

122
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,224
You should have been careful.

123
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:57,977
So-yeong.

124
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,231
What did you do this time?

125
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,318
There are two types of transfers.

126
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,279
One that you leave voluntarily.

127
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,866
And the other one that you are forced to
even if you don't want to.

128
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,830
That's why if you had decided
to leave sooner,

129
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,041
this never would have happened.

130
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,836
By the way,

131
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,922
how is I-an doing?

132
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,633
Hey.

133
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,887
How many people's lives must you ruin?

134
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,974
Is it my fault that I-an got hurt?

135
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,979
That happened to him
while he tried to cover up your lie.

136
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,525
So why is that my fault?

137
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,668
How long

138
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,379
do you plan to stay here?

139
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,755
Long. Even after you leave.

140
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,759
It won't go like you want.

141
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,012
Because I'm going to protect them.

142
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,182
I believe the power
of wanting to protect someone

143
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,310
is much stronger

144
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,021
than the power of hating someone.

145
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,319
It would be boring if everything goes
as you believe.

146
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,951
You...

147
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,956
were so happy because you thought
I was done for, weren't you?

148
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,503
This is why comebacks are so sweet.

149
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,799
Just you wait.

150
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,635
Eun-byeol.

151
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,597
Mom.

152
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,021
KANG SO-YEONG

153
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,912
You must have been shocked
to hear from the school.

154
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,581
A little.

155
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,374
Don't worry.

156
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,960
Let's talk later at home.

157
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:29,920
Okay.

158
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,807
Why aren't you going to the hospital?

159
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,686
Must I come to the school every day
and yell at you like this?

160
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,190
Give me some time to gather my thoughts.

161
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,775
Gather what? Why, you little...

162
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,362
What's the point of making a decision

163
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,657
after your body is damaged?

164
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,118
I-an.

165
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,997
If you don't stretch your stiff muscles
and strengthen your shoulders,

166
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,291
it will be much harder later.

167
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,043
Start right away.

168
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,586
Don't skip a single day, got it?

169
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,714
Hey.

170
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,468
Why aren't you answering me?

171
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,095
I-an.

172
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,930
Snap out of it!

173
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,224
I'll be watching you.

174
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,937
If I think you have a bad attitude,
I'll ban you from the swim team.

175
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,938
Do you get it?

176
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,398
Gosh.

177
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,859
It's much nicer
than a stuffy office, isn't it?

178
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,573
So, what did you want to tell me?

179
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,204
The laptop incident...

180
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,749
That...

181
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,419
was me.

182
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,047
I see.

183
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,968
Thanks for telling me the truth.

184
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,723
Will you be okay?

185
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,059
I don't know if I can convince my mom.

186
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:51,937
But...

187
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,399
like you said,

188
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,947
I don't want to go down the path
that I know is wrong.

189
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,116
What if...

190
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,704
I even forget that I took
the wrong path later on?

191
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:29,517
It turned out that someone in our class
is responsible for the laptop incident.

192
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,977
It was So-yeong.

193
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,523
So everyone who lost the five points

194
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,400
will get their points back.

195
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,365
Mr. Kim.

196
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,659
So, who did it?

197
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,497
If they confessed, they should come clean.

198
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,333
Must you know?

199
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,170
-Yes.
-I need to know.

200
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,422
Quiet!

201
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
Anyone can have
a momentary lapse in judgment

202
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,927
and make a mistake.

203
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,097
But the student
who reformatted the laptops

204
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,975
knew the project submitted
would get a zero.

205
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,727
However, the student
courageously came clean anyway

206
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,357
so that you guys
wouldn't be disadvantaged.

207
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,485
The person set things right
before it was too late.

208
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,072
I hope you remember that.

209
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,201
So-yeong just had to confess.

210
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,536
Just tell us.

211
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,955
-Just say it.
-Kang So-yeong, you should confess.

212
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,082
What's wrong with him?

213
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,209
-What is he doing?
-What is it?

214
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,129
What is he doing?

215
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,049
What is wrong with him?

216
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,723
I'm getting goosebumps.

217
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,022
I'm really sorry.

218
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,024
I was a coward.

219
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,070
And I'm so ashamed

220
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,200
for not coming clean sooner.

221
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,371
I regret it so much.

222
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,337
I will never forget how I feel now.

223
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,101
Of course,

224
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,520
I can't force you to forgive him.

225
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,898
But what Min-jun

226
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,484
didn't want to lose was you guys,

227
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:49,198
even if it meant sacrificing his grades.

228
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,911
His friends.

229
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,833
I hope...

230
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,627
you realize that.

231
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,092
Thanks.

232
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,135
Take your seat.

233
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,187
That will be all.

234
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,108
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

235
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,153
-We understand.
-Thank you.

236
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:31,949
What?

237
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,742
What?

238
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,744
What is wrong with her?

239
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,497
-Let's go eat pizza.
-Are you going to buy?

240
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,707
Let's go.

241
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,754
This is for the unexcused absence.

242
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,258
I told the students
not to return their library books.

243
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,553
Return them and put them back
on the shelves too.

244
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,138
When your mind is cluttered,

245
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,848
physical labor
is the best way to deal with it.

246
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,074
Thanks for helping me.

247
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,326
Sure.

248
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,664
This is so awkward to have you help me.

249
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,336
We were in the same class
since freshman year,

250
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,714
but you were never like this before.

251
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,341
We were in the same class

252
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,844
since sophomore year?

253
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,387
Yes.

254
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,557
What was I like then?

255
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,394
We weren't friends then either.

256
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,607
Yes, I can guess that.

257
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,154
But last year, around this time,

258
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,491
I came back to school one night.

259
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:02,581
The classroom was too noisy during lunch,
so I studied in a science lab.

260
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,999
But I left my book there.

261
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,767
That happened?

262
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,519
Yes.

263
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,021
I remember clearly
because it was that day.

264
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,607
What day?

265
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,488
We had a classmate named Jeong Su-in.

266
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,200
It was the day before I heard
that she died.

267
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,079
"Jeong Su-in"?

268
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,125
You don't remember Su-in either?

269
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,313
My friend

270
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,358
was called in for a disciplinary hearing.

271
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,113
That is a right thing if she broke a rule.

272
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,865
Right.

273
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,868
But I feel so guilty.

274
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,539
I cause trouble on a daily basis,

275
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,792
but thanks to you, I never get summoned.

276
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,797
What do you think
the other students will think?

277
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,804
So? What are you trying to say?

278
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,724
Are you asking me to call off
the disciplinary hearing?

279
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,352
If I asked, would you?

280
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,063
You said I don't need to worry about her.

281
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,819
I did.

282
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,282
But how did you know that friend

283
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,118
is the one called
into the disciplinary hearing?

284
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,080
I never said it was her.

285
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,544
You're incredible.

286
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,422
You know so much
about each and every student.

287
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,384
Or not. Whatever.

288
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,009
I-an.

289
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,763
What?

290
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,642
I heard you talking to your coach.

291
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,314
Why aren't you going to the hospital?

292
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,775
Why do you care?

293
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,694
You...

294
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,738
have nothing to do with me.

295
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,532
Did you forget?

296
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,246
Mom.

297
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,207
KANG SO-YEONG

298
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,669
-Oh, my.
-Let go.

299
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,088
Let go.

300
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,256
Go on your way.

301
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,426
Who are you to butt into our business?

302
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,100
Mom.

303
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,144
Hey, Eun-byeol.

304
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,527
Kang So-yeong...

305
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,239
That's the girl who harassed you
in Tongyeong, right?

306
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,533
Mom.

307
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,078
It terrifies me to think

308
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,832
you're in the same school
with someone like her.

309
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,127
Don't fight with her.

310
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,921
Let's just move and transfer
to another school quickly.

311
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,923
Okay.

312
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,718
But Mom,

313
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,931
there's something I need to do first.

314
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,475
What is it?

315
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,018
Do it at your new school.

316
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,812
No, I need to do it here.

317
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,609
I need to do it now.

318
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,197
So please give me some time.

319
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,491
Every time you see her,

320
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,161
it will remind you of all the bad things
in the past and pain you.

321
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,829
Do you still want to do that?

322
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,540
Yes.

323
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,669
I have you this time.

324
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,341
Okay.

325
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,678
I'm here for you.

326
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,265
So don't worry and don't be discouraged.

327
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,808
Okay?

328
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,115
Hello, ma'am.

329
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,327
Didn't you say you didn't have any proof?

330
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,497
Yes, but Min-jun--

331
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,415
How much did you corner my son
with that CCTV?

332
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,418
Otherwise, why would he make things up?

333
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,338
Sorry?

334
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,340
Make things up?

335
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,258
Then what?

336
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,011
You think Min-jun actually did it?

337
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,477
Mr. Kim.

338
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,481
Do you really not know what a zero means?

339
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:11,194
It can be fatal especially
to the kids on top like Min-jun.

340
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,196
You should know better.

341
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,158
Ma'am.

342
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:23,290
Do you really think the most fatal thing
to Min-jun right now are his grades?

343
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:29,170
Giving your child wings
may be breaking his knees.

344
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,550
Don't just look at his grades,

345
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,635
but look at his heart
and what he's feeling inside.

346
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,766
Please.

347
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,904
You know Min-jun's mother was reported
to the Ministry of Education, right?

348
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:42,744
This happened because private education
has gotten out of control.

349
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,873
Don't you think the school
should get involved?

350
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,001
Yes. The students' demands are increasing.

351
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,921
If the schools can't meet them,
where can they go?

352
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,257
They're changing the regulation

353
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,802
to permit after-school programs
from the next semester.

354
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,886
So let's wait and see.

355
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,888
In that case,

356
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:06,267
why don't you prepare a proposal
for an after-school program

357
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,852
and submit it by the end of the semester?

358
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,853
Pardon?

359
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,524
But I...

360
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,610
All right then. Have a nice day, everyone.

361
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,736
Sir.

362
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,656
-About Ko Eun-byeol--
-Mr. Kim.

363
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,574
Whatever you do,

364
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,952
the disciplinary hearing
will take place as planned,

365
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,620
so stop wasting your time.

366
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,590
-What are you taking out?
-Oh, my gosh.

367
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,596
What? I don't have anything.

368
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,775
Is something on your mind?

369
00:28:58,987 --> 00:28:59,821
What about you?

370
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,787
Do you want to share one each?

371
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,709
Shall we?

372
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,670
Me first?

373
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,969
My hands are very dirty.

374
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,432
My friend fell down,
but his hands are clean.

375
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,479
Do I have the right to take his hand
and help him up?

376
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,362
Who needs a right to hold hands?

377
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,324
You can go and wash your hands together.

378
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,286
Yes.

379
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,829
You're right.

380
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,626
What's your dilemma?

381
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,595
My dad is the one trying to kick
Eun-byeol out, isn't it?

382
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,561
Even if I ask why,
you can't tell me, can you?

383
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,275
I'll get going now.

384
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:34,707
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

385
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,596
The student's mother is resisting.

386
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,808
Of course, she should be.

387
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,894
Her kid is being forced to transfer
for such nonsensical reasons.

388
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,857
If the parent wants to express
her disagreement,

389
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,317
tell her to speak
at the disciplinary hearing.

390
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,736
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

391
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,740
You mean at the disciplinary hearing
filled with people who voted

392
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,409
as the school wanted
to force her to transfer?

393
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,995
I'm busy. Please leave.

394
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,707
Is Su-in's case the real reason?

395
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,085
Eun-byeol lost her memory.

396
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,839
And even if she hadn't,
she would never speak about the incident,

397
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,090
just like I wouldn't.

398
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,550
I said that isn't it!

399
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,443
I truly hope it isn't.

400
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,195
Please reconsider it...

401
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,781
Sir.

402
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:11,095
I'm thinking of getting Hong Jae-dong,
the teacher you've been waiting for.

403
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,598
-No one compares--
-Of all the...

404
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,768
It won't disappear
just because we ignore it.

405
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,354
I'm going to come out and say it.

406
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,813
Ms. Shin.

407
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,150
You know how important trust is
in this field, don't you?

408
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,947
You lost your tutoring company
and consulting company.

409
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,865
What are you doing now?

410
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,118
Yes, you know this field
better than anyone.

411
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,080
Who would trust you
with their kids' education?

412
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,291
And above all,

413
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,543
I heard it was Min-jun.

414
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,214
How could a son report his mom?

415
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,633
Let's stop talking about that.

416
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,136
We came to say
we won't be seeing you again.

417
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,180
We're leaving.

418
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,640
Goodbye.

419
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,624
Hey, I...

420
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,508
About Si-jin's consulting...

421
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,803
I need to reconsider it.

422
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,265
Hi. It's me, Min-jun's mom.

423
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,475
Can you talk?

424
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,272
I'm making a new group
and saved a spot for Jeong-yeon.

425
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,607
Of course!

426
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,747
What? Is that you, Eun-byeol?

427
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,417
Hello.

428
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,253
Why didn't you come in?

429
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,799
-No, it's okay.
-What do you mean?

430
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,803
I never send a guest away.

431
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,888
Come up.

432
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,311
What are you doing? Come up.

433
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,921
AWARDS

434
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:43,724
Okay. Here is some nice, hot stew.

435
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,184
Let's eat.

436
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,902
Why? You don't like the food?

437
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,196
No, I do. Thank you.

438
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,114
Good.

439
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,749
If using chopsticks is too hard,
do you want me to feed you?

440
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,585
Come on, Dad.

441
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,842
You're smiling again.
You must be feeling better.

442
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,770
But...

443
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,857
why are you kids so quiet?

444
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,484
Did you get into a fight?

445
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,585
Mr. Han.

446
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,087
Thank you for dinner.

447
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,549
Sure. Get home safely and come over again.

448
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,635
I will.

449
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,347
Eun-byeol.

450
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,642
He may act like he's fine,

451
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,769
but he must be dying inside.

452
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,650
You've always leaned on each other
since childhood,

453
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,112
so please help him through this again.

454
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,116
Call him out often
so he'll get some fresh air.

455
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,495
Kick him in the rear to wake him up too.

456
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,580
-Okay?
-I will.

457
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,917
Good. Thanks.

458
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:43,261
What took you so long?

459
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,350
-I'll get going now.
-Okay.

460
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,310
Bye.

461
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,020
Bye.

462
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,064
What? Wait a second.

463
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,567
You brat. Did I raise you like that?

464
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,861
It's dark. You should take her home.

465
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,322
She lives close by.

466
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,950
He's right. I'm fine.

467
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,613
I can go alone from here.

468
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,867
Go back home.

469
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,744
Let's just go.

470
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,537
-You're not well--
-I said, let's just go.

471
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,935
MOM

472
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,687
Where are you?

473
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,398
I made a study group. Don't be late.

474
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,402
I won't forgive you
if you get lazy because of this.

475
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,154
Get your head on straight.

476
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,174
MOM

477
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,430
11 MISSED CALLS FROM MOM

478
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,619
Doors are closing.

479
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,588
He isn't picking up?

480
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,343
Your call is being forwarded to voicemail.

481
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,471
Why, this kid...

482
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,981
Hey, you jerk.

483
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,941
Why...

484
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,069
Why did you come up here?

485
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,285
I got in the elevator.

486
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,458
We live on the third floor,

487
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,839
but I just couldn't press three.

488
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,052
When I got up here,

489
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,430
I found the door locked.

490
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,410
Why did you do it?

491
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,293
Because I hate Mom.

492
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,467
Because I wanted to stop hating her.

493
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,643
I'm sorry.

494
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,522
I'm sorry, Min-jun.

495
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,359
I'm your father,

496
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,196
and yet I didn't know you felt this way.

497
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,785
I didn't even try to know.

498
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,293
But still,

499
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,879
don't think of doing
anything drastic, okay?

500
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,675
Please, Min-jun.

501
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,639
Why?

502
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,475
Why did you do it?

503
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,855
Why did you go there?

504
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,651
Why did you go up there?

505
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,864
What am I supposed to do then?

506
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,623
How could you do this to me?

507
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,586
How could you do this to me?

508
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,549
How could you do this to me?
I live my life for you!

509
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,051
Exactly.

510
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,770
You live for me.

511
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,525
You can't live without me.

512
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,700
Mom.

513
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,623
Isn't it better...

514
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,337
to give up your greed than to lose me?

515
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,350
-Hello!
-Hello!

516
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,152
The attendance book.

517
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,696
Do you want me to drop it off
at the office?

518
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,406
Yes.

519
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,366
Thank you.

520
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:53,161
Teacher, someone pooped on my toothbrush.

521
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,581
-What?
-Hey, guys!

522
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,749
-What?
-Here you go.

523
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,918
-What is it?
-This is Si-jin's.

524
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,379
This is Eun-byeol's, and this is mine.

525
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,301
I got this from my modeling gig,
and I begged them for two more.

526
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,720
It's so pretty. Thanks.

527
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,555
How could you know how I feel?

528
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,015
It's nice and all,

529
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,726
but let's not wear them
on the same day, okay?

530
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,686
No. I'll use it every day.

531
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,062
The black one is so pretty.

532
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,690
-Let me try it.
-No way.

533
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,460
I-an.

534
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,463
What are you doing here?

535
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,968
What a silly question, right?

536
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,057
You're a swimmer.
Of course, you should be at the pool.

537
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,268
Right?

538
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,481
But...

539
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,734
why do you come when no one is around

540
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,612
and walk around the pool and leave?

541
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,947
You act like you shouldn't be here
or something.

542
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:11,948
I don't want to hear it,

543
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:13,909
so stop.

544
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,620
You told me

545
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,083
that people's expectations
are such a burden at times

546
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,584
that you want to throw them all away.

547
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,630
So, do you feel easy now?

548
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,215
Are you happy?

549
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,593
No, you're not.

550
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:37,933
I said stop.

551
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,518
Is it because you hate me that much?

552
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,439
It has nothing to do with you.

553
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,816
Then are you also...

554
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,360
afraid of the water?

555
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,699
Ever since

556
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,036
my memory came back,

557
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,707
water terrifies me.

558
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,711
When I wanted to die,

559
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,130
to be honest,

560
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,800
I wanted to escape
from the water so badly.

561
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:13,802
I remembered...

562
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,513
just how much

563
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,975
I wanted to live.

564
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,147
And...

565
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,526
I was thankful whenever I saw you.

566
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,197
I was so glad I was alive.

567
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,076
So...

568
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,122
I can't watch you ruin your life.

569
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,448
EUN-BYEOL! COME TO CLASS TWO'S CLASSROOM.

570
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,575
JEONG SU-IN

571
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,259
Your call is being forwarded to voicemail.

572
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,062
Please prepare the documents
for the meeting.

573
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:06,206
GANGNAM POLICE DEPARTMENT

574
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,843
SEKANG HIGH DEATH INCIDENT

575
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,180
NAME: LEE EUN-BI

576
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,394
NAME: LEE EUN-BI

577
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,107
Is Su-in's case the real reason?

578
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,400
I said that isn't it!

579
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:27,954
Eun-byeol.

580
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,790
Hi.

581
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:02,280
HANG IN THERE, I-AN!

582
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,536
Who are you?

583
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,373
Why did you call me here?

584
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,378
I wanted to ask you something.

585
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,883
You remember, don't you?

586
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:23,885
Pardon?

587
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:25,971
Jeong Su-in.

588
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,226
You said yourself that she was a friend.

589
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,689
Su-in?

590
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,315
Yes.

591
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,193
You got a letter from her too.

592
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,488
What did it say?

593
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,535
That's...

594
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,912
What did you ignore

595
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,540
this time?

596
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,042
Do you know...

597
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,586
Su-in?

598
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,213
I asked you first.

599
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,259
Did you forget

600
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,553
everything you did to Su-in?

601
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,432
How could you do that?

602
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,501
What did you do

603
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,296
the day Su-in died?

604
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,091
You deserted her,

605
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,719
so she died alone.

606
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,970
How did it feel to see her dead?

607
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,057
I...

608
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,392
did that?

609
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:55,935
If you...

610
00:55:58,938 --> 00:55:59,939
gone up to her

611
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,818
and asked if she was okay just once,

612
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,237
she wouldn't have died.

613
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,083
You also need to experience

614
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,377
how it feels to be left all alone

615
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,963
in this dark and cold classroom.

616
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,467
You need to know how it feels.

617
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,696
Let me out!

618
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,091
Hello...

619
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,188
Hello?

620
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:24,816
Hello?

621
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:27,986
Hello?

622
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,238
Hello?

623
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,161
Your call is being forwarded to voicemail.

624
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,418
Please help.

625
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,588
Is anyone out there?

626
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,674
Please help me!

627
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,315
Please help.

628
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,735
Please help me.
