1
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,350
To be honest...

2
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,271
I got my memory back

3
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,648
a while ago.

4
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,404
Eun-byeol, do you remember?

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,157
You promised

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,994
to grant me a wish
if you get your memory back.

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,835
Whatever I ask next,

8
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,171
you have to say "Yes."

9
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,174
You...

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,177
You're Ko Eun-byeol, right?

11
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,816
My wish...

12
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,277
isn't so difficult.

13
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,371
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,708
I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,047
Don't say sorry. Just say yes.

16
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,673
Okay?

17
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,513
Why are you doing this to me?

18
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,182
Why are you not Ko Eun-byeol?

19
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,352
Then was everything you said to me a lie?

20
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,562
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

21
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,314
Who are you?

22
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,778
Let's go.

23
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,325
Tae-gwang, let go of her.

24
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,163
I said, let her go.

25
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,799
-Tae-gwang.
-I told you not to do anything.

26
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,758
No.

27
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,010
I have to do it now.

28
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,181
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,528
I-an.

30
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,866
I'm...

31
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,287
not Ko Eun-byeol.

32
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,419
No.

33
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,630
I think

34
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,424
I'm confused about something.

35
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,595
Later...

36
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,307
Let's talk later.

37
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,100
You already...

38
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,104
know it now.

39
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,483
When I lost my memory,

40
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,110
it was so nice.

41
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,240
I had never received...

42
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,202
so much love before.

43
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,958
So, I made a wrong choice.

44
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:14,921
Back then...

45
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,717
I didn't know it would hurt you so much.

46
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,891
I know it's too late.

47
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,440
But I'm really sorry...

48
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,236
for lying to you.

49
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,113
I have no idea...

50
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,617
what you're saying.

51
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,203
So,

52
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,498
I need time to think.

53
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,933
You all know that we are

54
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,852
switching to our summer uniforms, right?

55
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,270
-Yes!
-Yes!

56
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,398
Students who need a new uniform, go to
the nurse's office and submit a request.

57
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,858
Do you have something to say?

58
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,775
Yes.

59
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:25,742
Everyone, do you know
the homepage has been updated?

60
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,118
-Yes!
-Yes!

61
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,828
Gosh. It's so gross.

62
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,497
Hubby, isn't she so lame?

63
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,291
My baby is so excited.

64
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,714
There is an anonymous comment page
for each teacher.

65
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,844
You can leave a message expressing
how thankful you are to your teacher.

66
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,305
Please make sure to leave
many messages for your teacher!

67
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,598
-Okay!
-Okay!

68
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,391
Hey... I mean Ms. Jeong,

69
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,809
is it really anonymous?

70
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,103
Can't you trace the IP address and--

71
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,022
Never mind.

72
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,946
Hey, Tae-gwang!

73
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,199
Come to school on time.

74
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,784
That will be all!

75
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,041
Everyone, have a great day!

76
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,211
-Have a great day!
-Bye!

77
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,963
Our school turned
into a kindergarten since she came.

78
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,006
Duck.

79
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,841
-"Quack, quack!"
-Dean!

80
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,801
"Bring the hammer."

81
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,345
-Student teacher!
-"Everyone, happy!"

82
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,138
-Snack bar!
-Go!

83
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,766
-Hello.
-Hello.

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,980
Were the students behaving themselves?

85
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,317
Yes, they sit as soon as I step into class

86
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,277
and they respond loudly, too.

87
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,033
I have a class to get to, so...

88
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,951
Sure.

89
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,292
She has no idea the kids are mocking her.

90
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,338
Shouldn't you tell her, Mr. Kim?

91
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,507
I already did.

92
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,175
And?

93
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,929
She says she believes
in the innocence of the kids.

94
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,084
I-an is absent today.

95
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,254
I guess he's human after all.

96
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,758
It must have been quite a shock.

97
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:53,973
What?

98
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,975
Don't tell me

99
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,187
you thought he would shield you after

100
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,439
finding out you're not Ko Eun-byeol?

101
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,902
So-yeong.

102
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,070
Poor thing.

103
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,160
Every time others call you Eun-byeol,

104
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,662
how will I-an feel?

105
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,541
What?

106
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,211
"Get rid of me"?

107
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,467
You should know that you being here

108
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,636
itself is painful...

109
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,598
for him.

110
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,953
TEACHERS' ROOM

111
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,598
Aren't you Min-jun's mother?

112
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,308
Hello, sir.

113
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,643
How have you been?

114
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,188
I'm as well as can be.

115
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,607
You are always busy, aren't you?

116
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,568
Yes, I am,

117
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,821
but I had to come all the way here.

118
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,534
Please, have a seat here.

119
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,412
I would like to speak
with Min-jun's English teacher.

120
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,798
Min-jun, your mom is here.

121
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,634
-What?
-She went to the teacher's office.

122
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,852
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

123
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,779
I heard it happened when

124
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,574
So-yeong was alone in the classroom.

125
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,203
And she even lied about being there?

126
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,582
So, why are you penalizing
the innocent kids

127
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,667
and trying to cover this up?

128
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,465
Is that what Min-jun said?

129
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,343
He's too nice to tell on others.

130
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,012
I heard from another student's mom.

131
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,807
I heard everyone in class knows it.

132
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,518
You didn't know?

133
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,149
It is true that So-yeong
was in the classroom,

134
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,862
but there is no proof
that she was responsible.

135
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,156
Then find the proof.

136
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,748
Or give Min-jun his full marks.

137
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,750
Goodness.

138
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,877
Five points?

139
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,297
Why must he suffer such an injustice
when he is not to blame?

140
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,634
It isn't fair to the others
who submitted it on time.

141
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,930
I have to dock points. I'm sorry.

142
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:25,935
I see.

143
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,606
I didn't want to do this
since this is a school,

144
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,026
but since you can't resolve this,

145
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,529
I'll have to call the police for help.

146
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,117
"The police"?

147
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,705
Ms. Shin,

148
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,126
please calm down and have a seat.

149
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,754
-I'll see you later.
-Ms. Shin.

150
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,464
Ms. Shin.

151
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,384
TEACHERS' ROOM

152
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,808
This is J Entertainment.

153
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,019
Your audition has been scheduled.
Give us a call.

154
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,946
Did you hear from them?

155
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,533
My uncle is busy
but I begged him to make time.

156
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,785
You have to do well.

157
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,520
Goodness.

158
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,737
Let's go eat. It's lunchtime.

159
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,366
What? It's lunchtime.

160
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,743
Right.

161
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,287
I don't feel like eating now.

162
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:10,956
Really?

163
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,209
Okay then.

164
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,637
Hello.

165
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,768
Hi, I-an. It's been a while.

166
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,188
What brings you here?
Did you tell Eun-byeol?

167
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,067
I came to see you.

168
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,279
You did?

169
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,532
Okay. Give me a minute.

170
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,008
How have you been?

171
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:45,926
Good.

172
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,681
It's okay. Tell me.

173
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,183
You're here because

174
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,895
you want to know about Eun-byeol, right?

175
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,330
-Tae-gwang.
-What?

176
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,500
Why are you here instead of the cafeteria?

177
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,295
You're so presumptuous.

178
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,964
I don't feel like eating either.

179
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,222
Hey! Over here!

180
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,602
Hello.

181
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,605
Our country is known for fast delivery.

182
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,401
Are you "the handsome guy
in the Sekang High School yard"?

183
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,195
Yes, I am.

184
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,407
-How much is it?
-It is 14,000 won.

185
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,160
-Here you go.
-Enjoy.

186
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,079
-Have a nice day.
-Hey, Tae-gwang.

187
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,499
Black bean noodles are the best
when you don't have an appetite.

188
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,837
This place is super good.

189
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,173
Do you know
that you have to mix it like this?

190
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,592
You don't, do you?

191
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,594
What could you possibly know?

192
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,892
Here, take this one.

193
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,278
Hey, Tae-gwang.

194
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,156
Don't you hate me?

195
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,410
It doesn't taste good cold, so eat up.

196
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,379
So?

197
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,381
How did the talk go last night?

198
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,633
Okay.

199
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,552
Are you happy you got caught?

200
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,220
No.

201
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,390
I guess

202
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,976
I didn't want to get caught
more than I thought.

203
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,108
Stop talking.

204
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,527
Have a dumpling.
You look like a dumpling yourself.

205
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,127
Are you okay?

206
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,380
She's still a kid.

207
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,509
It broke my heart
to think how hard her life was.

208
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,512
Back then,

209
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,765
she and I had...

210
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,727
no one else to turn to

211
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,979
but each other.

212
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,609
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

213
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,572
I won't.

214
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,866
You must have been shocked.

215
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,286
I still...

216
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,331
can't believe it.

217
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,044
I think

218
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,756
I was selfish and held onto her.

219
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,969
When I came to my senses,
my heart just dropped.

220
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,807
Even if I give her all my love...

221
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,229
how painful must it be
to live as someone else?

222
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,236
So, we're going to move and...

223
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,697
transfer her to another school.

224
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,911
Can you not let on until then?

225
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,085
About the laptop incident,

226
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,463
let's not suspect anyone
based on assumptions.

227
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,675
I hope you will all wait

228
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,718
until we resolve this.

229
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,512
That will be all.

230
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,098
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you.

231
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,776
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day. Good job, everyone.

232
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,444
Let's go.

233
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,530
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you.

234
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,045
I went to the computer repair store
yesterday.

235
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,507
One was broken

236
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,053
and two were intentionally reformatted.

237
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,265
Did you know that your team's laptop...

238
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,603
was broken?

239
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,316
Yes.

240
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,943
I did it.

241
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,615
I knew our team's laptop was broken

242
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,034
and reformatted

243
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,369
the other teams' laptops.

244
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,337
If I said that...

245
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,760
what would happen to me?

246
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,356
Our laptop was fine before gym class...

247
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,070
and I did not touch anything.

248
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,247
Min-jun.

249
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:54,294
When you tell a lie,
it is very difficult to fix things...

250
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,631
afterwards.

251
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,051
Yes, you may lose many things,

252
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,097
and others may scorn you.

253
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,686
But if you ignore it
because you're afraid,

254
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,564
it becomes more difficult to fix...

255
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,360
and you become a coward.

256
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,741
The past doesn't disappear.

257
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,918
I hope you wouldn't do such things.

258
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,096
Hello.

259
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,598
-Cha Song-ju?
-Yes.

260
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,560
Show us what you've prepared.

261
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,895
Okay.

262
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,077
"What about me?
Why don't you think about me?

263
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,079
My mom will be gone in two days.

264
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,873
Don't you feel bad for me?

265
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,958
I'm alone too now!

266
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,127
I won't let you go!"

267
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,545
You're good.

268
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,632
Have you received training
elsewhere before?

269
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,633
No.

270
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,969
This is the first agency
I've auditioned with.

271
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,763
Is that right?

272
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,307
We are lucky then.

273
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,767
Good job.

274
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,146
Thank you!

275
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,523
Thank you.

276
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,574
Tae-gwang, what is it?

277
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,451
You never answered my calls,

278
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,245
so I was checking to see
if you blocked my calls.

279
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,330
I wouldn't do that.

280
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,916
Yes, you would.

281
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,043
What on earth?

282
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,253
Hey.

283
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,338
So-yeong is

284
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,465
on cloud nine

285
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,217
because you're leaving.

286
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,720
Yes.

287
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,307
I said I would leave
after I get rid of her.

288
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,227
Then

289
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,813
you better get rid of her quickly,

290
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,732
so I won't have to see this face anymore.

291
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,908
-Goodness.
-Goodness!

292
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,158
So, we're going to move

293
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,452
and transfer her to another school.

294
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,372
Can you not let on until then?

295
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,557
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

296
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,028
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

297
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,615
A ticket to Tongyeong, please.

298
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:36,910
Thank you.

299
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,622
A ticket to Tongyeong, please.

300
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,856
THE LATE LEE EUN-BI

301
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:51,651
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

302
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:01,786
THE LATE LEE EUN-BI

303
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,615
I miss Eun-bi.

304
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,950
We're going to see her now.

305
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,244
No, the real Eun-bi.

306
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,913
She isn't in there.

307
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,247
Yes.

308
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,416
What's the point
in bringing my award to her?

309
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,377
She can't see it anyway.

310
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,130
Eun-bi is in there.

311
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,467
We can't see her,

312
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,178
but if she heard Seung-min won an award,

313
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,973
Eun-bi will be so happy.

314
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,142
She always was.

315
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,186
You're right.

316
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,565
She would compliment me
and make me spicy rice cakes.

317
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,901
You're right.

318
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,447
Are you crying?

319
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,907
No.

320
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,327
If I cry...

321
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,914
Eun-bi will be upset,

322
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,542
so I won't cry.

323
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,002
Let's go.

324
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,427
Ra-jin.

325
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:22,051
TO SEOUL

326
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,436
Gyeong-an.

327
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,358
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

328
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,402
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

329
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,570
I'm fine.

330
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,787
Here.

331
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,877
-I'll put it on for you.
-Sure.

332
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,867
Of course, these factors are not

333
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,620
solid proof that Min-jun did it.

334
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,206
And the same applies to So-yeong.

335
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,885
I understand what you're trying to say.

336
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,973
As you said, there is no solid proof,

337
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,352
so please leave my son alone.

338
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,315
I hope

339
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,859
you would do the same.

340
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,667
I'm home.

341
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,184
It's not true, right?

342
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,896
Your teacher is mistaken, right?

343
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,441
Son.

344
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,569
Answer me.

345
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,678
They don't have proof yet,

346
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,431
so keep your mouth shut.

347
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,728
Wash up and study.

348
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,923
My son.

349
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,467
How is it going?

350
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,472
Did you drink a lot?

351
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,432
Just a little.

352
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,895
When will you grow up and

353
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,981
have a drink with your old man?

354
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,609
I'm much bigger than you.

355
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,360
You smart cookie.

356
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,114
You think being tall
means you're grown up?

357
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,909
You don't even know the joys of drinking.

358
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,580
What are the joys of drinking?

359
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,418
Let's see.

360
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,466
When you feel empty
no matter how much you ate,

361
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,135
just one shot of this and...

362
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,602
Do you want to try one?

363
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,152
After the competition in two days,

364
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,862
pour me a drink then.

365
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,659
Let's see if it fills
the void like you say.

366
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,662
You're such a good boy.

367
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,998
Okay. After you win a medal,

368
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,585
have a drink with me, okay?

369
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,212
Okay.

370
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,113
Mom.

371
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,620
Yes? Do you feel better?

372
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,250
I'll call the school
that you're staying home.

373
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,336
No, I'm fine.

374
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,715
Did you stay up all night?

375
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,913
Hey, Eun-byeol.

376
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,831
What's wrong?

377
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,000
Are you sick or something?

378
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,921
No. I am okay.

379
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,634
I went to my audition.

380
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,721
You did?

381
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,267
Nothing you expected happened.

382
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,562
I think I'm going to
sign a contract with them.

383
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,191
-Song-ju.
-Eun-byeol.

384
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,110
Do you know how much I wanted to

385
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,280
brag to you and have you support me

386
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,574
as I prepared for my audition?

387
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,830
Why did you tear us apart like this?

388
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,874
Song-ju, I...

389
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,136
I know you're all concerned
about the laptop incident.

390
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,182
We've looked at the security videos
and other factors,

391
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,977
but we don't have any conclusive evidence.

392
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,063
Kang So-yeong. Cough.

393
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,150
It isn't her. It isn't.

394
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,652
She's the worst.

395
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:03,239
Didn't I just say
there is no conclusive evidence?

396
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,993
Don't suspect your friend and attack her.

397
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,787
When multiple people
do that to one person,

398
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,248
that is an assault.

399
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:18,045
I hope that will not happen in our class.

400
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,548
But it's obvious.

401
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,550
I didn't say anything.

402
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,638
-I know who did it.
-It was her.

403
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,351
Quiet! So what I'm saying is...

404
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,814
the only way to resolve this is

405
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,026
for the person to come forward.

406
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,154
I'll give you two days.

407
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,574
If anyone wants to talk
about the laptop incident,

408
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,617
come to my office by 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

409
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,245
You may call or text too.

410
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,289
I'll work with you to

411
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,875
find the best way to handle this.

412
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,379
That will be all.

413
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,132
Thank you.

414
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,261
It's obvious.

415
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,722
-Mr. Kim doesn't know.
-We all know who it is.

416
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,682
Just tell the truth.

417
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,166
Eun-byeol.

418
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,544
Eun-byeol.

419
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,631
Are you okay?

420
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,475
Are you sick?

421
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,603
You're burning up.

422
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,564
Get up.
I'll take you to the nurse's office.

423
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,986
Let's go, okay?

424
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,492
You should have said something
if you were sick.

425
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,577
Hey.

426
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,621
Are you really sick?

427
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,373
You're not faking it?

428
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,541
Tae-gwang.

429
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,753
Stop talking to me and get back to class.

430
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,589
Hey.

431
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,049
I'm sick too.

432
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,075
Eun-byeol.

433
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,750
Hello.

434
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,295
Is everything okay?

435
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,880
I... I am okay.

436
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,135
If you have a problem,
come talk to me, okay?

437
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,013
I will.

438
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,307
Eun-byeol, cheer up.

00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,361

00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,041
What are you doing here, Mom?

442
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,339
-This is difficult.
-Right?

443
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,383
They said I need to answer one
every minute.

444
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,761
Are they kidding me? I mean...

445
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,723
-Hey.
-You're all better. Let's go.

446
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,807
Hey, Eun-byeol.

447
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,852
Hey, Tae-gwang. Tae-gwang! You punk!

448
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,146
I'm going to call the police!

449
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:11,982

452
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,965
Let's just go. Please?

453
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,053
Let's go.

454
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,805
Come on.

455
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,152
Isn't it awesome?

456
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:43,907
Do you remember?

457
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,411
What?

458
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,873
Hi, Eun-byeol!

459
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,005
Hi, Eun-byeol!

460
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,933
Should I redo my greeting?

461
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,359
Hi,

462
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,278
Lee Eun-bi.

463
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,141
Thanks...

464
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,478
Tae-gwang.

465
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:02,861
Gosh.

466
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,489
Hey.

467
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,282
What is this?

468
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,744
What is this?

469
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,665
-A cell phone.
-A mobile phone.

470
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,711
What color is this?

471
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,799
-Jet-black.
-Pitch-black.

472
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,513
See? What you call it doesn't matter.

473
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,101
The same goes for you.

474
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:38,021
I don't care
whether you're Eun-byeol or Eun-bi.

475
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,148
So, when you're with me,

476
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,150
be whoever you want.

477
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,531
Do whatever you want.

478
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,779
He is so handsome!

SEKANG HIGH SWIM TEAM

480
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,160
Hey, I-an.

481
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,585
At her old school,

482
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,046
there was someone who tortured her so much

483
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,882
that she decided
to do something very drastic.

484
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,017
Aren't you going to thank me?

485
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,602
For what?

486
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,312
I don't know about anyone else,

487
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,397
but I thought you would understand me.

488
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,859
Isn't it upsetting having some random girl

489
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,194
pretend to be Eun-byeol?

490
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,531
I heard you're the one
that made her do it.

491
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:17,037
Well, you can say that I guess.

492
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,374
But there is a lot more to unravel,

493
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,000
so you just wait and see.

494
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:25,879
Hey, New Girl.

495
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,343
That's enough.

496
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,554
You look pitiful.

497
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,690
"Pitiful"?

Here comes Tongyeong's Miss K!

512
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,404
Hey, Song-ju.
You said we were making it up.

513
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,072
What's this? What?

514
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,785
Don't say it's someone
with the same name at a nearby school.

515
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,079
Why did she have to come to our school?

516
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,207
How annoying.

517
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,375
Annoying? It's disgusting.

518
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,503
-So annoying.
-It gave me goosebumps.

519
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,671
Look at her.

520
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:40,931
Song-ju.

521
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,851
I...

522
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,331
Eun-byeol, have you eaten?

523
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,375
Let's go to the snack bar.

524
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,085
You buy. I bought last time.

525
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,003
-Let's go to the snack bar.
-Let's go.

526
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,964
-Let's go to the snack bar.
-Sure.

527
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,633
-Let's go.
-I'm so hungry.

528
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,350
What's going on?

529
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,269
Did you do it?

530
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,522
It wasn't me.

531
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,151
Are you okay?

532
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,281
I think it's for the best.

533
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,327
What is? What's for the best?

534
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,122
You'll get rid of So-yeong and then what?

535
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,124
You'll transfer out and that's it?

536
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,878
But then again,

537
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,380
you must be happy.
You have no good memories here.

538
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,594
You don't have any good memories with me?

539
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,555
What?

540
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,018
I was very happy here.

541
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,771
You're one of the reasons why.

542
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:20,614
You're not going anywhere yet.

543
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,451
You better be strong.

I'm going to expose Eun-byeol

550
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,535
Too bad, you're going to miss a good show.

551
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,372
Good luck on your race.

-Hello, Miss K.
-Hello.

553
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,129
She's here.

554
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,340
-Hello, Miss K.
-Miss K.

555
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,801
What is she doing?

556
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,136
Miss K, hello.

557
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:29,849
-Who cares if she does well in school?
-How evil.

558
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:37,649
-Hello, Miss K.
-Hello.

559
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,026
-Look at Miss K.
-Hello, Miss K.

560
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,320
-Hello, Miss K.
-Hello.

561
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,280
Freak.

562
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,573
So funny.

563
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,780
You should be careful.

564
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,178
Oh, no.

565
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,472
He looks badly hurt. Are you okay?

566
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,078
Are you okay?

567
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,412
-He's hurt.
-Are you okay?

568
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,623
-Call 911.
-Are you okay?

569
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,458
Call the ambulance. He's hurt.

570
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,459
Is he okay?

571
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,336
-Are you okay?
-Is he okay?

572
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,506
-Is he okay?
-He's moving.

573
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,840
He looks badly hurt.

574
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,639
Guys.

575
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,893
You've been enjoying
bad-mouthing me lately,

576
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,520
haven't you?

577
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,854
You're quick.

578
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,857
-It's so much fun.
-What is she saying?

579
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,819
-We are enjoying it so much.
-What a thick skin.

580
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,570
-What's wrong with her?
-So much fun.

581
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,863
She is disgusting.

582
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,157
That's good.

583
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,243
Yes.

584
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,162
The N Girls' High in the article

585
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,290
is Noori Girls' High School
that I went to.

586
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,252
And I am that Miss K.

587
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,255
-See?
-Wow. Insane.

588
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,298
I knew it.

589
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,260
-Everyone knows.
-What is up with her?

590
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:13,221
-Did she just admit it?
-She has some nerve.

591
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,098
But,

592
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,769
about that outcast who supposedly died...

593
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,607
Don't you want to know

594
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:26,943
what she looked like?

595
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,571
Do you want me...

596
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,546
to show you?

597
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,507
-What?
-Show us.

598
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,926
-Give it to us.
-Let's see.

599
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,041
How much are you involved?

600
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,585
Your name is all over the investigation.

601
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,963
Was it really Min-jun?

602
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,631
Look.

603
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,300
This happened because

604
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,720
you didn't raise him with love.

605
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,182
We can't let So-yeong and that girl

606
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,393
go to the same school.

607
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,603
Rock, paper, scissors.

608
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,646
Fine.

609
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,024
Then, I'll take care of it myself.
