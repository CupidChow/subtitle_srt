1
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,557
"A tough time"?

2
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,186
When she had someone risking his life
to protect her?

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,190
So...

4
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,278
Lee Eun-bi went to Tongyeong?

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,698
No wonder.

6
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,160
I wondered how the little outcast
was so confident.

7
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,332
Poor I-an, what will you do now?

8
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,920
Hey, So-yeong.

9
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,299
What are you trying to say?

10
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,051
Did you know?

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,307
I-an left a competition
and was running to school

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,601
when he got in the accident.

13
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,437
What?

14
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:07,275
Whom do you think
he did something so reckless to save?

15
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,030
He already knew that she was Lee Eun-bi

16
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,741
and not Ko Eun-byeol by then.

17
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,160
What is she yapping about?

18
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,748
Hey, I-an.

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,210
I have a question.

20
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,340
Who is the one you like?

21
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,468
Ko Eun-byeol...

22
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,387
or Lee Eun-bi?

23
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,730
Hey, new girl.

24
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,525
I don't think

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,237
I have a reason to answer you.

26
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,406
No?

27
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,160
I just thought Eun-byeol would be curious.

28
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,371
Aren't you?

29
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,039
So-yeong.

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,168
You have a way of driving people crazy.

31
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,253
Why?

32
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,174
Are you going crazy
wondering what I-an will say?

33
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,594
No, not at all.

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,429
My goodness.

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,390
Hey.

36
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,269
Control your facial expressions
if you want to lie.

37
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,523
You dare to bring up my sister
whom you almost killed,

38
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,737
and my best friend of ten years
to mess with me?

39
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,031
Are you crazy?

40
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,167
I'm not interested in your games,

41
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,880
so go find someone else
while I'm being nice.

42
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,092
If you have realized
that it's not gonna work, get lost.

43
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,290
What?

44
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,376
Your temper is a work of art.

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,753
Take your hands off me.

46
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,713
Gosh...

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,800
Is that why you hurt your shoulder?

48
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,178
It was hurting before that too.

49
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,598
What?

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,434
Never mind.

51
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,270
Hey.

52
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,689
What's wrong with Tae-gwang?

53
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,608
What about him?

54
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,194
When he realized I wasn't Eun-bi,

55
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,405
he yelled at me asking where she was,
then ran out.

56
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,784
Now I hear he went to Tongyeong.

57
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,369
-Tongyeong?
-Yes.

58
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,787
He slept there last night.

59
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,123
Tae-gwang

60
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,834
has gone madder while I was gone.

61
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,256
What should I do with him?

62
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,311
I'm too late for class anyway.

63
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,647
Fine.

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,275
Ra-jin.

65
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,195
Put him on the bus to the bus terminal
on your way to school.

66
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,407
-Okay.
-Hey. Do you think I'm a fool?

67
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,450
This little kid is going to
take me to the bus stop?

68
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,663
Ra-jin is ten times
more trustworthy than you are.

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,959
Get home safely.

70
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,502
Bye.

71
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,338
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

72
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,424
-Bye.
-Let's go.

73
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,884
-Hold my hand.
-Let's go.

74
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,264
You'll come back, right?

75
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,770
Answer me. You'll come back, right?

76
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,189
Hey, watch your step.

77
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:19,902
I'll be waiting.

78
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,405
Tae-gwang...

79
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,701
Hey, kids. Wait for me.

80
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,749
Hey, just study on your own
for math class today.

81
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,125
Okay.

82
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,212
I need to ask Mr. Kim something.

83
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,714
Is he in the office?

84
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,799
I don't think he came in today.

85
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,177
We didn't have
morning homeroom time either.

86
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,596
What is it?

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,265
-Do you want me to take a look?
-Really?

88
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,017
I don't want to bother you though.

89
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
Not at all.

90
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,395
Let me see.

91
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,108
This one.

92
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,906
CLUB APPLICATION FORM

93
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,699
-What's this?
-What?

94
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,161
An application
for an after-school sports club.

95
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,288
-Are you going to play badminton?
-Yes.

96
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,165
Wow, you're doing sports now?

97
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,708
Nice.

98
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,502
Min-seok.

99
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,593
Hubby, unbutton your shirt
while I'm being nice.

100
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,928
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,601
Come on. More.

102
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,353
-More?
-More!

103
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,396
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,150
Don't leave a single one buttoned.
Take it off.

105
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,318
Oh, my gosh.

106
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,363
More. Keep going.

107
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,532
Hey.

108
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,284
Unbutton completely.

109
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,327
Really?

110
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,746
Gi-tae, Hae-na...

111
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,290
Your conversation sounds kind of wrong.

112
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,836
I wore it. Isn't that enough?

113
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,008
COUPLE T-SHIRT

114
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,511
See? Now that's what I'm talking about.

115
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,388
Thank you, my Gi-tae.

116
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:12,974
Now smile.

117
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,851
Okay.

118
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,951
I'm sorry for startling you.

119
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,745
No, not at all.

120
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,915
But will you be okay?

121
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,712
I wanted to wait
until the first semester ends,

122
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,174
but I've been hiding it for too long.

123
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,884
I just can't do it any longer.

124
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,306
I'll turn myself in for what happened

125
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,894
to Jeong Su-in a year ago.

126
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,065
Eun-bi.

127
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,153
Your government ID has been reissued.

128
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,031
I feel like a load has been lifted.

129
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,949
-You feel relieved too, right?
-Yes.

130
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,202
I know you have been through a lot,

131
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,954
but everything will be okay soon,
so don't worry.

132
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,915
Okay.

133
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,461
I heard you want to become a teacher.

134
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,757
All you need to do now is study hard.

135
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:33,513
I'll get the adoption process started.

136
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,349
Hello?

137
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,143
Eun-bi.

138
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,229
Eun-bi?

139
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,773
Yes, Mom.

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,070
Aren't you coming back to Seoul?

141
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,532
Are you having second thoughts

142
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,659
after seeing the kids?

143
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,457
Give me a little more time.

144
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,961
I'm sorry, Mom.

145
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,797
Okay.

146
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,218
Let's talk again soon.

147
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,804
Oh Jeong-a?

148
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,181
Eun-bi.

149
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,019
You were alive.

150
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,032
How are you...

151
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,199
I...

152
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,660
came here often

153
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,163
whenever I thought of you.

154
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,167
You must be shocked.

155
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,793
It's all right.

156
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,423
I thought it may not be you.

157
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,177
Eun-bi.

158
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,056
To be honest...

159
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,266
LEE EUN-BI

160
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,896
I hated myself for being such a coward
up until the day you left school.

161
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,940
So when I heard you went missing,

162
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,069
I went to the beach every day.

163
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,573
I mean...

164
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,701
We can't make out her face.

165
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,995
We just covered her up a little,

166
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,289
but based on her clothes

167
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,375
she looks like a student.

168
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,252
Yes, please come quickly. Hurry.

169
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,882
At first, I thought it might be you.

170
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,343
And even if it wasn't,

171
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,470
I wanted to punish So-yeong

172
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,264
who went around saying
she did nothing wrong.

173
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,894
That's why I left
your school name tag there.

174
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,273
This all happened to you
because you helped me,

175
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,860
but I ignored you.

176
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,321
I may have been

177
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,157
worse than So-yeong.

178
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:42,993
No.

179
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,289
I know better than anyone

180
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,294
just how horrible and scary it is

181
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,633
to be an outcast.

182
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,431
You had no choice.

183
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,517
I understand.

184
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,894
I wanted to go up to you

185
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,524
so many times, and...

186
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,447
I wanted to help you

187
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,659
as you had helped me, but...

188
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,745
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,375
I'm so sorry, Eun-bi.

190
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,925
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,862
Hey, Eun-byeol!

192
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,405
Hi, I-an.

193
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,618
Did you guys make up?

194
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,785
What?

195
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,455
We did, right?

196
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,418
We didn't fight. It was all my fault.

197
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,796
What could I-an have done wrong
to Eun-byeol?

198
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,965
It's always the other way around, right?

199
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,968
Hey, he has done wrong before.

200
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,179
What? Tell us one thing he did wrong.

201
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,936
See? There aren't any.

202
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,312
Right?

203
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,359
Hey.

204
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,487
Don't you think Eun-byeol
is back to being a spoiled brat

205
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,155
now that her memory is back?

206
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,365
Right?

207
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,992
The nice girl Eun-byeol is gone.

208
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,551
Hey.

209
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:09,515
What's with that face?
You barely got back in the water.

210
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,270
You knew it wouldn't be like before.

211
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,896
I knew that,

212
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,525
but after actually swimming,
it doesn't feel so good.

213
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,526
So what?

214
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,278
Are you going to hide again?

215
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,321
Don't worry.

216
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,491
I have made my decision,
so I won't do that.

217
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,536
Good.

218
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,622
The determination is half the battle.

219
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,915
And smile.

220
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,251
Get some rest, okay?

221
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,586
I will.

222
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,421
Begin.

223
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,564
I know it's painful for you
every time you see me.

224
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,692
Still, I wish you'll recover quickly

225
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,864
and go back to how you used to be.

226
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,640
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

227
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,353
Eun-bi.

228
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,065
What is that?

229
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,441
A gold medal.

230
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,235
It's not a toy. It's real.

231
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,946
Right.

232
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,658
Wasn't that in the columbarium

233
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,202
next to your picture?

234
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,579
Do you remember that?

235
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,415
Ra-jin, you're so smart.

236
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,129
Did you get it as a gift
when you were in Seoul?

237
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,547
Yes.

238
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,552
But I need to return it
to its rightful owner.

239
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,597
It belongs to someone else,

240
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,559
but I've been holding it for her.

241
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,478
I see.

242
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,481
But...

243
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,693
may I touch it just once?

244
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,195
Sure.

245
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,284
Wow, it's so cool.

246
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,209
I had been struggling

247
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,255
because I didn't know what to call you.

248
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,050
Get home safely, Eun-bi.

249
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,392
Eun-bi.

250
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,979
You want to go back to Seoul, don't you?

251
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:03,939
What?

252
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:06,900
No.

253
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,194
You have a mom

254
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,114
and lots of friends now.

255
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,366
And?

256
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,495
Are you afraid I'll return to Seoul

257
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,706
and leave you again?

258
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,207
No.

259
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,546
I now know that you didn't die,

260
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,089
so I'm not worried.

261
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,009
You want to go back to school

262
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,262
and see your friends, right?

263
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,599
Ra-jin.

264
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:43,187
You don't have to stay here
because of us anymore.

265
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,397
But...

266
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,527
promise you'll come on our birthdays,
Children's Day, and Christmas.

267
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,238
Okay?

268
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,619
Promise.

269
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,208
You promise, right?

270
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:08,879
Okay.

271
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,340
I promise.

272
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,245
JEONG SU-IN AUTOPSY REPORT
TIME OF DEATH: 4:30 P.M.

273
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,507
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

274
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,553
You don't need to go this far.

275
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,848
The disciplinary action
won't be too harsh.

276
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,977
Things will quiet down soon,
so just stay put.

277
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,520
Sir.

278
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:12,651
-If I were to be charged under the law--
-Stop being so weak!

279
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,529
That incident was an accident.

280
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,448
It's not like you left her there
when you knew,

281
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,201
and I didn't cover it up
for my personal gain.

282
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,704
But, sir...

283
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:24,955
I...

284
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,125
had no choice.

285
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,503
-It was for the school and the students.
-But you hid the truth.

286
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,260
Su-in died because everyone shunned her.

287
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,599
And you made sure no one remembered her
after she died.

288
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,312
The law I violated

289
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,106
is the Child Welfare Law.

290
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,820
Su-in was 15 years old at the time.

291
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,533
You and I did that to a girl
whom we were supposed to protect

292
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,995
from harm.

293
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,917
So please stop.

294
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,379
Even if you can't stop,

295
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,591
I will stop here.

296
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,767
What?

297
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,019
Am I so handsome
that you can't take your eyes off me?

298
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,858
I heard you went to Tongyeong yesterday.

299
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,821
You can't reach her, right?
She got a new number.

300
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,531
Did she?

301
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,034
I didn't call, so I didn't know.

302
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,919
Are you annoyed that I went to Tongyeong?

303
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,256
-No.
-Are you jealous?

304
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,050
-No.
-Then why are you staring at me?

305
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,927
Say what you want.

306
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,012
Is she okay?

307
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,601
So?

308
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,645
Is she okay?

309
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,608
Is she okay?

310
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,945
Yes, she's fine.

311
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,324
That's good then.

312
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,796
I knew she would be.

313
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,923
What? You still can't believe it?

314
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,676
Then go to House of Love.

315
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,930
I'm sure I heard she went down there.

316
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,809
Our little outcast
came back from the dead.

317
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,895
We should throw her
a big welcome-back party.

318
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,819
Are you insane?

319
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,283
Hey!

320
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,078
What do you think you're doing?

321
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,204
So-yeong.

322
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,749
Does it hurt seeing me

323
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,168
step on something of yours?

324
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,341
You want to kill me now, don't you?

325
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,343
Yes.

326
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,678
I want to kill you.

327
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,681
How do you think

328
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,684
I felt...

329
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,105
when you stepped on my sister?

330
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,779
You want to kill me over a cell phone.

331
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,658
What thoughts do you think

332
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,161
are going through my head when I see you?

333
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,789
Hey.

334
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,333
Move

335
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,794
your foot.

336
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,544
Hey.

337
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,714
Why do you keep calling me?

338
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,883
You know I don't talk to you, right?

339
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,262
If you're not going to talk,

340
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:33,972
I'm leaving.

341
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,519
Eun-byeol.

342
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,526
How much do you know
about Jeong Su-in's case?

343
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,779
Why...

344
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,532
do you care about that?

345
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,617
Do you know...

346
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,580
what the director's involvement is
in that case?

347
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,793
I don't know the details.

348
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,922
After that happened to Su-in,

349
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,299
we waited for the autopsy report,

350
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:14,429
and the police said her time of death
was between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.

351
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,682
I remember they said
it couldn't have been any later.

352
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,393
But when the official
autopsy report came out,

353
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,354
the time of death

354
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,148
was 7:30 p.m.

355
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:31,238
Su-in's family says
she definitely died during class.

356
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,115
But there is no proof.

357
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,414
The autopsy report says 7:30 p.m.,

358
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,377
and they refused to redo the autopsy.

359
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,172
Do you mean it was fabricated?

360
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,716
They must have wanted to make it
like she died late after school alone.

361
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,804
Not in the middle of class

362
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,807
when teachers and other students
were there.

363
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,395
Okay.

364
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,542
Hey.

365
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,392
-A bowl of noodle soup, please.
-Okay.

366
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,649
You look horrible.

367
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,985
Look who's talking.

368
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,321
Is something wrong?

369
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,324
Just...

370
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,369
Hey.

371
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,581
Do you want to share
each other's problems?

372
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,834
Sure, whatever.

373
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:11,963
There was a student

374
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,092
whom I could not protect.

375
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,848
If I finally step up and reveal the truth,

376
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,978
I would be taking away
another student's father

377
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,856
with my own hands.

378
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,695
In other words,

379
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,031
if I want to relieve one kid's pain,

380
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,867
I will have to hurt another one.

381
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,082
I am a teacher to both of them.

382
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,461
What should I do?

383
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,511
The student's father who did wrong
is the problem.

384
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,182
But...

385
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,894
if it were me,

386
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,857
I would tell that student

387
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,780
to try to convince his father
one last time

388
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,241
before it's too late.

389
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,662
Before someone else destroys him.

390
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,572
Dad.

391
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,824
What is it?

392
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,595
AUTOPSY REPORT

393
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,685
What do you think you're doing?

394
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,605
I gave you everything you need.

395
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,357
Is this how you repay me?

396
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,194
Finding my weakness
and threatening me with it?

397
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,740
Fine.

398
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,117
What is it that you want?

399
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,871
What do you want to get out of me
by showing me that?

400
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,456
Tell me.

401
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,418
I don't know.

402
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,546
-What?
-I don't know.

403
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,840
So, I want to ask you.

404
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,261
I truly hate you.

405
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,556
I thought I would be
the happiest person in the world

406
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,060
if you were to lose everything.

407
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,566
But even when I have this in my hand,

408
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,320
I can't do anything.

409
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,238
Why is that?

410
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,202
Do you know why,

411
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,454
Dad?

412
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,680
Do...

413
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,058
what you want with this.

414
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,811
Once you make your choice,

415
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,524
I'll take that
as your answer to my question.

416
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:18,353
HOUSE OF LOVE

417
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,406
How many nights till we meet again?

418
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,742
-Just 14 nights!
-Just 14 nights!

419
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,411
Even if you miss me,

420
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,705
you have to be strong, okay?

421
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,998
-Okay!
-Okay!

422
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,919
Goodbye, Eun-bi.

423
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,005
-Bye!
-Bye, Eun-bi!

424
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,509
Bye.

425
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,141
Bye, Eun-bi!

426
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,769
-Bye, Eun-bi!
-Bye, Eun-bi!

427
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,566
I'll be back.

428
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,314
Kong Jae-ho.

429
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,870
-Isn't that the director?
-What happened?

430
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,830
He must have done something wrong.

431
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,302
This is Jeong Su-in's
first autopsy report.

432
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,597
Estimated time of death is 4:30 p.m.

433
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,556
What is this?

434
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:07,188
Do you admit to fabricating
the official report

435
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,398
to cover up the incident?

436
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,443
I'm the one
who should be punished for this.

437
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,825
I'm the one who wanted to bury the fact
that she died during class.

438
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,369
So I forged the time of death.

439
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,122
I did it all on my own.

440
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,544
Kim Jun-seok already knew everything.

441
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,588
He was her homeroom teacher,

442
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,341
yet he kept it quiet
which is also a big crime.

443
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,385
He can't get away with that.

444
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,221
Kim Jun-seok did not stay silent.

445
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,724
Every time he tried to tell the truth,

446
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:48,146
I used my authority and power over him
to make sure he could not.

447
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,233
So, please consider all the facts.

448
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,070
Here are your drinks.

449
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,280
Thank you.

450
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,711
Are you keeping up
with your physical rehabilitation?

451
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,795
Yes.

452
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,547
It will get better.

453
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,676
I-an.

454
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,804
How well do you think you know me?

455
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,557
I don't know.

456
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,602
When we were young,
I thought I knew everything.

457
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,313
But I don't know now.

458
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,858
Before what happened at school,

459
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,360
I had no idea about
what was happening in your life.

460
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,200
About Eun-bi too?

461
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,410
Yes.

462
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,830
Eun-bi is lucky.

463
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,167
She has a reliable big sister like you.

464
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,301
Hey,

465
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,679
Eun-bi protected someone being bullied

466
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,348
and became bullied herself.

467
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,102
I ignored a friend in need
and kept running away.

468
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,733
Who do you think is more miserable?

469
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,528
It's been tough for you, hasn't it?

470
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,530
You're disappointed in me, right?

471
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,825
Hey.

472
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,453
I need to have expectations
to be disappointed.

473
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,829
Do you want to die?

474
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,458
Still,

475
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,504
I feel so much better
after telling you everything.

476
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:52,812
Mom.

477
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,606
Have you seen the doll in my room?

478
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,857
The teddy bear?

479
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,152
Eun-byeol put it in my room.

480
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,529
Why?

481
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,116
She sneezes if there are furry things
around her.

482
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,119
She just hates dolls.

483
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,537
I see.

484
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,541
Who gave that to you?

485
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,128
Well, a friend.

486
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,049
Excuse me.

487
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,471
Would you give this to Han I-an?

488
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,931
"Han I-an"?

489
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,809
What are you doing here?

490
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,412
-You know...
-Hey...

491
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,790
You go first.

492
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,253
I heard you went to Tongyeong.

493
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,422
Yes.

494
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,175
While you were gone,

495
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,385
I began my physical rehabilitation.

496
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,806
Really? That's great.

497
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,977
I figured you would get right up

498
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,980
once you saw that Eun-byeol was back.

499
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,149
But I didn't think it would be this quick.

500
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,402
That's not why.

501
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,863
It's okay.

502
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,158
That wasn't me who motivated you,

503
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,744
but I still feel good.

504
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,289
I don't have to worry about you anymore.

505
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,481
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

506
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:04,860
You should give this

507
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,947
to its rightful owner.

508
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,577
You made the promise, so you keep it.

509
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,874
I-an.

510
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,210
How do you feel now?

511
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,048
Is it easier seeing me now?

512
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,886
It's not like Eun-byeol returning

513
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,390
will undo the fact that I lied, but...

514
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,351
Why?

515
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,396
Are you planning
to really disappear or something?

516
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,232
Hey.

517
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,402
Although I had a hard time
because of you...

518
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,321
Fine.

519
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,367
I admit I was harsh to you
because I was confused.

520
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,121
But did you think
I would really be like that?

521
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,584
You thought I would be happy and relieved

522
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,043
if you are gone?

523
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,046
Do you think I would be like that?

524
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,216
Thanks.

525
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,597
Then I won't avoid you.

526
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,141
Is that okay?

527
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,602
Sure.

528
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,078
SEKANG FOUNDATION'S DIRECTOR,
KONG JAE-HO, ARRESTED

529
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,943
LEE EUN-BI

530
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,469
What is it Eun-bi?

531
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,304
Hey, Tae-gwang.

532
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:39,974
Hello?

533
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,142
Tae-gwang.

534
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,687
Hello?

535
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,523
Hey, Tae-gwang.

536
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,025
Tae-gwang, are you okay?

537
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,922
Mom.

538
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,484
MOM

539
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,697
MOM

540
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,052
EUN-BYEOL, IT'S OKAY TO IGNORE ME.
YOU ARE STILL MY ONE AND ONLY FRIEND.

541
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,866
Hello.

542
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,419
You must be Tae-gwang's friend.

543
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:14,837
Yes.

544
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,214
My name is Lee Eun-bi.

545
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,091
I'm in his class.

546
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,428
Seeing how you're not surprised to see me,

547
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,013
I guess I can assume

548
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,017
that you know quite well
about Tae-gwang, right?

549
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:31,979
Yes.

550
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,317
He used to smile a lot

551
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,612
when he was a kid.

552
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,118
After what happened with his dad and me,

553
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,830
he was very hurt.

554
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,086
I ignored his pain and sadness

555
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,133
although it was clearly visible

556
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,845
because I was too busy with work.

557
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,891
I had no idea

558
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,936
how deep a scar that would leave.

559
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,858
I have no right to even regret it.

560
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,279
But still,

561
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,034
I feel better

562
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,621
knowing that he has a friend like you

563
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,166
who is there for him at times like these.

564
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,337
Thank you.

565
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,299
You're welcome.

566
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,055
By the way...

567
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:55,687
Here.

568
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,024
Would you give this to Tae-gwang?

569
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,778
Please.

570
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,784
Yes, I will.

571
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,759
Tae-gwang.

572
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:27,719
Are you awake?

573
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:32,975
How do you feel?

574
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,687
If you were that sick,

575
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,939
you should have called someone.

576
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,233
You came anyway.

577
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,902
I'm not joking.

578
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,823
It could have been dangerous.

579
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,992
Were you worried about me?

580
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,535
Of course.

581
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,746
You won't ever have feelings for me.

582
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,250
So you shouldn't be doing this.

583
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,379
So what?

584
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:04,881
Do you want me to leave?

585
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,052
No.

586
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,264
So...

587
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:17,811
thank you.

588
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,291
After Su-in passed away,

589
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,002
I was cleaning her room

590
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,005
and found her blog...

591
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,799
LET'S STUDY HARD AND GET BETTER GRADES!

592
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,426
...and diary

593
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,512
were filled with stories about you.

594
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,933
The times spent with you

595
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,436
seem to have been

596
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,772
the happiest times for Su-in.

597
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:31,987
What are you doing?

598
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,739
Do you want to listen to this?

599
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,996
How will we paint

600
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,749
This day that is given to us?

601
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:48,754
-What colors could we paint on this day?
-What colors could we paint on this day?

602
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,391
What is this?

603
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:06,188
Don't worry

604
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,608
It's okay if you don't do well

605
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,568
You are still

606
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,779
Hey, let's go to the snack bar.

607
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,324
What on earth?

608
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,661
How will we paint

609
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:26,208
-This day that is given to us?
-This day that is given to us?

610
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,667
Eun-byeol.

611
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,505
It's okay if you ignore me.

612
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,467
You are still my one and only friend.

613
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:46,770
I think...

614
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,815
that's why I was being so stubborn

615
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,361
since you were the only one
she considered as a friend.

616
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,406
I thought, "If you had gone up to her..."

617
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,867
I was selfish.

618
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,370
I'm sorry.

619
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,587
It must have been so painful for you too.

620
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,968
I'm sorry, Eun-byeol.

621
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,701
THE 96TH NATIONAL COMPETITION

622
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,327
I-an.

623
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,538
I'm not the little Eun-byeol anymore.

624
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,498
We've already grown,

625
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,877
and many things have changed.

626
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,546
THE 96TH NATIONAL COMPETITION

627
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,854
Still, I wish you'll recover quickly

628
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,441
and go back to how you used to be.

629
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:16,943
I will help you

630
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,571
in any way I can.

631
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:22,991
Even if that means...

632
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,288
I need to disappear.

633
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,320
Eun-bi, what are you doing? Let's go eat.

634
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,201
I'm too weak to even use chopsticks.

635
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:14,960
Yes, that one.

636
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,923
Stop that.

637
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:21,800
So disgusting.

638
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,593
This looks like you.

639
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,179
Sorry.

640
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,056
It looks good.

641
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,943
Hey, Tae-gwang.

642
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,320
Are you sure you have no appetite?

643
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,324
Maybe it was because I ate alone,

644
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,119
but I really had no appetite at home.

645
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,916
I won't go to you even if you faint,
so you look after yourself.

646
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,042
Darn it.

647
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,048
Is there anyone home with you?

648
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,509
There's one person. The housekeeper.

649
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:06,970
Anyone else?

650
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:08,805
No.

651
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,020
You can't even debone that.

652
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:16,771
Here.

653
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,651
Thanks.

654
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,279
Right.

655
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,534
Your mom came by
to see you at the hospital

656
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,286
while you were asleep.

657
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,374
Here.

658
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,514
Aren't you eating? Eat up.

659
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,684
Good night.

660
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:39,854
Tae-gwang.

661
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,776
Do you want me to teach you
how to make time go faster

662
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,486
when you're alone?

663
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,322
There is no such thing.

664
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:53,535
There is only one thing
that makes time fly for me.

665
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,204
-What's that?
-Being with you.
