1
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,479
You also need to experience

2
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,774
how it feels to be left all alone

3
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,277
in this dark and cold classroom.

4
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,655
You need to know how it feels.

5
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,718
Let me out!

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,946
-Mr. Choi.
-Mr. Kim.

7
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,656
I'm sorry about this.

8
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,283
Don't be.

9
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,369
He was fine when I spoke to him
just this afternoon.

10
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,623
Who knew he would collapse in that time?

11
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,708
I'm sure he'll be fine.

12
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,044
Don't worry about the school and go.

13
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,670
-Thank you again.
-Sure.

14
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,339
Go on.

15
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:42,769
HANG IN THERE, I-AN!

16
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,152
Please help.

17
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,447
Is anyone out there?

18
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,325
Please help me!

19
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,091
Please help.

20
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,261
Please help me.

21
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,105
Eun-byeol.

22
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,398
Mr. Kim.

23
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,070
Are you okay?

24
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,531
Are you hurt?

25
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,535
Why are you here at this hour?

26
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,341
Let's get out of here.

27
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,106
I-an.

28
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,568
I'm glad you're here.

29
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,195
Would you take Eun-byeol home?

30
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,364
Okay.

31
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,076
What's wrong with you?

32
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,456
I think she was very startled
by something.

33
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,709
Go home for now.

34
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,836
Let's talk tomorrow.

35
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,881
Okay, Mr. Kim.

36
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,842
Go on.

37
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,603
Can you walk?

38
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:49,938
Yes.

39
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,898
I'm fine.

40
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,777
Tell me if you're tired.

41
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,155
Okay.

42
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,180
-Your call is being forwarded to...
-Damn it.

43
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,436
Damn it.

44
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,731
Hey. Why is your phone off?

45
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,483
Lower your voice.

46
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,780
Are you okay?

47
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,700
Yes.

48
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,744
What's wrong with her? What happened?

49
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,246
Did you say something to her again?

50
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,872
It's not like that.

51
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,418
If it isn't urgent, talk to her later.

52
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,961
It's super urgent, okay?

53
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,048
Hey, are you transfer...

54
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:04,929
Darn it.

55
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,474
Just go in.

56
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,351
Why do you look like that?

57
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,681
Hey, I-an.

58
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,397
Tell me what's going on.

59
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,566
Why should I do that?

60
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,610
You hate her.

61
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,447
Don't you?

62
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,741
Why can't you answer me?

63
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,451
You...

64
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,037
hate her.

65
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,706
So?

66
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,917
So stay away from her

67
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:17,960
or...

68
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,713
at least don't make her cry.

69
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,736
So, you didn't see her face?

70
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,947
No.

71
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,242
It was dark,

72
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,744
and she wore a cap that covered her face.

73
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,955
I see.

74
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,376
Did you hear anything else?

75
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,838
She brought up Jeong Su-in.

76
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,093
Actually...

77
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,763
I've been getting

78
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,393
text messages from her.

79
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,979
Last night too.

80
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,648
I went to the classroom
after I got her text.

81
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,234
How could that...

82
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,405
I am confused too.

83
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,615
I don't understand.

84
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,077
Eun-byeol.

85
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,248
I'm sorry I can't say anything right now,

86
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:42,295
but can you wait a little more
while I look into it?

87
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,883
If you get another text or anything again,
make sure to tell me.

88
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,759
Okay?

89
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,476
Mr. Kim.

90
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,020
Yes?

91
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,106
So this is where you were.

92
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,233
Yes.

93
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,027
I needed to check something.

94
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,571
Aren't you going to class?

95
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,240
Yes, let's go.

96
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,494
Everyone, it's very hot.

97
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,664
I'm sure it's tough
being in the classroom all day,

98
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,918
but don't forget that your teachers
always care about you.

99
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,461
-Okay.
-Okay.

100
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,716
Good luck again today.

101
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,552
-Good luck!
-I love you!

102
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,390
Do you have anything else to say?

103
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,476
You also need to experience

104
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,646
how it feels to be left all alone

105
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,856
in this dark and cold classroom.

106
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:36,993
That will be all.

107
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,495
Okay.

108
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,415
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

109
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,091
Rooftop.

110
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,693
I-an.

111
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,653
What are you thinking?

112
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,904
What?

113
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,116
Why did you fight
with Eun-byeol this time?

114
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,412
She's already stressed
with the disciplinary hearing.

115
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,788
Go make up with her.

116
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,499
"Disciplinary hearing"?

117
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,297
You must have fought big time.
You didn't know?

118
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,224
That feels good.

119
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,978
I almost got sick
because of that student teacher.

120
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,605
What's wrong with her?

121
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,858
"Everyone..."

122
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,027
I'm feeling sick again.

123
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,236
Burp some more.

124
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,156
Wow, Hae-na is so jealous.

125
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,908
What? Jealous?

126
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,868
It's obvious that Gi-tae got caught.

127
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,203
No!

128
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,829
What do you mean "No"?

129
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,082
You got that teacher's phone number
on the bus--

130
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,333
Go home already.

131
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,169
That's right. My mom called earlier.

132
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,796
Hey, Gi-tae.

133
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,673
You got what on the bus?

134
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,177
Get what? The bus isn't a store.

135
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,720
He's crazy.

136
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,182
Spill it before I dial
everyone in your contact list.

137
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,768
Look at this.

138
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,024
Who is it?

139
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,743
Give me a break.

140
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,127
Hey.

141
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,295
How could you go there alone at night?

142
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,297
What if something happened?

143
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,924
I wanted to know

144
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,761
what happened with Jeong Su-in.

145
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,723
SEKANG HIGH DEATH INCIDENT

146
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,564
PERSON WHO DISCOVERED THE BODY
KO EUN-BYEOL

147
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,818
I can't tell you the details,

148
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,238
but when Su-in died,

149
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,323
Eun-byeol was the first to find her.

150
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,369
How do you know that?

151
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,788
I just do.

152
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,293
Anyway, call if anything like that
happens again.

153
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,086
Anytime, anywhere.

154
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,504
Got it?

155
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,259
What?

156
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,011
Answer me.

157
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,306
Fine.

158
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,476
Goodness!

159
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,397
Aren't you coming?

160
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,069
I'll go in a bit. You go first.

161
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,530
No way. I don't think so.

162
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,366
You can't be alone for the time being.
Come on.

163
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,876
Eun-byeol?

164
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,422
Why are you so jumpy?

165
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,930
I'll see you later.

166
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,233
Hey.

167
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,610
Why were you so jumpy?

168
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,333
EMPLOYEE INFORMATION

169
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,421
MOTHER: KIM SUK-HUI

170
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,932
STUDENT INFORMATION: JEONG SU-IN

171
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,316
SISTER: JEONG MIN-YEONG

172
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,777
What are you looking at?

173
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,320
Nothing.

174
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,364
Aren't you going to class?

175
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,699
Yes, I am.

176
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,410
The career counseling dates are set.

177
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,538
A famous professor
is giving the lecture too.

178
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,581
It's pretty good.

179
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,832
Right.

180
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,459
It's nice that the universities
are doing that.

181
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,879
I hope it helps the students.

182
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,507
Well then...

183
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,603
Mr. Kim.

184
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:56,896
Yes?

185
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,815
Are you free tonight?

186
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,276
Why are you asking?

187
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,654
Since you're an experienced teacher,

188
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,407
I wanted to hear stories
about being a teacher.

189
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,244
Okay.

190
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,432
Are you okay?

191
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,227
Yes.

192
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,107
I was near the school.
Why didn't you call me?

193
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,945
I guess I should have.

194
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,371
Are you really...

195
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,206
going to transfer out?

196
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,125
Why?

197
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,586
You wish I would leave?

198
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:30,322
Let's see which outfit
will win over a girl's heart.

199
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,830
Why aren't you eating?

200
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,208
I have a blind date this Saturday,
so I'm shopping for clothes.

201
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,752
This t-shirt is awesome.

202
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,920
Buy now.

203
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,547
Confirm.

204
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,551
Anyone goes on dates now.

205
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,262
-Let me see.
-Why?

206
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,891
I need to appease my Hae-na
who is upset because of you.

207
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,060
I said I was sorry.

208
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,104
By the way, I'm better looking than you.

209
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,647
I can't hear you.

210
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,816
CUSTOM-MADE T-SHIRTS

211
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,367
This kimchi is good.

212
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,997
What's wrong with the sausage?

213
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,125
-We pay so much for--
-This should do, right?

214
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,171
Hey, Tae-gwang.

215
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,049
Do you not have an appetite lately?

216
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,886
Me neither.

217
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,812
What are you doing?

218
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,481
Hey, Tae-gwang.

219
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,858
You look like you're giving her
your leftovers.

220
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,903
You look the prettiest when you eat.

221
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,404
Eat up.

222
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,785
What will I do with him?

223
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,788
Hey. I'm not interested, and I won't be.

224
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,373
Hey. Do you really like her?

225
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,170
No, right?

226
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,588
Si-jin is too good for you.

227
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,966
Whatever.

228
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,931
Have you heard from Director Kong?

229
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,308
No, not yet.

230
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,352
Not yet?

231
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,649
Why don't you pay him a visit then?

232
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,652
You went. That's enough.

233
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,488
I went, but there is no progress.

234
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,323
You need to get involved.

235
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,829
So-yeong said nobody will believe her
that the twins were switched.

236
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,580
So?

237
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,875
Do you look like that because of her?

238
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,466
Dad...

239
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,013
Can't I just transfer to another school?

240
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,184
I know I can do well
if I go somewhere nobody knows me.

241
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,602
Stop being so weak.

242
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,021
I'm finally getting settled in.

243
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,232
We need to run away
because of a girl like that?

244
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,443
Honey.

245
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,113
Let's talk after dinner.

246
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,949
Stay focused and hang tight.

247
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,752
I just need to get her
transferred out, right?

248
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:34,965
Yes.

249
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,266
I remember when I was a student teacher.

250
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,436
Back then,

251
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,147
I was as passionate as you are.

252
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,983
What about now?

253
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,777
You mean you're not anymore?

254
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,947
Yes, not anymore.

255
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,034
Why not?

256
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,872
What made you change?

257
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,962
Last year,

258
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,342
I lost a student in my class.

259
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,970
I couldn't protect her when she was alive,

260
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,849
and I couldn't when she died either

261
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,066
because I was a coward.

262
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,199
What happened?

263
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,327
It was all my fault,

264
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,538
but I couldn't take responsibility.

265
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,832
I couldn't.

266
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,773
What are you doing?

267
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,067
You know very well what.

268
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,131
SONG HUI-YEONG TO WED
AT HAN HOTEL IN TWO DAYS

269
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,402
What is it?

270
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,532
I have a question.

271
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,035
What is it?

272
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,538
What's between Jeong Su-in, Ko Eun-byeol,

273
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,333
and you?

274
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,670
More specifically,

275
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,923
why are you so afraid of Jeong Su-in
who died a year ago

276
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,427
that you're forcing the witness,
Ko Eun-byeol,

277
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,012
out of the school?

278
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,100
What are you digging up?

279
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,316
From your reaction,

280
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,194
I guess I did hit on something.

281
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,656
The two cases are unrelated.
Stay out of it.

282
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,200
Don't try to find out either.

283
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,915
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

284
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,502
I'll go to the disciplinary hearing
and ask myself

285
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,171
whether or not they're related.

286
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,930
-You rude brat.
-So...

287
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,349
don't kick her out like that.

288
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,895
I've never asked you

289
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,731
for anything before.

290
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,784
Leave it.

291
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,953
I still have more to say.

292
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,637
Firstly,

293
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,683
I know apologies won't cut it,

294
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,979
but I'm truly sorry.

295
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,859
You're Su-in's sister, aren't you?

296
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,486
"Sorry"?

297
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,405
Now?

298
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:11,992
Was it you

299
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,911
who called Eun-byeol into the classroom

300
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,747
last night?

301
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,332
Yes.

302
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,837
You must know why,
so I won't explain myself.

303
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,595
You can do whatever you want to me,

304
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,097
but please don't hurt

305
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,350
these students.

306
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,564
I didn't know you cared so much
about the students.

307
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,901
I understand how you feel,

308
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,612
but this is wrong.

309
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,613
"Wrong"?

310
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,325
I pleaded with the police
and talked to reporters.

311
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,161
If you did everything you could
but to no avail,

312
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,831
what are you supposed to do then?

313
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,253
Until I showed up,

314
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,048
you also

315
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,718
went on with your life without any guilt.

316
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,517
What's wrong with wanting to see people

317
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,895
get the punishment they deserve?

318
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,733
Please give me a chance.

319
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,737
I'll set it right.

320
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,657
How can I trust someone like you?

321
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,494
If I can't keep my promise,

322
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,746
you do whatever you want.

323
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,499
I won't say anything.

324
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,822
SONG HUI-YEONG TO WED
AT HAN HOTEL IN TWO DAYS

325
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,418
Hello?

326
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,713
Hello?

327
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,424
Sorry, wrong number.

328
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,883
Tae-gwang?

329
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,307
Tae-gwang.

330
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:41,975
Tae-gwang?

331
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,019
It's you, isn't it?

332
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,356
-Mom...
-Don't hang up. Let's talk.

333
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,860
I've been wanting to talk to you too.

334
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,653
Please don't hang up.

335
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,218
Hey, Tae-gwang.

336
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,637
What's with that face?

337
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,477
I see.

338
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,024
Because you can't see Eun-bi much longer?

339
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,068
That's what got you down?

340
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,364
Hey, So-yeong.

341
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,908
Just leave.

342
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,078
I'm going anyway.

343
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,336
Just stay tuned until she leaves.

344
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,048
There is much more in the pipeline.

345
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,029
Director.

346
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,365
Go ahead.

347
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,910
When I was in high school,

348
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,206
you know I really
respected and liked you, right?

349
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,167
Jun-seok.

350
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,629
When I lost the class fee
that I collected,

351
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,883
the others assumed I took it

352
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,678
because my family was poor.

353
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,637
Remember that?

354
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,599
Yes, I remember.

355
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,643
If you had

356
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,063
just paid for it yourself or buried it

357
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,150
like nothing happened back then,

358
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:00,363
I probably would have carried
that scar with me to this day.

359
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,203
Why are you bringing up the past?

360
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,831
I will never forget the day

361
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,834
you helped me move the desks

362
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,379
from the storage shed to the schoolyard

363
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,842
in the rain.

364
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,893
I wanted to become a teacher like you.

365
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,814
Please help me stand before kids

366
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,359
without shame at least now.

367
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,529
Jun-seok.

368
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,573
Back then,

369
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,869
I was in a position
where I could worry about just you,

370
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,747
but it's different now.

371
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,958
If you won't do it,

372
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,711
I will set things straight

373
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,130
this time.

374
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,623
Ms. Jeong.

375
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,293
Yes, Eun-byeol. What is it?

376
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,879
I know...

377
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,590
you have something to tell me.

378
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,389
Then shall we go talk?

379
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,624
You're the one...

380
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,211
who has been sending me text messages,

381
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,507
aren't you?

382
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,387
Yes.

383
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,556
It's me.

384
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,189
I want to hear

385
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,359
why you are doing this.

386
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,740
Because...

387
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,826
I'm Su-in's sister.

388
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,917
If I didn't do this,

389
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,003
no one would remember my poor sister

390
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,798
who died like that.

391
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,305
When you were in grade school,

392
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,892
you and Su-in were best friends.

393
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,228
You were inseparable.

394
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,732
You used to come over
to my house often too.

395
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,905
Don't you remember?

396
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,583
ONE YEAR AGO
SEKANG HIGH, FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

397
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:41,918
Su-in.

398
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,878
Ko Eun-byeol?

399
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,296
Eun-byeol.

400
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,549
Gosh. Are we in the same school?

401
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,260
I haven't seen you
since we graduated grade school.

402
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,805
It's so good to see you.

403
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,056
What class are you in?

404
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,266
Class Two. You?

405
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,063
Me too.

406
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,524
Really? You are?

407
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,693
That's great. Let's go.

408
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,529
Let's keep in touch.

409
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,746
What is this?

410
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,456
It stinks.

411
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,381
Let's go to the snack bar.

412
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,868
THE DAY OF JEONG SU-IN'S DEATH

413
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,831
The two functions

414
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,584
meet at

415
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,546
two different points.

416
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,802
Hey.

417
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,055
Wake up the person next to you.

418
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,599
Sir, just continue.

419
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,851
We won't be able to finish
if we keep waking them up.

420
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,815
You study at prep schools
and sleep in school.

421
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,652
What is happening here?

422
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:37,492
Fine. They meet at two different points.

423
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,870
Mr. Kim, please come to my office.

424
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,040
Review your notes.

425
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,856
Hey, Mr. Kim said we can go home now.

426
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,334
Yes.

427
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,087
My poor sister

428
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,674
died alone just like that.

429
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,353
Cause of death,

430
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,398
meningitis.

431
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,235
Estimate time of death,

432
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,531
during Kim Jun-seok's last class,

433
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,491
4:30 p.m.

434
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,786
Time of discovery,

435
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,874
8:00 p.m.

436
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,960
If just one person...

437
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,630
If just one person had asked my sister

438
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,715
if she was okay...

439
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,801
If someone asked if she was sick,

440
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,639
Su-in would not have died.

441
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,063
But rather than being sad
and feeling guilty,

442
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,274
all of you

443
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,862
decided to keep your mouth shut.

444
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,451
I will never forgive you.

445
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,931
JEONG SU-IN DIED
BECAUSE OF EVERYONE'S APATHY

446
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,606
THE CLASSROOM WAS
A SUFFOCATING PRISON CELL FOR HER

447
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,907
Whatever it takes, find who did this.

448
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,202
Yes, sir. We will.

449
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,253
Like I said during the teachers' meeting,

450
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,132
make sure the kids
aren't disturbed by that post.

451
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,052
Please start looking for the person
who posted it.

452
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,971
Yes, sir.

453
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,640
Sir.

454
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,268
We deleted the post,

455
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,646
but it already spread, is going viral,
and the media is getting involved.

456
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,149
What?

457
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,031
PROSECUTOR KANG IL-SAN

458
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,537
I made sure they don't reopen the case,

459
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,040
but I can't guarantee anything.

460
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,334
Prosecutor Kang,

461
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,503
as you know, I didn't do it for myself.

462
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,173
I did it for the foundation
and the school.

463
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,764
I heard my wife came to see you.

464
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,142
Yes, she did.

465
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,770
I'll rush what she and I discussed.

466
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,563
I know it's a silly request,

467
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,399
but please understand
since you are a father yourself.

468
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,445
My daughter is having a difficult time
because of that girl.

469
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,906
Yes, of course.

470
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,575
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

471
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,410
Okay.

472
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,295
He's coming out!

473
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,009
Is it true that you ordered
that Jeong Su-in's case be buried?

474
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,970
Was the time of death really faked?

475
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,305
Please say something!

476
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,432
-Is it true?
-Please look this way.

477
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,643
Is it true you buried the case?

478
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,144
What are you doing? Let's go.

479
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:01,690
-Director Kong! Tell us the truth.
-Answer our questions!

480
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,775
Tell us the truth!

481
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,318
Sir!

482
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:20,918
Mom.

483
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,586
What is it?

484
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,384
What do you mean?

485
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,720
I came to sleep with my daughter.

486
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,479
Did you finish what you needed to do
before your transfer?

487
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,190
Not yet.

488
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:50,406
Let me know if you finish
before the disciplinary hearing.

489
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,288
I want to have you transfer
as soon as possible.

490
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:04,628
I'll help you get a fresh start
at a new school

491
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,256
as Lee Eun-bi.

492
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,472
Mom.

493
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,187
I've been selfish.

494
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,608
It must have been so hard for you.

495
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,611
I'm so sorry.

496
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,494
To be honest,

497
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,665
I was worried about
what you would think of me

498
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,170
if I said

499
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,964
I wanted to live as Lee Eun-bi.

500
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,350
How could you think that?

501
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,102
Mom.

502
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,314
Thank you.

503
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,548
I-an.

504
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,260
I have a favor to ask.

505
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,765
How do you feel?

506
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,101
Hui-yeong. A word, please.

507
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,020
Please look over here.

508
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,439
-Please smile.
-Look here.

509
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,733
Look at the camera.

510
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,569
Please look over here.

511
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,578
BRIDE, SONG HUI-YEONG

512
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,584
The bride is over here.

513
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,793
Hello.

514
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,629
Thank you.

515
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,344
You can wait over here.

516
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,928
You look beautiful.

517
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,327
There we go.

518
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,205
Tae-gwang, it's time to go to sleep.

519
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,706
Let's go to sleep.

520
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,583
-Mommy.
-Yes?

521
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,169
Do people die when they turn 100?

522
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:33,712
What?

523
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,216
Will you and Daddy die when you turn 100?

524
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:45,516
Everyone grows old and dies eventually.

525
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,313
No. I don't want you and daddy to die.

526
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,524
Don't worry.

527
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:59,738
Mommy and Daddy will be right next to you

528
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,907
until you turn 100 or 200.

529
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,120
-Really?
-Of course.

530
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,997
We'll stick right by you.

531
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,932
What is it?

532
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,101
What's the favor?

533
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,854
Just for today,

534
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,858
can you treat me like you used to?

535
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,321
Just for today,

536
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,948
do whatever I want

537
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,868
even if you don't like it.

538
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,209
What?

539
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,086
Hey, let's eat this.

540
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,463
Are you a kid?

541
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:40,964
We'll take one, please.

542
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,926
Thank you.

543
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,124
Hurry up.

544
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,264
I...

545
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,350
always wanted to come here.

546
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,022
I-an.

547
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,108
Give me your hand.

548
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:48,740
Do you like it?

549
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,786
What is it?

550
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,164
There was a time

551
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,168
when I wanted to leave everything too.

552
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,505
But back then,

553
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,591
I had nobody by my side.

554
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,557
If I had a friend like you back then,

555
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,185
I wonder what he would have said.

556
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,525
I can't even imagine

557
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,819
how important swimming is to you.

558
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,198
I bet the only person who knows that...

559
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,035
is you.

560
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,497
What I want...

561
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,253
is for you to realize how you truly feel.

562
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:46,840
That's all.

563
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,304
I know

564
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,558
it's painful for you
every time you see my face.

565
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,690
Still, I wish you will recover quickly

566
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,820
and go back to how you used to be.

567
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,866
I will help you

568
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,535
in any way I can.

569
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,914
Even if that means...

570
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,086
I need to disappear.

571
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,029
I-an.

572
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,408
Bye.

573
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:56,868
Okay.

574
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,246
Bye.

575
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,709
I had been struggling

576
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,796
because I didn't know what to call you.

577
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,009
Get home safely, Eun-bi.

578
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,254
I thought you would feel guilty,

579
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,465
so I went and gave a gift myself.

580
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,808
What is all this?

581
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,771
With both the school and mom...

582
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,649
Are you okay?

583
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,400
Foolish boy.

584
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,696
-What do you mean?
-So this is what you wanted?

585
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,826
Don't tell me

586
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,995
you think this is all because of me?

587
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,121
Why?

588
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,958
-I wouldn't put it past you.
-Dad!

589
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,627
What? Now you're worried about me?

590
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,139
Why would I worry?

591
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,433
You're reaping what you sowed.

592
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,144
It's blowing up because it's time.

593
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,484
The student that you mentioned?

594
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,113
I'm requesting that she be forced
to transfer tomorrow.

595
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,866
I don't want to see you,
so get out of my house.

596
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,285
You're right.

597
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,913
It's my fault that your life
is twisted and ruined.

598
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,291
Think what you want, I'll play along.

599
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,333
But...

600
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,672
just because you can't stand me,

601
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,383
don't hurt those around me.

602
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,384
That's cheating.

603
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,313
You know what happens

604
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,940
when I can't restrain myself, don't you?

605
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,051
Tae-gwang.

606
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,018
Why are you just leaving
after coming all the way here?

607
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,355
What?

608
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,524
I was just passing by.

609
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,165
Hey.

610
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,292
What are you thinking about?

611
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,586
I'm not thinking about anything.

612
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,634
I'm looking at you.
Why would I need to think?

613
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,261
I think when I don't see you.

614
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,139
Tae-gwang.

615
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,893
-You know...
-I know.

616
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,313
I know what you're about to say.

617
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,777
That's why I know
what I need to say is useless.

618
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,446
But...

619
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:45,949
still...

620
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,911
I like you.

621
00:54:58,753 --> 00:54:59,713
I'm sorry,

622
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,173
Tae-gwang.

623
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,651
I know.

624
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,366
I do, so...

625
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,792
It's just for a minute.

626
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,292
Ko Eun-byeol left the school trip
without permission,

627
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,462
stole, and threatened
a karaoke place owner.

628
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:08,591
That is why the disciplinary hearing
was called.

629
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,177
Do you acknowledge the violations?

630
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,428
I...

631
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:17,225
Eun-byeol had an unfortunate accident
during the trip.

632
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,432
Okay then.

633
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,020
We will vote by a raise of hands

634
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,147
on Ko Eun-byeol's disciplinary action.

635
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,860
You know her class teacher
can't vote, right?

636
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,698
Let's take a vote...

637
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,077
I came just in case,

638
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,247
but I am utterly flabbergasted.

639
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,835
I will voluntarily transfer my daughter.

640
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,464
She always had top grades

641
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,300
and was a model student.

642
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:36,429
I don't know
why you're trying to force her out,

643
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:43,019
but I do not have any desire
to send my kid to Sekang High.

644
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,198
Mom.
