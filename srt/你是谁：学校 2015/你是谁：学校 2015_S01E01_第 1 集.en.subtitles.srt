1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,557
Oh, school?

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,684
Well...

3
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,021
I don't want to go,
but I get anxious if I don't go.

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,316
If I'm to never go to school again,

5
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,319
I'll probably really want to go.

6
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,989
Strange, isn't it?

7
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,619
My least favorite time in school?

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,371
LEE EUN-BI
NOORI GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL, SECOND YEAR

9
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,622
That would be break time.

10
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,389
I have three part-time jobs.

11
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,643
When I graduate, I need to leave

12
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,313
House of Love and live independently.

13
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,815
My dream is to become a teacher.

14
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,863
A teacher who understands
what kids are saying,

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,408
discerns hidden meanings,
and is able to tell if they're lying.

16
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,708
GYEONGSANGNAM-DO, TONGYEONG

17
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,924
NOORI HIGH SCHOOL

18
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,606
Happy birthday to you

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,399
Ta-da!

20
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,613
-What are you doing?
-This isn't all.

21
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,991
Let go.

22
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,743
Let go.

23
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,541
Crack open the eggs.

24
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,668
First, crack open the eggs.

25
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,092
Then,

26
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,762
pour some flour on top.

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,476
Add plenty of

28
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,104
the special sauce

29
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,818
-and the special cake is complete!
-Complete!

30
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,861
So-yeong.

31
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,529
Happy birthday!

32
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,457
It's a shame we have no candles.

33
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,460
But, thanks.

34
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,379
I'm so moved.

35
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,172
I love you.

36
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,843
-I love you.
-Me too.

37
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,431
LEE EUN-BI

38
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,857
The "Gyeongbu Line Song" was written by

39
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,359
Choe Nam-seon, who returned
to Korea in 1908

40
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,361
after his studies from Japan...

41
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,696
Hey,

42
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,073
what was that special sauce earlier?

43
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,366
The anthem was written...

44
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,576
That?

45
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,037
...the song praises the Gyeongbu Line
that began operations in 1905.

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,920
The admiration and positive views on
the growth of civilization is expressed.

47
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,215
Along with the lyrics is a music sheet,
which was sometimes sung

48
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,591
in the Scottish folk song's tune...

49
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,634
What is that?

50
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,011
..."Coming through the rye."

51
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,721
Fish sauce?

52
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,474
The novel Tears of Blood
that was published in 1906

53
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,602
portrayed the ordeals
that Ok-ryeon and her family

54
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:52,649
had to endure for a decade
during the Sino-Japanese War.

55
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,733
It stinks, right?

56
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,944
The transition from classic
to modern literature...

57
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,738
I washed it with soap several times,
but the smell--

58
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,114
Will you move away?

59
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,158
"The whistle of the train is sonorous..."

60
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,035
Sure.

61
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,620
"...I leave the station from Namdaemun.

62
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:10,250
The train moves in such lightning speed
that even a bird..."

63
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,626
Excuse me.

64
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,796
I think someone farted. It smells funny.

65
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,675
Quiet!

66
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,553
We'll end here.

67
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,975
Lee Eun-bi, come to the office.

68
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,770
How many times is this?

69
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,398
Why are you always in your gym uniform?

70
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,859
I gave you a warning last time.

71
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,490
Is someone picking on you?

72
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,912
You need to tell me, so I can help you.

73
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,878
No, it's nothing like that.

74
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,090
Yeong-ho and Seung-min.

75
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,550
What are you doing?

76
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,594
-This is mine!
-It's mine!

77
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,345
It's mine!

78
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,145
There's plenty of soup.
Why are you fighting?

79
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,440
This one doesn't have
much scallions and radish.

80
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,110
If you don't finish your vegetables...

81
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,570
This is all so--

82
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,157
-"You can grow to be strong!"
-"You can grow to be strong!"

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,533
Still.

84
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,245
Just once,
can't you leave out the scallions? Please?

85
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,332
You cute little things.

86
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,751
Then I'll give in...

87
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,130
or so you thought

88
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,673
but not a chance!

89
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,594
Finish every last piece
of your vegetables.

90
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,556
Got it, everyone?

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,641
Got it!

92
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,061
Put the dishes in the sink
and brush your teeth well.

93
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,395
Can you do that?

94
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,356
-Yes!
-Yes!

95
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,275
Challenge

96
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,361
accepted.

97
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,696
Challenge accepted.

98
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,389
Ra-jin.

99
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,599
How did you get this bruise?

100
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,227
I fell.

101
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,937
How?

102
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,898
How did you fall?

103
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,361
Just, while playing with some kids.

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,285
Look me in the eye.

105
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,870
It's okay, you can tell me.

106
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,841
The kids were just playing.

107
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,759
What's the big deal?

108
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,554
Ma'am, when you play,

109
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,015
both sides are supposed to have fun.

110
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,060
But our Ra-jin didn't have any fun

111
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,562
and got hurt!

112
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,897
So what?

113
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,737
Dong-u, apologize to Ra-jin.

114
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,781
Promise not to bother her anymore, too.

115
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,869
I'm not moving an inch until you do.

116
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,874
Eun-bi.

117
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,760
Why are you hiding?

118
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,470
Just apologize, then!

119
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,554
Do it!

120
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,770
Sorry. I won't do it again.

121
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,817
Promise.

122
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,577
Are you happy now?

123
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,960
Let's go.

124
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,756
That stubborn mule.

125
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,591
Maybe it's because she has no parents.

126
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,510
Why would you play with that orphan?

127
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,554
Mommy, that hurts!

128
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,936
Want a piggy-back ride?

129
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,690
Ra-jin.

130
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,026
Even if it's a really close friend,

131
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,904
you should say if it hurts

132
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,615
or that you don't like it

133
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,451
or that it's wrong.

134
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,789
That way,
they won't treat you badly again.

135
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,749
Okay?

136
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,168
Like you just did?

137
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,797
Yes.

138
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,925
Thanks, Eun-bi.

139
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,553
You are

140
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,763
a gift from heaven

141
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,933
in place of a mommy.

142
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,733
"Magical things happened
to Sara every day.

143
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,528
Every time she opened her closet,

144
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,739
there was a new thing

145
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,742
and her shabby attic room was transformed

146
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,328
into a beautiful princess' room."

147
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,747
A LITTLE PRINCESS

148
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,874
"No matter what happens

149
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,209
I know for sure that

150
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,129
there is someone who cares about me.

151
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,091
I am not a bit sad

152
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,969
or lonely anymore."

153
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,276
Eun-bi. Can you come out for a minute?

154
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,367
This came for you this afternoon,
but I forgot.

155
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,412
It's from Gangnam,
so it must be that person

156
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,622
who sent you sneakers before.

157
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,540
Yes, I think so.

158
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:11,003
Whoever it is,
she must have really liked you.

159
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,215
She always sends you gifts.

160
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,022
"I was at the department store
shopping for my daughter

161
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,525
and thought of you,
and bought one for you, too.

162
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,027
Song Mi-gyeong."

163
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,114
Try it.

164
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,829
What do you think?

165
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,165
It's pretty.

166
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,876
It's incredible.

167
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,088
She got my shoe size perfectly
last time, too.

168
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,257
And this is totally my style.

169
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,846
SEOUL

170
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,723
Eun-byeol. Ko Eun-byeol!

171
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,694
Mom.

172
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,696
It's not a trip around the world.

173
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,948
It's three nights
in Tongyeong in Gyeongsangnam-do.

174
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,284
We'll take a bus, take some pictures,
and come back.

175
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,743
Did I say anything?

176
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,037
Why do I need all this stuff?

177
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,291
I took everything out
in case you forgot something.

178
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,919
Pick just what you want to take.

179
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,130
Keep your word.

180
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,215
You don't trust your own mom?

181
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,390
What, that's it?

182
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,516
That's it.

183
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,604
Hey. Still...

184
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,355
-Mom.
-Hold on.

185
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,024
Hold on.

186
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,819
This.

187
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,155
Just take one more then.

188
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,617
You'll get bored of playing after a while

189
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,286
so read it when you get bored.

190
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,872
You are impossible.

191
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,249
Here.

192
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,757
I haven't seen this before.

193
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,010
I got it with a friend.

194
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,929
What is with that cold attitude?

195
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,889
Will I get it dirty if I touch it?

196
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,071
Here.

197
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,866
-Bye.
-Oh, Eun-byeol.

198
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,284
Hold on.

199
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,997
Wear this at night when it gets cold.

200
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,167
You catch a cold easily
since your respiratory system is weak.

201
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,127
Okay, I will.

202
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,383
Mom, you know...

203
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,013
Never mind.

204
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,767
Get lots of rest while I'm away.

205
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,227
I will.

206
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,647
Have a safe trip, my precious daughter.

207
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,358
Bye, Mom. I'll be back soon.

208
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,201
SEKANG HIGH SCHOOL

209
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,039
Song-ju isn't here yet?

210
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,292
She's probably late
putting her make-up on.

211
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,378
Here she comes.

212
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,216
Here.

213
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,094
I'm so annoyed.

214
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,680
This stupid uniform
hides my body too much.

215
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,639
It's okay.

216
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,350
Your body itself is amazing.

217
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,186
Great observation, Eun-byeol.

218
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,773
I like your sneakers.

219
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,653
-Ta-da.
-Ta-da.

220
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,281
What? Oh my gosh, how embarrassing.

221
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,782
Are you two dating?

222
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,576
You think it ends there?

223
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,744
We are wearing

224
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,204
matching underwear, too.

225
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,374
-Right.
-Hot pink.

226
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,585
-You forgot?
-I wore it.

227
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,544
Liar.

228
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,713
You put on that face when you feel guilty.

229
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,340
-Let me see.
-What?

230
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,175
-Let me see what color you're wearing.
-Stop that.

231
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,927
-Get over here!
-Stop!

232
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,345
Hold on.

233
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,388
What is it? What color is it?

234
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,640
Show me, too.

235
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,224
Show you what?

236
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,726
Get lost.

237
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,186
Are you insane?

238
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,397
Show us!

239
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,983
-Attention!
-Show us!

240
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,526
-Show us!
-Attention!

241
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,738
I'm warning you again.

242
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,116
The most important thing
for a fun school trip is...

243
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,035
First, safety.

244
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,995
Second, safety.

245
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,122
Third, safety.

246
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,125
If you feel sick
or there's anything wrong,

247
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,045
let the teachers know,
so we can take you to the hospital.

248
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,006
Don't just take off without telling us,

249
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,386
-and beware of food poisoning.
-There goes Mr. Safety again.

250
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,887
Class President, is anyone missing?

251
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,389
Kong Tae-gwang had a personal matter.

252
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,391
Han I-an has a competition.

253
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,976
Other than them, everyone else is here.

254
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,189
It's the high school male 400m freestyle.

255
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,317
The swimmers are warming up.

256
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,153
This 400m freestyle is unusual

257
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,990
because a lot of the swimmers
that made it to the finals are rookies.

258
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,368
That's right. At lane three,
we have Sekang High's Han I-an.

259
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,912
-Yes!
-Lane four. Uhyeon High's Kim U-jin.

260
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,372
They are the strong favorites.

261
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,041
-That's right.
-I can't wait to see them swim.

262
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,919
The race is about to begin.

263
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,140
And they're off!

264
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,569
They are swimming with so much power.

265
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,156
You can see U-jin and I-an.

266
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,576
As expected,
the two of them are neck and neck.

267
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,299
It's close. Han I-an in lane three.

268
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:34,011
Kim U-jin in lane four.
They are fighting for first place.

269
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,473
His lap time is very good.
At this pace, he may have a good chance.

270
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,939
It's 28.14 seconds.

271
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,035
Five more meters to go. Will it be
Han I-an or Kim U-jin to finish first?

272
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,249
-Han I-an came in first!
-That's an incredible record!

273
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,837
Han I-an set a new record
and won the gold.

274
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,382
Han I-an has made history
in high school freestyle competition.

275
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,304
-Gold medal!
-Gold medal, Han I-an.

276
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,223
Han I-an in lane three won the gold.

277
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,474
Four minutes three seconds...

278
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,850
What are you listening to?

279
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,602
Nothing.

280
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,355
-Let me listen.
-Your make-up got smeared.

281
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,856
What? Where?

282
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,698
Smile!

283
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,284
Thank you.

284
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,121
-Let's go.
-May I touch your gold medal?

285
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,205
This?

286
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,209
Wow.

287
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,379
Congratulations, I-an.

288
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,465
You're lucky.
You're always winning medals.

289
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,259
Is that really gold?

290
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,593
Can I have one?

291
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,886
No.

292
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,516
You should win your own gold medal
if you want it that badly.

293
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,435
I can't swim as fast as you.

294
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,980
Cheapskate. I don't want it.

295
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,067
I don't want to give you this one.

296
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:16,572
When I win my first medal
in a national competition,

297
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,907
I'll give that to you. Okay?

298
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,576
Whatever. I don't believe you.

299
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,287
Why would you give me the medal
you win from a big competition,

300
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,956
when you won't even give me
this small medal?

301
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,459
Silly. It's because this medal is petty.

302
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,963
Whatever. Forget it.

303
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,008
I don't know how you do so well in school

304
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,384
with that brain of yours.

305
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,344
What did you say?

306
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,602
Got the gold medal.

307
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,979
So what?

308
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,148
Just saying.

309
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,400
Yes! We just arrived at the rest area.

310
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,195
Tongyeong is close from here, by the way.

311
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,571
So what?

312
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,240
Just saying.

313
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,785
How do you feel?

314
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,290
You're lost for words, right?

315
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,876
Do well on the 100m tomorrow, too.

316
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,085
Yes, Sir.

317
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,297
Excuse me, Coach?

318
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,342
What is it?

319
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,635
Go ahead.

320
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,721
It's nothing.

321
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,734
-Because the class is so small.
-How many...

322
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,529
There.

323
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,658
The one in the beige trench coat
is Piggy Mom.

324
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,703
Why is it so hard
to meet my kid's classmate's mom?

325
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,207
She's harder to meet
than the hottest celebrities.

326
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,750
-Right?
-I know.

327
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,962
Thanks, honey.

328
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,589
Then treat me to an expensive dinner.

329
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,174
Let's go in.

330
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,553
Hi.

331
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,180
Come in.

332
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,016
Did you wait long?

333
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,275
She's Eun-byeol's friend's mom.

334
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,819
Her husband runs
Gukje Plastic Surgery Hospital.

335
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,823
Wow. I'd believe it
if you said she were a model.

336
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,201
It's surprising that a mom has the time
to doll herself up.

337
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,370
I'm jealous. What's your secret?

338
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,582
I don't know. Perhaps...

339
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,210
It's being born with a great body,
I suppose.

340
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,380
Just kidding.

341
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,008
Stop joking around. Now take a seat.

342
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,808
I need to go.
I have a lecture out of town.

343
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,518
-Shall we go?
-Sure.

344
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,397
We just got here. Stay ten more minutes.

345
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,691
I need to get to the shop,
so I can't stay.

346
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,902
Yes, we just got here.

347
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,739
Then just ten minutes.

348
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,615
-Fine, ten minutes.
-Sure.

349
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,537
Well...

350
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,374
I've really wanted to meet you.

351
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,751
I see.

352
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,838
It's a shame
we can't even eat dinner together.

353
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,180
Give me a call sometime.

354
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,516
SHIN JEONG-MIN

355
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,478
Oh my. Thank you.

356
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,063
Thank you.

357
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,815
Oh my gosh!

358
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,776
Hey! Eun-byeol!

359
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,154
Hey, I-an

360
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,739
won the gold medal!

361
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,407
Isn't he super cool?

362
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,451
Is that right?

363
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,161
Good for him.

364
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,872
-What? That's it?
-What else?

365
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,874
-It's not like I won it.
-Brat.

366
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,292
You guys fought again?

367
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,212
Why are you guys always fighting?

368
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,924
It's because we've seen
too much of each other since childhood.

369
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,676
Must I do a celebratory dance?

370
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,136
Like this?

371
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,930
You're impossible.

372
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,656
JUST BECAUSE IT'S IN THE PAST,
DOESN'T MEAN IT NEVER HAPPENED

373
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,743
"Jeong Su-in"?

374
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,715
Do it again.

375
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,011
You're so clumsy.

376
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,764
Hey.

377
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,475
Hey, Eun-byeol.

378
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,399
Oh, right!

379
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,860
I saw Su-in's mom yesterday.

380
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,613
-Su-in?
-The incident at the school a year ago...

381
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,282
Oh, her?

382
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,826
She moved back to Carriage Tower.

383
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,829
I live there too.

384
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:21,710
But what happened
at the school a year ago?

385
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,462
Ask Eun-byeol's mom.

386
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,048
Didn't you say
Eun-byeol and Su-in were close?

387
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,429
No. They were just
in the same class before.

388
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,773
Did something happen?

389
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,319
There was no time for anything to happen.

390
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,989
Eun-byeol.

391
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,908
What's gotten into you?

392
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,701
It's nothing.

393
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,537
Give me that.

394
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,166
Did something bad happen?

395
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,294
You're killing me. Eat this and talk.

396
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,879
I'm not hungry.

397
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,760
Doesn't the smell make you hungry?

398
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,637
Open your mouth.

399
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,764
I said I don't feel like it.

400
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,600
Are you okay?

401
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,394
Eun-byeol.

402
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,146
This is out of line.

403
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,275
Guys.

404
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,527
It's Tongyeong!

405
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,490
-We're here!
-It's Tongyeong!

406
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,634
Ra-jin, that's enough.

407
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,969
I'm fine.

408
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,725
You're still hot.

409
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,604
I mean it. I'm all better, thanks to you.

410
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,483
Were you worried?

411
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,781
You have lots of friends at school

412
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,159
and are popular here in the House of Love.

413
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,829
But if you get sick,

414
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,541
I'll have nobody.

415
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,252
Okay.

416
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,713
I promise not to get sick.

417
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,884
Want me to make
your favorite spicy rice cakes?

418
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,762
Yes, extra spicy, please.

419
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,680
Okay.

420
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,933
Who is that?

421
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,149
Eun-bi! Come quick!

422
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,777
Please, have some.

423
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,406
Hi, Eun-bi.

424
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,244
Eun-bi, are you feeling okay?

425
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,413
We were so worried.

426
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,623
How did you...

427
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,585
We were supposed to volunteer

428
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:12,130
at a senior center today, but we heard

429
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,301
Eun-bi was sick, so we thought we'd visit.

430
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,386
That's why we changed volunteer locations.

431
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,929
Is that all right?

432
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,806
We'd be grateful.

433
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,643
Since you're Eun-bi's friends,
you're always welcome.

434
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,937
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

435
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,189
Please, eat.

436
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,126
Hey, Outcast.

437
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,213
You do this.
You're the one who will eat this.

438
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:58,134
Isn't this place
run by the tax that our parents pay?

439
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:03,306
So, if you have any consciousness,
you should serve us.

440
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,225
Right.

441
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,269
Stop trying to receive all the time.

442
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,438
Got it?

443
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,360
Eun-bi!

444
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,450
Oh my.

445
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,952
It's you.

446
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,705
Eun-bi has told me a lot about you.

447
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,666
Your name was...

448
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,502
What was it again?

449
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,756
-Ra-jin.
-That's it. Ra-jin.

450
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,551
But

451
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,137
why were you doing that to her?

452
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,472
Ra-jin, it's...

453
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,765
Can't you tell?

454
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,686
We were playing.

455
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,981
Playing.

456
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,026
When you're playing with a friend,

457
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,071
the other person
is supposed to have fun too.

458
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,949
Eun-bi, are you having fun?

459
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,701
Or does it hurt?

460
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,001
We really were playing.

461
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,253
I'm having fun too.

462
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,594
Oh, I see.

463
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,722
Of course, since you are so popular.

464
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,148
Is this how you spend your time?

465
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,234
Playing with innocent kids?

466
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,070
There is nothing Eun-bi can't do.

467
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,073
She makes
spicy rice cakes really well, too.

468
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,950
Right?

469
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,328
Right.

470
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,954
Really?

471
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,334
What do you put in it
that makes it so good?

472
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,586
Is it...

473
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,380
fish sauce?

474
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,100
VOLUNTEER CONFIRMATION DOCUMENT
LOCATION: HOUSE OF LOVE

475
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,020
SIGNED BY PARK MIN-GYEONG
DIRECTOR OF HOUSE OF LOVE

476
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,859
Thank you for today.

477
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,362
Not at all.

478
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,323
Anyway,

479
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,785
I'm worried
because Eun-bi still looks very ill.

480
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,621
Smile a little.

481
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,832
Look at her sweating.

482
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,625
Are you okay?

483
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,795
-Director.
-Yes?

484
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,380
Oh right.

485
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,676
My father's scholarship foundation

486
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,262
is looking for a new organization
to sponsor.

487
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,763
So...

488
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,600
I was thinking of
suggesting House of Love.

489
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,353
I would be so grateful.

490
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,147
Her father is Prosecutor Kang Il-san.

491
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,358
-You know of him, right?
-Of course.

492
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,778
Everyone in Tongyeong knows of him.

493
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,741
I didn't know
you were our benefactor's daughter.

494
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:14,289
You must get your caring heart
from your father.

495
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,207
Not at all.

496
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,836
I owe Eun-bi a lot.

497
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,923
She helped me a lot from the day

498
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,385
I transferred here from Seoul.

499
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,429
Is that right?

500
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,391
You must be tired. Please, eat.

501
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,440
I won.

502
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,152
-Man...
-Punishment time!

503
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,323
-No way.
-It's pretty sexy, right?

504
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,658
-What about this?
-It's this one.

505
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,702
-Hey.
-Okay, fine.

506
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,580
-See?
-One, two.

507
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,497
It's this.

508
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,124
TONGYEONG OFFICIALS
SPONSORING HOUSE OF LOVE

509
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,001
-I'll move this.
-Keep it for now.

510
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,669
-I should hold on to it?
-Yes, keep it.

511
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,921
You're doing well.

512
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,547
Look at me.

513
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,800
-So pretty.
-I know, right?

514
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,472
How can you use
the exact same tricks I used

515
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,849
when I went on school trips?

516
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,476
I'm disappointed.

517
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,852
I'm taking all these.

518
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,355
I thought you'd let a couple of them slide

519
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,273
and pretend not to see them.

520
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,900
We're disappointed too.

521
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,111
You poor things.

522
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,446
You're stuck with a clueless teacher.

523
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,323
Good night.

524
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,089
Put them in.

525
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,884
So-yeong.

526
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,804
Can we talk?

527
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,539
You've got some nerve.

528
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,000
What are you to be asking for me
at this hour?

529
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,295
What is it?

530
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,172
Earlier

531
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,924
you said
your father's scholarship foundation

532
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,551
is looking to sponsor someone new.

533
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,304
Is that true?

534
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,681
Why? Are you interested?

535
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,184
I thought

536
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,353
you'd say no because of me.

537
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,064
The director is having

538
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,858
a tough time with finances right now.

539
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,861
It's not for me to say yes or no.

540
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,154
What are you babbling about?

541
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:37,158
If you're going to ask for a favor,
do it right.

542
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,702
So what?

543
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,955
You want me to help or what?

544
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,919
Help us, please.

545
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,256
I wonder if my dad is home.

546
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,383
Let me call him.

547
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,389
Oh, I forgot my phone.

548
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:05,394
Lend me yours. You seem anxious.

549
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,523
Where did she go?

550
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,954
Who is that?

551
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,086
A guy...

552
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,173
IF YOU MESS AROUND WITH ME AGAIN, I'LL...

553
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,561
-What did he say?
-What?

554
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,481
There will be good news soon. Just wait.

555
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,319
You have a call.

556
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,737
Answer it.

557
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,160
-Hello?
-Eun-bi! You little witch!

558
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,536
You want your ass kicked, don't you?

559
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,955
You disgusting, good for nothing...

560
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,627
IF YOU MESS AROUND WITH ME AGAIN,
I'LL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN

561
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,297
You asked for a scholarship foundation?

562
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,718
You're so funny.

563
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,471
That kid Ra-jin said

564
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,643
she wants to be a cool girl like you
when she grows up.

565
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,854
She has no idea you're like this.

566
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,689
I'll pray for Ra-jin

567
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,026
that she ends up just like you.

568
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,028
Later.

569
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,327
Kang So-yeong.

570
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,962
You are incorrigible.

571
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,006
-What?
-You think

572
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,467
you have everything you want, don't you?

573
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,553
But do you know something?

574
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,306
In my eyes,

575
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,559
from the very day you transferred here
in grade school,

576
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,270
you've looked pitiful.

577
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,859
Is that right?

578
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,115
And you've been keeping it in
this entire time?

579
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,994
Keep going.

580
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,288
I said keep going!

581
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,630
Get away from me. Get away!

582
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,225
Hit me, if you can.

583
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,856
You can't even look me in the eye.

584
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,985
What? "Pitiful"?

585
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,583
So-yeong!

586
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,875
Hey,

587
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,419
Eun-byeol.

588
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,227
Here!

589
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,063
Thank you.

590
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,358
Where's Eun-byeol?

591
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,109
How would I know?

592
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,112
Just leave her. She's so annoying.

593
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,865
Hasn't Eun-byeol been acting weird?

594
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,118
Actually, last night...

595
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,496
I know, she was in the corner of the room

596
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,247
studying by herself, right?

597
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,460
She's my friend,
but I can't stand her at times.

598
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:43,130
She gets all angry and ruins our mood.

599
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,216
How could she study after doing that?

600
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,384
Well...

601
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,719
That's true.

602
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,140
Don't worry about Eun-byeol.

603
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,017
The two of us can have fun!

604
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,144
What shall we do?

605
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,028
HOUSE OF LOVE

606
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,244
Hello?

607
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,287
Is this House of Love?

608
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,834
Hello, I'm Eun-bi's friend

609
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,585
Gyeong-a.

610
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,922
A friend from middle school.

611
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:30,845
Can you give me her cell phone number?

612
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,433
-What would you like?
-Two Americanos, please.

613
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,350
Sure.

614
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,773
Here's your receipt. Thank you.

615
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,572
How could you do something so frightening?

616
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,825
Go see So-yeong in the hospital
and apologize

617
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,493
before she presses charges for assault.

618
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,373
Isn't that your phone?

619
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,625
It keeps ringing.

620
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,557
Number 27.

621
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,309
Your coffee is ready.

622
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,534
Thank you.

623
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,916
Excuse me.

624
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,295
May I leave early?
I have something urgent.

625
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,006
-Sure.
-Thank you.

626
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,676
Close your eyes. Are they closed?

627
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,470
-Yes.
-Okay, I'm putting it on.

628
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,349
All done.

629
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:02,019
You won't be disappointed.
One, two, three. Ta-da!

630
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,271
What?

631
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,940
Don't touch it. You look totally sexy.

632
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,400
You said you'd make it like yours.

633
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,784
Let's go.

634
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,911
Oh, okay.

635
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,081
Let's go.

636
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,787
Is someone there?

637
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,546
Is it you again?

638
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,550
How long will you keep this up?

639
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,910
Hey, Lee Si-jin!

640
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,955
-Cha Song-ju.
-What?

641
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,790
We're taking a group picture.
So, hurry up.

642
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,125
Okay.

643
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,461
-Let's go.
-Okay.

644
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,382
Let's take a picture! Get in!

645
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,135
-Everyone, gather!
-Come on.

646
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,095
-Quickly.
-Gather around.

647
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,849
Stand close to each other.
Watch the camera.

648
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,893
All together!

649
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,737
What is that?

650
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,572
Look at him.

651
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,157
Is everyone here?

652
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,660
Who's missing? Raise your hand.

653
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,786
-Here!
-Here!

654
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,289
Three people are missing.

655
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,584
Okay, just one person now.

656
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,877
Who is that?

657
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,420
That would be me.

658
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,216
Stop joking. Who is it?

659
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,926
Who's missing?

660
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,552
-Who is it?
-Wait.

661
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,388
What is that?

662
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,890
Who is missing?

663
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,520
Mr. Kim, Eun-byeol is...

664
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,355
Eun-byeol isn't here.

665
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,357
-Call her.
-Okay.

666
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,778
The person you have dialed...

667
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,864
It's off.

668
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,493
Where did you see Eun-byeol last?

669
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,620
I saw her.

670
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,872
I think she was pooping in the bathroom.

671
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,047
The person you have dialed...

672
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,508
Ko Eun-byeol!

673
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,260
Eun-byeol!

674
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,678
-Eun-byeol!
-Eun-byeol!

675
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,346
Eun-byeol.

676
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,557
Eun-byeol, I know you're in there.

677
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,808
Come out.

678
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,643
Eun-byeol, let's talk...

679
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,271
Sorry, ma'am.

680
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,908
Where the heck is she?

681
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:47,911
Eun-byeol.

682
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,788
Ko Eun-byeol!

683
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,540
-Ko Eun-byeol!
-Eun-byeol!

684
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,500
-Ko Eun-byeol!
-Eun-byeol!

685
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,335
-Eun-byeol!
-Eun-byeol!

686
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,464
-Ko Eun-byeol!
-Please be advised that

687
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,177
the cable car will stop running
for the day.

688
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,803
-You haven't found her?
-No.

689
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,139
-Over there.
-If you're taking the cable car down,

690
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,017
-please head over now.
-Ko Eun-byeol!

691
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,018
STROLL PATH CCTV

692
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,982
Stop.

693
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,650
Pause here.

694
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,991
You'll never find a person like this.

695
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,619
There are dozens of cameras
and thousands of people.

696
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:31,955
Did Eun-byeol

697
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,708
say anything unusual

698
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,960
or act differently than usual?

699
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,547
She seemed to be in a bad mood,
but you know

700
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,341
how she gets sensitive at times.

701
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,301
And you, Si-jin?

702
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,303
Did you notice anything unusual?

703
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,473
Well...

704
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,308
What is it? Tell me.

705
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,393
Last night

706
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,481
I saw her fighting with some guy.

707
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,649
What?

708
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,902
"Some guy"?

709
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,089
That brat. She doesn't even call.

710
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,310
Is she sleeping already?

711
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,316
No way. She's probably having fun.

712
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,282
Your call is being forwarded to voicemail.

713
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,792
Hello?

714
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,505
Ms. Song?

715
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,300
Eun-byeol is...

716
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:15,809
My keys.

717
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,719
Next up is the high school, male division.

718
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,930
The finals for the 100m freestyle
is coming up.

719
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:58,477
Competitors, please come to the pool.

720
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,605
CHA SONG-JU

721
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,123
Han I-an is making waves
all through the competition.

722
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,875
That's correct. Not many people

723
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,628
were interested in Han I-an
before this competition.

724
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,880
Yes. I have a feeling
Han I-an is going to become

725
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,883
a huge star after this competition.

726
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,481
The race has begun. But wait.

727
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,692
Han I-an hasn't jumped in.

728
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,362
Did he not jump in
or was it that he couldn't?

729
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,993
Eun-byeol, where are you?

730
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,002
-Ms. Song.
-Ma'am...

731
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,219
Bye, Mom. I'll be back soon.

732
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,025
Sir.

733
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,153
Where...

734
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,655
Where is my Eun-byeol?

735
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,617
We're still waiting to hear.

736
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,495
The other kids are all here.

737
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,081
Why is my Eun-byeol the only one missing?

738
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,794
You all left together.

739
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,381
Why didn't you bring my Eun-byeol back?

740
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,049
Why...

741
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,553
Why is my Eun-byeol
the only one who isn't home?

742
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,305
Why?

743
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,474
Please, you need to calm down.

744
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,727
No, let's go. Let's go.

745
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,437
Let's go, now.

746
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,064
Don't just stand there! Let's go!

747
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,901
The police are patrolling,
so if you'd wait--

748
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,028
What if something
happens to her overnight?

749
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,210
Eun-byeol...

750
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,670
Eun-byeol...

751
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,802
Eun-byeol...

752
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,601
Eun-byeol...

753
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:50,941
So-yeong

754
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,693
needs psychiatric therapy.

755
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,823
Imagine how frightening
and painful it is for her

756
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,450
to be in the same room with her attacker.

757
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,461
Lee Eun-bi.

758
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,546
CHAIRMAN

759
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,590
Apologize to Kang So-yeong.

760
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,145
I...

761
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,024
did nothing wrong.

762
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,111
She's unapologetic.

763
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,824
I thought about it, over and over

764
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,201
and over again.

765
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,163
I really didn't do

766
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,790
anything wrong.

767
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,127
Honey.

768
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,339
Calm down.

769
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,469
I request that you use your wise judgment

770
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:05,432
and punish her strictly.

771
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,143
Let's go.

772
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,614
-Prosecutor Kang!
-Prosecutor Kang!

773
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,833
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL FORM

774
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:35,253
SIGNED BY LEE EUN-BI
NOORI HIGH SCHOOL

775
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:43,720
This will be processed
after two weeks of consideration period.

776
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,306
You may go now.

777
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,558
Ma'am.

778
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,022
I'll attend all of today's classes.

779
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,193
It's my last day in school...

780
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,613
I don't want to feel like
I'm being kicked out.

781
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,207
GO TO HELL
YOU STINK

782
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,250
Eun-bi.

783
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,672
I heard you got expelled.

784
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,968
Considering the threatening texts
you sent us

785
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,053
and hospitalizing So-yeong,

786
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,347
they went too lightly on you.

787
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,183
Eun-bi.

788
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,895
Don't be too sad about
not seeing me anymore.

789
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:38,608
I'll go visit where you work
and play with you often.

790
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,152
What a friend.

791
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,239
There is something

792
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,701
I really want to ask you.

793
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,163
Why are you mean to me?

794
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,500
You want to know?

795
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,627
Then I'll have to tell you.

796
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,588
Well...

797
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:03,967
Just...

798
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,636
because.

799
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,931
I just hate you because you're Lee Eun-bi.

800
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,310
I smell Lee Eun-bi.

801
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,271
Isn't that the fish sauce smell?

802
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,565
-I made that.
-Impressive.

803
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,359
Kang So-yeong.

804
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,113
Just how low will you go?

805
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:29,325
-You've stooped low enough already.
-Why you...

806
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,001
Girls.

807
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,170
Close the curtain.

808
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,638
Stop it.

809
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,807
Stop it.

810
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,226
Stop it!

811
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,216
Smile, will you?

812
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,308
Act out again,

813
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,685
and I will

814
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,021
release this video.

815
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,483
LEE EUN-BI

816
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,944
...can be found here.

817
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,114
The phrase here is...

818
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:51,176
LEE EUN-BI

819
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,440
BYE

820
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,291
Bye, friends.

821
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,405
I have nothing to fear right now

822
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,908
other than the fact
that my daughter is not with me.

823
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,410
Nothing changes
just because Eun-byeol is missing.

824
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,829
Hi, Eun-byeol!
It's cool seeing you like this.

825
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,165
-It's Mom.
-Mom?

826
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,500
I'm her mom.

827
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,794
I guess I was a happy kid.

828
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,504
Do you really not remember

829
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,172
or are you pretending?

830
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,507
Hey, Eun-byeol!

831
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,841
Who are you?

832
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,302
It's okay, since you're back, Eun-byeol.
