TONGYEONG OFFICIALS
SPONSORING HOUSE OF LOVE

2
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,888
Do twins really have telepathy?

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,266
The more items we share,

4
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,852
the more frequently
I ask myself that in the mirror.

5
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,522
"Eun-bi, what are you wearing today?

6
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,483
What kind of music are you listening to?"

SONG MI-GYEONG
TO: EUN-BI

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,330
"I was at the department store
shopping for my daughter

9
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,083
and thought of you,
and bought one for you, too.

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,418
From Song Mi-gyeong."

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,801
-What do you think?
-It's pretty.

12
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,065
I had the same dream again...

13
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,529
about the day
I first met Mom when I was five.

14
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,489
12 YEARS AGO
SOMANG ORPHANAGE

15
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,200
It was the third day
after returning to the orphanage.

16
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,870
I was hurt from having
my adoption dissolved.

17
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,333
It was then that an angelic lady
came and spoke to me.

18
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,377
Hi.

19
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,340
Don't you remember me?

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,845
You were in House of Love in Tongyeong.

21
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,348
I saw you a few times there.

22
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,394
You have gotten prettier.

23
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,064
What?

24
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,691
Her adoption was dissolved?

25
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,568
Yes.

26
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,529
Eun-byeol came back three days ago,

27
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,157
and hasn't said a word since.

28
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,161
Poor thing.

29
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,038
Eun-byeol.

30
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,086
Do you want to go home with me?

31
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,978
Her embrace was so warm
that I couldn't tell her that

32
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,899
the child she met
at the House of Love in Tongyeong

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,984
wasn't me.

34
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,403
It was my twin sister, Eun-bi.

35
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,407
I couldn't tell her that I was never

36
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,576
at House of Love.

37
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,913
I didn't want to tell her.

38
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,791
If I had known then that
I had a twin sister

39
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,754
and that it was her that Mom had first met

40
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,755
Eun-byeol...

41
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,634
Would I have been able to be honest?

42
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,066
She forgot her phone again.

5 MISSED CALLS
CHA SONG-JU

44
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,704
FROM LEE EUN-BI

45
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:17,340
Please forgive me for leaving a letter
instead of telling you in person.

46
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,426
I am...

47
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:25,390
Lee Eun-bi, and I grew up
in House of Love in Tongyeong.

48
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,395
There must have been a mistake
when I was rescued

49
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,814
because we look alike.

50
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,112
Thank you for all
the warm memories, and...

51
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,614
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,061
HOSPITAL

53
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,689
I was admitted here about a month ago.

54
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:20,028
Can you check if someone else
came in on the same day?

55
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,446
What is the person's name?

56
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,156
Ko...

57
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,615
I mean, Lee Eun-bi.

58
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,617
LEE EUN-BI

59
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,495
There was no one by that name.

60
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:33,958
I see.

61
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,961
Yes, that's correct.

62
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,632
Was someone else rescued along with me?

63
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,676
No one was saved,

64
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,929
but a body was found
at the same place a few days ago.

65
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,807
A body?

66
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,228
THE LATE LEE EUN-BI

67
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,738
THE LATE LEE EUN-BI

68
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,953
THE LATE LEE EUN-BI

69
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,274
Hey!

70
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,401
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,500
Sir.

72
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,670
Do you know
that Tae-gwang's birthday is coming up?

73
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,714
What should we do?

74
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,633
Tell him to pick a gift he wants.

75
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,511
Should I prepare a birthday dinner?

76
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,140
I'll let you know
after I check my schedule.

77
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,748
Eun-byeol isn't here yet?

78
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
Did anyone hear from her?

79
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,337
I-an.

80
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,297
Did you not get a call from her?

81
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,798
No.

82
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,845
How far did we get last time?

83
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:41,103
HOUSE OF LOVE

84
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,570
Hello.

85
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,991
I'm Song Mi-gyeong from Seoul.

86
00:08:54,909 --> 00:09:00,039
I see, but what brings you
all the way from...

87
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,376
Song Mi-gyeong...

88
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,924
Oh, my.

89
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,511
You came to see Eun-bi, didn't you?

90
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,722
How did you know?

91
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:23,771
Eun-bi was so happy
every time you sent her a package.

92
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,441
How could I not know?

93
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,193
Packages?

94
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,993
This is all she left behind.

95
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,288
I kept telling myself
I need to get rid of them,

96
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,249
but I could never get myself to do it,

97
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,668
so I kept them.

98
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,214
Leave things behind?
What do you mean by that?

99
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,136
Oh, my.

100
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,935
Didn't you come
because you heard that Eun-bi died?

101
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,688
What?

102
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,527
That poor thing was bullied...

103
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,907
by the kids at school.

104
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,328
And then she was framed...

105
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,539
and was expelled.

106
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,542
It must have been too much to bear.

107
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,925
I'm to blame.

108
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,096
I'm supposed to be her substitute mom...

109
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:46,979
but I knew nothing until
after she decided to take her life.

110
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,903
May I look inside?

111
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,822
Yes, of course.

112
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,918
LEE EUN-BI

113
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,511
SONG MI-GYEONG
TO: EUN-BI

114
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,372
Where...

115
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,458
Where is she now?

116
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,652
THE LATE LEE EUN-BI

117
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,208
Eun-byeol.

118
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,210
Where were you?

119
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,921
I looked all over for you.

120
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,301
You are...

121
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,140
You are Eun-byeol, right?

122
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,072
This.

123
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,910
I tied this around your neck
when you left for the trip.

124
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,661
Try to remember.

125
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,665
You had it with you at the hospital.

126
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,709
Please.

127
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,255
Please try to remember.

128
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,760
I'm sorry.

129
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,847
I don't know what happened.

130
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,102
But I think my sister saved me, and...

131
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,483
I'm sorry.

132
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,365
Stop teasing your mom.

133
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,242
That's not true, Eun-byeol.

134
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,537
It's not true, right?

135
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,665
Eun-byeol.

136
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,833
It isn't true.

137
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,586
It isn't true.

138
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,505
I'm sorry.

139
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,927
You brat.

140
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,887
You brat.

141
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,640
Why are you upsetting me so much?

142
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,725
You're making me go crazy.

143
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,565
It isn't true! Why are you doing this?

144
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,651
No.

145
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,612
No.

146
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,782
My Eun-byeol is alive.

147
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,618
No.

148
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,830
My Eun-byeol didn't die.

149
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,499
She didn't die.

150
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,501
She didn't die.

151
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,171
No.

152
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,758
No.

153
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,678
No.

154
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,638
No.

155
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,517
My Eun-byeol...

156
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,270
My Eun-byeol is alive.

157
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,487
-Yes.
-Hello.

158
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:10,826
I had to spend some money recently.

159
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,579
I get paid in a few days.

160
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,372
Give me a call then.

161
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,294
I haven't been in an accident
over the past 12 years.

162
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,213
I won't get into an accident. Okay.

163
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,134
My precious 1.2 million won...

164
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,555
No one knows what will happen.

165
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,350
No one knows they will be in an accident.

166
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,019
Do you want me to lend you some money?

167
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,397
That smell.

168
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,107
You've been smoking...

169
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,572
Tae-gwang.

170
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,990
Don't worry.

171
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,911
"Maintain a safe distance" is my motto.

172
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,789
This not only goes for the distance
between cars,

173
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,666
but also between teacher and student.

174
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,250
Okay?

175
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,674
What is he saying?

176
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,095
Take your math notebook.

177
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,355
My mom wants you to take a level test.

178
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,941
What? Well...

179
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,027
What's wrong?
You've been waiting for a while.

180
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,446
My parents said the tuition
was burdensome.

181
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,324
Never mind. I'll be there.

182
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,826
Are many kids being tested?

183
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,203
I think it's just you and Si-jin.

184
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,162
"Lee Si-jin?"

185
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,665
What about me?

186
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,794
Your mom didn't tell you?

187
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,255
I heard you wanted to join
our study group.

188
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,549
I guess the cut-off
isn't that high after all.

189
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,010
There isn't much to prepare.

190
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,847
Mom, I can't believe you!

191
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,892
They know I'm going to fail.
They're only trying to look generous.

192
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,061
Why else?

193
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,856
Because you've been bribing them!

194
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,278
You and Min-jun's mom being close
won't make me turn into Min-jun.

195
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,783
Being with them
won't make my grades go up.

196
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,412
Forget it.

197
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,247
I'm going to hang up.

198
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,208
Why are you so down this morning?

199
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,423
My mom is hanging out
with some bad friends.

200
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,268
The top star Song Hui-yeong
has announced that

201
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,811
she will be getting married a third time.

202
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,482
Her fiancé is a businessman
who is six years younger.

203
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,400
They plan to keep the wedding private

204
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,487
since her fiancé is not a public figure.

205
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,323
We wish them a happy marriage.

206
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,493
Oh...

207
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,036
Did you just get here?

208
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,122
Do you want to eat anything
special tomorrow?

209
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,209
No. Everything you make tastes good.

210
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,311
Wow. Balloons.

211
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,775
Wow.

212
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,196
You're so lucky.
You get to have a birthday party

213
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,073
and see Mommy too.

214
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,157
Yes.

215
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,035
That must be your mommy.

216
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,124
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

217
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,210
Don't tell her that I'm here, okay?

218
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,505
I want to surprise Mommy,
so it's a secret.

219
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,424
Okay, it's a secret.

220
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,522
Did the shoot go well?

221
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,109
You know already.

222
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:17,030
Did you think I wouldn't know
that you had people tailing me all month?

223
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,871
These are divorce papers.

224
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,039
Send them to me after you sign them.

225
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,057
What are you doing?

226
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,560
You didn't marry me for love anyway.

227
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,189
How we met each other,
how that led to our marriage,

228
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,316
and Tae-gwang being born
were all mistakes, weren't they?

229
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,609
That's why I'm accepting...

230
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
my punishment.

231
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,989
Tae-gwang and I are a punishment to you?

232
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,037
Tae-gwang.

233
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,885
You poor thing.

234
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,347
Eating all alone even on your birthday...

235
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,016
I don't care about that.

236
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,566
What's wrong?
Have some while it's still warm.

237
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,152
I don't really like it.

238
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,572
Sure.

239
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,368
Seaweed soup isn't
for the person celebrating his birthday.

240
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,787
It's actually meant for the mom
who gave birth that day...

241
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:55,629
The director was upset
that he couldn't eat with you.

242
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,714
He said to pick out a really nice gift.

243
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,634
Sure. I will.

244
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,344
Thank you.

245
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,331
Stop!

246
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,427
What is it? Is it okay now?

247
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,429
The girl over there.

248
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,139
Isn't she really pretty?

249
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:51,852
Shit.

250
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,984
Ouch, that hurt!

251
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,319
Hey, Tae-gwang.

252
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,029
Are you okay?

253
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,117
No.

254
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,745
I'm sorry.

255
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:10,954
Mr. Kim.

256
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,374
It's not like you to rear-end people.

257
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,586
You need to always maintain
a safe distance

258
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,297
with the cars in front and behind you.

259
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,090
Between teacher and student as well.

260
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,761
You should know better.

261
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:28,972
Oh, my.

262
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,766
That will be pretty expensive.

263
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,061
I'll have to call the insurance company.

264
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:39,149
Sir, your car insurance
expired as of May 3.

265
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,364
You!

266
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,580
You'll call the insurance company, right?

267
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,458
I guess so.

268
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:06,426
HOUSE OF LOVE

269
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,100
I heard you worked multiple part-time jobs

270
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,268
to support the other kids.

271
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,562
It was okay.

272
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,398
It's what I wanted to do.

273
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,693
The things they did to you

274
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,114
even when you were doing your best
to be strong without parents were...

275
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,242
Those wicked things.

276
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,127
You had no one on your side.

277
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,587
Life must have been so hard
for you to bear.

278
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,590
Enough for you to decide on
doing something so horrible.

279
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,179
Call me at any time

280
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,682
if you ever need anything.

281
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:55,976
I will.

282
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,066
Thank you for everything.

283
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,778
And...

284
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,739
it wasn't intentional.

285
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,743
But I'm sorry.

286
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,288
Because of me...

287
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,633
Goodbye.

288
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,423
I guess

289
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,009
I was a happy kid.

290
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,387
Hi, Mom.

291
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,181
Mom.

292
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,600
I don't want to sleep alone.

293
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,313
I like your scent, Mom.

294
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,949
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

295
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,245
Thank you for coming back to me,
my precious daughter.

296
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,087
Mom.

297
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,466
Mom.

298
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,301
Yes.

299
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,220
Mom.

300
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,848
Mom...

301
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:19,035
Why do I still feel like
you're my daughter?

302
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:25,542
It's so hard to believe what is happening.
Maybe it's because I'm in denial.

303
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,045
But to me,

304
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,048
you're still like my Eun-byeol.

305
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,557
Do you want to erase
all your memories of this place

306
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,767
and live with me again?

307
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,898
If I let you go too,
I don't know how I'll go on.

308
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,692
I don't think I can do it.

309
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,363
Can't you just...

310
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,076
live as Eun-byeol for me?

311
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,252
That's crazy.

312
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,422
How...

313
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,924
How could I?

314
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,886
Just like when we didn't know anything,

315
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,721
let's just...

316
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,768
Let's just live together, you and me,

317
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,355
and be there for each other.

318
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,469
The May competition applications
are due tomorrow.

319
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,056
It's the national team in Seoul,

320
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,642
so you know how important it is.

321
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,020
You know only two
can compete per category, right?

322
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,980
-Yes, Sir.
-And...

323
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,568
Han I-an is doing
the 100, 200, and 400m freestyle,

324
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,114
so the rest of you
choose three categories each.

325
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,740
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

326
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,159
What was that?

327
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,203
Hey!

328
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,081
You better prepare yourselves, got it?

329
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,582
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

330
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,418
That's all.

331
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,878
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

332
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,257
Hey.

333
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,344
They give you the best
and tell us to pick the leftovers.

334
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,763
Don't be like that.

335
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,600
It's because it comes to him easily that
he keeps fooling around at competitions.

336
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,937
What? Do you want to fight again?

337
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,315
I'm sorry.

338
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,484
It will never happen again.

339
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,285
That's cold.

340
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,245
Wake up.

341
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,455
Are you taking after Eun-byeol?

342
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,751
I want to show you something.

343
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,462
Ta-da.

344
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,297
They're picking a school uniform model.

345
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,632
I'm going to apply.

346
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,178
If I make it,
I'll take you out to celebrate.

347
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,473
I hope I catch someone's eye
and make my debut.

348
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,060
SCHOOL UNIFORM MODEL APPLICATION

349
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,355
You want to become a celebrity that badly?

350
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,272
Yes.

351
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,236
I'm jealous.

352
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,154
Really?

353
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,782
I have another application. Want it?

354
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,909
Not that.

355
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:32,372
You're lucky you have something
you want to do.

356
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,542
It's only good if I make it.

357
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,669
That you can worry about later.

358
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,966
Why do I have millions of things
I don't want to do,

359
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,468
but not a single thing that I want to do?

360
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,847
I don't know what I live for.

361
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,766
Gosh.

362
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,264
MEN'S LOCKER ROOM

363
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,137
-You're leaving already?
-Yes.

364
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,432
No, don't. Stop it.

365
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,809
-Why not? Give it to me.
-You punk.

366
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,271
Your body is your biggest asset.
Don't waste energy doing this.

367
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,106
This is all exercise too.

368
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,151
You'll hurt your shoulder.

369
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,987
-I'm fine.
-Geez.

370
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,572
-Dad.
-What?

371
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,074
It's tough, isn't it?

372
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,162
Hang in there. I'll try hard--

373
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,081
Nonsense.

374
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,251
You think I would live off of my kid
and live in luxury?

375
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,754
You know that's not what I meant.

376
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,091
Look at this.

377
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:52,387
Oil stains don't come off easily.

378
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:59,143
Being in the water is what you're best at,
so focus on that only.

379
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,771
You know what keeps me going, don't you?

380
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:03,940
Yes.

381
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,484
Good. I'll see you later.

382
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,946
-Dad.
-Yes?

383
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,572
Don't skip your meals.

384
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,992
I won't. The same goes for you.

385
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,827
Go on.

386
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,092
I'll go in after I park.

387
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,289
What are you doing when you should be
getting ready for school?

388
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,708
I'll go tomorrow.

389
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,835
What are you talking about?

390
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,253
Get ready.

391
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,672
You don't seem well, ma'am.

392
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,091
Why are you speaking so formally?

393
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,179
Nothing has changed.
Just be how you have been.

394
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,265
-Please eat.
-Leave it.

395
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,642
I'll eat after I drop you off.

396
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,980
After I see you eat,
I'll take the bus, ma'am.

397
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:26,898
Again.

398
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,942
"I'll take the bus, Mom."

399
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,196
Okay.

400
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,281
Mom.

401
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,116
Good.

402
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,161
Shall I give it a taste, then?

403
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,461
It looks good.

404
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,304
My daughter is a good cook.

405
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,523
Will you be okay to take the bus?
You aren't familiar with this place yet.

406
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,025
I have taken it with my friends
here and there.

407
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,652
So, I'll be fine,

408
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,654
Mom.

409
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,659
Okay then.

410
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,579
I'm going to be late.

411
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,388
KO EUN-BYEOL

412
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,472
Eun-byeol.

413
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:28,019
May I really live as Ko Eun-byeol?

414
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,608
I'll always believe that you're with me.

415
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,404
I'll always work hard
not to disgrace your name.

416
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,513
Thank you.

417
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,033
You were absent. Were you sick?

418
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,744
No!

419
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,123
Then? You skipped school?

420
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,834
Yes!

421
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,215
Are you really Ko Eun-byeol?

422
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,142
Eun-byeol.

423
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,979
Eun-byeol.

424
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,030
Aren't you going to reply?

425
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,867
Well?

426
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,121
No?

427
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,015
Lend me your world history notes.

428
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,600
I wondered why you were absent.

429
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,518
Thanks.

430
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,355
Eun-byeol, lend me your scissors.

431
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,900
Oh, wow.

432
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,236
Does your handwriting change
if you have amnesia?

433
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,072
-Really?
-Yes, look.

434
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,245
-It's different, right?
-That's amazing.

435
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,789
What's so strange about it?

436
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,876
Wait.

437
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,880
Look at this.

438
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,174
This is a letter that you wrote me before.

439
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,801
It's totally different, right?

440
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,094
Isn't it amazing?

441
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,263
Yes.

442
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,057
You're right.

443
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,312
In the movies,
even if they lose their memory,

444
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,981
the body still remembers things.

445
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,818
For example, doing sports,
and playing musical instruments.

446
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,904
You're right.

447
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:30,868
Hey, I-an.

448
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,958
If you got amnesia, do you think
you'll forget how to swim? No, right?

449
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,795
Well, who knows if I'll forget
how to swim?

450
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,509
I'll do this later.

451
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,101
Where are you going?

452
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,104
I'm going to get some medicine
from the nurse's office.

453
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,397
I have a headache.

454
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,704
Tae-gwang, the bell rang. Get to class.

455
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,873
Please.

456
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,167
I was just in a car accident.

457
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,753
Then you should go to the hospital.

458
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,088
It isn't that bad.

459
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,256
I'll be fine in...

460
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,591
two hours.

461
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,344
Goodness.

462
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,306
I'm going to the administration office,
so stay quiet.

463
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,808
Okay.

464
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,606
THE TOP STAR, SONG HUI-YEONG,
ANNOUNCES HER THIRD WEDDING

465
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,095
Tae-gwang.

466
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,724
I heard you were in an accident.
Did you get hurt?

467
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,774
Don't talk to me. It's bad.

468
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,237
You said before that...

469
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,035
I didn't treat you like a human being
and that we barely spoke.

470
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,039
So, you must not know much about me.

471
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,958
I know one thing.

472
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,835
What?

473
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,713
You have amnesia.

474
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,425
Yes, you're right.

475
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,222
I don't know you and you don't know me.

476
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,766
It's fair.

477
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,434
That's nice.

478
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,315
You like having amnesia?

479
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,367
Want me to tell you a secret too?

480
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,125
Don't believe anything I say.

481
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,212
I'm a total liar.

482
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,214
More than I am?

483
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,258
You know,

484
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,553
my name is...

485
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,138
Ko Eun-byeol.

486
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,186
What the...

487
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,190
Like I expected.

488
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,318
I mean, who wouldn't go crazy
after studying their ass off like you?

489
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,363
I can't lose to you.

490
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,533
You know the top star, Song Hui-yeong?

491
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,327
She's my mom.

492
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,300
Did you call, Sir?

493
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:16,969
Jun-seok.

494
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,723
Yes, Sir.

495
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,726
I heard Tae-gwang
played a prank on you again.

496
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,812
-Don't worry about the accident.
-No.

497
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,064
I'll take care of it.

498
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,321
If you can't handle Tae-gwang--

499
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:39,408
I treat him like every other
student in my class.

500
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,873
I know you're very disappointed in me.

501
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,915
I'm not disappointed.

502
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,127
I have no right to feel that way.

503
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,298
Teaching is just like any other job.
When I think about it that way,

504
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,009
it's not so bad after all.

505
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:00,971
I'll get going now.

506
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,441
Hello.

507
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,000
AT LEAST KEEP THE GOOD MEMORIES, WILL YOU?
JEONG SU-IN

508
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,798
AT LEAST KEEP THE GOOD MEMORIES, WILL YOU?
JEONG SU-IN

509
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,721
You came over often
when you were in grade school.

510
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,931
Don't you remember me?

511
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,058
I'm Su-in's mom.

512
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,562
"Jeong Su-in"?

513
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,525
What?

514
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,362
Nothing. I just got a strange text.

515
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:00,906
Mr. Kim,

516
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,660
is there a student named Jeong Su-in
in our school?

517
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,287
I don't know.

518
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,707
There are too many students
for me to know all their names.

519
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,351
Awesome.

520
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,812
Song Hui-yeong is our director's ex-wife?

521
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,606
Poor Director Kong.

522
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:37,568
He's still alone
but she's getting married a third time.

523
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,487
I'm sure he has a girlfriend too.

524
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,406
Someone super young.

525
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,408
You should date him, punk.

526
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,536
My mom said she heard from someone

527
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,997
that this woman is a pro
at marrying rich men

528
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,874
and collecting huge alimony.

529
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:56,253
I heard our gym shrank to half its size
to pay off Song Hui-yeong.

530
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,928
You're annoyingly loud.

531
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,224
What the heck?

532
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,184
No.

533
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,770
You asshole, I warned you.

534
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,108
Darn it.

535
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,737
You have lost your mind, haven't you?

536
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,409
Stop them! Tae-gwang is going to die!

537
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,119
If I try to stop them,
I'll be the dead one.

538
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,998
Hey, Tae-gwang. What's wrong with you?

539
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,500
I'll get a teacher.

540
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,719
Sir, you have to come quick.

541
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,846
Tae-gwang and Gi-tae are fighting.

542
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:48,805
What?

543
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,182
Those punks.

544
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,904
-Hey!
-Hey!

545
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,789
What's so funny?

546
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,252
Hey!

547
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,049
Tae-gwang...

548
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,184
-Tae-gwang, stop.
-Let go!

549
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,062
-Eun-byeol!
-Eun-byeol, are you okay?

550
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,315
-Stop!
-Move it!

551
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,901
-Did you get hurt?
-Are you okay?

552
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:47,114
-You might end up killing him!
-Just leave me.

553
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,032
Stop it, you punks!

554
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,784
Eun-byeol got hurt!

555
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,828
What's your problem?

556
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,663
What's going on here?

557
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,754
Kong Tae-gwang. Kwon Gi-tae.

558
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,464
Come with me.

559
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,729
Eun-byeol, are you okay?

560
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,439
Yes.

561
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,611
Are you okay?

562
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,571
I'm fine.

563
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,990
You're lucky you didn't get hurt more.

564
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,410
I know. How could you step in
when they're fighting?

565
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,745
The old Eun-byeol would have

566
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,080
complained of the noise
and gone to the library.

567
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:40,834
Hey, Eun-byeol.

568
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,964
I was waiting to tell you
once you got your memory back

569
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,384
but you have been acting strange
since the school trip.

570
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,720
What did I do?

571
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,099
You fought with some guy
at the resort where we were staying,

572
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,976
and had a wound on your neck, too.

573
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,895
A wound?

574
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,108
The wound healed. It looked pretty bad.

575
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,489
Right, that was from the trip.

576
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,992
You wouldn't talk to us
and were troubled by something.

577
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,952
There were so many things.

578
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,497
But what guy are you talking about?

579
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:19,831
Who was it?

580
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,626
It was too dark, so I couldn't see.

581
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,920
He was very tall.

582
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,673
Was it I-an?

583
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,550
I-an wasn't there.

584
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:31,927
Really?

585
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,304
No one saw him?

586
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,014
No.

587
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,558
He was at a competition the entire time.

588
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,185
I spoke to him on the phone, too.

589
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,485
Hey, Eun-byeol.

590
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:50,946
Are you okay?

591
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,323
I am not hurt much.

592
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,118
Don't do that again, okay?

593
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,789
You said you stopped by
during the school trip, right?

594
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,792
Did you see me?

595
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,464
Right. You couldn't come on the trip
because of your competition.

596
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,716
How would you know?

597
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,719
I did go. Briefly, at night.

598
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,388
No one else knew that.

599
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,432
Of course not.

600
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,976
I went there quietly to only see
the person I wanted to see.

601
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,313
Did you see me or not?

602
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,607
I didn't.

603
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,866
Song-ju and Si-jin said

604
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,994
they saw me fighting
with some guy at the resort.

605
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,414
So bad that I had a wound on my neck.

606
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,416
Hey, that was--

607
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:45,542
Who was it?

608
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,628
Do you have any idea?

609
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,548
I don't know.

610
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,372
Quit school and prepare
to go abroad for your studies.

611
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,624
Why?

612
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,086
Sending me to a mental institute
for a month or two didn't suffice?

613
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,089
I think the best way is for us
not to see each other.

614
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,176
That's right.

615
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,055
Now you show your true colors.

616
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,266
Treatment, my ass.

617
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,686
All along, you just wanted to get me
out of your sight.

618
00:51:59,074 --> 00:51:59,908
You know...

619
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,912
what day it is today, don't you?

620
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,082
I don't need a gift.

621
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,794
Why don't we have a family dinner?
It's been ten years.

622
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,173
We can congratulate Mom
on her third marriage too.

623
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,470
You're becoming more and more...

624
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,890
like your mom.

625
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,894
You can't express yourself
rationally or normally.

626
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,490
I wonder.

627
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,076
Do I take after her because I'm her son?

628
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,706
Or maybe everyone
who lives with you turns out that way?

629
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,874
Pathetic fool.

630
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,419
How long will you keep
throwing your tantrums?

631
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,921
If you can't handle it, just leave.

632
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:55,839
No.

633
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,925
You said you're being punished.

634
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,637
You said giving birth to me was your sin.

635
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,598
Then keep being punished!

636
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,016
If I die, that will fix it!

637
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,519
How dare you say that to your father?

638
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,945
Think about it.

639
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,741
For a child

640
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,536
to turn out like this,

641
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,498
think about the things
he must have seen or heard.

642
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,652
I'll regret it. I won't regret it.

643
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,445
I'll regret it.

644
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,405
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

645
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,365
I won't regret it.

646
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,325
I'll regret it.

647
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,748
I won't regret it.

648
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,344
Eun-byeol, I need to tell you something.

649
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,804
Come out for a bit.

650
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,984
HAN I-AN

651
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,234
What are you doing here?

652
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,153
What's it to you?

653
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,655
Hey.

654
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,533
Why did you have to butt in?

655
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,370
Is your arm okay?

656
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,998
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

657
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,836
Are you indirectly implying that you're
not okay and want me to worry about it?

658
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,839
You said everything you say is a lie.

659
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,424
Think whatever you want.

660
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,053
Hey.

661
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:54,809
I really...

662
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,937
want to be alone today.

663
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,316
Did I say anything?

664
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,446
You're so dense!

665
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,220
Put your foot on it.

666
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,472
One, two, three.

667
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,517
-Like this?
-Okay, now go forward.

668
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,143
It's hard.

669
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,979
-I'm letting go.
-No.

670
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,106
-I'm letting go!
-Don't!

671
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,398
Hey...

672
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:48,738
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

673
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,474
Cha Song-ju! Massage my shoulders.

674
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,570
Quiet!

675
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,323
Everyone sit down!

676
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,785
We have a new transfer student.

677
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,830
Shut up.

678
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,750
Everything will be new to her,

679
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,629
so help her out until she adjusts well.

680
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,214
Come in.

681
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,257
Come in.

682
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:11,988
Introduce yourself.

683
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,949
I came from Tongyeong's
Noori Girls' High School.

684
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,743
I'm Kang So-yeong.

685
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,954
-Tongyeong.
-We were there.

686
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,790
-The Tongyeong where Mt. Mireuksan is?
-We went there.

687
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,752
I hope we can get along.

688
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,545
It's nice to meet...
