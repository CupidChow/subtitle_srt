1
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,762
Mom.

2
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,109
Mom.

3
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,785
Eun-byeol.

4
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,796
Are you...

5
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,632
Are you...

6
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,842
Are you okay?

7
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:34,803
Yes.

8
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,931
I'm fine.

9
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,770
What happened to your face?

10
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,065
Look at your face.

11
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,488
Mom.

12
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,535
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,078
How...

14
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,248
How could you do this?

15
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,836
How could you do this?

16
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:13,383
You should have told me
whether or not you were alive.

17
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,927
I'm sorry, Mom.

18
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,429
But...

19
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,725
I'm so glad to see you.

20
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,409
You...

21
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,286
You...

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,122
You're really okay, right?

23
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,125
I'm not dreaming, am I?

24
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,210
Do you know

25
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,297
how painful it was

26
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,425
every time I thought of you?

27
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,678
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,028
Eun-byeol.

29
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,741
Eun-bi.

30
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,718
Then...

31
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,347
where were you

32
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,059
and what have you been doing?

33
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,815
I was back

34
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,193
where I used to live.

35
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,905
Where I first met you, Mom.

36
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,032
House of Hope.

37
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,495
Why?

38
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,623
Why were you hiding?

39
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,502
Because...

40
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,422
I wasn't the one you first met.

41
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,426
It wasn't me. It was Eun-bi.

42
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,512
What?

43
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,017
When I went to Tongyeong
on the school trip,

44
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,355
I found out how hard Eun-bi's life was.

45
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,692
I knew it was too late,

46
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,238
but I thought I should do the right thing.

47
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,157
I felt like...

48
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,327
that was the only way I could live.

49
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,498
I had no idea

50
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,212
that you had been watching over me.

51
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,426
DURING THE SCHOOL TRIP IN TONGYEONG

52
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,542
Did you just hit me?

53
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,835
Hey, Eun-bi.

54
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,171
Wake up.

55
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,882
What did Oh Jeong-a, whom you protected,

56
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,176
do while you were being picked on?

57
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,303
No matter how much you harass me,

58
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,680
I believe that I am right.

59
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,725
What is she babbling about?

60
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,439
Wake up, will you?

61
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,444
Why do you try to lecture your friends?
You can't even look out for yourself.

62
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,739
Her dream is to become a teacher.

63
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,324
But...

64
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,243
can someone who got expelled
for beating up someone

65
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,828
become a teacher?

66
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,455
No way.

67
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,334
What would the kids learn from you?

68
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,294
Right?

69
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,963
Back then,

70
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,425
I felt like everything was my fault,

71
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,095
so I couldn't do anything.

72
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,099
I couldn't face Eun-bi,

73
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,145
or I couldn't go back
to the school where Su-in died.

74
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,965
Eun-bi! Wake up!

75
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,550
Eun-bi. Oh, no!

76
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,885
Eun-bi!

77
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,846
Eun-bi, open your eyes.

78
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,182
Eun-bi! Wake up, Eun-bi.

79
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,350
Eun-bi!

80
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,731
Is anyone there? Please, somebody...

81
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,985
Is anyone there?

82
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,613
Someone, please call 911!

83
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,913
Did you reach her family?

84
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,289
No.

85
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,250
She woke up,
but she can't remember anything.

86
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,086
Her name, age, address or anything else.

87
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,088
We called the police.

88
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,684
All I could think was I deserve to suffer

89
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,812
as much as Su-in

90
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,315
and Eun-bi did

91
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,984
until I set things right.

92
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,613
No, perhaps...

93
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,076
I wanted to escape from Su-in.

94
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,622
I had such a hard time...

95
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,920
ever since Su-in died.

96
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,759
I kept thinking of everything
I had done wrong,

97
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,805
so I was terrified.

98
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,149
But...

99
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,070
when I saw the post on the school webpage,

100
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,239
I realized

101
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,367
that if you don't remove the thorn,

102
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,452
the wound...

103
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,621
will eventually

104
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,125
be infected.

105
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:48,838
EVERYONE WHO SAT SILENTLY WAS A MURDERER

106
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,757
You poor thing.

107
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,594
I can't imagine
how hard it has been for you.

108
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,057
I hate myself for being so clueless.

109
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,893
I'm so pathetic.

110
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,323
Eun-byeol.

111
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,286
I'm truly sorry.

112
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,581
No, Mom.

113
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,461
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,634
Eun-byeol.

115
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,139
I'm looking at you close up now,

116
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,975
but I still can't believe this.

117
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,729
Me neither.

118
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,900
You know,

119
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,737
there were so many things
I wanted to do with you.

120
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,826
Let's do them all, one by one.

121
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm so glad.

122
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,754
I was worried that you would scold me.

123
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,632
Of course, you have to be scolded.

124
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,052
Just you wait once you get better.

125
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,628
-Come in.
-Thank you.

126
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,171
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

127
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,388
Thank you for taking care
of the annoying matter.

128
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,933
Don't mention it. It was nothing.

129
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,311
I heard you might be nominated.

130
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,938
Congratulations in advance.

131
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,401
Yes, I think so.

132
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,446
Please support me.

133
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,838
Isn't that So-yeong?

134
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,592
I'm grateful to have an honor student
join our school.

135
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm grateful for your help,

136
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,812
but I can't donate to your campaign.

137
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,355
As you know,

138
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,233
the foundation's money is not my own.

139
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,447
I thought you were someone
I could talk to,

140
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,284
but you're quite inflexible.

141
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,870
This is unrelated,

142
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,040
but there were rumors about So-yeong,
so I looked into it.

143
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,542
And it turns out that in Tongyeong,

144
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,213
she bullied another student
until she killed herself.

145
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,466
These days, it even becomes a problem

146
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,218
if you transfer your kid
under false pretenses.

147
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,637
Will you be okay?

148
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,766
Why don't you just forget
about the favor you did for me?

149
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,352
I'll do the same.

150
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,335
AUTOPSY REPORT

151
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,253
You know,

152
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,548
I looked into Jeong Su-in's case,

153
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,384
and I noticed something interesting.

154
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,678
What do you think?

155
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,765
It's different
from the official autopsy report.

156
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,227
I found this medical examiner
already resigned.

157
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,274
But if I want to find him,

158
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,609
it won't be so difficult.

159
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,194
-Prosecutor Kang.
-Well, then.

160
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,196
Think it over

161
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,156
and call me.

162
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,874
Hey.

163
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,585
Don't look at me.

164
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,505
You look so much like me, it's weird.

165
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,966
I feel the same.

166
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,095
It will take a while to get used to this.

167
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,186
-Seriously.
-Seriously.

168
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,981
Hey, don't copy me.

169
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,987
-It's funny.
-Yes.

170
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,456
Eun-byeol.

171
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,960
Thank you

172
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,045
for saving me.

173
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,674
Forget it.

174
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:09,927
And...

175
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,680
thank you even more

176
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,808
for coming back alive.

177
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,064
What do you want?

178
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,744
Eun-byeol.

179
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,374
Go back to school.

180
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:42,876
What about you?

181
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,587
I'm going to get my name back.

182
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,549
I'll show everyone

183
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,510
that there is a lot I can do

184
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,846
as Lee Eun-bi.

185
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,142
So you won't have to feel

186
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,562
guilty or worry about me anymore.

187
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,481
Okay.

188
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,609
I...

189
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,487
won't run away anymore either.

190
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,782
There is something I must do

191
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,744
before it's too late as well.

192
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,749
You mean about Jeong Su-in, right?

193
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,586
Yes.

194
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,255
I know

195
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,716
it won't be easy.

196
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,293
Do you like it?

197
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,295
There was a time

198
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,131
when I wanted to leave everything too.

199
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,634
What I want...

200
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,388
is for you to realize how you truly feel.

201
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,441
KO EUN-BYEOL

202
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,860
I STARTED...

203
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,907
If you don't want to see me,

204
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,034
start your rehabilitation soon.

205
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,036
Then I won't bother you anymore.

206
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,665
I STARTED REHAB YESTERDAY...

207
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,711
What do you mean?

208
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,714
How did you know?

209
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,967
No way.

210
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,309
Hey.

211
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,061
-Eun-byeol.
-Eun-byeol.

212
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,063
-How have you been?
-"How have you been"?

213
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,356
What's with her?

214
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,400
I simply meant last night.

215
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,986
I missed you guys a lot.

216
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,155
You did something bad, didn't you?

217
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,072
That's right.

218
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,576
You saw us all day at school,
but you still missed us?

219
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:25,956
Well, I do have a face
that you can't get enough.

220
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,208
You're so vain.

221
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,461
Where are you going?

222
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
She's embarrassed of you.

223
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,256
Eun-byeol.

224
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,136
Go!

225
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,182
I heard at the teachers' office
that Eun-byeol

226
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,474
is transferring out tomorrow.

227
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,392
What?

228
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,477
No way.

229
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,980
She didn't say anything this morning.

230
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,358
No, I heard the vice principal
tell Mr. Kim.

231
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,153
-Right?
-Yes, I heard it too.

232
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,571
No way.

233
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,448
She would have told us.

234
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,908
We walked to school together too.

235
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,119
She's right. Eun-byeol is transferring.

236
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,667
I guess this is the last day
I'll see Eun-byeol here.

237
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,545
So...

238
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,591
I prepared a little going away gift.

239
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,967
What is that?

240
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,273
I told you that Lee Eun-bi
from the Internet article

241
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,901
was still alive.

242
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,279
Where do you think she is?

243
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,657
Where is she?

244
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,118
The girl you believe to be Ko Eun-byeol...

245
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,042
is really Lee Eun-bi.

246
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,962
What garbage is that?

247
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,672
-What now?
-How long will she keep that up?

248
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,507
Give it a rest, will you?

249
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,176
Hey, Kang So-yeong.

250
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,929
I told you to stop it already.

251
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,598
Stop making things up.

252
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,892
Eun-byeol, what is she babbling about now?

253
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,853
Rather than being
the orphan and outcast Lee Eun-bi

254
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,230
who was expelled from school,

255
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,233
she is pretending to be Ko Eun-byeol.

256
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,652
She's pretending to have lost her memory.

257
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,408
Think about it.

258
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,079
Even if she had lost her memory,
she changed way too much.

259
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,665
Didn't you think it was strange?

260
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,714
So-yeong.

261
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,217
I'm sorry,

262
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,220
but you got both of them wrong.

263
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,473
Firstly,

264
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,809
I'm not transferring out.

265
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,811
Secondly,

266
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,814
I am Ko Eun-byeol.

267
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,861
Do you have proof?

268
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,239
Why do I need that?

269
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,121
Do you need proof
that you're Kang So-yeong?

270
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,834
Is that right?

271
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,715
But I have proof
that you're not Eun-byeol.

272
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,009
You know about it already.

273
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,262
Let me see it.

274
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,933
KOREAN FORENSIC SERVICE

275
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,937
It's Ko Eun-byeol's
handwriting comparison with yours.

276
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,150
If this isn't enough,
do you want your fingerprints checked?

277
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,403
I can just write for you here

278
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,114
and give you my fingerprints,

279
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,909
but we don't need either

280
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,788
because I got my memory back.

281
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,335
It's my turn to ask you.

282
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,757
What...

283
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,511
did you do to my sister?

284
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,767
Incessant verbal abuse

285
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,104
and pulling her hair
in front of people constantly.

286
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,814
Dumping trash on her.

287
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,399
Framing her for something she didn't do.

288
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,948
A person died because of you.

289
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,952
Yet you don't even bat an eyelid.
You are shameless.

290
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,045
What?

291
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,933
Responding to violence with violence

292
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,061
is beneath me.

293
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,697
-Nice.
-That's so cool.

294
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,532
Nice.

295
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,962
Tae-gwang.

296
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,881
You changed your hairstyle.

297
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,883
Did Si-jin dump you?

298
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,219
That hurts.

299
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,350
Be calm. Be good.

300
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,737
Come in.

301
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,797
Hello.

302
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,884
I'm Ko Eun-byeol of Class Three.

303
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,763
How dare a student
walk into the director's office?

304
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,266
Other students probably have
no reason to see you

305
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,356
since it's rare for the director himself
to force a student to transfer out.

306
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,817
-Now look here!
-I cannot transfer out.

307
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,194
No.

308
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,655
I will not.

309
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,198
What do you take the school for?

310
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,909
If you need to,
call another disciplinary hearing.

311
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,787
I no longer have a reason to leave.

312
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,518
Goodness.

313
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,396
I'm so sick of this.

314
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:15,991
What?

315
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,372
Hey, Eun-byeol.

316
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,417
Seeing how you're treating Tae-gwang,
you must really have your memory back.

317
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,877
I was totally shocked earlier.

318
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,338
So-yeong was bothering Eun-byeol again,

319
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,009
and Eun-byeol
poked So-yeong's shoulder like this.

320
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,307
What more is So-yeong
planning to do to you?

321
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,558
I really don't like her.

322
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,435
It's okay.

323
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,562
She can do whatever she wants.

324
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,188
I'm not afraid one bit.

325
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,458
Hey.

326
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:08,835
Rooftop.

327
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,362
Rooftop!

328
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:57,967
Hey.

329
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,928
Why are you avoiding me?

330
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,100
What?

331
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,352
I told you that day

332
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,062
I just...

333
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,273
-Just...
-Just what?

334
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,693
-Just say it here.
-What?

335
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,737
Say it.

336
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,701
Did So-yeong bother you again?

337
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,371
-Were you okay alone?
-Of course, I was.

338
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:28,998
Hey.

339
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,252
Do you realize you don't look okay at all?

340
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,132
Do you want to die?

341
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,883
Hey, Tae-gwang.

342
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:39,801
Hey.

343
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,639
I'm getting some crazy thoughts,

344
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,058
so stay still.

345
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,936
What thoughts?

346
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,986
Hey. Get your hands off of me.

347
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,155
What's wrong with you?

348
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,949
You're acting like the old...

349
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,208
How have you been,

350
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,002
Kong Tae-gwang?

351
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,882
I really am Eun-byeol.

352
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,634
You've changed a lot.

353
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,138
Are you Eun-byeol?

354
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,267
Really? Are you really Eun-byeol?

355
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,564
What's going on?

356
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,445
-I heard how you've been helping Eun-bi--
-What about Eun-bi?

357
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,364
Where is Eun-bi?

358
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,408
-What?
-Where is she?

359
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,772
Eun-bi!

360
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,110
Eun-bi!

361
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,623
Eun-byeol...

362
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,297
I'm still not used to it.

363
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,884
Mom.

364
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,595
I'm really okay.

365
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,266
Take your time.

366
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,568
I'm sorry I didn't let you
live as Eun-bi sooner.

367
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,780
I'll correct the death certificate first.

368
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,866
Let's fix things step by step.

369
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,333
I feel like I'm dreaming.

370
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,753
That's how happy I am,

371
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,383
so stop making that face.

372
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:30,972
Okay.

373
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,850
From now on,

374
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,269
me, Eun-byeol,

375
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:38,980
and you, Eun-bi,

376
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,524
will live happily together.

377
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,028
Let's forget the painful past, okay?

378
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,129
I'm glad you started
before it was too late.

379
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,883
Recovering the joint's range of motion
comes first,

380
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,218
but since you're an athlete,

381
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,763
I think we can do it simultaneously
with muscle-building too.

382
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,349
It will be hard,
but make sure you come regularly.

383
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:15,892
I will.

384
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,150
Ms. Ahn.

385
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,527
You heard the Ministry of Education

386
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,905
is sending a native English-speaking
assistant teacher, right?

387
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,908
Yes, he's starting soon
since he finished his training.

388
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,494
Please look after him.

389
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,787
Yes, sir.

390
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,122
Ms. Jeong.

391
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,084
May we have a talk?

392
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,460
Yes, sir.

393
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,391
Do you have proof
that I'm the one who posted it?

394
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,145
I found out by chance

395
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,900
that the math student teacher

396
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,697
is the elder sister of that student,
Jeong Su-in,

397
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,532
who died last year.

398
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,035
You're Jeong Su-in's elder sister,
aren't you?

399
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,456
Why did you hide that fact?

400
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,084
You never asked.

401
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,544
I mean...

402
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,923
think about it.

403
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,386
A post about a student who died
turned the school upside down,

404
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,638
and it turns out
the student's elder sister

405
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,473
is a student teacher at the school.

406
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,058
I mean,

407
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,728
it's so obvious.

408
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,313
Bring me proof.

409
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,608
We can file a complaint
with the university

410
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,404
that you chose our school
for improper reasons.

411
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,284
Just leave quietly.

412
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:02,999
Ms. Jeong.

413
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,425
I sent immature texts
and even threatened people.

414
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,429
I wanted all of you to remember Su-in
and suffer too.

415
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,891
You said my methods were wrong, right?

416
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,978
I meant it would hurt you too.

417
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,522
I really am not the one

418
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,816
who posted that.

419
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,985
I know

420
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,529
because I did it.

421
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:40,787
I'll tell the truth
so you won't get kicked out of school.

422
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,080
No, it's okay.

423
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,957
It's not a matter of who posted it.

424
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,795
I'm being kicked out
because I'm Su-in's sister.

425
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,424
I'm sorry.

426
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,678
I'll do everything I can.

427
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,318
HOUSE OF LOVE

428
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,661
I'll go in alone.

429
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,168
Ra-jin.

430
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,797
It's me.

431
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,512
Is it really you,

432
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,224
Eun-bi?

433
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,603
Yes.

434
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,356
Eun-bi.

435
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,902
-Eun-bi.
-Eun-bi!

436
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,037
See? I told you she wasn't dead.

437
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,414
No, you were dead,

438
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,333
but you came back
because you read my letters, right?

439
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,043
"Letters"?

440
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,255
Yeong-ho wrote a letter every day
asking you to come back

441
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,342
and hung them on the Tree of Hope

442
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,095
at school.

443
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,187
Did you?

444
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,439
Eun-bi.

445
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:18,402
You went away because we gave you
a hard time, didn't you?

446
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:25,993
Yeong-ho and Seung-min became really good
and don't cause trouble anymore.

447
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,788
It's not like that.

448
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,539
And...

449
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,668
I'll help you a lot more.

450
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,920
So, please.

451
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,507
Don't leave us again, okay?

452
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,302
Okay.

453
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,477
I'm sorry, guys.

454
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,188
I'm so sorry.

455
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,574
Must you do this?

456
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,370
I'm sorry, Mom.

457
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,749
But...

458
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,544
I need to take care of things here.

459
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,381
Okay.

460
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm overreacting.
You'll be back, aren't you?

461
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,850
You'll come back, right?

462
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,727
To our house in Seoul.

463
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,232
Okay, I understand.

464
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,234
I'll go back first.

465
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,986
Take a few more days.

466
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,196
Okay, Mom.

467
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,913
Tae-gwang?

468
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,542
Hey, Eun-bi. How could you...

469
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,835
Tae-gwang.

470
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,464
-How did you get here?
-How else?

471
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,507
I took the bus. Why?

472
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,716
What's your deal?

473
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,635
Why are you here?

474
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,429
It just happened.

475
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,430
"It just happened"?

476
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,057
That's it? Then it's over?

477
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,977
You think it's over if you run away
without as much as a goodbye?

478
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,648
Tae-gwang.

479
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,733
I'm not back here for good.

480
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,693
Are you kidding me?

481
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,238
If you were here for good,
I would really be mad.

482
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,197
Hey.

483
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,449
Don't bother Eun-bi!

484
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,367
What?

485
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,328
It's not like that, guys.

486
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,289
We saw you yelling at Eun-bi.

487
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,917
He's a bad person, right?

488
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,001
Hey, that was...

489
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,589
Calm down.

490
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,716
You calm down.

491
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,281
Eat quickly and go.

492
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,158
-Do I have to go?
-Of course.

493
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,243
You have school tomorrow.

494
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,706
I guess I've been too good lately.

495
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,541
I usually don't go to school.

496
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,091
Hey.

497
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,344
Why are you guys still up?

498
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,098
Get up. One, two...

499
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,935
Did you brush your teeth?

500
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:28,569
Seung-min, go straight to the bathroom,
brush your teeth, and then go to bed.

501
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,653
Okay.

502
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,572
Yeong-ho and Ra-jin, go to bed now.

503
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,032
-Okay.
-Okay.

504
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,464
If you don't leave in an hour,

505
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,301
you'll miss the last bus.

506
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,219
Really?

507
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,347
Okay.

508
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,316
So...

509
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,652
are you happy Eun-byeol is back?

510
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,695
Yes.

511
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,907
So happy that I can't believe it.

512
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,619
She hasn't changed.

513
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:20,829
How so?

514
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,667
She has a habit of hitting people.

515
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,669
I got hit today too.

516
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,218
What about you?

517
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,386
What?

518
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,096
What will you do now?

519
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,974
I don't know.

520
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,020
I feel like this is where I belong,

521
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,399
but I also feel like
I should go back to Seoul.

522
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,528
One thing for sure

523
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,782
is that from now on,

524
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,577
my place is for me to choose and decide,

525
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,496
not anyone else.

526
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,375
Go ahead,

527
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,544
but tell me where you're going first.

528
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:18,721
You should go now.

529
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,228
Fine.

530
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,278
Hey.

531
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,488
Tae-gwang.

532
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,870
I've been wanting

533
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,206
to say this for a while now.

534
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,673
Thank you

535
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,842
for everything.

536
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,347
For letting me

537
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,308
not have to lie to you,

538
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,271
and for being the first person
to call me by my name,

539
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,774
and for always making me laugh.

540
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:16,945
And...

541
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,368
I'm sorry I can't return the feelings

542
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,329
you have for me.

543
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,246
Hey.

544
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,666
That's enough.

545
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,608
Goodbye,

546
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,362
Kong Tae-gwang.

547
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,002
But...

548
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:15,671
you know something?

549
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:17,840
What?

550
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,677
I missed the last bus.

551
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,594
What?

552
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,306
Hey.

553
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,394
You said you know everything.

554
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,688
Then how long will you do this?

555
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,983
Until you stop apologizing for everything.

556
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,276
Happy?

557
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,695
Right.

558
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,697
Shall I do it too?

559
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:44,992
Brush my teeth?

560
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,426
KO EUN-BYEOL

561
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,621
Hey, I-an.

562
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,748
Hey.

563
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,379
What is it that you want to talk about
at this hour?

564
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:40,547
Hey.

565
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,759
Do I need a reason to see you?

566
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,223
What?

567
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:51,767
Right.

568
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,729
I hesitated in case you would get
the wrong idea,

569
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,399
but I started my physical rehabilitation.

570
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:01,944
What physical rehabilitation?

571
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,029
For my shoulder, of course.

572
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,155
"Your shoulder"?

573
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,911
But why would I get the wrong idea

574
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,955
about you doing your rehabilitation?

575
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,250
Whatever.

576
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,003
Because you kept saying stupid things
like if I begin rehab,

577
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,215
you won't bother me,
and that you'll disappear.

578
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:31,974
Hey, I-an.

579
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,935
What's wrong with you?

580
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,604
The shoulders are a swimmer's life.

581
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,398
How did you hurt it?

582
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,485
You should have been more careful.

583
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,946
Hey. You...

584
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,699
Why are you talking like that?

585
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,286
Don't you know
how I got into the accident?

586
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,045
I-an.

587
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,091
At the school trip,

588
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,471
I felt bad after walking away
from you like that.

589
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,560
I was in no state of mind
to think about someone...

590
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,522
You...

591
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,566
What's going on?

592
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,153
Hey, that hurts. Let go.

593
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,112
You...

594
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,281
You...

595
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,706
I'm sorry.

596
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,084
You have every right to be angry.

597
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,545
I won't act up or get annoyed,

598
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,384
or hit you until you're not mad anymore.

599
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,012
I mean it.

600
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,181
I promise.

601
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:57,851
Eun-byeol.

602
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,272
Yes.

603
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,441
It's me.

604
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,656
It's been a while, I-an.

605
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,409
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

606
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,168
What on earth?

607
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,630
Do you know how much...

608
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,550
How am I supposed to accept all of this?

609
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,304
There was something I couldn't tell you.

610
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,015
I'll tell you slowly.

611
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,477
Hey.

612
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,897
-I said I was sorry.
-Eun-byeol.

613
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,191
I'm upset too, and I feel bad!

614
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,027
So please, be understanding.

615
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,449
Is that all you can say?

616
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,912
Even when you disappeared,

617
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,415
and when you reappeared?

618
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,213
Did you think how I felt
when I thought you were dead?

619
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:13,218
Or when the person I thought was dead
suddenly appeared before my eyes?

620
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,514
You never once thought of that, have you?

621
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,435
Hey.

622
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,522
I may be a selfish, inconsiderate brat,

623
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,109
but give me some credit.

624
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,861
So you shouldn't have done this!

625
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,530
Why are you getting so angry?

626
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:36,950
Fine.

627
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,162
You're always like this.

628
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,000
Let's say it's because I worried

629
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,544
much more than I should have about you.

630
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:54,676
I'm so happy and thankful
that you're back safe and sound.

631
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,680
But I can't smile for you.

632
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,057
Sorry.

633
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,045
Mr. Kim.

634
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,757
Hi, Eun-byeol.

635
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,509
I...

636
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,220
got my memory back.

637
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,972
Since it's back,

638
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,017
I won't run away anymore.

639
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,397
And I want to apologize to Su-in.

640
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,985
-Eun-byeol.
-To be honest,

641
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,696
before I lost my memory,

642
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,284
I hated coming to school. It terrified me.

643
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,371
Since that night a year ago

644
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,292
when I placed my hand on Su-in's shoulder,

645
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,297
she had been following me.

646
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,759
At school,

647
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,803
on the streets,

648
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,973
and at home.

649
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:26,935
She was everywhere.

650
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:30,856
I'm sorry.

651
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,149
I was afraid

652
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,736
the other students would look at me

653
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,574
the way they looked at her.

654
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,286
I can't turn back time

655
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,330
no matter how much I regret it.

656
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,626
But...

657
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,338
I still want to tell the truth.

658
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,426
You do too, don't you?

659
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:01,845
Yes.

660
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,141
I'm sorry

661
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,352
for making you go through this
because of my incompetence.

662
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,772
I'll set it right.

663
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,156
Look over here!

664
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,284
Look!

665
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:41,009
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

666
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,685
HOUSE OF LOVE

667
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,686
Eun-bi!

668
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,314
Hey!

669
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,399
Aren't you going to get up?

670
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,827
Here!

671
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,330
Wait, I got it!

672
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,957
One to zero!

673
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,959
Good job!

674
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,131
Goal!

675
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,718
-Hey, Eun-bi.
-Pass!

676
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:28,348
-Eun-bi.
-Hi, Eun-bi!

677
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,351
Go on and play.

678
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,603
Let's go there!

679
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,190
What are you doing? Come on.

680
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,067
Let's play!

681
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,986
It's Eun-bi!

682
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,363
Over here!

683
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,280
Wait!

684
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,955
Pass!

685
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,253
Goal!

686
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,629
Hold on!

687
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,881
Pass!

688
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,508
You can't beat me.

689
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:06,845
Here!

690
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,819
I-an.

691
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,071
Remember you asked before

692
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,907
why I didn't tell you the truth

693
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,620
as soon as I got my memory back?

694
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,789
I must have known

695
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,792
that if I told you,

696
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,296
we would end up like this.

697
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:51,890
Hey.

698
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,976
How long must I walk on eggshells
around you?

699
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,564
Since when did you worry
about other people?

700
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,108
You got me.

701
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,490
But how did you hurt your shoulder?

702
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:09,908
It was an accident.

703
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,659
What accident?

704
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,745
During training?

705
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,539
No, that's not it.

706
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,418
You should have been careful.

707
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,712
This is an important time for you.

708
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,131
But...

709
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,383
where is Eun-bi now?

710
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,513
In Tongyeong.

711
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,015
At House of Love where she used to live.

712
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,936
Tongyeong?

713
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,065
Did she go back for good?

714
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:44,943
I don't know.

715
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:51,950
Mom and I are anxiously waiting for Eun-bi
to make her decision.

716
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,872
If she had good memories here,
she will return.

717
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,250
If not,

718
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,418
I guess she will want to stay
in Tongyeong.

719
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,842
How did she seem to you?

720
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,719
Did Eun-bi...

721
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,721
have a really tough time here?

722
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,563
"A tough time"?

723
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,484
When she had someone risking his life
to protect her?

724
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,241
So...

725
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:37,287
Lee Eun-bi went to Tongyeong?

726
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,039
No wonder.

727
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:43,751
I wondered how the little outcast
was so confident.

728
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,381
Oh, my.

729
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,759
Our poor I-an, what will you do now?

730
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:55,972
Hey, So-yeong.

731
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,309
What are you trying to say?

732
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,145
Did you know?

733
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,484
I-an left a competition
and was running to school

734
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,694
when he got in the accident.

735
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,739
What?

736
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:17,118
Whom do you think
he did something so reckless to save?

737
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,206
He already knew that she was Lee Eun-bi

738
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,083
and not Ko Eun-byeol by then.

739
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,504
What is she yapping about?

740
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,091
Hey, I-an.

741
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,053
I have a question.

742
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,015
Who is the one you like?

743
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,061
Ko Eun-byeol...
