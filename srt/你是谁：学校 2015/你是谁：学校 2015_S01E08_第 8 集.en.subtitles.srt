1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,769
Hey, you only got one.

2
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,731
Why don't you try it?

3
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,445
Get low, like this.

4
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:31,865
Try it.

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,536
-Come on.
-Like this?

6
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,664
No, get low. Like this.

7
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,131
Hey, are you okay?

8
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,056
You should be more careful.

9
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,515
Let me see.

10
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,022
What is this scar?

11
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,485
When I was ten,
I was learning how to ride a bike...

12
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,946
When you were ten?

13
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,991
Did you get your memory back?

14
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,536
But you got it all wrong.

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,455
I taught you how to ride a bike
in middle school...

16
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,215
You know me better than I do.

17
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,300
-Oh, my!
-Eun-byeol!

18
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,346
How could you erase
every single memory of me?

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,267
Do you want me to help you
get your memory back?

20
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,186
No.

21
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,191
I was frustrated,

22
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,819
so I worked really hard
to get my memory back.

23
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,362
But I shouldn't have.

24
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,363
Hey.

25
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,490
I think...

26
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,409
I'll really miss the days

27
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,870
when I didn't remember anything.

28
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,623
I-an.

29
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,542
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,381
For making two people's memory
a memory only one person remembers.

31
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:14,968
The person I am now

32
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,179
is very different
from the Eun-byeol that you know.

33
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,266
But we're still good friends, right?

34
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,357
Hey, Eun-byeol.

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,695
Eun-byeol.

36
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,788
You...

37
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,541
You're Eun-byeol...

38
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,711
Right?

39
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,679
I-an.

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,724
I'm...

41
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,396
You see...

42
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,442
You've been acting so differently

43
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,195
that I had a crazy thought.

44
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,742
Let's go. I'll take you home.

45
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,211
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,173
I must have lost my mind.

47
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,551
Hey, Eun-byeol.

48
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,554
This is when you should get angry.

49
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,557
Not when I am worried about you.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,019
Got it?

51
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,628
When I was ten,
I was learning how to ride a bike...

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,064
Eun-byeol, have some snacks.

53
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,692
Mom.

54
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,403
Yes?

55
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,321
You're here...

56
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,409
when I come home.

57
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,370
And at school, I have friends.

58
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,709
It's so nice.

59
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,715
What about you?

60
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,592
Are you

61
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,178
happy

62
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,347
because I'm here?

63
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,270
Of course, I am.

64
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,106
That's good.

65
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,817
Why do you ask?

66
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,820
I'm worried

67
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,366
that it pains you every time you see me.

68
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,413
I shouldn't hurt others

69
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,542
just so I can be happy.

70
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,381
Nonsense.

71
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,137
Eun-byeol.

72
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,099
If things are hard,
you can transfer to another school.

73
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,312
Do you want to start over at a new school?

74
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,786
UNIVERSITY ADMISSION INFORMATION

75
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,499
SAT SCORE
LANGUAGE B, MATH A, ENGLISH

76
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,307
You must be tired.

77
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,226
Just go get some sleep.

78
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm fine.

79
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,521
Keep studying.

80
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,199
Concentrate.

81
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,995
This is why you lost 0.5 points clumsily.

82
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,251
Are you preparing well
for the English project?

83
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,046
It's not a hard one,
so you better get a perfect score.

84
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,339
No matter what.

85
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,301
You better not lose
to that girl, So-yeong, again.

86
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,596
Okay?

87
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,433
Got it?

88
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,560
Yes.

89
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,397
Okay. Keep studying.

90
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,499
-Mister.
-Yes?

91
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,669
-I'll take the bus today.
-You know how to do that?

92
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,255
I won't know unless I try.

93
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,397
Hey.

94
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,818
Why didn't you exercise this morning?

95
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,740
I overslept.

96
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,536
I wondered what had gotten into you.

97
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,540
Come exercise with me tomorrow.

98
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,250
It's boring running alone.

99
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,212
Okay.

100
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,424
Do you want to watch a movie

101
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,843
after my afternoon training?

102
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,053
That sounds good.

103
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,846
What should we watch?

104
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,570
Darn it.

105
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,906
You shouldn't ride like that
on the sidewalk!

106
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,660
Are you okay?

107
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,286
Yes.

108
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,998
She's fine.

109
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,104
What are you doing?

110
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,648
I'm having lunch with you. What?

111
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,317
You're so fickle.

112
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,360
Whatever.

113
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,238
You're unbelievable.

114
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,338
Gosh.

115
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,312
Song-ju.

116
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,772
Did you go to that audition?

117
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,943
No, they had to reschedule.

118
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,238
Right.

119
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,158
My uncle is busy
with traveling on business.

120
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,743
I see.

121
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,288
Hi, Uncle.

122
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,832
She has a common face.

123
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,211
Just pretend to interview her.

124
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,213
It will take only 15 minutes.
Can't you do that?

125
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,634
Just have her do this and that.

126
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,219
What can she do when she's told
she's not good enough?

127
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,226
Yes, Uncle.

128
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,104
Call me when you set the date.

129
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,022
Okay.

130
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,157
So-yeong.

131
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,077
What are you doing?

132
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,119
Can't you tell?

133
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,580
I'm setting up Song-ju's audition.

134
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,166
I warned you

135
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,504
not to hurt Song-ju.

136
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,758
Go tell her the truth

137
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,219
and cancel the audition.

138
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,512
Why?

139
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,013
Why should I do that?

140
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,682
-Like you don't know?
-No, I don't.

141
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,270
I said I would give her a chance,
not get her scouted.

142
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,861
I'm not done yet.

143
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,365
Eun-byeol.

144
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:45,413
You don't just look like Eun-bi,
you act like her too.

145
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,042
This is why I keep getting confused.

146
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,212
Hi, I-an!

147
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,594
You must have something to talk about.

148
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,264
I'll get going now.

149
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,026
Did you fight with the new girl again?

150
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,616
Don't forget we're going to watch
a movie later.

151
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,703
I'll call you after training.

152
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,581
Okay.

153
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,677
-He's studying so hard.
-Who?

154
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,387
Min-jun?

155
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,181
Look at them.

156
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,350
-Look at him.
-Be quiet!

157
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,522
HIGH SCHOOL LITERATURE

158
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,753
So-yeong already knows

159
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,423
that Lee Eun-bi and Eun-byeol
have the same handwriting.

160
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,427
How long will you just stand there
and deny it?

161
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,392
Did anyone see

162
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,895
my World History notebook?

163
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,396
Nobody?

164
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,239
Did anyone see
Eun-byeol's World History notebook?

165
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,282
-No.
-No.

166
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,826
-No.
-No.

167
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,014
-Sir.
-Yes?

168
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,975
-You forgot this.
-Thanks.

169
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,395
Here's the handwriting analysis
you requested.

170
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,563
Would you like to take a look?

171
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,814
-Let me see.
-Here.

172
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,444
HANDWRITING ANALYSIS

173
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,489
THE HANDWRITINGS ARE 95% IDENTICAL

174
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,164
So-yeong.

175
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,875
Wait for me.

176
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,795
-Doesn't my makeup look good?
-Yes.

177
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,175
What's wrong? Are you okay?

178
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,220
I have a stomachache.

179
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,597
Really?

180
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,850
I'll tell the teacher.
Go lie down in the infirmary.

181
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,435
Would you?

182
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,228
Thanks.

183
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,272
Can you go alone?

184
00:14:59,106 --> 00:14:59,940
Go on.

185
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,797
We'll be doing safety training today.

186
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,051
If something happens at school,

187
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,719
this can help you save

188
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,972
your friends' lives
before the paramedics arrive,

189
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,141
so pay attention and learn.

190
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,477
Min-jun.

191
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,688
-He isn't here yet?
-I'm here.

192
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,816
Three people at a time. Let's start.

193
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,026
Yes, sir.

194
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,489
If someone has lost consciousness

195
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,700
or stops breathing,

196
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,203
listen to check if they are breathing.

197
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,917
Put your hand on their chest
and make sure their heart is beating.

198
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,345
Song-ju.

199
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,855
Make up with Si-jin.

200
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,816
What's wrong with you guys?

201
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,987
Whatever.

202
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,823
Song-ju.

203
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,658
You know...

204
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,577
What? What is it now?

205
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,288
Do you really have to go on that audition

206
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,582
So-yeong is setting up?

207
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,876
Hey, Eun-byeol.

208
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,586
That again?

209
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,589
No.

210
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,094
-I heard her talking on the phone and--
-Is there something between you two?

211
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,722
Or did you know her from before?

212
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,810
I just don't get it.
Why are you doing this?

213
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,772
Whether it's good or bad,
I want to give it a shot.

214
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:24,877
Hey.

215
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,714
Look at this.

216
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,759
I said not to make this face.

217
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,929
Keep your eyes wide open
and head held high.

218
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,559
Okay. I need a break, that's all.

219
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,935
Goodness.

220
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,279
But I'm glad I got caught.

221
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,908
I don't need to pretend in front of you.

222
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,042
Aren't I funny? No?

223
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,251
This isn't funny?

224
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,630
It's not funny? Oh, you laughed.

225
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,258
That was hard.

226
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,640
We're changing!

227
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,766
Class 2-3!

228
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,935
Many of you haven't submitted
your project!

229
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,979
Even one second past five o'clock
won't cut it, okay?

230
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,356
-Okay.
-Okay.

231
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,155
So-yeong, did you submit ours?

232
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,241
I'll do it now.

233
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,582
What's wrong?

234
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
What's wrong with my laptop?

235
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,422
What?

236
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,177
It was acting up earlier too.
Did you back it up?

237
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,514
You can't do this now!

238
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,599
How long will it take to edit it?

239
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,560
It will take more than an hour.

240
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,479
-Oh, no.
-What are we going to do?

241
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,567
-We're in trouble.
-Oh, no!

242
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,737
What is this? What happened?

243
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,243
-It looks like it's been reformatted.
-What?

244
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,829
What about ours?

245
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,547
It's not working.
It was fine before gym class.

246
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,674
What? Three laptops at the same time?

247
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,802
Was anyone in the classroom
during gym class?

248
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,221
That's right.

249
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,182
Hey, So-yeong.

250
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,185
Weren't you in here
because you weren't feeling well?

251
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,605
No, So-yeong was in the infirmary,
not in the classroom.

252
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,732
Right?

253
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,151
Yes.

254
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,197
I was in the infirmary and just got here.

255
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,824
Did I say anything?

256
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,286
I'm just asking if you saw anything.

257
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,753
This is ridiculous.

258
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,602
Class 2-3 again?

259
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,687
I'm sorry.

260
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,023
So what will you do now?

261
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,942
I'll stick to the rules.

262
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,362
But that means...

263
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,157
I was very clear about the procedure.

264
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,659
Regardless of what happened,

265
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,954
I'll only accept submissions
received before five o'clock.

266
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,373
Ms. Ahn.

267
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,377
-The kids worked hard on it and--
-Yes.

268
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,128
I'm sure they worked hard.

269
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,214
Everyone works hard.

270
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,175
But if I give them more time,

271
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,721
other kids may do this again
to buy more time.

272
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,517
I don't want to believe it,

273
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,687
but if someone did this on purpose,

274
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,648
innocent kids will suffer unjustly.

275
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,696
Then those three groups

276
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,532
may submit their projects
by noon tomorrow,

277
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,868
but I'll deduct five points
from their score, okay?

278
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,081
Mr. Kim.

279
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,834
You need to investigate this.

280
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,254
And be prepared to deal
with the parents' complaints.

281
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:38,922
Goodness.

282
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,044
Hey.

283
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,673
-I-an.
-What?

284
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,509
How would you feel if I had a twin?

285
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:25,969
What?

286
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,264
If there was another girl
who looked just like me...

287
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,435
And she went to school with us,
and the three of us hung out.

288
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,773
How do you think you would feel?

289
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,108
I would probably be confused.

290
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,819
-Is that all?
-What else?

291
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,655
It would be a huge pain for me

292
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,908
if there were two ugly,
ill-tempered brats.

293
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,079
Forget it. Just keep playing.

294
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,501
Stop that.

295
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,252
You told me to keep playing.

296
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,169
-Can you help with this?
-Okay.

297
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,059
Is someone coming?

298
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,652
I invited people from the foundation,
so stay in your room.

299
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,657
How long will it last this time?

300
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,411
How will you be able to even eat

301
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,706
while worrying about what I would do?

302
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,916
When you refused to go abroad,

303
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,294
didn't that mean you would behave?

304
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,298
You no longer have a choice.

305
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,133
Remember that.

306
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:11,801
Hey.

307
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,845
Did you wait long?

308
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,639
Yes.

309
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,307
A little.

310
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,995
It's almost time.

311
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,705
Let's go in.

312
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,133
You didn't like the movie?

313
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,636
You look so serious.

314
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,390
I liked it.

315
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,767
All right then.

316
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,271
Do you want to walk around a bit?

317
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,735
Let's go.

318
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,530
This is cute.

319
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,660
I'm not so sure about that.

320
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,294
Look.

321
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,048
Hey.

322
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,009
-What do you think?
-What are you doing?

323
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,096
What do you think?

324
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,270
It's so cute.

325
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,606
-You like it?
-Yes.

326
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,874
Eun-byeol.

327
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,042
For you.

328
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,418
Hey.

329
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,387
You know I hate furry things
that catch dust.

330
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,347
You keep it.

331
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,024
It's so cute.

332
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,049
Your call is being forwarded to voicemail.

333
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,557
How's the movie?

334
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,812
I really want to be alone today.

335
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,279
Hi, Eun-byeol.

336
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,740
Hey.

337
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,453
I really...

338
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,539
want to be alone today.

339
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,808
It's not even my birthday.
Why did you buy me a gift?

340
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,185
Thanks.

341
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,187
You like it?

342
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,147
Yes, totally.

343
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,946
Tae-gwang.

344
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,454
What are you doing here at this hour?

345
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,374
I was waiting for you at this hour.

346
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,417
Why else would I be here?

347
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,174
Eun-byeol, the bus is here.

348
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,467
Go on.

349
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,762
Tae-gwang, it's late.

350
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,514
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

351
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,767
Hey.

352
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,645
Go.

353
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,415
Since when

354
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,543
were you so interested in Eun-byeol?

355
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,003
I know.

356
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,797
The old Eun-byeol

357
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,925
wouldn't even look me in the eye.

358
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,386
Right?

359
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,305
What do you mean?

360
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,057
I mean the Eun-byeol now

361
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,059
needs me...

362
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,896
more than she needs you.

363
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,150
You punk. Stop your gibberish.

364
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,235
Why would she need you?

365
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,863
Are you trying to say the old Eun-byeol

366
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,532
and the Eun-byeol now
are different people or something?

367
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,666
Why are you doing things I used to do?

368
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,628
This is not your style.

369
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:09,969
And...

370
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,555
don't think too much about what I said.

371
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,687
You know I'm a madman.

372
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,376
This is so annoying.

373
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,003
It's annoying enough
that we have to start over.

374
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,798
Why should we lose five points?

375
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,218
I know. What did we do wrong?

376
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,386
We're victims.

377
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,181
But who do you think did it?

378
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,143
Probably someone outside the three teams
who had their laptops reformatted.

379
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,296
You were in the classroom.

380
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,966
Why did you say you were in the infirmary?

381
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,760
I went to the infirmary

382
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,972
but there weren't any vacant beds,
so I went back to the classroom.

383
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,727
I was sick, so I took a nap at my desk.

384
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,313
That's all.

385
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,526
Then why did you lie to the others?

386
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,571
I panicked when they suddenly asked...

387
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,577
Why would I do something like that?

388
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,705
Our team's laptop was wiped out too.

389
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,208
Okay.

390
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,627
That's all for now.

391
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,588
You can go.

392
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,776
What? Were you listening in on us?

393
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,070
I was just passing by.

394
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,663
-Cheer up.
-It's so annoying though.

395
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,999
She's here.

396
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,918
She's finally here.

397
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,505
Hey, So-yeong.

398
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,673
What's your deal?

399
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:53,966
What?

400
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,844
I heard you were caught on camera.

401
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,263
You were in the classroom
during gym class.

402
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,516
Why did you lie?

403
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,811
I did go to the infirmary.

404
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,230
You seemed to accuse me, so I panicked.

405
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,898
If you did nothing wrong,
why did you panic?

406
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:10,942
So-yeong.

407
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,528
Eun-byeol's notebook that went missing...

408
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,782
Didn't you take it that morning
I saw you here?

409
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,793
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

410
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,391
-It's true.
-It's the notebook.

411
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,771
I swear I didn't touch the laptops.

412
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,982
Think about it.

413
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,402
Our team's project is gone too.
Why would I do that?

414
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,488
Our laptop was acting up
since that morning.

415
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,698
I know.

416
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,366
I got it now.

417
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,621
Your laptop died,
so you sabotaged the others' laptops?

418
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,958
And all the smart kids' laptops at that.

419
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,460
I said it wasn't me.

420
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,338
I said I didn't do it!

421
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:19,093
This reminds me of that bullied girl.

422
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,014
Are you sure that wasn't you either?

423
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,852
Hey, you.

424
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,981
You don't have any proof.
Stop harassing me.

425
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,860
You're holding the proof now.

426
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:06,933
KO EUN-BYEOL

427
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,894
I left later because I had a lot to carry.

428
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,146
About ten after three?

429
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:16,359
I went to the supply room
and took the emergency kit,

430
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,527
so it was about fifteen after three.

431
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,198
Okay.

432
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,617
You can go.

433
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,895
How did it feel to have others

434
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,064
look at you like that?

435
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:56,983
What?

436
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,150
That is

437
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,695
what you did to my sister

438
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,406
and other students all the time.

439
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,826
How did it feel
to be on the receiving end?

440
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,831
It wasn't so bad.

441
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,084
You thought I would quiver in fear
like someone?

442
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,378
Give me a break.

443
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,923
You'll find out soon enough.

444
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,845
But I didn't touch the laptops.

445
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,101
Really?

446
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,020
Good.

447
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,440
Then you can experience

448
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,985
how it feels to be framed

449
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,070
for something you didn't do.

450
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,616
And how much it hurts

451
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,370
when you didn't do it,

452
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,998
but no one will listen

453
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,501
or believe you.

454
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,554
Hey.

455
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,188
Hey!

456
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,694
Now...

457
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,989
I don't care who you are.

458
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,243
I'll kill you.

459
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,128
I'll carry this one.

460
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,965
I can go alone.
You don't need to go with me.

461
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,219
I'm here for a month as the assisting
teacher, so I should know as well.

462
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,929
Let's go!

463
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,350
Okay.

464
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,773
You want to restore it?

465
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,859
Is there a way to find out

466
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,612
at what time it was reformatted?

467
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,074
Well, I'm not sure.

468
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,675
One looks like a hardware failure,
and the other two were reformatted.

469
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,553
If you begin both at once,
it can be done in five minutes.

470
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,222
I left later because I had a lot to carry.

471
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,391
About ten after three?

472
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,937
I went to the supply room
and took the emergency kit,

473
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,773
so it was about fifteen after three.

474
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,155
Mr. Kim.

475
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,074
Mr. Kim.

476
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,577
Yes?

477
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,662
What are you thinking about?

478
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,124
About the kids' laptops...

479
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,085
If what that guy said is true,

480
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,421
it's likely that the student
whose hardware failed

481
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,174
is the one who reformatted the others.

482
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:13,012
Well, yes. One can look at it that way.

483
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,473
What do you plan to do?

484
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:16,932
I plan...

485
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,977
to talk to the kids a little more.

486
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,149
Even after work,
you think only about the kids.

487
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,902
Your students are lucky.

488
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,946
Thank you.

489
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,035
I don't know

490
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,206
where to lead the kids.

491
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,336
And I have no right to lead the kids.

492
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,630
Yes.

493
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,757
Well, that's how I feel.

494
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,010
Why?

495
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,846
You're a teacher.

496
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,724
I...

497
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,645
don't want to be a teacher or a mentor.

498
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:06,982
I just want to be an employee.

499
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:12,738
Someone who just teaches math,
writes reports, and posts memos.

500
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,242
Some...

501
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,579
Well...

502
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,669
Would you like some more to drink?

503
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,629
Sure.

504
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,133
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

505
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,347
That's 32,000 won.

506
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,141
Here you go. Thank you.

507
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,028
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW THAT I'M GONE?
JEONG SU-IN

508
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,660
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW THAT I'M GONE?
JEONG SU-IN

509
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,836
Aren't you leaving?

510
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,630
I'm leaving.

511
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,830
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW THAT I'M GONE?
JEONG SU-IN

512
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:08,020
I had it analyzed just in case,
and it really is the same person.

513
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,022
Dad.

514
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,400
Don't be made a fool
and be smart about it.

515
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,162

Eun-byeol.

522
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,106
Aren't you going to reply?

523
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,292
Your turn!

524
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,967
-Did you do it?
-Stop it!

525
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,982
-We should do that!
-Go away!

526
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,525
What is that?

527
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,210
HANDWRITING ANALYSIS

528
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,463
It took a while, didn't it?

529
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,840
You must have been curious.

530
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,844
No.

531
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,931
You already knew.

532
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,104
So you must have been terribly anxious.

533
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:58,899
Sure.

534
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,693
Do anything and everything you can.

535
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,616
If you admit to being Lee Eun-bi,

536
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,369
I'm done for too.

537
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,163
So you choose.

538
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:18,752
We can both come clean,
hurt your precious friends, and leave.

539
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,381
Or you can transfer out quietly
by yourself.

540
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,675
Even if I leave,

541
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,010
do you think you'll be okay?

542
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,555
That's none of your business.

543
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,974
I just need you gone.

544
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,644
But I'm sorry to say

545
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,105
I can't do that.

546
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,692
You've really lost it.

547
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,237
Can you tell the others the truth?

548
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,488
Yes.

549
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,116
I'm going to leave this place

550
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,620
after I get rid of...

551
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:55,789
you.

I-an has been at it for hours, coach.

554
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,680
Hey, I-an!

555
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,724
Hey, you punk!

556
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,143
Stop right now!

557
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,148
Get out there.

558
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,108
Get out!

559
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,987
Are you training
or letting out your anger?

560
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,865
Taking care of your body is a skill too!

561
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,203
I know it's stressful,
but what can you do?

562
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,997
How we do at the competition in May
determines funding,

563
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,582
and if you do well, the seniors...

564
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,755
will be able to at least win a medal
in the relay and go to a good college.

565
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,131
Okay?

566
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,385
That means you need to hold down the fort.

567
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,179
Control your pace and stay focused.

568
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:36,973
I-an.

569
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,684
Look at me.

570
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,690
I believe in you.

571
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:46,775
Got it?

572
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,611
Yes, sir.

573
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:14,845
Here's the person
you're dying to know about.

574
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,264
Look carefully.

578
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,333
-Hello?
-I-an, Eun-byeol is missing.

579
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,586
Eun-byeol is missing!

580
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,298
How would you feel if I had a twin?

581
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,884
I would probably be confused.

Your call is being forwarded to voicemail.

585
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,085
I-an?

586
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,504
Eun-byeol came by, so they left together.

587
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,976
Wow, Eun-byeol.

588
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,520
You're all grown up
You're now even walking me home.

589
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,067
Hey! You make me even carry your bag now?

590
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,238
I'm exhausted from training
for the competition in May.

591
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,490
I trained so hard that my arm hurts.

592
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,621
You know how draining swimming is.

593
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,165
Right.

594
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,252
You're a really good swimmer.

595
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:57,382
So, don't be afraid of the water again,
and give it a try.

596
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,510
Don't fall in and scare me like last time.

597
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:05,849
Here.

598
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,519
Stop whining and you carry it.
It's so light.

599
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,354
You idiot.

600
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,482
You really don't know
why I ask you to do this?

601
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,487
Why would I run past your house
every morning

602
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,699
and let countless buses pass
until you come?

603
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,410
And call you out

604
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,455
whenever I have an hour between training?

605
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,722
I have to get back.

606
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,766
Take this.

607
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,186
Thanks, Eun-byeol.

608
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,064
Good luck with your training.

609
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,357
Thanks.

610
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,442
Later.

611
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,754
You said you would help me
get my memory back, right?

612
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,800
Okay. I'll get you your memory back.

613
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:26,262
But if you get it back thanks to me,
you need to grant me a wish.

614
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,099
Promise.

615
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,851
Promise.

616
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,067
Grant me a wish.

617
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,404
The person I am now

618
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,615
is very different
from the Ko Eun-byeol that you know.

619
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,617
But...

620
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:49,953
we're still good friends, right?

621
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,538
But you know,

622
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,750
I think I like
the new Ko Eun-byeol better.

623
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:50,472
Why weren't you at school today?

624
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,641
Were you sick?

625
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:55,727
Just...

626
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:57,896
I played hooky.

627
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,027
I-an.

628
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,112
Yes?

629
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,034
I...

630
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,413
have something

631
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,707
to tell you.

632
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,003
What is it?

633
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,885
To be honest,

634
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,972
I got my memory back

635
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,391
a while ago.

636
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,272
Really?

637
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,446
Eun-byeol,

638
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,156
do you remember?

639
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,160
You promised to grant me a wish

640
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,541
if you got your memory back.

641
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,296
You got your memory back,

642
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,507
so can I tell you my wish?

643
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,724
Whatever I ask next,

644
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:18,935
you have to say, "Yes."

645
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:24,607
You...

646
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,694
You're Ko Eun-byeol, right?

647
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,292
My wish...

648
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,836
isn't so difficult.

649
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:55,930
I'm sorry.

650
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,144
I'm so sorry.

651
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,649
Don't say sorry. Just say yes.

652
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,234
Okay?

653
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,199
Why are you doing this to me?

654
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,784
Why are you not Ko Eun-byeol?

655
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,038
Then was everything you said to me a lie?

656
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,081
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

657
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,958
Who are you?

658
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,339
Let's go.

659
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,136
Tae-gwang, let go of her.

660
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,351
I said let go.
