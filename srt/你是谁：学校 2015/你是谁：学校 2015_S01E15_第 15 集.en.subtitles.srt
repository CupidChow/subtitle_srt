1
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:21,938
Good night.

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,315
Tae-gwang.

3
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,112
Do you want me to teach you
how to make time go faster

4
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:30,864
when you're alone?

5
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,658
There's no such thing.

6
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,912
There's only one thing
that makes time fly for me.

7
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,540
-What's that?
-Being with you.

8
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,267
Hey, Tae-gwang.

9
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,561
What...

10
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,563
Hey.

11
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,149
I can't...

12
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,194
I can't hear you right now.

13
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,739
Hey.

14
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,786
If you're going to hit me, do it.

15
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,046
If you're not,

16
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,757
I can't look at you right now.

17
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,175
Go in inside.

18
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,679
Okay, bye.

19
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,353
-Hey.
-Yes?

20
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,105
Bye.

21
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,609
Okay.

22
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,901
Hey, Tae-gwang.

23
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,111
You startled me.

24
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,738
Come with me to the roof.

25
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,077
Hey! What is it?

26
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,918
Why did you need to bring us here?

27
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,753
Tae-gwang.

28
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,925
I need to tell you something
before it's too late.

29
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:38,968
What is it?

30
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,095
I was too confused

31
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,723
and didn't know how I felt,

32
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,559
so I couldn't answer your question.

33
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,896
Go ahead.

34
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,149
I realized I didn't hate Eun-bi.

35
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,944
I was angry

36
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,112
not because I hated her,

37
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,366
-but because I liked her.
-Hey, I-an.

38
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,035
I don't care what I saw

39
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,162
or what I heard.

40
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,041
-Hey.
-I don't care what you say either.

41
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,925
So? What do you want?

42
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,510
I am saying it's not over yet.

43
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:22,845
Hey, I-an.

44
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,098
It was like that from the start for me.

45
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,559
I didn't care about anything

46
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,312
but Eun-bi.

47
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,066
So, what I'm saying is...

48
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,862
I'm just beginning.

49
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,497
Mr. Kim.

50
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,584
You were acquitted of that case.

51
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,046
Why do you insist on resigning?

52
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,634
The school is only docking
three-months' pay.

53
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,764
I don't think
I can teach the kids anymore.

54
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,268
The semester isn't over yet,

55
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,520
but I'm sorry, sir.

56
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,732
I guess we have no choice.

57
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,944
Please stay on until we find a replacement

58
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,990
and make sure the kids aren't affected.

59
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,535
Yes, sir.

60
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,579
Thank you for everything.

61
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,961
Sir.

62
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,422
This is Sam Hammington.

63
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,508
He's the native English-speaking
teaching assistant.

64
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,810
I can speak Korean.

65
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,520
Speak comfortably.

66
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,440
He's from Australia,
but his Korean is excellent.

67
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,027
You should have said so.

68
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,946
Anyway, thank you.

69
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,782
Take good care of him.

70
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,866
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,702
-You can go.
-Yes, sir.

72
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,084
Where have I seen him before?

73
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,504
Okay, listen carefully to the teacher,

74
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:24,217
and even if you don't understand,
give it your best shot.

75
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,276
Why do you care about that?

76
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,033
DIA? DIC?

77
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,827
DIA? DIC?: DID I ASK? DO I CARE?

78
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,245
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

79
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,579
Awesome.

80
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,041
Are you kidding me?

81
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,419
It's like we are in Itaewon.

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,923
Gosh, I am sorry.

83
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,141
Tae-gwang.

84
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,771
Damn it.

85
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,566
-What?
-You seem disappointed.

86
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,317
Go away.

87
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,530
I wanted to ask you something,
but you answered it already.

88
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:28,990
Damn it.

89
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,242
What? What answer are you talking about?

90
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,620
That Kong Tae-gwang likes Eun-bi.

91
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,292
Why do you look surprised?

92
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,586
You went to Tongyeong after seeing me.

93
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:42,879
It's obvious.

94
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,341
-But you...
-What?

95
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,635
-Why are you staring at me?
-Because I'm angry.

96
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,682
Imagine someone like you
is following your little sister around.

97
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,644
-What about me?
-Anyway,

98
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,730
I know how you feel,

99
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,357
but what about Eun-bi?

100
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,902
Does she like you too?

101
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,785
Thank you.

102
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,123
Have a nice day. Please come again.

103
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,128
You're better than I am.

104
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,881
I was the queen of part-time jobs
in Tongyeong.

105
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,966
Is that right?

106
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,763
You'll help out here
until you find a new school?

107
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,474
What if you fall behind?

108
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,894
Actually, I was thinking
of taking prep classes.

109
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,522
-May I?
-What do you mean?

110
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,523
Of course, you should.

111
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,192
I'll look into classes for you.

112
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,155
I got this one.

113
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,490
Hello.

114
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,078
Are you looking
for anything in particular?

115
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,791
KONG TAE-GWANG

116
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,922
What's up, Tae-gwang?

117
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,547
Hey.

118
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,760
What did you want to talk about?

119
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,641
-About last night, I'm sure you were--
-Tae-gwang.

120
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,018
What?

121
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,479
I don't know,

122
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,317
so don't ask me anything.

123
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,323
Good.

124
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,201
You didn't apologize, so I won't either.

125
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,300
Hey.

126
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,594
You know, you're blushing.

127
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,096
I am not!

128
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,609
Try this.

129
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,736
-What is it?
-Who is it this time?

130
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,613
It's okay. I think it's cucumber.

131
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,198
Don't you know I can't eat cucumbers?

132
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,241
I feel sick.

133
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,417
I am losing my appetite all of sudden.

134
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:19,428
No one compares to me
when it comes to having a thick skin.

135
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,682
But I am not even close to So-yeong.

136
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,563
My Hae-na is tough and chic

137
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,273
while she's just a criminal.

138
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,528
Look at her just sitting there
and listening to us.

139
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,947
I wouldn't be able to sit there.

140
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,196
Hey, Eun-byeol.

141
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,991
You think I'll just crumble like this,
don't you?

142
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,121
I know you and Eun-bi are both alive
and toying with the other kids.

143
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,290
Do you think you'll be safe?

144
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,835
So-yeong.

145
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,338
Look in the mirror.

146
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,299
Look at your face.

147
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,634
And if you have time,

148
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,179
look into your heart too.

149
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,599
-What?
-Acting tough and screaming

150
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,267
doesn't hide it.

151
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,644
I know from my experience.

152
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,938
You want to erase everything

153
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,274
and run away like crazy

154
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:56,901
on the inside.

155
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,982
Dad, would you like some tea?

156
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:37,983
No, thanks.

157
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,986
-Then some fruit--
-No.

158
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:52,957
Dad.

159
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,876
You know that kid in my class...

160
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,586
In one of Shakespeare's plays,

161
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,547
there is a saying

162
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,175
that a weed is allowed to grow
and spread out

163
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,178
because the wind is too gentle.

164
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:07,888
Excuse me?

165
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:12,434
Being mild and lukewarm
only allows weeds to grow out of control.

166
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,605
If you don't want to be trampled on,

167
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,441
you must trample on them first.

168
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,616
-No, I want to just transfer out.
-Don't you know I'm up for nomination?

169
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,954
I'm already on edge
because of your problem.

170
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,584
So stop saying stupid stuff
and stay quiet.

171
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,045
Or trample on her and silence her.

172
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,798
Do one or the other.

173
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,729
Hey, Eun-bi!

174
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,317
Eun-bi!

175
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,915
Your cell phone.

176
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,166
What?

177
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,168
Give me your phone.

178
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,636
I thought we agreed
to be comfortable with each other.

179
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,056
-I-an.
-Hey.

180
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,725
We can't be comfortable
if I don't have your number

181
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,852
since it will be too difficult to meet up.

182
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,316
Did you sleep well?

183
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,068
Did you look into prep classes?

184
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,280
What prep classes?

185
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,116
I need to keep up with class
before I transfer.

186
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,618
I need to go register later.

187
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,161
Really?

188
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,039
-Should I go with you?
-What?

189
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,333
You can't.

190
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,169
What? It's not "no," it's I "can't"?

191
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,214
Are you...

192
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,842
going together?

193
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,302
What?

194
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,596
Yes.

195
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:14,848
I see.

196
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,768
Good.

197
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,813
I was thinking of skipping training
for an hour.

198
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,774
You're training hard?

199
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,067
Of course.

200
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,445
Eun-bi.

201
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,951
Take responsibility for what you said
until I win a gold medal.

202
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,955
What do you mean?

203
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,587
Just.

204
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,840
Hurry up. We'll be late.

205
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,098
You're here.

206
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,933
Look.

207
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,893
-Look at this.
-It's so hot.

208
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,437
Why are you late?

209
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,397
-Get out of the way.
-Hey!

210
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,606
Stop!

211
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,863
I did it to you first.

212
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,782
Guys, I have an announcement.

213
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,535
I think Mr. Kim

214
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,496
is leaving the school.

215
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,207
What? Why?

216
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,792
-Why?
-Why?

217
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,085
-Why?
-Out of the blue?

218
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,253
Keep it down.

219
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,089
Is it because of Jeong Su-in's case?

220
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,762
Right, he was her class teacher last year.

221
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,929
Is that why?

222
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,349
When is his last day?

223
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,770
I heard them say
until they find a replacement.

224
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,356
We're getting a new teacher mid-semester?

225
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,274
I know.

226
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,736
Are we...

227
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,363
going to just let him go?

228
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,683
What did you text your teacher? "Rooftop"?

229
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,479
I texted "Rooftop, sir."
Not just "Rooftop."

230
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,649
What is it?

231
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,319
Are you leaving the school?

232
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,826
Tae-gwang.

233
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,664
Do you know who inspired me
to become a teacher?

234
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,124
Who?

235
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
My class teacher when I was a junior.

236
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,590
He was a passionate teacher
who went to the suburbs

237
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,969
looking for a runaway student.

238
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,764
I keep a safe distance from my students.
I can't even compare to him.

239
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,850
That's cool.

240
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,811
You should learn
from a great teacher like that.

241
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,524
Do you know who that was?

242
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,362
Your father.

243
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,494
I saw Director Kong.
He asked me to look after you.

244
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,748
Forget being a good teacher like him.

245
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,459
I don't know if I'm even
a decent human being.

246
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,341
That's why I'm quitting,
so I can take time to think.

247
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,094
Darn it.

248
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,680
Then what about me?

249
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,647
You can just call me.

250
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,149
Any time.

251
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,322
Stop that. It doesn't suit you.

252
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,074
Come on. Tell me.

253
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,118
My car was perfectly fine.
How did this happen?

254
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,077
My goodness.

255
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,370
Look here.

256
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,499
You parked in front of my store,
so I called to ask you to move it.

257
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,585
I told you, I didn't do it.

258
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,712
If not you, then who?

259
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,339
Let's talk at the station.

260
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,507
-Let go of me.
-Let's go to the police station.

261
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,051
-Let go--
-Come with me.

262
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,554
-Hey, I-an. Don't do this.
-Who are you?

263
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,350
I-an!

264
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,393
I-an!

265
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,520
Hey! Let go!

266
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,647
Stop it!

267
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,774
Don't do this. Go inside, come on.

268
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,654
The holding cells?

269
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,031
Go to the detention facility
on the first floor.

270
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,913
I refuse to settle.

271
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,165
Get on your knees and beg for forgiveness.

272
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,333
I'll think about it then.

273
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,002
I-an, sit down.

274
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,586
Sit.

275
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,090
Look here, young man.

276
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,385
Let's just settle and end it nicely.

277
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,470
You did nothing right either.

278
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,223
See? Why would I settle with you?

279
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,101
Keep it down, both of you.

280
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,290
Why are you just leaving?
You should see your dad.

281
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,418
It's okay.

282
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,214
Director Kong is doing well,
so don't worry too much.

283
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,842
Please take good care of him.

284
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,219
I will.

285
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:46,907
May I...

286
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,911
get in on that dinner?

287
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,746
I'm in his class.

288
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,584
My name is Kong Tae-gwang,
Director Kong Jae-ho.

289
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,802
Is your shoulder okay?

290
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,178
Does it hurt anywhere?

291
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,263
I'm fine,

292
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,057
but doesn't it hurt here?

293
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,309
I'm fine.

294
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,436
Let's go.

295
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,492
What?

296
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,244
KONG TAE-GWANG

297
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,495
You are going to the same school.

298
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,164
Is he a friend of yours?

299
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,793
Yes.

300
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,714
-Hello.
-Hi.

301
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,384
Hold on.

302
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:54,307
Hey, you're really good looking.

303
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,059
Have you eaten?

304
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,770
-No.
-Good.

305
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,939
-We're going to eat now. Come with us.
-Excuse me?

306
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,321
-I'm fine.
-What do you mean you're fine?

307
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,781
Just come eat with us.

308
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,491
I-an, let's go eat.

309
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,243
Let's go eat. I am starving.

310
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,454
Let's go.

311
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,001
I dropped my phone.

312
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,711
Did you back up your data?

313
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,588
No. Please do it for me.

314
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,298
Will it take long?

315
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,633
It depends.

316
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,635
Do you have many photos and videos?

317
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:34,806
I have quite a bit of photos
and just a few videos...

318
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:42,189
Recover all the data, please.
Every last bit.

319
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,414
Gosh, you...

320
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,460
You're a man. Don't pick at your food.

321
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,961
Put it in here, like this.

322
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,505
-Yes, sir.
-Eat up.

323
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,637
Good boy. You're eating so well.

324
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,307
Do you want another bowl?
You need energy to fight more.

325
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,934
Come on, Dad.

326
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,355
I've never done anything for you,

327
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,483
but you jumped in
just because I'm your dad.

328
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,111
Thank you, son.

329
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,866
Still, you're an athlete,
and you're injured.

330
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,244
You shouldn't have done that.

331
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,704
You do that again,
and you'll have to answer to me.

332
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,289
I don't care if I get in trouble.

333
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,083
If it happens again, I'll do it again.

334
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,334
What?

335
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,379
You brat.

336
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,429
Right.

337
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,349
Why were you at the police station?

338
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,559
Did you do something?

339
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,064
That's what normally happens, but not...

340
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,152
today.

341
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,532
Okay. Eat up.

342
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,124
-Thank you.
-Sure.

343
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,917
-Come over sometime.
-Yes, sir.

344
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,420
Bye.

345
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,465
-Dad.
-Yes?

346
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,301
-Give me a minute.
-Sure.

347
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,929
Hey, Tae-gwang.

348
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,682
What?

349
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,477
You want to ask how Eun-bi is doing again?

350
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,272
Are you okay?

351
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,190
What do you mean?

352
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,900
You.

353
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,361
Are you okay?

354
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,782
Me? Of course, I'm okay.

355
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,117
-Hey.
-What?

356
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,536
I told you. This is just the beginning.

357
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,872
That again?

358
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,708
It's no fun because
you look defeated already.

359
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,668
So...

360
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,130
keep your head up.

361
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,426
Later.

362
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,833
LEGAL GUARDIAN

363
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,678
DAD

364
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,931
"Dad."

365
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,518
"Dad"?

366
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm home.

367
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,073
Hi.

368
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,118
How was the prep class? Did you like it?

369
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,369
Yes, I do.

370
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,746
-Where is Eun-byeol?
-In the room.

371
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,415
Eun-bi.

372
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,084
I decided on your new school.

373
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,710
You did?

374
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,382
Here.

375
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,009
SEUNGRI HIGH SCHOOL

376
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,683
Eun-byeol.

377
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,186
Isn't it uncomfortable
sharing a bed with me?

378
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,688
No way.

379
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,066
One of the things I wanted to do with you

380
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,736
was talking in bed with you like this.

381
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,530
-Really?
-Yes, really.

382
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,909
You know...

383
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,788
Mom chose a new school for me.

384
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,749
Really?

385
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,085
You really don't want to go

386
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,045
to Sekang with me?

387
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,006
No.

388
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,134
But I want

389
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,928
to apologize to everyone for lying to them

390
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,556
before I leave.

391
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,727
But that would make things
awkward for you, right?

392
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,228
No.

393
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,274
I can play hooky all day
while you're in school.

394
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:38,985
By the way,

395
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,197
sorry for moving your doll without asking.

396
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,450
Who gave it to you anyway?

397
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,743
What?

398
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,829
I-an.

399
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,708
He didn't know I wasn't you back then.

400
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,460
If he thought you were me,

401
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,629
he wouldn't have bought you a doll.

402
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,756
He knows he would get it.

403
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,052
I-an knows that you don't like dolls?

404
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,428
Of course.

405
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,140
Let's go to sleep.

406
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,246
Luckily, we were able to save
70% of the data.

407
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,169
Ko Eun-byeol.

408
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,213
Lee Eun-bi.

409
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:47,178
Let's see how long you can walk proudly
with your head held up high.

410
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,350
Hey, I have big news.

411
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,687
Director Kong's son attends our school.

412
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,730
-What?
-Really?

413
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,731
What grade is he in?

414
00:30:59,107 --> 00:30:59,941
I don't know.

415
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,193
Director Kong got recently arrested.

416
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,946
How must he feel?

417
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,242
His dad's name is all over the news...

418
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,619
Kong Jae-ho.

419
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,454
-Kong?
-"Kong"?

420
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,706
-Kong?
-Him?

421
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,003
-No way.
-No. There's no way.

422
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,381
Then what? He's Song Hui-yeong's son?

423
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,135
Anyway, isn't the director
totally two-faced?

424
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,638
He used to act so self-righteous
in his interviews.

425
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,056
Exactly. What a fake.

426
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,351
-A total fake.
-I don't think so.

427
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,561
Hey, Tae-gwang.

428
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,067
-What?
-Where are you going?

429
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,778
The bathroom.

430
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,078
My goodness,
I thought he was gonna do something.

431
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,289
He was about to do something.

432
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,457
I think I'm traumatized.

433
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,878
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LAW AND ORDER

434
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,173
What is it? You seem so happy.

435
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,636
What are you smiling at?

436
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,304
It's a letter from my son.

437
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,390
-He came in first again.
-He did?

438
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,560
I don't know how a loser like me
had a son like him.

439
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,564
I feel so bad, I want to remove him
from my family registry for him.

440
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,608
-Are you bragging right now?
-Yes.

441
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,610
I truly hate you.

442
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,321
I thought I would be
the happiest person on earth

443
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,407
if you were to lose everything.

444
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,537
But even when I have this in my hand,

445
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,749
I can't do anything.

446
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,667
Why is that?

447
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,088
Do you know why, Dad?

448
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,318
Are you reading again?

449
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,945
Can't you tell?

450
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,331
Do you remember?

451
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,459
Long time ago,

452
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,546
I would sit next to you
and wait all day like this

453
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,047
for you to finish reading.

454
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,718
After playing ball,
you would ask, "Are you done yet?"

455
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,762
After playing marbles. "Are you done yet?"

456
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,515
You bugged me so much.

457
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,518
Do you know how bored I was?

458
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,229
You stayed
even though I told you to leave.

459
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,317
Because I didn't want to leave.

460
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,073
You were shorter than me,
and didn't study well.

461
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,118
You would get scared and tear up
whenever I screamed.

462
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,996
What happened to that little I-an?

463
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,332
Yes, everything you said is true.

464
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,545
"We've already grown,

465
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,089
and many things have changed."

466
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,425
Right?

467
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,472
Hey, Eun-byeol.

468
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,641
You know...

469
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,351
What?

470
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,104
Say it.

471
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,993
I'm going training.

472
00:34:55,885 --> 00:35:01,140
JEONG SU-IN
WE WILL REMEMBER YOU FOREVER

473
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,563
Su-in.

474
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,901
I'm sorry for coming so late.

475
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,071
I'm sorry for ignoring you

476
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,406
that time.

477
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,576
But may I come

478
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,371
see you sometimes

479
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,166
since I'm your friend?

480
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,883
I heard you're leaving the school.

481
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,470
Yes.

482
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,598
I don't think I belong there.

483
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,685
What will you do then?

484
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,192
I need to become a person

485
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,320
who belongs there.

486
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,672
First off,

487
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,260
I'm sorry to leave so suddenly like this.

488
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,930
And for not staying with you
until the end.

489
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,516
I'm sad too.

490
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,314
Let me give you one final word of advice.

491
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,402
You might feel that some days

492
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,698
are very difficult and lonely,

493
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,284
and confusing for you.

494
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,120
But...

495
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,581
it's okay.

496
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,584
Because...

497
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,296
you are only 18 years old.

498
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,023
That will be all.

499
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,693
Attention.

500
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,366
Thank you, sir.

501
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,662
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

502
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,418
I shouldn't be ashamed of making mistakes.

503
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:21,007
I should be ashamed of denying
that I made mistakes.

504
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,385
I'll always remember what you said.

505
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,471
-Mr. Kim!
-Mr. Kim!

506
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,516
-No!
-Don't go!

507
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,436
-Goodbye!
-Take care!

508
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,022
-Don't go!
-Don't go!

509
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,440
-Don't go.
-We love you!

510
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,401
-We'll miss you.
-Make sure to eat well!

511
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,112
Thank you for putting me
onto the right path

512
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,655
instead of the easy path.

513
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,116
I'll see you on TV.

514
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,327
I'll come find you
after I become a big celebrity.

515
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,203
You just wait a little while more.

516
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,664
-Mr. Kim!
-We love you!

517
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,707
Mr. Kim!

518
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,126
Sir, I love you.

519
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,004
Sir, come visit!

520
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,547
Gi-tae says he'll buy snacks!

521
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,175
-Come back!
-We'll listen to you!

522
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,053
-Don't go!
-Come back!

523
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,847
I paid attention in math class
because of you!

524
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,765
I'm sorry!

525
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,392
Goodbye!

526
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,729
-We love you!
-Bye!

527
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,154
Being serious doesn't suit you.

528
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,449
I can call you Jun-seok now, right?

529
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,396
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

530
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,855
What's this?

531
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,524
Eun-byeol.

532
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,776
I kept my promise.

533
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,281
When we were kids,

534
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,577
I promised to give you my first gold medal
from a national competition.

535
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,829
You did?

536
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,415
What a good boy.

537
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,208
You remembered that?

538
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,718
But Eun-byeol.

539
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:33,973
I...

540
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,560
came to say goodbye.

541
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:39,895
To me?

542
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,272
No.

543
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,192
To my...

544
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,820
ten-year-long crush.

545
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,030
Hey.

546
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,908
Then you can end your crush on your own.

547
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,289
Everyone may scoff saying,

548
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,916
"What does an eight-year-old know?"

549
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,587
But ever since back then,

550
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,923
I've liked you.

551
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,135
I-an.

552
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,013
I'm not the little girl
that you used to know.

553
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,891
We've grown so much

554
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,560
and many things have changed.

555
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,151
I can't say I've never questioned

556
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,779
whether you were just a friend or more.

557
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,406
I know

558
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,159
that you thought about it.

559
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,622
That's why I waited for so long

560
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,249
and had held onto hope.

561
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,420
But Eun-byeol,

562
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,465
before your head questions it,

563
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,259
your heart...

564
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,596
already knows.

565
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,516
Is that right?

566
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,479
I-an.

567
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,067
Once time has passed,

568
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,863
I may think I had liked you a lot.

569
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,743
I may regret it

570
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,621
and wonder why I didn't realize it sooner.

571
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,961
Even if one day I am saddened that you,

572
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,880
who only looked at me for ten years,

573
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,050
are no longer next to me...

574
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,932
I have to deal with that.

575
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,184
So you should follow your heart.

576
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,980
Hey, Eun-byeol.

577
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,608
I'm breaking up with my crush.

578
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,194
I'm not saying I won't see you again.

579
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,030
Of course not.

580
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,782
Am I crazy?

581
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,035
Why wouldn't I see someone
so easy to order around?

582
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,370
-Hey.
-What?

583
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,290
Forget it.

584
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,541
Get off.

585
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,337
Is your shoulder okay?

586
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,716
It's not this shoulder.

587
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,092
Do you want to die?

588
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,307
I don't know if you'll believe me,

589
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,893
but I'm going to school
and not causing troubles.

590
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,355
Good.

591
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,858
Maybe it's because
I have a lot of time to think,

592
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,821
but I keep thinking
maybe you would have been fine

593
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,409
if I had left you alone.

594
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,994
And that maybe I'm the reason
you couldn't settle down.

595
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:06,954
Come on.

596
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,456
I wasn't trying to get you to say that.

597
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,959
I meant that you don't need
to worry about me.

598
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,673
That tie looks good on you.

599
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:25,806
This...

600
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,684
was a gift from Mom.

601
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,562
I see.

602
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,814
You may not believe this either,

603
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,525
but the house feels empty

604
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,237
without you.

605
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,035
I'm embarrassed to show myself like this.

606
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,209
I used to be embarrassed of you.

607
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:57,880
But now,

608
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,841
I'm glad I was wrong.

609
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,056
Tae-gwang.

610
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:13,437
I thought I had a lot to protect,

611
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,773
but I realized in the end

612
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,360
that I had only one thing

613
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,363
that I needed to protect.

614
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,912
That was you, Tae-gwang.

615
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,041
Your visitation time is up.

616
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,588
Spending even three minutes with you
used to be hard.

617
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,757
But time just flew today.

618
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,224
I'll come again,

619
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,727
Dad.

620
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,109
Okay.

621
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,628
Tae-gwang.

622
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,758
I thought I had a lot to protect,

623
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,970
but I realized in the end

624
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,723
that I had only one thing

625
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,601
that I needed to protect.

626
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,314
That was you, Tae-gwang.

627
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,605
I-an.

628
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,064
Are you returning from your prep class?

629
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:22,941
Yes.

630
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,485
You haven't been going out to exercise
in the morning.

631
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,529
Yes.

632
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,615
I've been sleeping in.

633
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,868
I've been waiting.

634
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,954
I...

635
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,040
can wait

636
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,250
much longer.

637
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,798
I need to get off.

638
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,929
Should we get off together?

639
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,517
Or do you want to go together
a little longer?

640
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,211
I'm going to school tomorrow

641
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,380
to say my final goodbyes.

642
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,175
So...

643
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,929
you really are going to another school?

644
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,555
Yes.

645
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,976
Tomorrow,

646
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,689
I get to leave the name
Ko Eun-byeol for good.

647
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,274
I don't like this talk

648
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,735
about it being final,

649
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,656
but I'm happy for you.

650
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,786
You need to start afresh.

651
00:49:58,995 --> 00:49:59,830
Yes.

652
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,336
I've gained a lot of things without trying

653
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,341
while living as my sister.

654
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,301
Like what?

655
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:18,181
Love from my mom, Mr. Kim, and my friends.

656
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,061
Just because my name was Ko Eun-byeol,

657
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,565
you...

658
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,192
liked me too.

659
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,705
Do you remember this place?

660
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,415
Of course.

661
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,208
We came here often.

662
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,334
We did.

663
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,628
But...

664
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,256
this is the first time I'm here

665
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,259
with Lee Eun-bi.

666
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,602
The first meal with Eun-bi.

667
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,022
The first song I listen to with Eun-bi.

668
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,697
From now on,

669
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,033
everything will be like that.

670
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,703
So...

671
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,831
So we can start over.

672
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,584
Can't you not go?

673
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,260
Hey, I-an!

674
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,013
I...

675
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,140
can't go to you.

676
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,351
I can't go to you,

677
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,394
so...

678
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,980
can't you come to me?

679
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,150
Or...

680
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,403
may I go to you again

681
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,781
like that time

682
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,033
you called out to me?

683
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,973
Hey, Tae-gwang.

684
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,066
What are you doing?

685
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,528
It really is you, Eun-bi.

686
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,197
What's going on?

687
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:26,161
I came to say my final goodbyes.

688
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,163
I asked my sister for a favor.

689
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,000
Go ahead.

690
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,169
You couldn't go
farther than Tongyeong anyway.

691
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,588
Let's go.

692
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,302
Hey.

693
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,728
Do you want to eat noodles?

694
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,068
It will be summer vacation soon.

695
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,278
What are you going to do?

696
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,114
-Study.
-Forget that.

697
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,407
Let's take a trip together.

698
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,701
-Yes? Doesn't it sound great?
-Yes!

699
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,495
-Deal?
-Deal?

700
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,456
Deal? Why aren't you saying anything?

701
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,125
-What? You're going to study alone?
-Really?

702
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,961
-Answer me.
-Let's go.

703
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,089
-Okay.
-Let's go!

704
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,423
-Let's go.
-She said yes.

705
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,800
-You said you'll go.
-You said it.

706
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,803
You make kimbap, and I'll make sushi.

707
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,471
-What will you make?
-Jokbal.

708
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,473
-Jokbal? It sounds good.
-Jokbal.

709
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,809
-That will so delicious.
-Where should we go?

710
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,394
-Where should we go?
-Where should we go?

711
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,479
-I say the beach.
-Do you want to go anywhere?

712
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,407
Hey, Eun-byeol.

713
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,492
You must be busy.

714
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,453
What are you doing
while Eun-bi is in school?

715
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,663
So-yeong.

716
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,123
What is it?

717
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,625
Are you bored without me?

718
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,627
Yes, I'm bored.

719
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,674
So, I've prepared a little event.

720
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,260
Do you want to come watch?

721
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,515
Sorry, I don't have
that much time on my hands.

722
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,142
What a shame.

723
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:17,814
I have an incredible video
that I shot in Tongyeong.

724
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,778
Guess who's the main character?

725
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,515
Let's go.

726
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,529
Well...

727
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,573
guys.

728
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,043
Eun-byeol, what are you doing there?

729
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,628
What? Are you going to sing?

730
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,091
-I guess not. Let's go.
-I guess not.

731
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,370
I...

732
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,416
have something to tell you guys.

733
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,505
What is it?

734
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,142

735
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,559

736
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,440
I told you.

737
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,650
Lee Eun-bi from Tongyeong...

738
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,320
wasn't dead.
