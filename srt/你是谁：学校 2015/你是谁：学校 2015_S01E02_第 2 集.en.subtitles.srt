1
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,766
It's been exactly ten days...

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,101
KO EUN-BYEOL'S MOTHER
SONG MI-GYEONG

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,561
...since I last saw my daughter.

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,067
"Bye, Mom. I'll be back soon."

5
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,528
That's what she said,

6
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,240
but she hasn't come back yet.

7
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,291
How can I go home alone?

8
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,585
I can't bear to see

9
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,838
my daughter's empty room.

10
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,844
I'm positive that Eun-byeol is alright.

11
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,014
Of course, she has to be.

12
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,018
I will find my daughter

13
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,605
and take her home with me hand-in-hand.

14
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,716
"Magical things happened
to Sara every day."

15
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,136
Director!

16
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,097
SARA...

17
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,058
"No matter what happens,

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,727
I know for sure that

19
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,272
there is someone who cares about me.

20
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,776
I am not a bit sad

21
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,529
or lonely anymore."

22
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,662
Please, take a look. Here.

23
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,206
Please, take a look and let me know.

24
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,084
Ma'am, please.

25
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,254
This is my daughter.
Please call me if you see her.

26
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,547
Thank you.

27
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,257
This is my daughter...

28
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,432
Mister. Mister, please.

29
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,893
Don't just throw it out.

30
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,478
Please look at her face.

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,064
-Please? This is my daughter.
-Hold on.

32
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,359
Thank you. Thank you so much.

33
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,884
MISSING PERSON
NAME: KO EUN-BYEOL

34
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,137
HEIGHT: 166CM
WEIGHT: 45KG

35
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,431
Stop smiling,

36
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,309
you brat.

37
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,025
Where are you?

38
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,862
I'm so worried.

39
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,367
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,414
It's all my fault.

41
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,584
Eun-byeol.

42
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,880
You'll come back to me, won't you?

43
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,678
I'm going crazy.

44
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,892
I can't handle it!

45
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,582
Hello?

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,584
Yes.

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,795
That's right.

48
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,601
Thank you.

49
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,731
Thank you, so much.

50
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,131
Are you awake?

51
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,137
It's Mom.

52
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,225
Mom?

53
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,896
Yes.

54
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,858
Do you recognize me?

55
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,534
Mom?

56
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,830
Mom.

57
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,707
Yes.

58
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,586
Mom.

59
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,090
Mom.

60
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,635
It's okay.

61
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,304
It's okay.

62
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,598
Don't worry about a thing.

63
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,476
Mommy is here.

64
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,937
It's okay.

65
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,237
MEDICAL OFFICE

66
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,536
She has amnesia
caused by her injuries and stress.

67
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,496
It may be temporary

68
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,998
or she may never regain her memory,

69
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,794
so I can't really give you a time frame.

70
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,176
I'll get the car. Wait right here.

71
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,261
Okay.

72
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,028
I heard you ran away from home
after being expelled.

73
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,114
I guess you had nowhere else to go.

74
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,492
See?

75
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,539
No one will talk to
and play with you but me, right?

76
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,880
What? You don't care now
that you've been expelled?

77
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,007
Who are you?

78
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,512
Wow. Now you're acting?

79
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,224
You don't remember?

80
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,603
Then I'll make you remember.

81
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,649
-What are you doing?
-What is she...

82
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,902
Oh my gosh. Hey.

83
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,782
Are you okay?

84
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,826
What's going on?

85
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,455
She attacked me out of the blue.

86
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,084
Who are you?
Why would you do something like that?

87
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,670
Get back to your business.

88
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,007
Who are you to butt into our business?

89
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,592
I'm her mom.

90
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,053
How dare you touch my daughter?

91
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,555
I won't forgive you.

92
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,974
Stay right there. I'm calling the police.

93
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,060
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,439
I must have mistaken her for someone else.

95
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,609
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,868
Are you okay?

97
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,162
Let's go.

98
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,520
Do you want to listen to some music?

99
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,316
TEN DAYS AGO, FIELD TRIP

100
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,651
Why are you here during a competition?

101
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,988
Is the school trip boring?

102
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,825
Or are you not happy that I came?

103
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,910
-Both.
-Hey.

104
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,788
The resort food must have sucked.

105
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,874
You get irritated when you're hungry.

106
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,709
Stop your nonsense and just go.

107
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,965
Guess.

108
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,176
Why do you think I'm here?

109
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,891
A promise I made seven years ago.

110
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,853
I don't remember and I don't care either.

111
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,481
May I go now?

112
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,694
What now?

113
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,365
Leave me alone, please!

114
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,035
Why does that sound like

115
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,454
"Please don't leave me alone"

116
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,999
to me?

117
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,882
I have a game tomorrow, so...

118
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,095
just hit me right here. Hit me.

119
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,014
I'll let you hit me until you feel better.

120
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,728
This is a rare opportunity.

121
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:29,980
Hit me.

122
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:33,984
I'm so sick of it.

123
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,696
I'm so sick of everything.

124
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,374
What is this?

125
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,796
What is it?

126
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,641
I-an.

127
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,601
Look.

128
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,355
I'm not the little girl
that you used to know.

129
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,774
We've grown so much

130
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,944
and many things have changed.

131
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,574
There is nothing you can do for me...

132
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,410
anymore.

133
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,485
You don't even greet your seniors anymore?

134
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,448
Since you won the gold
and set a new record,

135
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,658
it's easy for you to look down on us.

136
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,037
But why did you do that during the 100m?

137
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,747
It was in the papers.

138
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,041
"Marine Boy fears the water."

139
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,751
Wow. Marine Boy.

140
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,711
It's not like that.

141
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,426
What was that look?

142
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,225
You seem to have a lot to say.

143
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,519
Go ahead.

144
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,312
Go ahead.

145
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,274
-I have nothing to say.
-Look at you.

146
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,735
Lower your eyes.

147
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,364
Don't push my buttons!
I'm not in the mood to put up with you.

148
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,448
Why you little...

149
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,786
I told you that
I don't want to put up with you!

150
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,288
Hey! You punks!

151
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,416
What are you doing? Hey!

152
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,169
What are you doing?

153
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,088
Look at these punks.

154
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,426
Was training too lax?
You have the energy to fight?

155
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,678
Sorry.

156
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,973
Run to the pool in 30 seconds. Now.

157
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,641
-Yes, Sir.
-Run.

158
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,814
Why aren't you running?

159
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,444
I hate

160
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,781
punks who are arrogant
just because they're talented!

161
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,992
If you're going to be like this,
just quit!

162
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,388
Awesome shot.

163
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,981
Kong Tae-gwang!

164
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,233
It's dangerous! Come back up!

165
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,945
If you had let me go out when I asked you,

166
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,697
this would never have happened.

167
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,240
Gosh!

168
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,079
So,

169
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,998
if I die, whose fault is it?

170
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,376
Please! Tae-gwang! I'm sorry!

171
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,295
I messed up, so please stop!

172
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,880
Whose fault is it if I die?

173
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,435
Mine.
It's my fault for not letting you go out.

174
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,353
Happy?

175
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,772
-But you know...
-What?

176
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,607
What's the point in taking the blame
after I die?

177
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,734
Should I just date you

178
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,028
while I'm still alive?

179
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:47,988
What?

180
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,250
Hi, Eun-byeol!

181
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,628
It's cool seeing you like this.

182
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,590
That brat.

183
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,219
You never say hi back to me.

184
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,181
Don't you know how to give and take?

185
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,269
Tae-gwang!

186
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,069
-Oh my gosh.
-What are you doing?

187
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,321
You almost gave me a heart attack.

188
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,034
He scared me, too.

189
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,428
You risked your life to escape
just so you could have a burger?

190
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,804
Are you crazy?

191
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,305
I risked my life.

192
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,266
I need to have at least three.

193
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,352
Idiot.

194
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,313
Here. Eat up.

195
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,203
-Kongtae.
-Yes?

196
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,248
How will you support yourself
when you're older?

197
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,211
It's so funny
that you're worried about someone else.

198
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,546
It's really funny.

199
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,882
Is this how my mom feels when she sees me?

200
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,760
Eat slowly, okay?

201
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,971
I'd like to keep you company
until you're done,

202
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,142
but even I who live
for people's attention, can't handle this.

203
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,394
Hey.

204
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,981
-What?
-Eun-byeol is here at this hospital.

205
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,692
Why are you only telling me that now?

206
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,695
Because I just remembered!

207
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,076
Geez.

208
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,583
I-an, Eun-byeol is in Seoul.

209
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,585
I'll wait for you outside
Hankuk University Hospital.

210
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,094
I-an!

211
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,639
Hey, I-an! Han I-an!

212
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,563
Idiot.

213
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,857
What if he gets injured again?

214
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,237
Excuse me, where is the annex building?

215
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,780
It's at the end of the hall.

216
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,255
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

217
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,009
Geez...

218
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,554
Thank you.

219
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,747
Are you getting on?

220
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,930
What floor?

221
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,608
I...

222
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,660
Hey!

223
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,500
Hey, Ko Eun-byeol!

224
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,090
I-an. I'm not the little girl
that you used to know.

225
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,384
We've grown so much

226
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,013
and many things have changed.

227
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,977
If it's your choice to take a step back,

228
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,647
it's my choice to take a step forward.

229
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,361
Fine, we've grown so much
and many things have changed.

230
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,280
So, what?

231
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,201
You have the wrong person.

232
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,461
It's okay now since you're back,
Eun-byeol.

233
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,714
Who are you?

234
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,217
What? "Who are you?"

235
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,844
Are you joking? It's not funny.

236
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,471
Please let go first.

237
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,889
"Please?"

238
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,891
You know how to say things like that?

239
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,768
You're completely out of it.

240
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,936
Hey.

241
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,775
Please go back to normal, okay?

242
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,777
Please, let go of me!

243
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,154
-Nothing? Not even me?
-Not even me?

244
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,033
I don't even remember my own name.

245
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,452
Wow.

246
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,248
Thanks for coming.

247
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,125
We must have been really close.

248
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,626
-No.
-No.

249
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,133
I'm in the middle of training,
so I need to go.

250
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,719
I think I have other plans.

251
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,179
Let's walk to the bus stop together.

252
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,473
Eun-byeol, I'll come again.

253
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,268
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

254
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,198
When you get your memory back, you tell me

255
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,534
whether or not we were close.

256
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,878
We're home.

257
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,133
-Get some rest, okay?
-Okay.

258
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,522
Eun-byeol.

259
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,859
Your room is over there.

260
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,447
Okay.

261
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,886
Wow.

262
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,222
Did I really make this?

263
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:17,062
AWARD CERTIFICATE

264
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,652
This is nice.

265
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,669
Eun-byeol!

266
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,504
Come down for dinner!

267
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,214
Okay! Coming!

268
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,591
TONGYEONG OFFICIALS
SPONSORING HOUSE OF LOVE

269
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:48,969
Look at this.

270
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,762
So cute.

271
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,063
We went to the amusement park
with your dad often

272
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,815
around this time.

273
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,236
I must have liked going on rides.

274
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,572
No.

275
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,323
Your dad did.

276
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,993
You always got scared and cried.

277
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,452
What?

278
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,248
You're right. I'm crying here.

279
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,875
Yes.

280
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,420
But why aren't there any baby pictures?

281
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,175
Well...

282
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,681
You'll find out
once you get your memory back anyway.

283
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,269
We first met when you were five.

284
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:40,937
What?

285
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,649
I was adopted?

286
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,568
Don't be so shocked.

287
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,695
You already knew.

288
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,532
Really?

289
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,202
But,

290
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,746
regardless of that,

291
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,876
we were the closest mother and daughter
in the world.

292
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,212
My precious daughter.

293
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,091
I guess

294
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,386
I was a happy kid.

295
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:16,890
That's nice.

296
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,437
Of course. You were so happy.

297
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,193
Oh my, look at the time.

298
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,904
Go to bed. You have school tomorrow.

299
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,282
-Goodnight, Mom.
-You too.

300
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,953
-Goodnight, my precious daughter.
-Bye.

301
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,551
Can I just sleep here?

302
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,011
What's gotten into you?

303
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,723
You used to lock your door
and tell me not to come in.

304
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,933
I did?

305
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,560
-I don't care.
-I don't care either.

306
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,439
I don't want to sleep alone.

307
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,194
I like your scent, Mom.

308
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,780
Stop being so gross.

309
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,448
Come on.

310
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,159
That tickles. Stop that.

311
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,498
SEKANG HIGH SCHOOL

312
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,503
Isn't that Kong Tae-gwang?

313
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,342
Didn't you say
he'd be in there for a while this time?

314
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,177
Your bag.

315
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,306
Let's have a smoke before we go.

316
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,391
Are you avoiding him?

317
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,477
No. If I fight him, it isn't fun.

318
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,396
I get more irritated.

319
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,065
The more I beat him up,
the crazier I feel.

320
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,567
-I see.
-Are you listening?

321
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,695
-Of course, you're stronger than him.
-Let's go.

322
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,282
-I'll go in now.
-Okay.

323
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,461
What are you doing?

324
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,344
Did she just greet me?

325
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,054
To me?

326
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,681
Hey, Eun-byeol!

327
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,768
Hey, Kongtae.

328
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,314
Why is he...

329
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,151
You saw the pictures of the kids
that I sent, right?

330
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,819
Yes, I memorized most of them.

331
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,239
Eun-byeol, I'm so glad to have you back.

332
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,247
-What on Earth?
-What?

333
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,999
-Wow.
-Eun-byeol.

334
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,376
-Hey!
-What's happening?

335
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,378
-What's going on?
-What is it?

336
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,924
-Hello.
-What's up with her?

337
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,841
What's your deal?

338
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,930
-Hi.
-It feels strange.

339
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,972
It does.

340
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,766
She's back.

341
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,601
Wow. Look who's here.

342
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,437
Isn't this the Miss K from S High School
who disappeared during her school trip

343
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,480
and caused a commotion?

344
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:11,898
Any words?

345
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,316
Get lost.

346
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,151
I'll get lost

347
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,530
-Eun-byeol, this is your seat.
-Have a seat.

348
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,698
It's so weird.

349
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,461
Listen up. I have something to say.

350
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:40,593
Eun-byeol has a slight case of
amnesia because of the accident.

351
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,970
-What?
-Oh my gosh.

352
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,013
-What? Really?
-What is that?

353
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,434
So, even if she's a little unlike herself
and clueless,

354
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,853
be understanding and help her, okay?

355
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,022
You really don't remember anything?

356
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,608
Wow. That's so strange.

357
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,236
I've never met someone
with amnesia before.

358
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,529
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

359
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,197
You're not pretending?

360
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,324
Maybe there is a secret she wants to hide.

361
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,785
-Hey.
-Watch what you say.

362
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,579
I'm just kidding.

363
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,665
Hi, Eun-byeol, it's been a while.

364
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,962
It must be true.
You can't even find your seat.

365
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,589
That's crazy.

366
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,467
This is your seat.

367
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,430
Get lost.

368
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,311
Hi.

369
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,604
Hello.

370
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,530
I guess it won't be a quiet day.

371
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,617
It looks like he's about to throw that.

372
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,495
You just watch, I won't even blink.

373
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,711
-Oh...
-Hey.

374
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,671
Are you okay?

375
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,931
-Hey.
-Hey.

376
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,557
-Okay, fine.
-Fine.

377
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,352
Eun-byeol, Mr. Kim wants to see you.

378
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,853
Where's the office?

379
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,231
Come with me. He wants me to come too.

380
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,483
Take this.

381
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,087
Seriously!

382
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,467
Giving up?

383
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,428
Don't push me, okay?

384
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,682
I'm trying to live a peaceful life.

385
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,767
What a shame.

386
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,229
I was hoping to get beat up
so I can rest in the nurse's office.

387
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,273
You idiot.

388
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,030
Stop watching.

389
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,914
What was all that fuss about
when he can't even hit me?

390
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,598
Hi, Eun-byeol.

391
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,519
Ms. Ahn,

392
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,731
I bought this from Tongyeong.

393
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,901
I forgot to give this to you earlier,
because of what happened there.

394
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,028
Mr. Kim,

395
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,113
what is this?

396
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,449
A souvenir from Tongyeong.

397
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:54,704
I'm asking why you are giving me
a souvenir from Tongyeong.

398
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,122
What does it mean?

399
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,542
It's too small to have any meaning.

400
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,339
There is no gift without any meaning.

401
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,760
Even a single toothpick
has a meaning behind it.

402
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,553
Don't you agree?

403
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,892
But...

404
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,520
Mr. Kim, here's Eun-byeol.

405
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,856
-Hey.
-Hello.

406
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,316
You are here.

407
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,653
I was worried, but you look good.

408
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,988
Maybe this is for the best.

409
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,740
What do you mean?

410
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,660
It's better to forget
bad things that happened.

411
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,161
"Bad things"?

412
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,749
I heard that

413
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,919
you were having a tough time
during the school trip.

414
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,045
I see.

415
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,465
Min-jun, can you help her out for a while?

416
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,884
I know you're busy studying, but...

417
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,511
Class President,

418
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,596
do me a favor, okay?

419
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,182
Okay. That's not a problem.

420
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,017
Good. You may go now.

421
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,561
-Okay.
-We'll go back to class now.

422
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,029
You know I'm keeping my eye on her, right?

423
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,408
-Yes.
-Has Kong Tae-gwang returned to school?

424
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,285
-Yes.
-For Class Three,

425
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,330
either control them
so they don't cause trouble

426
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,542
or make sure they don't talk
so word doesn't get out.

427
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,586
Let's do at least one of them right.

428
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,797
You understand what I mean, right?

429
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,007
Yes.

430
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,135
I'll try my best so nothing will happen.

431
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,483
-Hey.
-Is that true?

432
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,153
I thought she went missing?

433
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,156
She disappeared during the school trip.

434
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,867
-Really?
-It was a total disaster.

435
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,092
Eun-byeol.

436
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,136
Are you okay?

437
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,554
Yes.

438
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,602
She did?

439
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,313
What did Eun-byeol's mom say?

440
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,482
Eun-byeol will resume tutoring on Monday.

441
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,445
I'm glad she's back safe and sound.

442
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,490
But honestly, I'm worried.

443
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,659
She can't even remember her own name.
How can she possibly study?

444
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,619
Right.

445
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,038
We'll have to see.

446
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,414
But,

447
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,375
if we don't kick out troubled students
right away,

448
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,544
they'll be difficult to control.

449
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,879
That's true.

450
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,141
Wait.

451
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,520
Yes?

452
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,074
What's this?

453
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,828
What else could this be?
It's out of good heart.

454
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,872
My husband went to Paris

455
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,208
for an academic conference.

456
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,501
It's a souvenir.

457
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,420
Here. Take it.

458
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,840
What? Oh my goodness.

459
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,677
If Eun-byeol leaves,

460
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,431
please let Si-jin
into Mr. Kim's private class.

461
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,268
We've discussed this.

462
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,354
We'll decide after the midterm grades.

463
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,398
And look.

464
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,233
I'm a fair person.

465
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,403
I go by the grades.
This won't change anything.

466
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,696
I know.

467
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,907
I'm not giving this to you
because of that.

468
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,327
It's because I like you so much.

469
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,662
Oh my.

470
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,165
Mi-gyeong.

471
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,878
When did you get here?

472
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,881
Hey, why is it so hard to meet you?

473
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,929
I heard everything.

474
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,891
If that's the mothers' decision,
what can I do?

475
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,518
Let's decide after the grades come out.

476
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,407
-Lee Si-jin.
-Yes.

477
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,664
Ko Eun-byeol.

478
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:49,957
Yes.

479
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,377
Eun-byeol came in first.

480
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,426
Good job.

481
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,887
Why did you have to get amnesia
at a critical...

482
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,311
Get better soon
and focus on just your grades.

483
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:11,771
Okay.

484
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,398
REPORT CARD
KO EUN-BYEOL

485
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,608
AVERAGE GRADE 99.1

486
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,783
There's a crackdown currently being done

487
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,452
regarding minors
going to improper establishments.

488
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,204
Fun is short-lived,

489
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,665
but your grades follow you forever.

490
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,291
You know that, right?

491
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,709
-Yes.
-Yes.

492
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,877
That's all.

493
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,255
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

494
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,134
A crackdown?

495
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,429
It's so strange.

496
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,599
Why do I get the urge to do things
the teacher tells us not to, even though

497
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,226
I never had the thought
in the first place?

498
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,479
Hae-na, that's you.

499
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,940
The way you play hardball
is what makes you so attractive.

500
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,817
It's like defying gravity
and soaring into the sky.

501
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,652
You make me blush.

502
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,663
My Hae-na wants it, so shall we go out?

503
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,959
-Sure.
-Sure.

504
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,168
Really?

505
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,214
And then I made this move...

506
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,258
My stomach hurts.

507
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,884
-Cho-won, wait for me.
-No.

508
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,052
You'd better sing!

509
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,433
MOM

510
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,350
19 MISSED CALLS

511
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,060
What the...

512
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,271
TURN OFF PHONE

513
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,983
Wait for me.

514
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:41,777
Let's go.

515
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,405
Eun-byeol, I will show you

516
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,490
how much fun we used to have. Let's go.

517
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,658
Let's go.

518
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,535
Wait.

519
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,537
I forgot my wallet.

520
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,582
In the classroom? Should we go back?

521
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,173
I found my wallet.

522
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,197
Excuse me.

523
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,658
Aren't you Han I-an,
the gold medalist in the 400m freestyle?

524
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,453
Yes, I am.

525
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,539
Congratulations. I watched the race.

526
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,210
Thank you.

527
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,754
Do you mind

528
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,881
if I get a picture with you?

529
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:44,924
Sure.

530
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,553
Which angle do you prefer?
I look good when I take it from this side.

531
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,805
Look here.

532
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,146
Which class are you in?

533
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,315
I'm in my second year and Class Three.

534
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,817
Oh, I see.

535
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:05,986
Wait.

536
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,446
What?

537
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,200
Excuse me, but we're in the same class.

538
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,702
I know I miss school because of the games.

539
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,371
What's your excuse?

540
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,886
Hello, Director.

541
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,056
I-an, good work.

542
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,183
It's all thanks to you.

543
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,227
It's been a while. Let's have dinner soon.

544
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,188
That sounds good.
Coach and I will come by.

545
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,691
-Sure. Call me.
-I will.

546
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,610
May I

547
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,157
join you for dinner?

548
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,954
I'm in his class.
My name is Kong Tae-gwang.

549
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,332
Director Kong Jae-ho.

550
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,835
Well,

551
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,837
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

552
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,719
Wow.

553
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,096
Han I-an, you're impressive.

554
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,224
You get to eat with the director.

555
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,027
Eun-byeol!

556
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,161
What is she so happy about?

557
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,635
All done.

558
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,222
Father! Come and eat.

559
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,224
Okay.

560
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,353
Wow.

561
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,855
It smells great.

562
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,273
I bet it tastes even better.

563
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,942
You eat ramen all the time
when I'm not here.

564
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,903
No, that's not the only thing I eat.

565
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,239
I'm sure of it.
I bet you have soju with it.

566
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,951
You're a smart cookie.

567
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,702
Let's eat.

568
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,290
Thanks for the meal.

569
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,802
"They don't need to excel in academics.

570
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,721
I just want happy students at our school."

571
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,021
Are you okay?

572
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,487
I never knew my dad was so funny.

573
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,780
I mean,

574
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,992
I've never laughed this hard in my life.

575
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,452
He's incredible.

576
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,497
Father.

577
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,834
I respect you, Father.

578
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,297
You have quite a sense of humor.

579
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,008
Are you taking your meds?

580
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,846
But did you

581
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,308
really say this?

582
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,353
"You should embrace a problem child more."

583
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,106
That's not right.

584
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,900
A problem child

585
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,821
should be sent to a mental institution.

586
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,865
That's what you believe.

587
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,700
Right?

588
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,004
I'm done.

589
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,652
TOTAL AMOUNT

590
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,405
Excuse me.

591
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,783
Your card was rejected.

592
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,869
That can't be.

593
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,079
Excuse me.

594
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,502
You can't freeze my account
without telling me.

595
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,338
How will I look
in front of the other kids?

596
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,840
Do you know how embarrassing this is?

597
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,468
Whatever!

598
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,804
Do me a favor and unfreeze my account.

599
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,889
If you don't, I'll take it
that you don't even care.

600
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,517
Forget it.

601
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,030
Is that what you did?

602
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,283
Did they really do that?

603
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,701
Yes.

604
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,956
You bold little punks.

605
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,209
Hello, sir.

606
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,546
Hello, Mr. Kim.

607
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,886
Did they drink?

608
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,054
Yes.

609
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,764
They didn't just drink.

610
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,975
They threatened the owner to avoid paying.

611
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,853
What? Threatened?

612
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,855
They threatened to report him

613
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,899
for serving alcohol to minors.

614
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,236
Excuse me, sir.

615
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,156
I'm their teacher. Can we talk?

616
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,409
Darn it.

617
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,497
I'm sorry, but

618
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,210
what will it take to settle this matter?

619
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,046
Do you want me to kneel...

620
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,591
What are you doing?

621
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,136
I'm just embarrassed
and can't forgive myself.

622
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,512
Goodness...

623
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,307
This is a pain.

624
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,601
Since I didn't teach them right,

625
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,062
I'll pay their tab and the penalty.

626
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:18,692
So please forgive them.

627
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:23,614
I reported them knowing that
my business might be forced to shut down.

628
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,869
I'm saying this to you
knowing I may have to resign.

629
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,830
Please forgive them.

630
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,089
Thank you.

631
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,802
A total of 1.2 million won...

632
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:50,933
Excuse me, sir.

633
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,269
May I pay this in 12-month installments?

634
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,623
I'll have to think about
what I'm going to do with you.

635
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,042
Go home for now.

636
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,627
-Yes.
-Yes.

637
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,088
-Please don't tell our--
-Go.

638
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,673
-Okay.
-Goodnight.

639
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,007
Goodnight.

640
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:29,805
Let's go.

641
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,191
Damn.

642
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,403
My 1.2 million won...

643
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,374
I'm glad we're headed
in the same direction.

644
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,720
You must have spent
several months' allowance today.

645
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,264
I'll treat you tomorrow.

646
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,142
If you don't mind the school snack bar.

647
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,855
You'll eat with me, right?

648
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,070
Do you

649
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,781
really not remember

650
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,950
or are you pretending?

651
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,410
I'm sorry.

652
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,706
I guess we weren't very close.

653
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,173
It must be so easy for you.

654
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,846
Bye.

655
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,476
Yeong-eun.

656
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,854
Let's go separately.

657
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,340
It's late. Want me to pick you up?

658
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,469
It's okay. I'll be home in ten minutes.

659
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,765
-My things keep going missing.
-I see.

660
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:41,311
-Was there anything else missing?
-That's about it.

661
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,318
Hi there.

662
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,486
Gosh.

663
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,238
What's going on?

664
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,991
My jewelry went missing, so I reported it.

665
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,203
-You were robbed?
-Well, there wasn't a break-in.

666
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,164
I've been living with a thief.

667
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,667
Who else can it be but the housekeeper?

668
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,378
They didn't disappear at once.

669
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,672
She took them one by one
so that I wouldn't notice.

670
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,382
She's a total professional.

671
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,887
Yeong-eun!

672
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,185
-Hello.
-Hi.

673
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,147
-Go inside.
-I'll see you later.

674
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,322
Oh! Mom!

675
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,409
Eun-byeol.

676
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,747
Mom.

677
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,790
Goodness.

678
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,128
I said to have fun,
not stay out all night.

679
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,338
It's dangerous at night.

680
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,424
You're in trouble, young lady.

681
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,550
Yes, ma'am.

682
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,178
What's with the formality?

683
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,804
Mom.

684
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,809
It's okay as long as you had fun.
Let's go.

685
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:14,988
What?

686
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,632
Hey.

687
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,467
Where are you going?

688
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,385
-To exercise.
-Exercise?

689
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,345
Yes.

690
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,347
I didn't even set my alarm.

691
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,351
Why do I wake up automatically at 5 a.m.?

692
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,188
I must have been very diligent.

693
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,272
No.

694
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,650
At times, you'd go to school
without washing your face.

695
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,360
What? Really?

696
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,570
Then what's going on?

697
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,405
Could it be a side effect of the accident?

698
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,449
I don't know what to do.

699
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,743
I looked through my workbook

700
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,411
but I couldn't understand the half of it.

701
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,415
Oh no. What will you do now?

702
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,835
You're ugly, not fit,

703
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,753
-and have a horrible personality.
-Hey.

704
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,881
All that you had going for
was your brains...

705
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,300
See you later.

706
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,135
Hey!

707
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,224
It must be frustrating
not being able to remember.

708
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,769
Mr. Kim said

709
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,397
I didn't look well during the trip.

710
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,358
Why did I disappear?

711
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,236
I don't know.

712
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,866
Right. You couldn't come on the trip
because of your competition.

713
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,242
How would you know?

714
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,161
I did go. Briefly, at night.

715
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,956
No one else knew that.

716
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,791
Of course not.

717
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,544
I went there quietly to only see
the person I wanted to see.

718
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:54,880
Who?

719
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,300
Why should I tell you?

720
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,178
What? Hey. Wait!

721
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,347
Wait for me! Hey!

722
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:08,101
KO EUN-BYEOL

723
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,024
Now, 220.

724
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,322
It's so annoying.

725
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,532
I bet 50,000 won
that you'll never remember.

726
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,451
And 100,000 won
that you'll break the lock.

727
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,911
-Get lost.
-Okay.

728
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,789
What's in there that it's so secure?

729
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,082
I don't know.

730
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,377
-Is it...
-Is it

731
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,880
a love letter?

732
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,507
If that's what you think, dream on.

733
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,928
I bet you hid a cake from me,
and it's rotting away.

734
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,555
That's all?

735
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,559
I'll try again later.

736
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,269
Let's go.

737
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:56,816
Right.

738
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,778
Did you hear from Yeong-eun?

739
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,404
No, why?

740
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,948
She didn't come to school yesterday.

741
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,783
You didn't know?

742
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,535
-Should I have known?
-What?

743
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,382
COUNSELING ROOM

744
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,511
Did you know
your mom reported her jewelry stolen?

745
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,972
No, I didn't.

746
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,308
Someone was caught on camera

747
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,687
selling it to a jewelry store.

748
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,313
Do you want to take a look?

749
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,498
This is you, isn't it?

750
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,667
We met at the police station

751
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,919
a few days ago, too.

752
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:00,964
Why did you do it?

753
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,550
Where is the rest of it?

754
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,816
Where is Ko Eun-byeol?

755
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,114
-Yes?
-Open your locker.

756
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:30,493
Well, I couldn't remember
the combination yet.

757
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,871
Min-jun, bring a hammer.

758
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,499
A hammer.

759
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,834
Excuse me?

760
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,385
Move.

761
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,102
KO EUN-BYEOL

762
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,859
-Nice!
-Wow!

763
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,195
Silence!

764
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,207
What is it? I'll take care of it.

765
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,583
That is

766
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,419
my mom's.

767
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,216
-What's that?
-What's going on?

768
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,801
She stole it?

769
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,265
-It was in her locker.
-It must be expensive.

770
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,279
Ko Eun-byeol, come with me.

771
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,412
Ko Eun-byeol.

772
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,289
Didn't you hear me?

773
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,731
Han I-an, stop right there!
