00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,854
ONE WEEK AFTER
KO EUN-BYEOL'S DISAPPEARANCE

2
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,323
What on earth is this?

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,328
What on earth is this?

4
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,501
It's a flower.

5
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,627
Who put this here?

6
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,258
Who was the first one here today?

7
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,889
Me. Why?

8
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,557
Was this here when you came?

9
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,101
I don't know if it was there or not.

10
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,270
Of course, he doesn't.

11
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,065
Min-jun never looks sideways.

12
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,024
Watch.

13
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,445
-Up, down, up, up, down--
-Yun-jae, be quiet.

14
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,030
Fine, I'll be quiet.

15
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,117
Hey. Would you admit it if it were you?

16
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,329
Why ask who did that?
What a waste of time.

17
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,248
He doesn't even have
the courage to face her.

18
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,125
He spent money, went to a florist...

19
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,962
Look, it's wrapped nicely too. That fool.

20
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,964
I'm not in a mood to joke around.

21
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,550
Calm down.

22
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,593
That's what it is.

23
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,304
It wasn't to insult Eun-byeol,
it's to upset you.

24
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,264
Think about it.

25
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,435
Eun-byeol doesn't even know
if there's a flower or poop on her desk.

26
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,771
Fine.

27
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,608
Nothing changes
just because Eun-byeol is missing.

28
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,028
Those who will study, study.
Those who will play, play.

29
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,196
Those who will sleep, sleep.

30
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,573
I'm not asking you to worry about her.

31
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,159
But...

32
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,247
this isn't right.

33
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,592
School bullies?

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,010
SEO YEONG-EUN
SEKANG HIGH, SECOND YEAR

35
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,179
Are there still bullies?

36
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,058
Nobody orders other people around
or takes money from others.

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,353
Nobody cares about anyone either.

38
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,522
They're too busy studying.

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,941
Ko Eun-byeol?

40
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,236
Well...

41
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,865
We hung out a few times,

42
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,408
but we're not close.

43
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,162
But...

44
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,290
I would rather not talk about her.

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm sorry, but may I go?

46
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,588
I have a lot of homework.

47
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,038
That's it.

48
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,874
That's my mom's.

49
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,417
What's going on?

50
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,793
Did she steal it?

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,009
Ko Eun-byeol, come with me.

52
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,640
Ko Eun-byeol.

53
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,642
Didn't you hear me?

54
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,414
Let go. Let go of me!

55
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,418
I need to find out what's going on.

56
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,628
And if you do?

57
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,214
If I did something wrong,
I'll take the punishment.

58
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,466
If I didn't,
I'll clear up the misunderstanding.

59
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,509
How?

60
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,804
Did you steal that necklace?
Did you take it from her?

61
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,014
What will you say?

62
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,350
You don't remember anything,
so how can you clear your name?

63
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,145
And if I avoid it?

64
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,356
Will that resolve it?

65
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,483
-Who said to avoid it?
-Then what?

66
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,985
I was frustrated, that's why.

67
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,737
You were panicking
before finding out what happened.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,948
You're not being yourself!

69
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,700
What does that even mean?

70
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,916
Everyone keeps telling you things,

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,835
so you don't know whom to believe, right?

72
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,171
Listen up.

73
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,926
The person you need to trust
is not someone else.

74
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,678
It's yourself.

75
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,680
You, Ko Eun-byeol.

76
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,268
You're a brat, you're annoying,
and you're so hateful at times

77
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,353
that people want to smack you,

78
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,814
but what you see is what you get.

79
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,734
You're not a coward

80
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,903
who would hide someone else's stuff
in your locker.

81
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,031
Really?

82
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,867
Can I...

83
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,536
trust myself?

84
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,289
Yes.

85
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,131
So...

86
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,259
So Eun-byeol said that she would hurt you

87
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,470
if you don't bring money?

88
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,473
That's why you took your mom's jewelry.

89
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,349
Is that right?

90
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,102
Yes.

91
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,355
Why are you guys doing this to me?

92
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,274
Fine.

93
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,695
But given Eun-byeol's current state,

94
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,324
you know it's impossible to get
both sides of the story, right?

95
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,244
Isn't it because you don't believe
that she could have done it?

96
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,914
She's the top student after all.

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,500
I never said that.

98
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,796
What I'm trying to say
is we'll have to call in the parents.

99
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,714
I'm fine with that.

100
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,467
Detective Park told me earlier

101
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,512
that family members can't be found guilty.

102
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:32,058
I'm the one who stole it,
and we already got it back,

103
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,851
so please just forget about it.

104
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,023
It would be humiliating
if the other students found out.

105
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,150
Here, Gi-tae!

106
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,445
-Can you do it?
-Sure.

107
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,572
Good job.

108
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,994
Oh, what did Mr. Kim say?
It's a misunderstanding, right?

109
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:57,917
"What's the point in asking you?
Just go back to class."

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,836
That's all he said.

111
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,006
Something happened, but it's too quiet.

112
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,633
I don't like it.

113
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,511
The flower on your desk too...

114
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,388
What?

115
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,390
Isn't that Yeong-eun?

116
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,062
-I told you, that's not it.
-Shush!

117
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,188
Oh, no.

118
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,400
-That must be her mother.
-It is.

119
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,989
I need to ask you something.

120
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,200
It was weird before.

121
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,662
Yeong-eun was spending way too much money.

122
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,665
Do you...

123
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,834
Of course not.

124
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,669
You think we take money
from other students?

125
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,880
Right. We don't, right?

126
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,967
First,

127
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,261
it is true that the necklace

128
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,638
was found in Ko Eun-byeol's locker.

129
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,849
Oh, my goodness.

130
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,352
I request an official SVPC investigation.

131
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,937
SVPC: SCHOOL VIOLENCE PREVENTION COMMITTEE

132
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,481
No. I don't want it.

133
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,278
She doesn't remember anything.
There is no point.

134
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,988
Let's just keep this quiet.

135
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,782
I said I'll take care of it,
so stop talking.

136
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,452
What's the point of an investigation?

137
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,205
We would just be announcing
that I'm an outcast

138
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,374
who pays for other kids
to hang out with me.

139
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,501
Yeong-eun.

140
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,252
This is the teachers' office.

141
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,838
What are you talking about?

142
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,590
You're a what?

143
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,967
Do they treat you like an outcast?

144
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,552
Who are they?

145
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,638
Give me their names. Now.

146
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,473
Who are they?

147
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,853
What a hypocrite.

148
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,815
Since when did you start caring about me?

149
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,527
Just be yourself!

150
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,321
Stop pretending to be a good mom!
You make me sick!

151
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,615
How dare you talk to your mother that way?

152
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,534
Apologize right now.

153
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,786
Why are you yelling at my child?

154
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,288
Is this how you treat the students here?

155
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,503
Ma'am.

156
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,506
If a teacher doesn't scold a student
at times like this,

157
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,174
what are we supposed to teach them?

158
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,178
I'll take care of teaching her manners.

159
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,973
Apologize to her right now!

160
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,309
Now!

161
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,568
Yeong-eun!

162
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,820
Yeong-eun!

163
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,530
Yeong-eun!

164
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,961
Your call is being forwarded to voicemail.

165
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,799
Yeong-eun, can we talk?

166
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,479
I know I should be ashamed to say this,

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,899
but we must sometimes
just turn a blind eye

168
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,361
in times like this.

169
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,362
Mr. Kim.

170
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,198
What is a teacher's authority?

171
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,367
A teacher's right?

172
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,453
A teacher's prestige?

173
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,164
No.

174
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:28,878
I believe it's a teacher's obligation
to teach.

175
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,256
If you don't scold a student
who does something wrong,

176
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,093
you will lose your teacher's authority.

177
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,181
Lose just a little bit. Please.

178
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,641
I mean,

179
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,602
you will just be reprimanded and sued.

180
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,647
A teacher needs to make a living too.

181
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,608
Goodness. Come on now.

182
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,445
Anyway,

183
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,572
I'm worried.

184
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,952
I wonder what Yeong-eun's mother will do.

185
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,212
Ma'am, I'll have some
chicken feet and soju--

186
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,051
I mean sausages, please.

187
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,595
Ms. Ahn.

188
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,430
Do you live nearby?

189
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,515
Yes.

190
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:23,933
Ms. Ahn.

191
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,771
Did you want sausages
and not chicken feet with soju?

192
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,982
Yes. I'm just so hungry.

193
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,401
What's gotten into you?

194
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:41,242
I'm sure both of you
had an exhausting day.

195
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,370
Have a drink and shake it off.

196
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,580
Yes, we will.

197
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:48,958
Ms. Ahn.

198
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,168
Have a drink with us.

199
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,965
It's rare for us to get together.

200
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,842
Let's have a venting session.

201
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,093
I don't want to.

202
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,887
Come on, Ms. Ahn.

203
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,307
-Don't be like that and join us.
-I won't.

204
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,977
Then what?

205
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,687
Shall we go to you?

206
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,607
Ma'am, please pack mine to go.

207
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,567
Good night.

208
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,320
I will pick it up later.

209
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,991
Does Ms. Ahn...

210
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,580
like me or something?

00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,660
Hey.

215
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,038
Why are you sitting alone?

216
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,956
Well...

217
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,544
-Let's be friends.
-I'm the best, right?

218
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,422
I am, right?

219
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,176
Okay.

NEW MESSAGE

221
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,608
Yeong-eun, I have so many questions.

222
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,735
Please call or text me.

223
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,794
Eun-byeol.

224
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,589
Aren't you Eun-byeol?

225
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
Yes. Hello.

226
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,803
You came over often
when you were in grade school.

227
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,012
Don't you remember me?

228
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,181
Who are you?

229
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,559
I'm Su-in's mom.

230
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,894
Su-in?

231
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,938
Eun-byeol.

232
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,565
Mom.

233
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,069
-Hello.
-Hello.

234
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,906
Why did you come here?
I said I only needed ten minutes.

235
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,117
I wanted to see you ten extra minutes.

236
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,495
-Aren't I the best?
-Yes, my daughter is the best.

237
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,040
Let's go.

238
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,170
Mom, do you know Su-in?

239
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,714
She said we were close.

240
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,258
Yes, when you were in grade school.

241
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,926
Does she go to my school now?

242
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,012
I doubt that.

243
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,807
It's late, so let's talk about that later.
Let's hurry home and eat.

244
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,766
Okay.

245
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,130
What are you doing?

246
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,885
What else? It's my morning exercise.

247
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,887
I already did a lap.

248
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,430
See you later.

249
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,102
What? Hey, what are you doing?

250
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,145
Do another lap.

251
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,897
No. Why should I?

252
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,315
You've been eating a lot lately.

253
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,776
You'll be rolling around soon.

254
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,946
-Let's go.
-I'm tired.

255
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,616
Hey, did anything happen
while I was at my afternoon training?

256
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,452
No. It's been quiet so far.

257
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,496
That's more frustrating though.

258
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,456
It will be fine.

259
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,707
Trust me.

260
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,170
I was thankful
for what you said yesterday,

261
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,091
but I feel more offended
the more I think about it.

262
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,258
What?

263
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,553
Hey. What did you say about me?

264
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,056
A brat, annoying,
and making people want to smack me?

265
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,351
Why are you friends
with someone like that?

266
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,352
I know, right?

267
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,776
The wound healed. It looked pretty bad.

268
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,653
-Here?
-Yes.

269
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,697
I didn't have a wound.

270
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,699
When did I get hurt?

271
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,412
Never mind. You're okay now.

272
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,087
Seo Yeong-eun's mother
requested an SVPC investigation.

273
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,634
It's good that the school
violence committee was established,

274
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,303
but we're getting more and more incidents.

275
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,348
It isn't the students who don't get a say.

276
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,810
It's their parents
who are blowing things out of proportion.

277
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,188
Is it the kids' problem or the parents'?

278
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,149
It's confusing!

279
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,192
But as you know, Ko Eun-byeol...

280
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,654
does not remember anything
about the incident.

281
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,156
What should we do?

282
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,449
We must be fair.

283
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,992
What if all the kids start claiming

284
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,454
that they don't remember anything
for something they did?

285
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,790
Most of their classmates
should know what happened.

286
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,876
Right.

287
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,422
Then, we'll distribute
a school violence questionnaire,

288
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,884
and we'll question the students related.

289
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,097
Hey, did you hear about
Seo Yeong-eun's locker incident?

290
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,934
Eun-byeol may be tough,
but she would never do that.

291
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,228
Maybe Yeong-eun framed her.

292
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,064
But she has proof.

293
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,484
Maybe she's lying about having amnesia.

294
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,195
Let's go.

295
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,529
Let's go.

296
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,837
Ko Eun-byeol.

297
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,924
Who are you?

298
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,078
Hey.

299
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,539
Get in.

300
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,334
That's not funny.

301
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,388
Not this.

302
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,305
My goodness.

303
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,811
I want to repel down from here too.

304
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,689
Like when I first saw you at the hospital.

305
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,192
Maybe I'll feel better then.

306
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,861
While wearing this?

307
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,320
Hey, Tae-gwang!

308
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,742
Were you and I close?

309
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,286
No way.

310
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,539
Isn't it funny?

311
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,960
The fact that I need to ask that
to anyone I meet.

312
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,549
Should I tell you?

313
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,052
You may not know since you have amnesia,

314
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
but you used to follow me around.

315
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,849
It's just that I didn't like you back.

316
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,351
You used to call, text,
and annoy me so much.

317
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,522
-I did?
-Yes, you did.

318
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,608
And...

319
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,152
do you want to know a secret?

320
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,445
What?

321
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,073
I'm actually that man's son.

322
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,872
I'm the crazy son
of the respected Director of Sekang High.

323
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,337
It's fun, isn't it?

324
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,630
What is?

325
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,632
Me.

326
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,176
Whatever you say,

327
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,304
I have no idea
if you're telling the truth or not.

328
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,558
It must be fun toying with me.

329
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,269
You're wrong. You're not fun at all.

330
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,775
Hey, Eun-byeol.

331
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,737
Fine. I'll tell you.

332
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,657
Your locker.

333
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,159
I broke the door,

334
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,495
but I broke it a while ago.

335
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,121
One thing is for certain.

336
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,582
I got an earful from you because of it.

337
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,334
And...

338
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,712
that is the only time you and I spoke.

339
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,172
The end.

340
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,551
Yes, that's the look.

341
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,137
You never treated me like a human being.

342
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,390
That's a fact.

343
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,103
What the...

344
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,608
COUNSELING ROOM

345
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:21,238
That day at the karaoke place,
whose credit card was it that was denied?

346
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,823
Yeong-eun's.

347
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,577
She tends to spend a lot of money
whenever we hang out.

348
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,706
"I'll treat you to a movie.
I'll buy dinner."

349
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,125
She says that all the time.

350
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,255
I've received make-up from Yeong-eun.

351
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,424
You must be close.

352
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,551
Not really.

353
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,263
We hang out every so often.

354
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,683
Yeong-eun likes to spend money.

355
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,478
She gets the most allowance in our class.

356
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,023
You've never forced her?

357
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,316
Of course not.

358
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,236
Everyone assumed she spends a lot
because she gets a lot.

359
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,740
But...

360
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,492
Eun-byeol really didn't do it.

361
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,204
She wouldn't even accept
gifts from Yeong-eun.

362
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,165
There is no way she made her do that.

363
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,293
Wasn't the locker hers?

364
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,045
Well...

365
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,174
Yes.

366
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,092
What did you talk to Eun-byeol about?

367
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,261
Nothing much.

368
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,513
Then why did you take her?

369
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,682
She was so out of it,

370
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,935
so I yelled at her to snap out of it
and brought her back.

371
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,314
Mr. Kim.

372
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,192
I've been living quietly.

373
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,360
Tae-gwang put my name down, didn't he?

374
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,445
You don't need to know that.

375
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,115
If you get rid of him,
I'll continue to live quietly.

376
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,709
Tae-gwang.

377
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,254
I even stopped coming to the rooftop
so you can be comfortable.

378
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,757
You don't need to do that.

379
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,801
I don't find you uncomfortable one bit.

380
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,347
Whatever.

381
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,016
I came to tell you something.

382
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,269
I'm glad you came.

383
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,566
You and I are like bombs,
but we're different types.

384
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,528
You're a grenade
that explodes upon impact,

385
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,197
but I'm a time bomb
that explodes after a time.

386
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,201
And my timer has almost reached its limit.

387
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,956
Let's try to get along.

388
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,895
I heard Eun-byeol came in first again.

389
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:03,024
It's so different
from what Si-jin's mom was saying.

390
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,945
I only said that's what I thought
would happen.

391
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,406
I didn't say her grades would drop.

392
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,453
And there are always kids who play
but always get good grades too.

393
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,621
Those annoying kids.

394
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,960
But I don't think she can join the group.

395
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,420
Why not?

396
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,631
We said we would decide
based on the midterm grades,

397
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,176
so I don't want to look like
I'm changing my word.

398
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,096
But they found stolen goods
in Eun-byeol's locker.

399
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,014
What?

400
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,141
The school is launching
an SVPC investigation.

401
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,268
Oh, my goodness.

402
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,980
I totally misjudged her. My goodness.

403
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:42,939
By the way.

404
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,442
My husband said he saw Si-jin.
Didn't she tell you?

405
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,361
Oh, at school?

406
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,449
The school is in the jurisdiction
of Min-jun's father.

407
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:56,369
Yes, but he saw her at the police station.

408
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,166
Why did he see her at the police station?

409
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,794
Sorry I'm late.

410
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,422
An emergency came up at the shop.

411
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,718
I know you're busy,
but look in on Eun-byeol too.

412
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,680
She shouldn't hurt others
during this important time.

413
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,309
What do you mean?

414
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,439
Let's all do our job properly.

415
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,693
I'll call when the study group
is finalized.

416
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,278
-Shall we go?
-You're leaving?

417
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,321
Let's go.

418
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,369
I know you just got here,
but what should I do?

419
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,829
I have plans, so I need to go too.

420
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:40,997
Bye.

421
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,509
Hae-na, what did the dean say?

422
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,054
They found a necklace
in Eun-byeol's locker.

423
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,014
Why are they asking about the time
we went to karaoke?

424
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,141
Yeong-eun must have said something.

425
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,143
What on earth is her deal?

426
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,937
But...

427
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,482
does no one really know
about that necklace?

428
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,195
Eun-byeol's locker thing is strange,

429
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,699
but it's true that we treated her
like a free wallet.

430
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,409
Hey.

431
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:18,994
Why?

432
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,625
This is so frustrating.

433
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,921
I feel like we got stuck
between the two of you.

434
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,382
Let's go.

435
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,396
What's Eun-byeol's deal?

436
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,357
I don't know. It's one or the other.

437
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,651
Eun-byeol did something
and forgot about it,

438
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,236
or Yeong-eun is framing her.

439
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,404
There's a third possibility.

440
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,781
Eun-byeol is pretending to have amnesia.

441
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,327
Regardless, Eun-byeol
is such a disgrace now.

442
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,120
Hey.

443
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,081
Watch your mouth.

444
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,375
What do you know?

445
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,177
Don't mind them. Let's eat.

446
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,731
Hey, Outcast. Enjoy your lunch.

447
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:31,941
Eun-byeol.

448
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,401
Ko Eun-byeol.

449
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,445
Are you okay?

450
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,113
Are you not feeling well?

451
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,618
You've been under a lot of stress lately,
haven't you?

452
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,912
Do you want to rest at the nurse's office?

453
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:44,829
No.

454
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,624
I was a little dizzy, but I'm fine now.

455
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,262
How long has it been?

456
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,599
Stop poking me, Mom.

457
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,935
It keeps falling off.

458
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,314
This is so nice.

459
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,860
You know,

460
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,489
before you lost your memory,

461
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,117
we didn't laugh this much.

462
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,827
Really?

463
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:28,498
I thought you and I
had fun like this every day.

464
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,712
When you disappeared,

465
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,590
I repented a lot.

466
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,343
I was too busy worrying about your studies

467
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,805
that I didn't take the time
to get to know you.

468
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,687
I heard from Yeong-eun's mom.

469
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,564
Why didn't you tell me?

470
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,234
What if...

471
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,695
I really did that?

472
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,616
Disappointing you scares me the most.

473
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,203
If you did something wrong,
just never do it again.

474
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:16,629
I'm looking for ways to help you
in any way I can too.

475
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,215
Don't worry and face it with confidence.

476
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,801
Got it?

477
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,428
Okay.

478
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,898
Yeong-eun! Open the door!

479
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,442
How long will you keep this up?

480
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,236
Why must you upset me like this?

481
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,907
I'm doing this
so you can go to school comfortably,

482
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,658
but why won't you go to school?

483
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,368
Yeong-eun!

484
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,958
I'm busy, and I need to go out.
Let's talk later.

485
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,473
Ha-yeon.

486
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,851
I went to buy a flower basket
for my mom's birthday,

487
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,395
and I saw the florist
talking to Yeong-eun.

488
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,440
He asked if she doesn't need
the chrysanthemum anymore.

489
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,108
Really?

490
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,069
How annoying must Eun-byeol have been

491
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,613
that she got a chrysanthemum
for someone who wasn't dead?

492
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,575
What was that?

493
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,118
Give that back.

494
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,288
It takes just two seconds to say a name.

495
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,458
Seo Yeong-eun. Happy?

496
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,548
Seo Yeong-eun is...

497
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,383
A volunteer victim.

498
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:45,844
What?

499
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,098
She spent her money when no one made her,

500
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,518
so it's difficult to assign blame.

501
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,566
But if it were to avoid being an outcast,
that changes the story.

502
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,110
Well, that's true.

503
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,612
But as you know,
Eun-byeol lost her memory.

504
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,073
The investigation is pointless.

505
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,825
What should we do?

506
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,537
I'm worried that the psychological stress

507
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,040
will hinder Eun-byeol
in getting her memory back.

508
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,295
But the victim is adamant about the abuse,

509
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,963
and we have solid proof.

510
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,465
We'll need to hold a meeting.

511
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,804
Then let's just do it.

512
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,847
Do it.

513
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,183
NOTICE

514
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,810
SCHOOL VIOLENCE PREVENTION
COMMITTEE MEETING

515
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,353
SUBJECT: SECOND YEAR CLASS 3 MS. KO

516
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,689
It's obviously Ko Eun-byeol from Class 3.

517
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,158
Seo Yeong-eun.

518
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,411
Stop avoiding us, and let's talk.

519
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,374
Let me ask you something.

520
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,503
You put a chrysanthemum
on Eun-byeol's desk as if she had died.

521
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,839
What did you do with her locker?

522
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,050
You told the dean

523
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,761
that we made you pay
for the karaoke, didn't you?

524
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,431
Yeong-eun, let's talk this out.

525
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,601
Why are you doing this to your classmates?

526
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,272
Since when did you consider me
your classmate?

527
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,858
You admitted it as well.

528
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,902
You guys treated me

529
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,905
like the class' official wallet.

530
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,116
Well...

531
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,702
-That was just--
-Hey.

532
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,414
-Did we ever ask you to pay?
-No.

533
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:43,586
But you treated me like I was invisible
and asked me to hang out once in a while.

534
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,546
That meant you wanted me to pay,

535
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,299
not that you wanted to hang out with me.

536
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,678
Is that how you really felt?

537
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,930
What a victim's mentality.

538
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,265
You should have declined.

539
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,935
Right, that would have solved everything.

540
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,103
What is this mess?

541
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:04,399
Sure.

542
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,111
It's easy for you guys.

543
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,531
When you ask me to hang out,

544
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,908
should I have declined?

545
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,037
Do you know

546
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,999
just how hard I try to hear those words,

547
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,544
"Do you want to go?"

548
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,296
I could never say "No"

549
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,883
even though I knew you wanted my money

550
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,428
and not me.

551
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:36,973
Do you know why?

552
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,812
Because I didn't mind.

553
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,859
Even if that's what it took,

554
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,696
I wanted to have friends.

555
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,583
I really didn't want to request
an SVPC investigation

556
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,545
because it's so humiliating.

557
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,132
But I think I've changed my mind.

558
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,719
It's too late anyway.

559
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,890
I hope it's not just Eun-byeol
who gets punished.

560
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,893
I hope all of you...

561
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,896
gets punished as well.

562
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,872
Where is Seo Yeong-eun?

563
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,248
Does anyone know?

564
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,340
Nobody? Not even the class president?

565
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,175
I don't know.

566
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:03,267
Yesterday, we learned how to check
the continuity of functions.

567
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,522
What are the three conditions
when a function is discontinuous?

568
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,150
When there's no limit value,
when there's no function value,

569
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,861
or when the limit value is not the same
as the function value.

570
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,321
Okay.

571
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,282
That took one second.

572
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,575
It's so easy, isn't it?

573
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,535
-It isn't easy.
-No.

574
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,083
No matter how difficult math may be,

575
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,460
it's nothing compared to you kids.

576
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,506
Okay, today...

577
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:58,990
Yeong-eun.

578
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,705
What are you doing?

579
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,915
What else?

580
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,003
I came to get my bag now
so I wouldn't run into you guys.

581
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,135
This locker door

582
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,929
wasn't broken that day.

583
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,640
Tae-gwang broke it earlier.

584
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:25,933
Didn't we...

585
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,519
swap lockers?

586
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,813
Just before the school trip.

587
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,153
Did you...

588
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,781
get your memory back?

589
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,202
I'm right then.

00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,841
Good.

592
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,635
Go and tell them

593
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,638
that I put on a show
because of my inferiority complex.

594
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,935
I wanted to ask you something.

595
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,605
Did you frame me unintentionally

596
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,734
because of the locker situation?

597
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,778
Or...

598
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,990
was it because you really hated me?

599
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,576
Right.

600
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,954
I hated you.

601
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,748
If I could,

602
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,291
I wanted to destroy your reputation

603
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,210
and your pride.

604
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,295
I wanted to destroy everything.

605
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,173
I wanted to make you feel

606
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,093
the humiliation of being embarrassed

607
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,220
in front of others.

608
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:46,931
Why?

609
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,226
Why did you do that?

610
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,397
You said...

611
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,191
you got your memory back.

612
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,095
Four student tickets, please.

613
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,264
I'll get my own.

614
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,057
It's okay. I'll get it.

615
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,851
I'm not okay.

616
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,769
I'll pay for mine.

617
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,109
But...

618
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,237
what is that you always buy
with your money?

619
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,450
Food? Movie tickets? Friends?

620
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,660
Or...

621
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,620
is it time?

622
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,749
What do you mean?

623
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,335
That's right.

624
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,880
You buy the time of the people
you spend money on.

625
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,092
I won't sell you
even ten minutes of my time.

626
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,097
Did you do that?

627
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,558
-I thought you did.
-Maybe.

628
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,894
-Maybe I did.
-When did you guys buy this?

629
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,562
Maybe we should have bought two.

630
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,731
I'm going to eat all of this.
We should have got two.

631
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,840
I think what you said was right.

632
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,925
What?

633
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,261
I must really be annoying, rude,

634
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,222
and so hateful
that people want to smack me.

635
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,848
You just realized that?

636
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,811
I'm glad I can clear my name
for the necklace case,

637
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,604
but my heart feels heavy.

638
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,648
Why? Because of the SVPC investigation?

639
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,565
Yes.

640
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,987
Apologizing when I have no memory
would be useless, right?

641
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,532
But still,

642
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,992
it's not like my memory
will suddenly return overnight.

643
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,495
Hey.

644
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,789
At least you cleared your name.

645
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,124
Stop it.

646
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,085
-I don't want to. I'll keep doing it.
-Stop it!

647
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,257
Wait!

648
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,261
-Wait! Stop!
-Stop!

649
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,265
-Stop it!
-Wait.

650
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,183
Hello.

651
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,396
Stop it! It hurts!

652
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,022
Okay! Stop!

653
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,418
Oh my goodness!

00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:03,878

00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,660
Eun-byeol, are you okay?

661
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,954
Wake up, Eun-byeol.

662
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:34,885
Hey!

663
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,350

Fine. I'll leave you alone.

00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,707

00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:35,959
The teacher is asking for you.

693
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,086
Okay.

694
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,593
As I told you, Eun-byeol lost her memory.

695
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:49,890
So, it's impossible to confirm the truth
about what happened--

696
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,016
No, sir.

697
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,936
I remember.

698
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,982
I don't remember everything,

699
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:02,778
but I got some of my memory back.

700
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,619
I put it in an empty locker,

701
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,581
but Detective Park
suddenly came to the school,

702
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,125
so I got scared.

703
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,505
I'm sorry for lying.

704
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:22,965
Don't be.

705
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,969
Thank you for being brave
and for telling me.

706
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,138
The committee is still in a meeting,

707
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,849
so I can go tell them.

708
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,227
I'll tell them myself.

709
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,738
Since you got your memory back,
why don't you tell us?

710
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,867
Is what Seo Yeong-eun said true?

711
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,329
Yes.

712
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,498
It is.

713
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,593
You admit to threatening Seo Yeong-eun?

714
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:09,720
Yes.

715
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,182
How did you threaten her?

716
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:21,356
With the scariest words I know.

717
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,866
"I...

718
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,536
won't be your friend anymore."

719
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,293
Excuse me.

720
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,212
I think someone farted. It smells funny.

721
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,095
I'm sure nothing is scarier

722
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,683
than thinking everyone in class hates me.

723
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,229
I know very well

724
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,899
just how that feels.

725
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,780
"I don't need many friends.

726
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,908
I just need one.

727
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,246
But why won't anyone come to me?"

728
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,254
The one who made Yeong-eun
feel frightened...

729
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,675
was me.

730
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,857
SEO YEONG-EUN

731
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,914
Only a friend's hand

732
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,542
can remove a thorn in a person's heart.

733
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,754
Yeong-eun.

734
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,006
Will you take my hand?

735
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,475
Why won't it return?

736
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,644
What?

737
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,648
It's completely dead.

738
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,401
At least it did something good
before it died.

739
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:55,987
Good boy.

740
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,449
-Punk.
-Hey.

741
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:01,785
Why, that...

742
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,586
It's open.

743
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,048
What's gotten into you?

744
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,008
You're not locking your door anymore?

745
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,808
What? Is the magnetic strip not working?

746
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,186
I don't need it anymore.

747
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,481
I'll take a tiny allowance too.

748
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,609
What's gotten into you?

749
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,698
I want to transfer to another school.

750
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,826
I want to start anew

751
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,370
with friends

752
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,581
and with you.

753
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,376
I want to try something different

754
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,378
without using money.

755
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,551
Eun-byeol, are you ready?

756
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,887
Yes, Mom. I'm coming.

757
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:08,143
FROM LEE EUN-BI

758
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:09,978
Attention!

759
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,901
Eun-byeol's school violence case
that had begun with a misunderstanding

760
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,446
was resolved well.

761
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,703
I have some sad news though.

762
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,333
Seo Yeong-eun transferred out
as of yesterday.

763
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,251
What?

764
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:40,091
No, she was not forced out.

765
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,843
She wanted to leave.

766
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,762
Without saying goodbye?

767
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,057
She said she said goodbye to everyone.

768
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,060
-No, she didn't.
-She didn't.

769
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,104
Message her.

770
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,357
That's all for today.

771
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,567
-Goodbye.
-Have a nice day.

772
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,402
By the way.

773
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,864
Did you know

774
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,827
that Yeong-eun
was a really good cartoonist?

775
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,121
Really?

776
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,831
-Cartoon?
-Really?

777
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,216
What's this?

778
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,177
Wow, did you see this?

779
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,388
-What?
-What is it?

780
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,515
-What is it? Let me see.
-What is it?

781
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,808
-What is it?
-Let me see.

782
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,226
Let me see.

783
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,775
It doesn't look like you.

784
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,568
What is this?

785
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,362
It's so pretty. Looks just like you.

786
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,497
How is she so annoying to the bitter end?

787
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,292
"How is she so annoying
to the bitter end?"

788
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,752
-What?
-Hey.

789
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,379
Is my face this weird?

790
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,176
What?

791
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,934
Eun-byeol.

792
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,228
Thanks for reaching out your hand.

793
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:02,442
After some time has passed,
I hope we can reconcile for real.

794
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,037
Do you want to stop by the school?

795
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:30,887
Let's just go.

796
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,272
Hey.

797
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,233
Why weren't you picking up?

798
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,777
I left my phone at home.

799
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,321
You're so absent-minded.

800
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,492
Hey.

801
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,745
I set an unofficial new record
during training.

802
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,038
Really?

803
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:58,790
Congratulations.

804
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,128
I really can't get used to you.

805
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:04,879
What do you mean?

806
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,714
This is how the old you
would have responded.

807
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,218
"Unofficial records don't count.

808
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,762
Come back when you set
an official new record."

809
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,931
Wow, I'm so cool.

810
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,600
I kept picking on you
to control your temper,

811
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,477
and now you're being way too obedient.

812
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,655
I need to go somewhere,

813
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,532
so let's part ways here.

814
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,325
Okay.

815
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,996
I was frustrated,

816
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,415
so I worked really hard
to get my memory back.

817
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,293
But I shouldn't have.

818
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,627
Why not?

819
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:46,796
I think...

820
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,008
I'll really miss the days

821
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,260
when I didn't remember anything.

822
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,392
I-an.

823
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:02,812
Goodbye.

824
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,483
What is this?

825
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,276
Goodbye to you too.

826
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,306
Bye!

827
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,434
Call me!

828
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,350
You said giving birth to me was a sin.

829
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,227
Then keep being punished!

830
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,812
If I die, that will fix it!

831
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,438
"Jeong Su-in"?

832
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,857
Is there a student named Jeong Su-in
in our school?

833
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,109
Want me to tell you a secret too?

834
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,319
Don't believe anything I say.

835
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,488
-I'm a total liar.
-More than I am?

836
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,906
Are you really Eun-byeol?

837
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,366
You're Eun-byeol, right?
