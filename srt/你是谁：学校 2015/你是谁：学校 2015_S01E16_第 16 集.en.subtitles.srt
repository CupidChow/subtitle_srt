1
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,141
I have...

2
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,979
something to tell you guys.

3
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,357
To be honest--

4
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,002
What's going on? This is scary.

5
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,963
Didn't you say Eun-byeol's sister died?

6
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,258
They look like twins.

7
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,527
Finally we are all here together.

8
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,575
I told you

9
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,827
Lee Eun-bi from Tongyeong

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,455
wasn't dead.

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,439
Don't worry.

12
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,818
Continue what you were saying.

13
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,823
Sorry.

14
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,908
I'll tell you my story later.

15
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,709
So-yeong,

16
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,087
we need to talk.

17
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,713
Say it here.

18
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,715
Why?

19
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,093
Do you still have more to hide?

20
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,886
I don't care what you want.

21
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,181
-Come with me.
-Why should I?

22
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,391
Come with me!

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,611
-What's going on?
-Who is that?

24
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,864
-Who is Eun-byeol?
-Is she Eun-byeol?

25
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,576
I got goosebumps.

26
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,911
This is so weird. I got goosebumps.

27
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,623
No way.

28
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,005
So-yeong, hand it over.

29
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,174
What?

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,427
You got me to the classroom
where Eun-bi was,

31
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,929
so you got what you wanted.

32
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,265
Now, hand it over.

33
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,227
Right, the video?

34
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,689
You're smart. You should know better.

35
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,611
If that gets out, it will be over for you.

36
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,155
You think...

37
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,117
I would really give it to you
when I don't even have a copy?

38
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,327
What on earth...

39
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,872
did you do to my sister?

40
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,418
Don't worry.

41
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,171
She won't die just because it gets out.

42
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,717
It's just that

43
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,179
many people will remember

44
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,306
those two same faces

45
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,061
and be chitchatting about that video.

46
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:50,980
Did you...

47
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,776
take the video yourself?

48
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,113
-Probably.
-Give me a straight answer!

49
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,659
Did you do it?

50
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,622
I'm sorry

51
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,541
for lying all this time.

52
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,421
I'm...

53
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,466
I'm Lee Eun-bi.

54
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,094
-Wow. This is just insane.
-Seriously.

55
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,303
Hold on.

56
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,056
What are you saying?

57
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,892
You're not Eun-byeol?

58
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,481
You're Eun-bi, but you pretended
to be Eun-byeol with amnesia?

59
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,986
The Eun-byeol who got her memory back
is the real Eun-byeol?

60
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,862
What is all this?

61
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,156
Hey, Eun-byeol.

62
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,658
I mean...

63
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,538
You guys took turns coming to school

64
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,666
and pretended to be the same person?

65
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,338
I-an,

66
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:58,840
did you...

67
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,592
know about this?

68
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,344
Yes.

69
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,472
How could you do this?

70
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,017
I didn't mean to lie to you
from the start.

71
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,645
When I awoke in Tongyeong,

72
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,316
I had lost my memory,

73
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,943
so I didn't know anything.

74
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,280
And I believed I was Ko Eun-byeol
and came to Seoul.

75
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,284
By the time I got my memory back,

76
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,746
it was too late.

77
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,665
Too much had happened...

78
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,961
so I couldn't tell you the truth.

79
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,258
But still. How long
were you planning to lie to us?

80
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,176
Hey.

81
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,178
We're on a hidden camera show, aren't we?

82
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,263
I'm sure of it. There's a hidden camera.

83
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,431
Hey, keep it down.

84
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,100
Let her finish.

85
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,770
Whatever the reasons were,

86
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,398
it's true that I lied to you.

87
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,069
So, you have a right to be angry.

88
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,538
I'm very sorry.

89
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,917
Eun-byeol! Are you crazy?

90
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,671
So-yeong,

91
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:22,840
listen carefully.

92
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,472
Many people will remember

93
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,766
those two same faces

94
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,851
and be chitchatting about that video.

95
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,853
Did you...

96
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,648
take the video yourself?

97
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,443
-Probably.
-Give me a straight answer!

98
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,695
Did you do it?

99
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,322
Yes.

100
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,740
That's right.

101
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,828
What are you doing?

102
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,162
If you show

103
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,207
that video to anyone,

104
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,460
or if it makes it online
for a second... No!

105
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,965
If you ever mention the word "video,"

106
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,301
you better be prepared.

107
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,684
You think getting rid of this
will change anything?

108
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,562
I'm warning you.

109
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,982
As long as I remember,

110
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,067
the only way for you to live

111
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,278
is for you to...

112
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,990
stay out of my sight,

113
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,576
and...

114
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,621
not to do a single thing.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,834
That's the only way.

116
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,745
It's only right to apologize
if you do something wrong.

117
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,666
But I feel like
that apology is irresponsible.

118
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,128
Isn't it more irresponsible not to do

119
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,380
anything?

120
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,888
Hurting others and then apologizing...

121
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,309
I feel like it's an excuse
to make myself feel better

122
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,021
without knowing
whether that person's wound...

123
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,485
has healed or grown even deeper.

124
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,904
I guess...

125
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,865
that's how I feel toward you too.

126
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,079
I guess,

127
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,748
that's why I don't want to...

128
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,334
apologize to you.

129
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,045
It's okay.

130
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,884
You don't have to say
what you don't want to.

131
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,719
Right?

132
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,058
How nice would it be if you can't hear
what you don't want to hear?

133
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:50,923
Hey.

134
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,885
Who are you?

135
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,554
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,931
Are you Eun-byeol this time?

137
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,183
Hey, Eun-byeol.

138
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,396
How could you do that to us of all people?

139
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,773
I know I was wrong.

140
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,900
I'm really sorry.

141
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:14,280
I'll ask why you did it
and where you were over time.

142
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,325
The first thing I want to ask is...

143
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,829
Are you okay now?

144
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,914
Yes.

145
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,249
That's all that matters.

146
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,001
Thanks.

147
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,753
Let me get this straight.

148
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,965
The nice Eun-byeol is your sister Eun-bi,

149
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,343
and this rude brat Eun-byeol is

150
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,638
the real Eun-byeol.
That's you, right? But...

151
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,598
Forget it. You're making my head spin.

152
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,144
Your sister must have had
such a tough time because of So-yeong.

153
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,315
She really scares me now.

154
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,860
She has to pay for what she's done.

155
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,820
That's only right.

156
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,701
And tell Eun-bi to give me a call.

157
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,411
She needs a scolding.

158
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,913
The four of us should hang out.

159
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,040
That would be so much fun!

160
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,042
Hae-na,

161
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,505
whatever the reason is,
So-yeong said it wasn't her.

162
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,508
Did I say I don't believe her?

163
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,179
Yes, with the laptop incident
and the fake Eun-byeol incident,

164
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,015
everything So-yeong said was true, but...

165
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,483
Go on.

166
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,363
So, you acknowledge that everything I said

167
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,865
was true, right?

168
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,335
It's a relief the truth
has finally been revealed.

169
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,548
Right, Song-ju?

170
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,469
Yes.

171
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,601
But, So-yeong...

172
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,690
Why is it that after finding out
you told the truth,

173
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,401
I find you even more impossible
to understand?

174
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,945
What?

175
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,114
You really don't get

176
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,118
why everyone is colder to you
than Eun-bi who lied?

177
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,834
Do you make friends
because you need people to believe...

178
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,963
you're the toughest and the best?

179
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,634
I'm saying this genuinely for your sake.

180
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,346
Don't live your life like that.

181
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,855
That was straight to the point.

182
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,023
Very nice.

183
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,025
That was awesome.

184
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,994
How could an 18-year-old girl do something

185
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,497
so heinous to her classmate?

186
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,124
After what she did in the past,

187
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,168
she doesn't repent, but threatens her?

188
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,461
"Threaten"?

189
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,004
Look here.

190
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,216
As I told you,
that supposed video isn't in

191
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,552
her phone, computer, or anywhere else!

192
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,556
They were just joking around!
Don't blow it out of proportion!

193
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,474
Ma'am,

194
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,686
please don't call this "joking around."

195
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,856
Whether or not she had the video,

196
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,275
she used it to torment a friend.

197
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,902
That is wrong.

198
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:46,242
So-yeong is so cold
and doesn't act like an 18-year-old.

199
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,703
Seeing you today, I can see why.

200
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,872
What did you say?

201
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,960
I mean, I pity the girl.

202
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,674
You don't go astray
at that age for no reason.

203
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,971
Please calm down, both of you.

204
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,305
Please sit down.

205
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,516
Please sit down.

206
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,317
After considering
the various circumstances,

207
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,528
I don't think So-yeong

208
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,157
will be able to avoid
a disciplinary hearing.

209
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,618
Excuse me?

210
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:34,081
We have a recording of her
threatening a friend with a video

211
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,667
regardless of whether or not
it actually exists.

212
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,336
And there are many witnesses

213
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:44,425
who said they saw her harass
the student in question.

214
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,388
We'll hold a disciplinary hearing.

215
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,727
But why should my kid be

216
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,897
the only one being disciplined?

217
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,193
A student sent her twin
to school in her place.

218
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,654
Taking turns coming to school

219
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,948
and deceiving the teachers
and the students

220
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,618
isn't against this school's policy?

221
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,958
Punish her as well.

222
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,130
What? Another disciplinary hearing?

223
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,300
-Who is it this time?
-I think it's Class Three again.

224
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,509
There are two of them.

225
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,012
-You don't have money.
-Don't worry about that.

226
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,139
The teacher is here.

227
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,390
Class Three.

228
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,684
Your new teacher is here.

229
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,313
He's Mr. Kim Seul-yeong. He teaches math.

230
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,070
Be good and listen to him, okay?

231
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,363
Yes!

232
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,406
Please introduce yourself.

233
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,246
Nice to meet you.

234
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,541
As long as I'm your teacher,

235
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,711
I guarantee that you will get good grades.

236
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,468
I heard briefly about this class.

237
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,054
I don't need students who are nice

238
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,139
and I don't care if you cause trouble.

239
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,019
But I won't forgive you
for distracting others from studying.

240
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,897
So, be on your toes

241
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,233
and do what you need to do.

242
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,275
Understood?

243
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,992
Hi.

244
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,868
-Hello.
-Hello.

245
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,788
Okay.

246
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,707
Last time...

247
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,550
Tae-gwang.

248
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,261
What are you doing here?

249
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,929
You missed my class?

250
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,098
I did.

251
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,766
How come I didn't realize it?

252
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,021
Your voice is better
than any sleeping pill.

253
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,732
I slept so well just now.

254
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:09,987
Hey.

255
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,781
It doesn't matter
whether or not a spot opens up.

256
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,450
I-an.

257
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,162
Even if you're recovering quickly
and the pain is gone,

258
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,289
you're not well enough to compete.

259
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,790
Coach,

260
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,417
I know.

261
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,544
I'm not trying to win a medal.

262
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,173
I just want to try
like when I first began competing.

263
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,177
You may end up losing your confidence.

264
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,264
Still, I want to give it a shot.

265
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,486
Will you help me pick out a gift
for my dad?

266
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,406
LEE EUN-BI

267
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,825
I'm hungry after training.

268
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,499
Hey!

269
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,209
Come out now!

270
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,258
What are you so happy about?

271
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,097
Damn it.

272
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,308
This isn't what I wanted!

273
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,684
What's not?

274
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,685
Darn it...

275
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,361
I'm at my prep class.

276
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,785
Where are you going?

277
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,079
SH PREP CLASS

278
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,082
Hey.

279
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,460
Hey, Tae-gwang.

280
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,962
What are you doing here?

281
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,631
For class obviously. Not for you.

282
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,009
Class? All you do in school is sleep.

283
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,224
Are you okay?

284
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,560
Yes.

285
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,607
It's nice not having to lie
to anyone anymore.

286
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:14,903
Let's go.

287
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,531
But why am I in a special class?

288
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,510
I-an.

289
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,682
Why are you together?

290
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,978
I take a class here.

291
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,274
Tae-gwang, you take a class here?

292
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,945
Is it strange that a high school student
in Korea is taking a prep class?

293
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,741
Not taking one is strange. Like you.

294
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,661
But...

295
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,164
what are you doing here?

296
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,834
I came to take her home,

297
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,295
since it's on my way back.

298
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,510
Forget it.

299
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,390
I'll go on my own.

300
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,435
I want to go alone.

301
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:34,942
Hey, Eun-bi!

302
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,917
It tickles.

303
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,897
Kwon Gi-tae, one demerit.

304
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,315
What?

305
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,486
Mr. Kim! Why?

306
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,697
Don't talk back to me.

307
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,282
Three demerits.

308
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,667
Kang So-yeong,

309
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,879
why did a good student
like you cause so much trouble?

310
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,384
Two students transferring out
as soon as I transfer in.

311
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,928
Two of the top students at that.

312
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,266
The class average
is going to drop big time.

313
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,481
Let's begin.

314
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,947
My poor daughters have been through a lot.

315
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:10,412
I would like to close the store and move.

316
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,124
And transfer both of you into a new school

317
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,169
and start over. What do you think?

318
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,921
Yes, I would like that.

319
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,426
Yes, me too.

320
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,513
Then let's do that. I'll take care of it.

321
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,558
But I have...

322
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,479
something to tell the both of you.

323
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,606
What is it?

324
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,816
I have been thinking about it for a while.

325
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,778
But back then,

326
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,822
you didn't have anyone else,

327
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,909
so I had given up on it.

328
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,955
But now, you have Eun-bi...

329
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,667
Stop beating around the bush.

330
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,213
There is...

331
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,091
something I want to study.

332
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,521
Hey, Tae-gwang.

333
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,274
-Eat with us.
-Forget it.

334
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,234
Sit.

335
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,792
Hey.

336
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,627
I'm transferring out.

337
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,173
You're really leaving?

338
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,008
It's for the best.

339
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,011
I want to transfer
and go to school with Eun-bi.

340
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,517
And I may leave to study abroad soon.

341
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,979
-Study abroad?
-Where?

342
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,021
So,

343
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,357
be nice to me while I'm here.

344
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,196
I want to say goodbye to Eun-bi too.

345
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,115
Yes.

346
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,909
Let's see Eun-bi before you leave.

347
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,935
Do you want to go
watch a movie this weekend?

348
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,733
Hey.

349
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,359
Is this about moving out?

350
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,778
It will still be where people live.

351
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,363
There will be cars and electricity.

352
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:51,907
I told you that already.

353
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,118
-Tae-gwang...
-I don't care about that.

354
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,166
What about you?

355
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,044
Do you not care that...

356
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,088
you'll be apart from me?

357
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,428
Tae-gwang.

358
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,848
Every time I see you...

359
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,976
I'm always grateful,

360
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,604
but I feel bad at the same time.

361
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,484
I wanted to be as good to you like

362
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,195
you were to me...

363
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,112
Hey.

364
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,405
Fine.

365
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,116
You don't have to answer my question.

366
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,244
I'm fine with...

367
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,874
the way things are now.

368
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,085
That's a lie.

369
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,425
That's why I'm saying this.

370
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,512
I can't

371
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,723
look at you the way...

372
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,519
you look at me.

373
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,069
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,119
I knew that already.

375
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,247
I got it, so get up.

376
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,292
Let's go.

377
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,432
It's anorexia nervosa.

378
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,642
Simply put, she's starving herself.

379
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,562
KANG SO-YEONG

380
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,576
Sekang's biggest outcast, Kang So-yeong,

381
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,702
heads to Hajun High.

382
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,121
I know her. She's a troublemaker.

383
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,415
We're getting another troublemaker.

384
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,126
-Why our school?
-She almost killed someone at Tongyeong...

385
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,545
Kang So-yeong,
who almost killed someone...

386
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,880
Kang So-yeong's identity revealed.

387
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,590
-So-yeong's photo.
-If she comes to my school,

388
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,800
-I don't want to go to school.
-Why our school?

389
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,804
She almost killed someone
at Tongyeong's Noori High.

390
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:22,807
So?

391
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,018
When are you leaving?

392
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,565
After we move,
and as soon as summer vacation starts.

393
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,735
I-an,

394
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,946
make me proud, so I can boast
about being your friend

395
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:37,947
even when I'm abroad.

396
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,911
I have been boasting about
being your friend since I was eight.

397
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:46,956
I-an...

398
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,377
after what happened with Su-in,

399
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,587
I thought a lot

400
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,049
about myself and my friends.

401
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,677
What's important

402
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,848
isn't what others think,
but what my heart says.

403
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,810
Why didn't I know that before?

404
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,775
So, I want to spend more time
fulfilling my dream.

405
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,443
Hey.

406
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,112
You're kind of cool.

407
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,366
And I never said this before...

408
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,036
I always teased you
about getting bad grades,

409
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,498
but when you swim, you're the best.

410
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,130
What?

411
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:38,925
Eun-byeol.

412
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,553
Take care.

413
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,807
Don't forget I'm always rooting for you.

414
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,684
Don't get sick, okay?

415
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,686
You too.

416
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,773
Have you seen Eun-bi?

417
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,867
You're so frustrating.

418
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,995
Both of you are so not my type.

419
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,126
Sorry.

420
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,586
Stop that.

421
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,171
Hey.

422
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,091
I said, stop!

423
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,475
Either stay quiet

424
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,771
or trample her, so she can't say anything.

425
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,105
How many times did I tell you that?

426
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,192
You couldn't take care
of that one little thing

427
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,736
and made me lose my nomination?

428
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,950
-Stop it!
-Stop what?

429
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,660
How many times is this?

430
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:52,081
I worked so hard to get assigned here
after leaving Tongyeong like that.

431
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,834
But because of this brat...

432
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,254
Why should I go through this humiliation?

433
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,423
Honey.

434
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,802
Word has spread all over.
Forget the nomination.

435
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,180
I can't even walk anywhere
with my head up!

436
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,809
Stop it. You're scaring her.

437
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,602
You.

438
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,896
Snap out of it.

439
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,234
If you do something stupid
like this again,

440
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,111
it won't matter
if you're my daughter or not!

441
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,326
Eun-byeol wanted us to hang out with you
as your friend, not hers,

442
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,036
so she didn't come today.
You know that, right?

443
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,164
Let's meet up once in a while
like this after we move.

444
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,124
I don't want to.

445
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,129
I'm going to meet up often.
Right, Song-ju?

446
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,215
Yes. I'm going to come over
every single day.

447
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,258
Please do.

448
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,348
You have gotten so big.
What grade are you in now?

449
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,228
Where is the Air Force Academy Test
practice book?

450
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,529
Bye.

451
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,410
His school has a free semester
and he's been

452
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,247
fixated on becoming a pilot
ever since his field trip.

453
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,752
Even that little thing has a dream.

454
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,842
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
KANG SO-YEONG

455
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,139
I have something to tell you.

456
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:29,948
What is it?

457
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,159
Why do you think I called you here?

458
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,203
I don't know.

459
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,246
Because I have

460
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,874
nowhere to go and no one to meet.

461
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,463
Because you're stupid.

462
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,384
You help anyone you feel sorry for.

463
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,887
You said you pity me

464
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,058
from the first time we met.

465
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,484
There is

466
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:08,903
no video.

467
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,453
I can't make you believe me,
but it's true.

468
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,793
That great sister of yours broke my phone,

469
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,128
so I lost it.

470
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,049
So,

471
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,219
I'm so grateful to Eun-byeol
that I could cry.

472
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:37,724
I think...

473
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,271
at some point,

474
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,191
I forgot how to stop.

475
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,868
I'll never apologize to you.

476
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,913
It's not like anything will change

477
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,750
if you forgive me anyway.

478
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,544
So-yeong,

479
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,380
I know you are...

480
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,842
regretting it.

481
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,597
There is only one thing I can

482
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,224
comfort you with.

483
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,564
That I am still alive.

484
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,612
When you finally realize
you did something wrong,

485
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,741
but the person
you need to apologize to is dead...

486
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,870
Do you know how horrible that would be?

487
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,336
Later on,

488
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:53,049
if you genuinely want
to say something to me,

489
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,928
I hope the fact that I am alive and well

490
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,765
will be of small comfort to you.

491
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,483
Eun-bi.

492
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,304
You need to add that here.

493
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,349
That will be all for today.

494
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,935
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

495
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,362
Tae-gwang.

496
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,699
Are you okay?

497
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,033
Excuse me?

498
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,578
Why were you awake
during class instead of sleeping...

499
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,249
That's not right.

500
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,339
What is it now?

501
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,096
Mr. Kim.

502
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,517
What do you like more than anything?

503
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,478
Why do you ask?

504
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,857
Not just like.

505
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,902
Can you live without seeing the thing

506
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,030
you like more than anything in the world?

507
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,953
Life still goes on.

508
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,249
But why do you ask?

509
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,502
Why can't you see what you like?

510
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,092
Because...

511
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,429
she likes someone else

512
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,806
more than anything and not me.

513
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,146
And I hate seeing her feel bad
all the time too.

514
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,490
Tae-gwang.

515
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,703
You can survive without seeing her,

516
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,039
but...

517
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,918
you can't make yourself
stop liking her, can you?

518
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,630
What?

519
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,216
Can kids these days
do things like that so easily?

520
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,971
Anyway,

521
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,015
you're saying I can live,
if I can handle it, right?

522
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,559
But...

523
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,938
you won't be happy.

524
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,778
Look at you. You're all grown up.

525
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,281
You like a girl now?

526
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,037
Who is it? Who?

527
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,751
Mr. Kim.

528
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,921
What do you like more than anything?

529
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,928
GUMUN HIGH SCHOOL

530
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,598
JOB POST
MATH TEACHER

531
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,384
Are you moving out tomorrow?

532
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,554
No.

533
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,598
It's in a few days.

534
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,103
Are you going to avoid me until you go?

535
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:18,981
No.

536
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,609
Hey, Eun-bi.

537
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,945
I will...

538
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,242
get rid of my feelings, as you want,

539
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,244
so don't worry.

540
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,496
It's okay.

541
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,378
What?

542
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,508
You'll regret dumping me later.

543
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,717
That's for sure.

544
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,844
-Tae-gwang.
-Whatever.

545
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,554
Go home.

546
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,350
The bus stop is right there,
so I won't take you home.

547
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,064
Go.

548
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,275
I said, go.

549
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,394
Hey, Eun-bi.

550
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,151
Mr. Kim said I can keep on living

551
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,113
even if I really like you
if I can withstand it.

552
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,532
So, I decided to

553
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,994
lie to you that I'm going to get over you.

554
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,668
But I don't want to anymore.

555
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,256
So...

556
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,762
I'm going to be honest.

557
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,022
No matter how hard I try,

558
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,777
I can't figure out a way not to like you.

559
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,531
So, I'll just stay like this.

560
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,037
You don't need to feel bad

561
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,290
and you don't need to do anything.

562
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,377
Just know...

563
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,467
how I feel. That's all.

564
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,312
Okay.

565
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,193
Now...

566
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,659
you can really go.

567
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,454
Hey.

568
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,373
Put that away.

569
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,084
Okay.

570
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,509
Hey.

571
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,388
You like I-an, don't you?

572
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,017
Hey.

573
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,687
It's either yes or no.
Why are you so startled?

574
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,360
You really are silly.

575
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,405
Eun-bi...

576
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:42,911
Do you know what upset me the most
after I found out about you?

577
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,999
Why couldn't Mom whom I love the most,

578
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,668
and my sister whom I miss the most

579
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,423
and I be a family?

580
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,134
That was all I wanted.

581
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,846
-Eun-byeol--
-I'm very happy right now,

582
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,808
and I-an is still a very good friend.

583
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,229
Whether you accept him or not is...

584
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:11,940
up to you.

585
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:21,283
I didn't know you would leave so soon.

586
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,204
It feels like time has been passing faster

587
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,040
since we decided to move.

588
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,126
What about the competition?

589
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,253
Can you come watch?

590
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,714
Sorry.

591
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,176
That's my first day at my new school.

592
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,347
Hey.

593
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,100
What's wrong with you?

594
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,852
Are you never going to see me again?

595
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,147
I-an...

596
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,860
I like you.

597
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,329
But right now,

598
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,916
I need to think about who I am...

599
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,171
not the person I like.

600
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,550
So, when I feel like

601
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,428
you and other people

602
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,390
love me for who I am,

603
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,267
that is when...

604
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,690
I can accept your feelings for me.

605
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,285
I told you.

606
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,913
I can wait much longer.

607
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,209
I-an.

608
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:56,962
Take care.

609
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,860
When you can be you and not someone else

610
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,070
and when your feelings
for me becomes clear,

611
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,031
return it to me then.

612
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,077
But...

613
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,623
you have to return it to me

614
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,335
because this is what I treasure the most.

615
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,396
How do you feel
about your first day of school?

616
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,692
-Eun-bi.
-What?

617
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,362
What is it?

618
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,988
Goodness.

619
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,834
The men's 400m freestyle finals
will soon begin.

620
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,796
One of the reasons this is important is
because Han I-an is competing again.

621
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,589
Han I-an was out with an injury
for a while.

622
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:27,135
This is his first competition since that.
I can't wait to see how he will do.

623
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,178
And they're off!

624
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,805
The start was not bad.

625
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,975
It was a great start.

626
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,310
Han I-an is giving his all.

627
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,020
He's taking the lead.

628
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,898
You can't tell he's injured at all.

629
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,651
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

630
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,821
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

631
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,448
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

632
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:53,245
He is swimming very well.
He has reached the 50m mark.

633
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,724
What's going on?

634
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,350
Han I-an has come to a stop.

635
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,270
He can't go forward at all.

636
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,063
He can't move.

637
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,778
-What is going on?
-You can do it!

638
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,281
-Is it his injury?
-What's going on?

639
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,325
He was doing so well today.

640
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,994
That's right. The crowd doesn't know

641
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,371
what to say either.
They are all frozen in place.

642
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,833
-You can do it!
-Go for it!

643
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,961
-Come on!
-Go for it!

644
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,048
Something unbelievable is happening
before our eyes.

645
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,300
Hang in there.

646
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,973
Han I-an has begun to move again.

647
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,768
He is swimming again.

648
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,437
But he is not using his right arm at all.

649
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,023
He is swimming with only his left arm.

650
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,025
Let's go, I-an!

651
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:20,999
-Go Han I-an!
-You can do it!

652
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:10,340
-Go Han I-an!
-Han I-an!

653
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,718
Han I-an!

654
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,386
That's it!

655
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:50,464
SIX MONTHS LATER

656
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,336
Class Three,

657
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,507
we have a new transfer student.

658
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,136
Come in.

659
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,022
-What?
-Who is that?

660
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,612
Hey, Eun-byeol.

661
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,364
Isn't it Eun-bi?

662
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,953
Which one are you?

663
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,210
Hi.

664
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,879
My name is...

665
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,550
Ko Eun-bi.

666
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,679
It's Eun-bi.

667
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,431
-It's her.
-It is Eun-bi.

668
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,864
KO EUN-BI

669
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,875
LEE EUN-BI

670
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,209
ROOFTOP

671
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,661
Hey, Lee Eun-bi!

672
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,790
What is all this?

673
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,794
Did you transfer here?

674
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,129
Really?

675
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,095
Hey, Tae-gwang. Do you want to die?

676
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:50,852
No?

677
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,522
It's weird.

678
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,192
You are Lee Eun-bi, right?

679
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,568
Hey.

680
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,779
I'm Ko Eun-bi.

681
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,118
KO EUN-BI

682
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,497
Darn it.

683
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,583
Look.

684
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,378
You can draw the graph

685
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,672
a distance p toward x, and

686
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,591
a distance q toward y.

687
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,968
Everyone, try drawing it.

688
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,765
Hey! Don't put your head down!

689
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,141
Goodness.

690
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,524
Try that chord.

691
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,908
That's good.

692
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,995
Si-jin. What are you doing?
Does my hair look okay?

693
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,913
-Focus.
-You look so pretty.

694
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:52,956
At 18 years old,

695
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,917
it's too soon to fulfill your dreams,

696
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,087
but the perfect age to start those dreams.

697
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,973
It hurts when you fall,

698
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,936
but it's the perfect age
to learn how to get back up

699
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,438
a hundred times over.

700
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,358
Even if the love you thought
would last forever

701
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,153
ends tragically because of the huge burden

702
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,864
called "college entrance."

703
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,576
You'll break up when you go to college.

704
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,411
Even if you're not accepted into one.

705
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,539
Because we are 18 years old,

706
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,167
-That is what it means.
-we could

707
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,254
-love passionately and hate passionately
-You're so smart.

708
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,674
as if it was the last day on Earth.

709
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:48,887
We are clumsy,

710
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,598
and at an age when we get hurt easily.

711
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,059
So, these years seem

712
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,564
painful and difficult to bear.

713
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,152
But notwithstanding all of that,

714
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,780
I can look back many years later

715
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:11,534
and say I was truly happy during that time

716
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,205
because of a warm hand
that reached out to me

717
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,540
when I had fallen.

718
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,470
Mom, Eun-byeol sent a letter.

719
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,846
Really?

720
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,186
I miss her.

721
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,564
TO MOM AND EUN-BI

722
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,399
I'LL BE BACK SOON. SO STAY HEALTHY!
FROM EUN-BYEOL

723
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,568
She's coming back to Korea soon.

724
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,352
What are you doing?

725
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,939
I'm going to school. You?

726
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,441
Me too.

727
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,693
How have you been?

728
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:28,570
Good.

729
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,324
Did you watch the competition?

730
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,037
No, sorry.

731
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:39,914
Did you do well?

732
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,209
Somewhat.

733
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,548
Liar.

734
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,069
Congratulations, I-an.

735
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,571
You...

736
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,907
What's with your hair?

737
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,450
Why you little...

738
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,035
Hold on.

739
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,996
If only one person, no more, no less,

740
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,373
would go up to a friend who is crying

741
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,667
and offer their hand and say this,

742
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,794
then

743
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,796
there would be

744
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:32,800
no hardship that we cannot overcome.

745
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,239
"It's okay.

746
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,074
It's okay to hurt,

747
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,786
because you are only 18."
