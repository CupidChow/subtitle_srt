1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,183
Being called a swimming prodigy is nice.

2
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,476
It is,

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,603
but it's burdensome.

4
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,523
At first, I couldn't even float properly.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,443
I couldn't make it across the pool
in one go.

7
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:31,406
Watching my friends' backs ahead of me
made me angry,

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,367
so I started coming in an hour earlier

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,704
and leaving two hours later.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,999
I decided to never see
someone else's back again in the water.

11
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,170
Will people be disappointed
to hear that I'm not a prodigy?

12
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,589
Excuse me?

13
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,008
What's important to me?

14
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,969
Swimming isn't everything.

15
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,265
My father and...

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,157
I was frustrated,

17
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,701
so I worked really hard
to get my memory back.

18
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,579
But I shouldn't have.

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,958
I think...

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,629
I'll really miss the days

21
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,964
when I didn't remember anything.

22
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,053
Bye!

23
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,764
I-an.

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,849
Goodbye.

25
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,440
I'll regret it. I won't regret it.

26
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,275
I'll regret it.

I'll regret it.

I won't regret it.

31
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,258
Eun-byeol, I need to tell you something.

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,676
Come out for a bit.

33
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,608
Put your foot on it.

34
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,777
One, two, three.

35
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,780
-Like this?
-Okay, now go forward.

36
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,198
It's hard.

37
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,368
-I'm letting go.
-No.

38
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,494
-I'm letting go!
-Don't!

Come out for a bit.

45
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,477
Did you leave the medal here?

46
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,272
Yes.

47
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,984
I had promised to give it to you,
but you probably don't remember that.

48
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,244

-Cha Song-ju,

53
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,686
massage my shoulder.

54

Quiet!

55
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,702
Everyone sit down. Attention!

56
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,122
We have a new transfer student.

57
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,378
Everything will be new to her,

58
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,091
so help her out until she gets adjusted.

59
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,801
Come in.

60
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,802
Come in.

61
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,701
Introduce yourself.

62
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,037
I came from Tongyeong's
Noori Girls' High School.

63
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,747
I'm Kang So-yeong.

64
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,125
-Tongyeong.
-We were there.

65
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,043
She's from Tongyeong.

66
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,002
Tongyeong.

67
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,922
I hope we can get along.

68
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,715
It's nice to meet...

69
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,182
What's wrong?

70
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,814
What?

71
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,404
Nice to meet you.

72
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,321
Give it up.

73
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,541
-Should I roll out the red carpet?
-I don't know.

74
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,918
-But you know about the story, right?
-I do.

75
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,670
-You heard it, right?
-Oh, right.

76
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,590
May I sit here?

77
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,467
Sure. Sit.

78
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,264
We went to Tongyeong recently
on a school trip.

79
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,640
Really?

80
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
Have you always lived there?

81
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,020
Yes.

82
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,064
My dad was transferred
to the Prosecutors' Office in Seoul.

83
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,733
He's a prosecutor?

84
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,444
Wow, that's so cool.

85
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,654
I-an!

86
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,864
Have this while you train.

87
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,907
Thanks.

88
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,033
Did you see that?

89
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,832
I-an, are you going to training?

90
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,919
-Snack time.
-Nice!

91
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,087
Isn't he a swimmer?

92
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,797
Yes, he is.

93
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,385
You guys must be very close.

94
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,304
Who? Eun-byeol and I-an?

95
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,015
They've been friends
since they were eight.

96
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,854
I need to use the restroom.

97
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,509
Don't you remember me?

98
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,518
I don't...

99
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,354
remember you.

100
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,860
You know, in Tongyeong.

101
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,534
At the hospital.

102
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,203
I did something wrong.

103
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,625
Don't you remember?

104
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,212
Then I'll have to help you remember.

105
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,134
What are you doing? Let go!

106
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,051
Let go.

107
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,511
Let go!

108
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,097
How dare you touch my daughter?

109
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,266
Stay right here. I'm calling the police.

110
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,518
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,689
I must have mistaken her for someone else.

112
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,529
So that was you.

113
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,115
Sorry about that day.

114
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,368
I had a friend
that I didn't get along with,

115
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,329
and I mistook you for her.

116
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,205
"A friend"?

117
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,794
You do that to a friend

118
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,881
just because you didn't get along?

119
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,386
I had my reasons.

120
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,888
Don't get me wrong.

121
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,599
Let's get along, okay?

122
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,648
-Got it?
-Yes.

123
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,067
You know the national diagnostic exam
is coming up, right?

124
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,486
-Gosh.
-Great.

125
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:59,158
Memorizing the EBS English answer book
won't cut it anymore, got it?

126
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,242
Great.

127
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,039
Work on English vocabulary
if you have time for that, okay?

128
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,666
Okay!

129
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,632
You forget to bring your homework
to school,

130
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,634
but you always remember
to put your make-up on, right?

131
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,388
Your skin will rot from all that.

132
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,065
What are you doing?

133
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,779
I wasn't the one who got beaten up,

134
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,365
so I wanted to just give you
demerit points.

135
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,492
But for the sake of peace in our class,

136
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,869
I decided to give you a special penalty.

137
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,372
Clean.

138
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,623
Now.

139
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,378
Hey.

140
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,506
Come here.

141
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,843
Look at each other.

142
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,307
The point of this punishment
isn't cleaning.

143
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,228
Don't look away,
and match each other's movements.

144
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,480
Clean.

145
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,544
Hey!

146
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,297
Shit.

147
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,484
What is your problem?

148
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,612
Mr. Kim. Seriously...

149
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,409
Hey, Kongtae.

150
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,620
What are you doing?

151
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,539
I know, right? Why am I doing this?

152
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,836
LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE

153
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,547
Come home right after class.

154
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,259
If you're in a rush,
you should've waited for me.

155
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,805
If it's infinity over infinity,
what can you use?

156
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,806
L'Hopital's Rule.

157
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,725
Right! L'Hopital's Rule.

158
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,935
So, let's solve this.

159
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,103
In L'Hopital's Rule,

160
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,065
when limit X approaches two,

161
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,067
what if you differentiate the denominator?

162
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,155
-One.
-Right.

163
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,282
If you differentiate the numerator,

164
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,620
it becomes f(2) - 2f'(x).

165
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,206
What you have to note here is...

166
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:57,169
Either switch over to arts
or get her a proper consultant.

167
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,339
She's only a junior. Is that necessary?

168
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,926
Honey.

169
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,513
You should pay more attention to her
instead of keeping yourself in shape.

170
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,306
Getting a tutor in her senior year

171
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,809
is like waiting to see a doctor
until you have stage four cancer.

172
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,524
Even a great doctor
can't do much for you then.

173
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,111
Even a great admission specialist
can't help you much then.

174
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,240
If I get Si-jin a consultant,

175
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,577
can she really get into Hankuk University?

176
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,455
Some patients are cured
after one treatment,

177
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,041
and some need continuous treatment.

178
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,545
You're lucky you met me
before it's too late.

179
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,551
Hey.

180
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,763
-Did it go well?
-Yes.

181
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,766
So, you're Min-jun.

182
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,227
Yes, hello. But...

183
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,522
I'm Si-jin's mom. You know Si-jin, right?

184
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,612
-"Lee Si-jin"?
-Yes.

185
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,447
Si-jin, come here.

186
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,534
Say hi. She's Min-jun's mother.

187
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,120
Hello.

188
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,455
Hi.

189
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,042
You look like such a good girl.

190
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,835
You must look like your dad.

191
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,103
Your admissions have been taken care of.

Hey.

195
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,906
I really...

196
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,867
want to be alone today.

Is this not it?

216
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,388
-What about him and I?
-What's up?

217
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,265
What? What's going on?

218
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,183
Are you a psycho?

219
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,811
Hey, wait.

220
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,147
-Don't do it.
-That's good.

221
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,898
Doesn't she look crazy?

222
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,776
-That will work, right?
-You're so good at it.

223
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,821
You're so good.

224
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,740
-Good job.
-Do it again.

225
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,783
Hey, Eun-byeol.

226
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,536
I got a callback
for the uniform model audition.

227
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,621
Congratulations, Song-ju.

228
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,207
Maybe you'll really become a star.

229
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,293
Do you want my autograph in advance?

230
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,254
-It's Lee Si-jin.
-Lee Si-jong.

231
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,755
-Lee Si-jin.
-Lee Si-jaeng.

232
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,674
-Lee Si-jaeng.
-This is your seat, right?

233
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,800
Sorry.

234
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,720
Thanks.

235
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,602
Would you give me a tour of the school
during lunch?

236
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,562
What?

237
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,771
Are you kidding?

238
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,774
She still gets lost at school.

239
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,569
What do you mean?

240
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,865
Eun-byeol was in an accident
during the school trip,

241
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,117
so she lost her memory.

242
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,453
In Tongyeong?

243
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,123
Oh, no.

244
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,750
What do you mean?

245
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,461
She's totally fine.

246
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,838
Right, Eun-byeol? You'll come back, right?

247
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,839
Yes.

248
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,781
Transfer student.

249
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,283
Come here.

250
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,459
I was worried
I would have to eat by myself.

251
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,627
Thanks.

252
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,340
Have some water.

253
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,930
Of course, you eat alone.

254
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,598
Do you need someone to feed you?

255
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,352
Don't mind him.

256
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,400
You've been friends
since you were eight, right?

257
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,777
Yes, that's right.

258
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,196
You must be very close.

259
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,616
Wow, I-an is such a nice guy.

260
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,159
With this rude brat?

261
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,578
Rude brat?

262
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,667
But...

263
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,046
you really look like her.

264
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,674
Eun-byeol?

265
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,426
With who?

266
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,594
Somebody.

267
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,556
She was in my class in Tongyeong.

268
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,983
How much does she look like her?

269
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,111
She doesn't just look like her,

270
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,405
they're identical.

271
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,449
It's like she came back from the dead.

272
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,701
That's ridiculous.

273
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,703
This is so frustrating.

274
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,164
Do you want me to send you a picture?

275
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,167
I'll call you back.

276
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,838
You must have been feeling bad.

277
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,801
About what?

278
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,806
I mean, you were friends for ten years,

279
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,600
but she didn't even remember your name.

280
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,144
You must have been very close.

281
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,316
Well, that's just what I assume.

282
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,360
Of course.

283
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,489
That's why I hit Eun-byeol
ten times a day.

284
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,746
Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.

285
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,706
It's okay.

286
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,042
Your name is Kang So-yeong, right?

287
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,338
You're quick,
so you'll adjust here in no time.

288
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,715
Later.

289
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,099
You still don't listen to me.

290
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,058
Oh, no.

291
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,101
Do Eun-byeol.

292
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:26,738
Are you okay?

293
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,282
Kongtae, what did you do now?

294
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,535
She was taking a picture.

295
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,121
I'm better looking than they are.

296
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,749
A picture?

297
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,044
Were you...

298
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,630
secretly trying to take a picture of us?

299
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,467
I'm sorry.

300
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,304
You guys looked so nice
hanging out together.

301
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,224
But taking pictures
without permission isn't right.

302
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,934
This face is really expensive now,
you know.

303
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,020
Kongtae, take one of us.

304
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,397
Go on.

305
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,648
Come here.

306
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,736
If you turn it into a selfie, you're dead.

307
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,405
I don't want to be in it.

308
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,906
I'm heading back first.

309
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,533
What's wrong?

310
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,166
Hey, Eun-byeol!

311
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,293
That's more like it.

312
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,795
That's more like the rude brat.

313
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,131
I thought she was acting weird.

314
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,551
Move.

315
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,600
I heard from your father.

316
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,269
You decided to go study abroad?

317
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,941
Did you really agree to it?

318
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,444
If that's what my father wants,

319
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,739
that's what I have to do.

320
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,081
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL FORM

321
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,920
You know there is a two-week

322
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,005
waiting period
for a withdrawal request, right?

323
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,298
I don't really care.

324
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,394
Hello.

325
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,730
Wait for me.

326
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,981
Let go.

327
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,653
Aren't you Han I-an?

328
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,406
I'm Lee Sang-yun of K Ad.

329
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,200
I see.

330
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,618
LEE SANG-YUN, K-AD

331
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,620
This is a famous advertisement agency.

332
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,290
I know you refused, but please reconsider.

333
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:47,837
We can't find a rising star athlete
who is as popular as you.

334
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,426
I'm sorry, but I have
an important competition in May.

335
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,428
I need to focus on training.

336
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,723
I see.

337
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,519
Please call me if you change your mind.

338
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,521
Sure.

339
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,362
No time?
You can go when you don't have training.

340
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,073
That's just not my thing.

341
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,245
APPLICATION FOR STUDYING ABROAD

342
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,487
TO EUN-BYEOL

343
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,405
What are you doing?

344
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:04,998
Are you sleeping?

345
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,135
-What are you doing here?
-What?

346
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,179
Why? What?

347
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:44,788
Hey.

348
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,914
What?

349
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,499
I'm hungry.

350
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,504
Let's go.

351
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,471
How's my gold medal doing?

352
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,014
Good.

353
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,476
But what was the promise?

354
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,562
To give you my first gold medal
from a national competition.

355
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,439
I see.

356
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,484
You were at a competition
during the school trip.

357
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,404
-Is that when you won it?
-Yes.

358
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,366
I went straight to Tongyeong that night,
but I couldn't give it to you.

359
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,328
You were really upset.

360
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,376
I did go. Briefly, at night.

361
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,795
No one else knew about it.

362
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,880
Of course not.

363
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,967
I quietly saw the only person
I wanted to see.

364
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,310
-Are you done?
-What?

365
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,068
We used to come here all the time.

366
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,780
We always ate ramyeon like this.

367
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,325
We did?

368
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,038
This is cruel.

369
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,959
How could you erase
every single memory of me?

370
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,922
Do you want me to help you
get your memory back?

371
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:19,799
No.

372
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,471
You don't want to remember me?

373
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,657
HIGH SCHOOL, MALE 400M SWIMMING

374
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,540
Eun-byeol, did you know?

375
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,545
I-an must like you a lot.

376
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,684
MISSING PERSON
NAME: KO EUN-BYEOL

377
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,690
That's insane.

378
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,984
Is this the girl you met in Seoul?

379
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,904
She went missing when Eun-bi died.

380
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,531
What? Are they twins?

381
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,202
Missing?

382
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,039
Eun-bi.

383
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,416
Eun-byeol.

384
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,419
Give me that.

385
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,595
Eun-byeol.

386
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,973
Did I upset you?

387
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,435
I'm sorry.

388
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,105
I didn't mean anything by it.

389
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,859
I'll be careful from now on.

390
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,069
Don't be mad, okay?

391
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,950
Hey, Eun-byeol.

392
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,536
It's my fault, okay?

393
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,080
She took it because I was so pretty.

394
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,003
Forgive me.

395
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,818
Eun-byeol, just let it go.

396
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,655
What is up with her? She's acting so mean.

397
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,117
She must've gotten her memory back.
Her temper is back.

398
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,285
I guess so.

399
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,637
Eun-byeol.

400
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,557
Who...

401
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,770
Are you...

402
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,064
Su-in?

403
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,778
I heard you lost your memory.

404
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,822
I guess you didn't get it back yet.

405
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,867
Su-in...

406
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,246
died last year.

407
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,546
JEONG SU-IN

408
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,217
Eun-byeol.

409
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,344
Aren't you Eun-byeol?

410
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,097
You came over often
when you were in grade school.

411
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,223
Don't you remember me?

412
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,641
"Jeong Su-in"?

413
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,685
I'm Su-in's mom.

414
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,769
CAN WE MEET ONE LAST TIME?

415
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:00,687
FROM: JEONG SU-IN

416
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,734
Eun-byeol!

417
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,162
LIBRARY FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS

418
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,857
A808. 3-3-23-12

419
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:10,173
EUN-BYEOL, IT'S OKAY TO IGNORE ME.
YOU ARE STILL MY ONE AND ONLY FRIEND.

420
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:18,014
EUN-BYEOL, IT'S OKAY TO IGNORE ME.
YOU ARE STILL MY ONE AND ONLY FRIEND.

421
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,221
Eun-byeol skipped class
and isn't picking up her phone.

422
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,599
That transfer student, So-yeong,
seems okay,

423
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,976
but I guess Eun-byeol
really doesn't like her.

424
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,354
-Bye.
-Hey, Kongtae.

425
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,982
Take this to the bus stop, please.

426
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,401
-What is it?
-It's Eun-byeol's bag.

427
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,820
-Eun-byeol?
-Yes.

428
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,368
Hey, Kongtae!
What are you going to do with that?

429
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,037
Bring it back tomorrow!

430
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,165
Isn't he being weird?

431
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,251
Isn't he always weird?

432
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,169
That's true.

433
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,504
Anyway...

434
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,840
do you want to get spicy rice cakes?

435
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,050
I have my study group.

436
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,013
My poor baby, you can't even eat with me.

437
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,436
Start the quiz now.

438
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,026
The questions of this degree of difficulty
must be answered within a minute.

439
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,783
One minute passed.
Move on to the next question.

440
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,745
If you can't answer those questions
in a minute,

441
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,123
don't even dream of going to S University.

442
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,934
One minute passed. Next one.

443
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,689
Hey, Min-jun.

444
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,359
Does that girl from your class
even get this stuff?

445
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,737
Ask Si-jin yourself.

446
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,572
At what level is she?

447
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,657
She was struggling
with the workbook earlier.

448
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,076
Aren't her grades
significantly lower than ours?

449
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,746
What's the point of doing
a diagnostic test then?

450
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,041
Why do you think?

451
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,794
The one replacing Eun-byeol opted out.

452
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,298
All of you saved 500,000 won each
thanks to Si-jin.

453
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,553
We better be nice to her then.
She's our benefactor.

454
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,096
Right.

455
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:21,822
HAN I-AN

456
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,834
You punk.

457
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,712
You need to tell me right away
if you're injured!

458
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,466
Do you realize how many swimmers
hide small injuries

459
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,176
and end up giving up their careers?

460
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,845
Coach, I'm fine.

461
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,181
Sit out on this competition
and focus on rehab.

462
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,141
I need to compete this time!

463
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,063
Do you want to retire
after the May competition?

464
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,984
The rest of you, tell me right away
if you have any problems, okay?

465
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,568
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

466
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,906
Coach!

467
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,825
-Coach.
-Go.

468
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,209
Can't I quit that study group?

469
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,716
It's only been a few days.

470
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,094
I don't want to do it.

471
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,847
I'm not even at their level.

472
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,811
That's your problem.

473
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,271
You're so weak.

474
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,024
You need to work hard
until you reach their level.

475
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,817
Do you plan to fail without even trying?

476
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,420
Why are you crying?

477
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,674
Fine.

478
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,803
Let's switch over to arts then.

479
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,265
Do you want to paint?

480
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,770
Min-jun's mom said there's hope
if I get you an expensive tutor.

481
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,522
Music won't work though.

482
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,608
Mom.

483
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,319
I don't understand you.

484
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,696
Then how will you get into college?

485
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,323
What do you want to do?

486
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,203
I said I'll do anything you want.
Why are you crying?

487
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,831
Oh, my gosh. Hey, Si-jin!

488
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,166
What...

489
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,085
Si-jin!

490
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,836
Si-jin!

491
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,216
Where are you going?

492
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,681
I'm crying because there is nothing
I want to do, okay?

493
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,104
I am not as smart as dad
or as pretty as you!

494
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,606
Why was I born like this?

495
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,317
I'm not good at anything!

496
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,764
That kid followed me again today.

497
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,369
I'll know who it is if I turn around,

498
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,622
but I'm afraid to face
the person threatening me,

499
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,749
so I can't.

500
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,302
When I'm alone,

501
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,429
that kid turns off the lights,

502
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,723
closes the door,

503
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,892
and...

504
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,895
disappears before I can find a trace.

505
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,027
I can't tell Mom

506
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,488
or cry out loud

507
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,491
because

508
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,410
I deserve to be punished.

509
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,974
Why are you so out of it?
You didn't even hear me come.

510
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,523
What's wrong?

511
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,651
Something is wrong, isn't it?

512
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,654
I-an.

513
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,201
You said you would help me
get my memory back, right?

514
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,663
Help me.

515
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,459
I need to know

516
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,253
how I used to be.

517
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,091
I...

518
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,511
want to be the Ko Eun-byeol from before.

519
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,605
Okay. I'll get you your memory back.

520
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:14,109
But if you get it back thanks to me,
you should grant me a wish.

521
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,072
Promise?

522
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,783
Promise me.

523
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,123
Grant me a wish.

524
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,490
What are you doing?

525
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:08,580
Go in.

526
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,165
Okay.

527
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,052
I'll give you ten seconds.

528
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:28,851
What is it?

529
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,106
I'LL GIVE YOU TEN SECONDS

530
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,702
That hurts. Shoot!

531
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,501
What the...

532
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,587
Aren't you here to pass the bag?

533
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,255
So we're done here.

534
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,428
No.

535
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,930
I came to see Eun-byeol.

536
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,362
See her tomorrow.

537
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:28,952
Darn it.

Ra-jin.

547
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,496
Eun-byeol.

548
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,840
TONGYEONG OFFICIALS
SPONSORING HOUSE OF LOVE

549
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,809
It's okay.

550
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,812
Cry if you want to.

551
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,609
When it is hard,

552
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,902
let's not hold back our tears

553
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,156
and cry together.

554
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,283
Okay?

555
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,164
Okay, Mom.

556
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,432
Do you need anything?

557
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,101
No, I'm fine.

558
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,021
Do you want some new clothes?

559
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,648
I have plenty in my closet.

560
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,365
Eun-byeol.

561
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,536
Tell me if you need anything
or want to do anything.

562
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,082
A daughter is supposed
to ask her mom about those.

563
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,541
Okay?

564
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,383
Mom.

565
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,844
Did you see the diary...

566
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,515
Never mind.

567
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,227
I don't think I will do so well
on exams this time.

568
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,436
What should I do?

569
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,815
Don't stress about it.

570
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,317
Still,

571
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,820
I'll do my best.

572
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,571
Of course.

573
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,615
I'll help you.

574
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,493
Eat, okay?

575
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,962
-What? Eun-byeol.
-Eun-byeol!

576
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:07,879
Hey.

577
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:08,964
Hi, I-an.

578
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,883
-Kongtae gave you the bag?
-How?

579
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:14,469
I was afraid he would have thrown it out.

580
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,055
Oh, my.

581
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,349
Sorry.

582
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:22,978
What the...

583
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:25,772
What?

584
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,165
I said I would call
once the study groups are set.

585
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,167
There's no need.

586
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,503
Take Eun-byeol out of all of them.

587
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,755
Goodness.

588
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,548
Were you offended by something?

589
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,262
I put her in because everyone does,

590
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:02,100
but I always felt bad for Eun-byeol.

591
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,104
I won't make her suffer anymore
to feed my greed.

592
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,525
You're making me tear up.

593
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,695
You think that's love, don't you?

594
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,697
That's being irresponsible.

595
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,324
Think it over.

596
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,576
Once she leaves, it may be over for good.

597
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:20,869
I know.

598
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,915
I came to end it for good.

599
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,432
It's Tae-gwang's withdrawal request.

600
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,893
He said he will go

601
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,686
if it is his father's wishes.

602
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,816
That means it isn't by his choice.

603
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,568
When will it be processed?

604
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,196
Must you send him away?

605
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,534
He's causing trouble to spite me.

606
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,662
It's best for him if I'm out of his sight.

607
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,750
So you are rationalizing
your decisions again,

608
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,253
just like last year.

609
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,214
Jun-seok.

610
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,424
Just do what I ask.

611
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,973
I'll hold onto this.

612
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,685
The next time he gets in trouble,
I won't report it to you.

613
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,771
I'll take care of it myself.

614
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,120
Hi.

615
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,830
-Hi.
-Hi.

616
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,835
Well...

617
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,462
about Eun-byeol.

618
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,882
Eun-byeol? What about her?

619
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,844
When she got amnesia,
she didn't recognize you?

620
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,389
That isn't all.
She was a completely different person.

621
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,640
That's right.

622
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,602
When that cold Eun-byeol first saw me,

623
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,064
she said, "Hi."

624
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,650
Si-jin lent Eun-byeol her notes,

625
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,736
and she said her handwriting
was completely different too.

626
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,070
I see.

627
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,282
-Really?
-Isn't that surprising?

628
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,244
But why are you so interested
in Eun-byeol?

629
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,455
What?

630
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,416
No reason.

631
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,293
It's just interesting.

632
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,845
Hey, bring that.

633
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,805
-Do you want to go to the snack bar?
-Sure.

634
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,641
-Eun-byeol, are you coming?
-No.

635
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,143
-I-an, let's go to the snack bar.
-We'll be back.

636
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,400
Eun-byeol.

637
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,820
Can we talk?

638
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,832
What is it?

639
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,793
Actually...

640
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,922
I have a problem.

641
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,632
I don't want to hear your problems.

642
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,009
Find someone else.

643
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,887
When I was in Tongyeong,

644
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,227
there was an infamous outcast in my class.

645
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,773
She was the class president
and popular in junior high,

646
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,610
but she didn't know her place

647
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,487
and her life was ruined instantly.

648
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,202
2 YEARS AGO
TONGYEONG NOORI MIDDLE SCHOOL

649
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,459
Oh Jeong-a, short and stubby. Incredible.

650
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,337
There is no other way to describe her.

651
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,149
Guys, please stop.

652
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,527
And So-yeong, don't you think
you're being too mean?

653
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,039
That's our class president,
the keeper of justice.

654
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,791
Eun-bi rocks. She's so authoritative.

655
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,170
Shielding her won't make Stubby
any taller.

656
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,380
Stop calling her Stubby.

657
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,507
Stubs will be offended.

658
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,307
Excuse me.

659
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,897
I need to tell you something.

660
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,445
Hey, Eun-bi.

661
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,115
Do you realize what you did?

662
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,660
I got three days of suspension,
but that's it for me.

663
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,164
But our poor Jeong-a

664
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,461
will go from our class' Short and Stubby
to school's Official Outcast.

665
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,504
Hey!

666
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,631
What do you think you're doing?

667
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,591
Hey.

668
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:30,470
Stop picking on the weak
and take it out on me instead.

669
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,056
Can you handle it?

670
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,186
Fine.

671
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,313
If that's what you want,

672
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,108
I'll grant you your wish.

673
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,989
I mean,

674
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,118
friends can fool around.

675
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,037
But she killed herself,

676
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,751
so I had to transfer
when I did nothing wrong.

677
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,636
So?

678
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,347
What do you want to say?

679
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,183
Can someone who died...

680
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,103
come back from the dead?

681
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,899
Pretending to be someone else

682
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,944
and fooling everyone around her.

683
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:36,661
So I want to look into
whether that outcast

684
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,581
died or is still alive.

685
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,963
Your friend died,

686
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,508
and that's all you can think of?

687
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,554
I feel sorry for you.

688
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,308
Since the day

689
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,519
you transferred to my grade school,

690
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,189
I have been feeling sorry for you.

691
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,113
I knew you would say that.

692
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,909
Our little outcast.

693
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,453
You haven't changed a bit.

694
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,874
Hey.

695
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,667
Lee Eun-bi.

696
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,128
It's been a while.

697
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,507
If you hurt Song-ju,

698
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,883
I won't forgive you.

699
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,886
Not because you have something to hide?

700
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,680
Is that so easy?

701
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,348
Give it up.

702
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,517
I'm just getting started.

703
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,893
Fine, let's do this.

704
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,145
Then why are you following me around
and getting on my nerves?

705
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,355
Because I'm worried!

706
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,107
Hey, Tae-gwang. What's your deal?

707
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,901
Don't call Eun-byeol out tonight.
