1
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,266
Look at this.

2
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,269
They are Lee Eun-bi's
and Eun-byeol's handwriting.

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,813
They are exactly the same, aren't they?

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,150
I'm going to ask my dad
to get it verified.

5
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,236
Do you want me to tell you a secret too?

6
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,447
My name...

7
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,407
is Ko Eun-byeol.

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,075
Don't believe

9
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,327
anything I say.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,956
Given what happened,

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,209
I guess I should come clean,
just like you said.

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:44,919
Right?

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,464
That's only fair.

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:54,846
Sure.

15
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,391
Do it. I'm really curious too.

16
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,310
By the way...

17
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,479
if both of you spill your secrets,

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,023
who do you think is at a greater loss?

19
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:10,779
Hey.

20
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,447
Kong Tae-gwang.

21
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,327
What? Having second thoughts?

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,206
Then be careful

23
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,124
until the results come out.

24
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,765
Eun-byeol, let's skip school today.

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,392
Hey! What are you doing?

26
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,529
Hey.

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,781
You can have...

28
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,659
at least one person, right?

29
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,830
Someone to call you by your real name.

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,667
Can I...

31
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,633
be that person?

32
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,600
Hey.

33
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,145
I just talked to So-yeong,
and she said it wasn't her.

34
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,273
It was about the school next to hers, and
she moved here because of her dad's job.

35
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,066
So don't go around spreading rumors.

36
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,028
Especially you, Yun-jae. I will kill you.

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,159
"I will kill you."

38
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,454
She says it isn't her.

39
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,916
-She said no.
-What was that about?

40
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,335
-That was vicious.
-What a way to start the morning.

41
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,019
What's my real name?

42
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,359
You said you would call me
by my real name.

43
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,820
So, what is my real name?

44
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,047
Ko Eun-byeol.

45
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,302
You're Ko Eun-byeol.

46
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,682
So act like Ko Eun-byeol.

47
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,558
Don't act like you did something wrong.

48
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,311
Hey.

49
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,522
I don't know why,

50
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,817
but I can't stand to see you
get flustered in front of So-yeong.

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,859
That's why I told you

52
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,279
not to worry about me.

53
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,655
Then make me not worry!

54
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,075
Crush So-yeong
so that she will stop snooping around

55
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,952
and trying to get information on you.

56
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,454
That's what Ko Eun-byeol would do.

57
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,208
So-yeong already knows

58
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,461
that Lee Eun-bi and Ko Eun-byeol
have the same handwriting.

59
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,339
How long will you
just stand there and deny it?

60
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,141
So, I'm saying I'll help you...

61
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,812
for you to live as Eun-byeol.

62
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,578
It's an M. What is the K?

63
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,246
A real number.

64
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,835
I am sorry.

65
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,090
Hey, Tae-gwang.

66
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,009
This is a warning.

67
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,510
Come to class on time.

68
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,305
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,518
Loser.

70
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,195
This is your math evaluation result.

71
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,990
It must have been difficult.
Only one person got a perfect score.

72
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,285
I'll leave it here, so come and check.

73
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,830
Study hard for other evaluations as well.

74
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,290
Got it?

75
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,626
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

76
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:18,836
That's all.

77
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,589
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you.

78
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,346
Kang So-yeong? Not Park Min-jun?

79
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,515
Look at Eun-byeol's score.

00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,561

KO EUN-BYEOL 16.5

81
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,814
She said her memory loss
wouldn't hurt her studies,

82
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,107
but I guess not.

83
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,900
-She's finished.
-Let's go.

84
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,819
Get out of the way.

85
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,619
Min-jun, are you okay?

86
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,829
I'm fine.

87
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,895
Why are you back already?

88
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,773
Are you sick?

89
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,610
Yes, I left school early
because I didn't feel well.

90
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,655
Is everything okay at school?

91
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,824
Yes.

92
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,952
-Do you want to go see a doctor?
-It's not that bad.

93
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,246
You don't look well.

94
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,083
You should've gone home.
Why did you come here?

95
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,754
Let me stay with you a little while.

for my daughter.

00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,385
About what?

186
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,893
Is it okay to talk about it anywhere

187
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,728
like this?

188
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,942
So-yeong.

189
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,069
Come with me.

190
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,619
My legs are killing me.

191
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,665
I heard you were surprised yesterday.

192
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,084
You mean the newspaper articles?

193
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,003
Why would I be?

194
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:35,507
Lee Eun-bi is alive and well right here.

195
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,885
Are you not afraid of me?

196
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,802
What?

197
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,387
Afraid of you?

198
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,473
My gosh.

199
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,186
You used to quiver in fear
whenever you saw me,

200
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,437
and now, look at you.

201
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,445
I feel sorry for you.

202
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,448
Of all the schools out there,

203
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,366
why Sekang High School?

204
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,204
If you hadn't met me,

205
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,748
you could've started new

206
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,542
like nothing ever happened.

207
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:12,961
Hey.

208
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,505
Don't try so hard.

209
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,883
You're so pathetic, it's painful to watch.

210
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,678
When I first transferred in,

211
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,057
I knew when I saw the look in your eyes.

212
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,311
"I'm doomed."

213
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,439
That's what your eyes said.

214
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,778
So what?

215
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,447
You'll get my handwriting verified?

216
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:43,951
I know

217
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,329
I can make sure

218
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,499
nobody believes a word

219
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,918
you say.

220
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,171
Do you really think

221
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,507
you can get me with just that?

222
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,975
It will be such a pain to unwillingly
transfer and adjust to another school.

223
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,143
Right.

224
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,437
I guess it wouldn't be a transfer.

225
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,733
If I expose everything
you did to my sister,

226
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,655
you'll end up somewhere else,
not at school.

227
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,700
I don't need to say

228
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,994
where that is, do I?

229
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,746
And where is that?

230
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,165
Where is it?

231
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,460
Do it if you can.

232
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,504
Do it!

233
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,676
My sister may have taken your threats,

234
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,720
but not me.

235
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,639
You underestimated me.

236
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,107
Let's see

237
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,776
who underestimated who.

238
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,573
How is school?

239
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,867
It's good.

240
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,287
Except for one thing.

241
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,206
What is it?

242
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,711
Remember that girl in Tongyeong
from House of Love?

243
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
The girl who died?

244
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,509
Yes. Lee Eun-bi.

245
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:09,888
A girl in my class

246
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,599
looks exactly like her.

247
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,351
Goodness.

248
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,145
Supposedly, they were twins
who were separated,

249
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,688
but something is weird.

250
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,112
Look at this.

251
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,947
They're identical, right?

252
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,032
I think Eun-bi is alive.

253
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,367
That's absurd.

254
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,077
I'm sure of it, Dad.

255
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,250
Dad, can you get these analyzed?

256
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,305
Honey.

257
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,559
You didn't even hear the whole story.

258
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,105
Did you forget why I had to leave the
place I have been working for ten years

259
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,315
and moved to Seoul?

260
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,360
I know. I do.

261
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,826
I'm doing this to clear my name and
prove that I didn't make her kill herself.

262
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,452
Whatever anyone may say,
that case was closed

263
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:18,081
with her being the attacker
and you being the victim.

264
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,002
Don't look into it anymore and just study.

265
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:26,173
-Still, the rumors--
-What can rumors do?

266
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,674
They will last a year or two at most.

267
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,802
Stop acting weak,
and don't let anyone use it against you.

268
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,762
You must forget about it first.

269
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,873
-She died?
-Oh, my gosh.

270
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,832
Did she kill her?

271
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,543
-She killed herself because...
-She died?

272
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,422
It gives me the creeps.

273
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,715
A murderer is a bit harsh.

274
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,717
Kang So-yeong didn't kill her though.

275
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,596
If she died because of her, it's murder.

276
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,311
Lee Eun-bi.

277
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,814
You're alive and well.

278
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,650
How dare you do this to me?

279
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,945
I will...

280
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,030
never give up.

281
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,713
2015 MATH EVALUATION PARK MIN-JUN

282
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,759
I asked Mr. Kim to go over your answers.

283
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,013
I checked already. I did make a mistake.

284
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,473
-Did you?
-Yes.

285
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,267
The answer is correct,

286
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,894
but I made a small mistake on the graph,
so marks were deducted.

287
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,312
Why did you make a mistake like that?

288
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,023
Isn't it annoying to do well
on the written test

289
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,608
but lose points on the evaluation?

290
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,569
-Mom, it's only 0.5 points.
-Min-jun.

291
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,613
Don't underestimate 0.5 points.

292
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,699
Even 0.1 points
can make a huge difference.

293
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,911
Min-jun.

294
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,497
You know what I do for a living, right?

295
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,251
How can I teach students to succeed
when you're doing so badly?

296
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,588
Who would trust
my method of success if you fail?

297
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,217
I won't fail.

298
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,303
You better not.

299
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,098
Do you want to eat now?

300
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,726
-Finish up and come out.
-Okay.

301
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,229
By the way,

302
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,816
what did that So-yeong girl get?

303
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,651
I don't know.

304
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,786
2015 MATH EVALUATION PARK MIN-JUN

305
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,299
My wallet. What?

306
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:15,967
Darn it.

307
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,429
-Hey, Min-seong.
-Hey, you haven't paid yet.

308
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,974
I know someone back there.
Give me a minute.

309
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,642
-Hey!
-For two people, please.

310
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,396
Including me?

311
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,154
Hey.

312
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,450
-Hey.
-Thank you.

313
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,543
I want to show you my gratitude
for helping me out.

314
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,379
May I have your number?

315
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,392
I'll pay you back.

316
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,531
You know there is
a transfer student, right?

317
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,074
Her mom will be here soon.

318
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,535
You mean that girl, So-yeong?

319
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,452
Yes.

320
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,040
I heard she was the only student who got
a perfect score on the math evaluation.

321
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,586
My goodness, I guess it doesn't matter
where you live.

322
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,713
Smart kids are just smart.

323
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,730
Hello. I'm So-yeong's mom.

324
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,149
-Hello.
-Hello.

325
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,526
I'm Min-jun's mom.

326
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,404
-Hello.
-Why don't you sit here?

327
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,828
Since you're busy all the time,

328
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,289
I'll get right to the point.

329
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,042
I'm sure she will have to take a test,

330
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,172
but I brought these for your reference.

331
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,216
Oh, my goodness.

332
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,217
REPORT CARD

333
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,137
She is at the highest level
in every subject.

334
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,096
Oh, my goodness.

335
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,681
Look at this.

336
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,058
Calm down.

337
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,110
KANG SO-YEONG
TONGYEONG NOORI HIGH SCHOOL

338
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,741
REPORT CARD

339
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,579
These are impressive.

340
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,873
But the group is full right now.

341
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,458
I thought there was room for one--

342
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,131
Why?

343
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,259
You think Min-jun's morale will drop

344
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,094
if someone with better grades
joins his group?

345
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,349
Of course not.

346
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,352
I'm sorry if I misunderstood you.

347
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,104
I heard many Piggy Moms create groups

348
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:19,651
only with kids who have grades
slightly lower than their own kids.

349
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,444
Goodness. Really?

350
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,032
I don't mean that you do that.

351
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,994
It's understandable
why you would think that

352
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,163
since you don't know how things work here.

353
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,289
What do you mean?

354
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:37,502
So-yeong was tutored in Tongyeong

355
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,921
by a famous tutor too.

356
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,303
The English evaluation is making
a vacation brochure for Tongyeong.

357
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,221
You know that, right?

358
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,182
-Do we have to?
-Why?

359
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,308
Quiet.

360
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,686
You went there on your school trip,
so it should be easy.

361
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,107
I've assigned you to groups of three.
Work together to make a great outcome.

362
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,024
Min-jun.

363
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,569
Check your groups. That's all.

364
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,404
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

365
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,076
-Let's see.
-Where is my name.

366
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,994
What?

367
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,788
Of all the people...

368
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,082
Look who's talking.

369
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,171
Does this mean that the English teacher
will give us credits or what.

370
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,798
What should we do?

371
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,301
Let's come up with a team name first.

372
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,679
"We Have No Hopes or Dreams".

373
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,890
A team name? Forget it.
There is no answer.

374
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,182
"Team No Answer"?

375
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,143
"Team No Solution"?

376
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,857
Hey, Gi-tae.

377
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,525
You went on the school trip.

378
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:43,943
Pictures.

379
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,945
You took pictures, right?

380
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,615
I have plenty of pictures.

381
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:52,785
Here.

382
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,712
Hey.

383
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,340
How would anyone know this was Tongyeong?

384
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,383
Forget it. "Team Dead for Sure".

385
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,427
Forget that.

386
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,181
Let's collect 50,000 won each and have
a brochure company make it for us.

387
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,058
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

388
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,101
I have to get to training.

389
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,436
Where's your money?

390
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,104
"Team No Money".

391
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,566
"Team No Cards"?

392
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,746
Hey, Tae-gwang!

393
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,000
Don't bother Eun-byeol.

394
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:42,877
Me?

395
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,546
Not you?

396
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,383
Don't cause trouble and get her hurt.

397
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,759
-Hey, that was--
-Later.

398
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,096
Hey, Swimmer Han I-an.

399
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,435
I'm not going to bother Ko Eun-byeol.

400
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,396
And I will never let her get hurt,

401
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,898
so stay out of it.

402
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,003
Hey, look here.

403
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,046
You're the only one missing.

404
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,092
This is when you disappeared
and scared us to death.

405
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,052
-Right.
-Really?

406
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,939
Get in! All together!

407
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,191
Everyone is here, right?

408
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,579
By the way,

409
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,290
you know the wound on your neck?

410
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,668
I think you got it just before
I saw you on the school trip.

411
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,005
I don't know.

412
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,799
Eun-byeol, you take Mireuksa Temple.

413
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,177
You take Dongpirang Village.
I'll do Undersea Tunnel.

414
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,678
-Good?
-Sure.

415
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,305
Then let's write
the introduction separately,

416
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,432
and let's meet later
to talk about putting it all together.

417
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,562
Eun-byeol.

418
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,148
Hey, snap out of it.

419
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,026
What? What did you say?

420
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,034
I would like to check my phone records
from a month ago.

421
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:44,040
You can check the record
at one of our stores or online.

422
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,419
PHONE CALL RECORDS

423
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,469
PARK MIN-JUN
CHA SONG-JU

424
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,320
"April 27, 2015."

425
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,989
"At 9:45 p.m."?

426
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,884
Hello?

427
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,387
Hello?

428
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,849
Eun-byeol?

429
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,108
-Lipgloss?
-I'll put it on you.

430
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,068
-Should I try?
-Yes

431
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,070
I can't.

432
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,743
Is it okay?

433
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,960
What's taking Song-ju so long?

434
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,962
How would I know?

435
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,131
Why don't you call her
if you want to know?

436
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,386
Sorry, I'm late.

437
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,762
Hey.

438
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,056
Did you finish your tutoring session?

439
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,057
Yes.

440
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,310
Lee Si-jin.

441
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,439
Hey, is there something wrong?

442
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,483
I have no time,
so let's split up the work.

443
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,527
These are pictures from Tongyeong.

444
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,824
That's right.

445
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,410
Eun-byeol is the only one missing here.

446
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:49,916
If we had dragged her out of the bathroom,
she would never have gone missing.

447
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,126
-The bathroom?
-Yes.

448
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,086
You called us over, remember?

449
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,673
The bathroom before we took
the group photo?

450
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,133
Yes, there.

451
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,895
Hey, Si-jin!

452
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,814
-Song-ju.
-What?

453
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,733
We're taking a group photo. Hurry.

454
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:16,984
Okay.

455
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,153
-Let's go.
-Okay.

456
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,743
-But Si-jin...
-What?

457
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,248
Didn't you hear a scream
after you left the bathroom?

458
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,749
"A scream"?

459
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,168
What does he mean?

460
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,631
Hey, Si-jin.

461
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,718
What happened when you went back
for your pouch?

462
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,599
Why aren't you saying anything?
What is it?

463
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,646
You are acting a bit strange.

464
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,275
What do you mean by strange?

465
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,361
What are you imagining?

466
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,239
Do you think I harmed
Eun-byeol or something?

467
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,740
Think about it.

468
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,660
You had no problem saying
she was fighting with a guy.

469
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,122
Why didn't you say
what happened in the bathroom?

470
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,166
You should have told me
if something was wrong,

471
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,585
or you should have brought Eun-byeol out.

472
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,134
Right.

473
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,387
I left my pouch in the bathroom.
Wait for me.

474
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,180
That's unlike you.

475
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,432
-Go and get it.
-Okay.

476
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,162
Is it you again?

477
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,582
How long will you keep doing this?

478
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,586
Eun-byeol.

479
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,258
Is she on the phone?

480
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,987
Yes, I thought it was strange,

481
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,990
but I called her name,
and she didn't respond.

482
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,410
She was in a bad mood
since the day before,

483
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,372
so I thought she was fighting
on the phone.

484
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,956
I assumed she would be okay.

485
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,584
Are you kidding me right now?

486
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,505
I liked having you all to myself
during the trip,

487
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,631
so I pretended not to notice.

488
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,590
I admit it.

489
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,092
-Hey.
-But...

490
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,262
I regretted it after she disappeared.

491
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,724
You aren't the only one who went
through a hard time. I had it worse!

492
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,728
Hey, Si-jin.

493
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,064
You know nothing about it.

494
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,994
I was surprised that you called.

495
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,163
Sorry.

496
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,333
I needed to ask you something right away.

497
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,377
What is it?

498
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:22,920
Did you...

499
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,297
call me that night

500
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,050
we went on the school trip?

501
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,303
Do you...

502
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,722
remember?

503
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,476
That night,

504
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,854
we met up, remember?

505
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,607
I won.

506
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,776
-Man...
-Punishment time!

507
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,238
-No way.
-It's pretty sexy, right?

508
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,282
-What about this?
-It's this one.

509
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,286
YEON MI-JU

510
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,092
This.

511
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,386
This is you, isn't it?

512
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,764
JUST BECAUSE IT'S IN THE PAST,
DOESN'T MEAN IT NEVER HAPPENED

513
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,849
JEONG SU-IN

514
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,686
Look carefully.

515
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,855
It's from Su-in.

516
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,190
Exactly.

517
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,444
Did you send me this strange text
using Su-in's name?

518
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,491
Why?

519
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,701
Do you feel guilty about something?

520
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,413
Why did you do it
if you were going to be this scared?

521
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,751
You have Su-in's phone, don't you?

522
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,796
Give it to me. Where is it?

523
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,090
-Where is it?
-What are you doing?

524
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,676
It wasn't me!

525
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,303
Where is Su-in's phone?

526
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,389
I feel like I'm going to die too!

527
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,320
I got

528
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,822
that text too.

529
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,951
Su-in...

530
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,162
really did send it.

531
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,250
Have you lost your mind?

532
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,462
How could a dead person send a text?

533
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,424
Su-in...

534
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,178
keeps appearing everywhere.

535
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,640
She follows me

536
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,184
every day.

537
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,438
I'm terrified,

538
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,900
but I can't tell her to stop coming to me.

539
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,611
I feel so bad

540
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,863
and so guilty

541
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,243
for Su-in.

542
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,841
Why did Su-in...

543
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,177
How did she die?

544
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,181
I don't know either.

545
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,435
I went to school one day,

546
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,522
and they said that she died
the day before.

547
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,485
What was...

548
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,072
the relationship
between Su-in and me like?

549
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,330
Why was I so miserable
that I was hallucinating?

550
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,210
All I know is...

551
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,922
you hated Su-in too

552
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,051
although it wasn't as much as I did.

553
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:10,481
EUN-BYEOL, IT'S OKAY TO IGNORE ME.
YOU ARE STILL MY ONE AND ONLY FRIEND.

554
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,260
Hey.

555
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,304
Mom.

556
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,015
Can I sleep with you tonight?

557
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,185
Of course. Come here.

558
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,700
Mom, you know...

559
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,244
Yes?

560
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,996
What is it? Tell me.

561
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,711
Nothing.

562
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,174
I feel like I'll sleep better next to you.

563
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,656
-Hello.
-Hello.

564
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,617
-Hello.
-Hello.

565
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:01,258
Didn't I say that students skirts
should not be that short?

566
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,848
More.

567
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,309
More!

568
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,230
You cut it all off,
so there's nothing to pull down.

569
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,484
Ms. Ahn, you went
on a blind date last night, didn't you?

570
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,944
It didn't go well?

571
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,614
What? Don't change the subject!

572
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,917
Hello.

573
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,126
Who...

574
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,003
Who are you?

575
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,714
I'm Jeong Min-yeong
and I am here as a student teacher.

576
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,010
You too must have forgotten

577
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:49,389
your bottom clothes
on your first day at work.

578
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,266
Pardon?

579
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,191
Why are you scaring her?

580
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,609
What age are you living in?

581
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,530
Come with me.

582
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,087
Guys, it's a female teacher!

583
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,383
Take your seats.

584
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,427
Take your seats.

585
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,142
From today, she will help teach math
for a month as a student teacher.

586
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,686
This is Ms. Jeong Min-yeong.

587
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,688
Please introduce yourself.

588
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,356
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

589
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,108
I look forward to
teaching you for a month.

590
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,905
Ms. Jeong!

591
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,700
-How old are you?
-Do you like pasta?

592
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,743
I'll make you pasta.

593
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,162
I'll take your questions later.

594
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,082
Calm down.

595
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,835
She isn't your friend.

596
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,130
She isn't your sister.
Remember, she's your teacher.

597
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,506
Got it?

598
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,882
-Yes.
-Yes.

599
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:06,925
That's all.

600
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,511
You don't need to answer
their silly questions.

601
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,476
I need to use the toilet.

602
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,854
I have to go.

603
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,316
Excuse me.

604
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,986
Ms. Jeong. Do you remember me?

605
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,948
Of course. I told you we would meet again.

606
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,246
Can you pretend not to know me?

607
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,664
Why?

608
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,833
Actually,

609
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,127
my family has high expectations for me.

610
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,338
I need to concentrate on my studies.

611
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,423
-Before I enlist, I have to--
-Really?

612
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,550
That's great.

613
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,428
Ask me for help anytime.

614
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,055
You have my number, right?

615
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,059
Yes, I do. But...

616
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,101
Ms. Jeong?

617
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:12,866
What are you doing?

618
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,409
I am sunbathing.

619
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,379
Hey.

620
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,382
Why are you making that face again?

621
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,759
Tae-gwang.

622
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,805
There is someone

623
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,558
who I hope never finds out my secret.

624
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,770
And...

625
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,107
there is someone
to whom I want to tell everything.

626
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,028
But if they are the same person,

627
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,740
what should I do?

628
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,452
Hey, Tae-gwang!

629
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,413
Don't bother Eun-byeol.

630
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,623
Don't cause trouble and get her hurt.

631
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,626
Just...

632
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,880
don't do anything.

633
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,457
I thought about it

634
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,542
over and over

635
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,170
and over again.

636
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,090
I really didn't do

637
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,967
anything wrong.

638
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:56,970
Dad.

639
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:58,764
Yes.

640
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,307
What is it?

641
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,685
-Let's go.
-Okay.

642
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,757
Where are you?

643
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,764
I just finished training,
so I'm heading home.

644
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,690
Then I'll go to the gym now.

645
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,451
Hi.

646
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,173
Why are you being so picky?

647
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,718
How could an athlete pick out carrots?

648
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,677
Hey,

649
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,387
I'm picking them out for you

650
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,722
because you hate carrots.

651
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,433
Really?

652
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,854
This is good.

653
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,772
You were such a picky eater.

654
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,733
Use this opportunity to fix it.

655
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,738
Hey, what did I like?

656
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:20,947
And what did I hate?

657
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,243
Your favorite ice cream was vanilla,

658
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,829
coffee was latte,
and fruit was strawberries.

659
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:32,000
And you hated carrots,
broccoli, and raisins.

660
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,087
You know me better than I do.

661
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:40,175
Of course, after my dad,
you are the one I saw more than anyone.

662
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,593
How could I not know?

663
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,890
The person I am now

664
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,435
is very different from
the Eun-byeol that you know.

665
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,979
But...

666
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,231
we're still good friends, right?

667
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,278
That depends on you.

668
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,282
But you know,

669
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,495
sometimes I think I like
the new Eun-byeol better.

670
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:18,838
Want this?

671
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,301
Hey.

672
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,019
Oh, this is cute.

673
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,854
This looks just like you.

674
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,572
No way.

675
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,659
Why are you coming this way?

676
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:48,994
I don't know.

677
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,393
What is this?

678
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,988
-Nice.
-Three skips.

679
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,656
-Three.
-Three.

680
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,117
Here I go.

681
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,664
Hey, you only got one.

682
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,294
Why don't you try it?

683
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,300
Get low, like this.

684
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,511
Try it.

685
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,224
-Come on.
-Like this?

686
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,519
No, get low. Like this.

687
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,736
Are you okay?

688
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,660
You should be more careful.

689
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,120
Let me see.

690
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,585
What is this scar?

691
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:25,090
When I was ten,
I was learning how to ride a bike...

692
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,426
When you were ten?

693
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,554
Did you get your memory back?

694
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,058
But you got it all wrong.

695
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,143
I taught you how to ride a bike
in middle school...

696
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,778
You know me better than I do.

697
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,947
-Oh, my!
-Eun-byeol!

698
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,867
How could you erase
every single memory of me?

699
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,831
Do you want me to help you
get your memory back?

700
00:56:58,998 --> 00:56:59,833
No.

701
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,754
I was frustrated,

702
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,423
so I worked really hard
to get my memory back.

703
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,092
But I shouldn't have.

704
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,009
Hey.

705
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,137
I think...

706
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,140
I'll really miss the days

707
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,350
when I didn't remember anything.

708
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,228
I-an.

709
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,188
I'm sorry.

710
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:27,986
For making two people's memory
a memory only one person remembers.

711
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,698
The person I am now

712
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,742
is very different from
the Eun-byeol that you know.

713
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,829
But we're still good friends, right?

714
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,421
Hey, Eun-byeol.

715
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:53,887
Eun-byeol.

716
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,774
You...

717
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,697
You're Eun-byeol...

718
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:14,991
Right?

719
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,694
You better not lose
to that girl, So-yeong, again.

720
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,446
I'm glad I got caught.

721
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,323
I don't need to pretend in front of you.

722
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,033
Are you happy because I'm here?

723
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,244
Can you tell others the truth?

724
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,497
I shouldn't hurt others
just so I can be happy.

725
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,458
I'm going to leave this place
after I get rid of...

726
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:07,669
you.

727
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,504
I'll kill you.
