- Mother.
- Hey.

37
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:26,165
You are aged.

38
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,605
Leave such things to me.

39
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:29,126
Hold tight.

40
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,048
I got it.

41
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:43,246
Mother, be careful.

42
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:46,286
See? The family can't do without me.

43
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:49,885
Be careful.

44
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:52,765
- Okay.
- Alright.

45
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:53,885
Mother.

Mrs. Chun. Miss Keling.

Sir.

52
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:09,045
Greetings, Sir.

53
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,165
Mrs. Chun, it's time
to take Miss Keling to the palace.

54
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,566
It's better to set off early

55
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,045
for the first time
to meet Empress Dowager.

56
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:18,566
Thank you, Sir.

57
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:21,925
Mother, I'm leaving.

58
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,885
Remember what I told you.

59
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:26,205
Don't talk too much. Don't be impulsive.

60
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:28,605
Yes. Talk less, smile more,

61
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:29,925
and follow the rules, right?

62
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,325
Go ahead.

63
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:34,445
Come back early.

64
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:36,605
I'm leaving now.

65
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:37,984
Go ahead.

66
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:40,645
Mother, don't bother to see me out.

67
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:44,566
Don't bother, Mother.

68
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,968
See you.

69
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:52,286
Lift the sedan chair.

(Young Lord's Mansion)

71
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:16,486
His Majesty has been busy
with state affairs.

72
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,566
He appointed me to host you.

73
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:22,926
I took the liberty to hold the feast
in the Young Lord's Mansion

74
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:25,166
and I hope you wouldn't mind.

75
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:28,166
You are so kind.

76
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:30,325
I came this time

77
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,525
mainly to meet my son-in-law.

78
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,006
I only have one daughter,

79
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:37,366
so I attach great importance
to her marriage.

80
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,606
Please understand.

81
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:42,726
That's for sure.

82
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:52,096
Pay respect.

83
00:04:57,926 --> 00:05:00,726
Greetings, Your Highness.

84
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:09,686
Raise your head,

85
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:10,845
so I can see you clearly.

86
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:34,926
He looks like you.

87
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:41,166
Naturally.

88
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:52,566
Welcome to Jianglin. Cheers.

89
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:54,285
Thank you for your hospitality.

90
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,885
Let the children meet each other.

91
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:57,806
That's for sure.

92
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:58,765
Alright.

93
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:00,926
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

94
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:02,126
Cheers. Cheers.

00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,525
(This is Princess Ulan?)

96
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,246
(I guess so.)

97
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:27,126
(Young Lord, I feel like
I might ruin our plan.)

98
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:30,006
(No. You are my brother now.)

99
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,325
(Why don't you
grant me a cup of poison?)

100
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:41,046
(Don't say that. If you
take the blow for me in this life,)

101
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:43,126
(I will repay the debt
in the next life.)

102
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,405
(Control your expressions. Both of you.)

103
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:49,926
(Get up and greet the princess now.)

104
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:56,486
- Greetings, Princess Ulan.
- Greetings, Princess Ulan.

105
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:03,566
My son-in-law is really humorous.

106
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,085
She is the mother of my princess.

107
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:08,686
My beloved wife.

108
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,965
Your Highness is truly fortunate.

109
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,366
You don't understand.

110
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:26,525
(S-She isn't the princess.)

111
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:29,486
(If her mother even looks like this,
then the princess...)

112
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:34,726
Princess Ulan has arrived.

113
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,885
I'm Princess Ulan of Sulala Ghuriyya.

114
00:07:57,405 --> 00:07:58,645
Greetings, Your Highness.

115
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:03,926
Greetings, Young Lord.

116
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,726
Greetings, Second Prince.

117
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:16,064
("Chun" in reverse)

118
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:18,688
Be careful.

119
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,525
It's all thanks to Tengyun

120
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:25,445
that Young Lord and I
were not forced to part.

121
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,126
I hope after Keling enters the palace,

122
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,926
she can deliver my message
to the emperor personally.

123
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,006
It would be best
if the emperor could adopt my advice.

124
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,206
Then, it will benefit
all the scholars from humble families.

125
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:35,685
Come on.

126
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,765
Keling is going to meet the in-laws.

127
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:39,565
Not to be an official in the palace.

128
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:42,486
Anyway, Keling and I

129
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:45,126
are going to move to the next level.

130
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,446
If Keling marries A-Si,

131
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:50,525
then A-Si will become my brother-in-law.

132
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,525
I never thought of it.

133
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,165
I will have a young lord

134
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:56,966
and a prince as brothers-in-law.

135
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:58,525
Buping, you better stop now.

136
00:08:58,606 --> 00:08:59,846
It is not set yet.

137
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:01,525
It's very likely though.

138
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:03,006
Right.

139
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:05,565
Mother, I probably will...

140
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,685
No. I will definitely be frequently
visiting Young Lord's Mansion.

141
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:11,726
Young Lord and I are both confident

142
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,246
that we will surely move His Highness.

143
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:14,846
You guys just rest assured.

144
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:17,086
Ruyu,

145
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,405
the kids are all grown up

146
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:20,045
and have their own thoughts.

147
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:22,366
You don't need to worry too much.

148
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:26,045
Yes. But I am not sure
how Keling is doing right now.

149
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:29,045
Keling who is smart and clever

150
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:30,165
has also grown up.

151
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,206
Just rest assured.

152
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,285
Exactly.

153
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,645
Besides, A-Si is a prince.

154
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,805
Who dares to do anything to Keling?

155
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,405
What's more,
who could bully Chun Keling?

156
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,805
Indeed.

157
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:42,165
The food is getting cold. Let's dig in.

158
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:43,405
Enjoy.

159
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:44,405
I'm drooling over

160
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:45,645
the white gourd.

161
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,685
- Search.
- Yes.

162
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,285
What...

163
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,726
What's wrong?

164
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:00,045
Sir, what's going on?

165
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:01,086
Where's Chun Keling?

166
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:02,285
What happened to her?

167
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:03,525
What on earth is going on?

168
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:04,384
Take them in!

169
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,966
- In. In.
- Mother. Mother.

170
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,006
Be careful. Be careful.

171
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:16,165
Eunuch Wang, there's no trace of them
in the Chun family.

172
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:17,326
Send more soldiers to search.

173
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,726
- Yes.
- Wait.

174
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,326
Keep a close eye on them.

175
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:23,846
I don't believe
Chun Keling won't come back.

176
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:25,792
Yes.

177
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:31,604
("Chun" in reverse)

178
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:34,925
Mother, what's going on?

179
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:38,206
Did Keling cause trouble in the palace?

180
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,285
They've surrounded our house.

181
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:43,326
Several rounds.

182
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:46,165
I had a feeling something bad
was going to happen earlier.

183
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,846
I shouldn't have let her
enter the palace.

184
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,405
What on earth happened to her?

185
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:51,565
Don't worry yet.

186
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,126
We need to figure out

187
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:54,726
what exactly happened.

188
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:01,006
Sir.

189
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,685
May I ask what happened to Keling?

190
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:03,966
Why are you surrounding our house?

191
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:06,525
Tell me where Chun Keling is.

192
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,525
You asked us? We wanted to ask you.

193
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,285
You took Keling away this morning.

194
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:11,565
What happened to her?

195
00:11:11,645 --> 00:11:12,846
I advise you

196
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:14,805
if you know where Chun Keling is,

197
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,446
give me a straight answer.

198
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,296
Eunuch Wang.

199
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:23,606
Eunuch Wang.
Is there a misunderstanding?

200
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:27,405
Keling and Fourth Prince
are always close

201
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:30,285
and our family
and Lord Ling are friends.

202
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,086
Search Lord Ling's Mansion.

203
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:33,805
Yes.

204
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:35,285
We don't know them!

205
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,045
We don't know them.

206
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:42,565
Why don't you let us
go searching for her ourselves?

207
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:44,565
And let you leak the information?

208
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:45,645
I tell you.

209
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:47,366
You are not going to leave this room

210
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,565
until Chun Keling is found.

211
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:50,765
You're illegally detaining us.

212
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,285
Do you have any law in your mind?

213
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:15,326
What for?

214
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:16,685
What are you doing?

215
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,966
Buddy, stay calm.

216
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:22,405
I came out on risk

217
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,285
to discuss a simple,

218
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,966
yet very profound issue with all of you.

219
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:30,285
In the world,

220
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,326
what is the most essential thing?

221
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:40,966
Health, right?

222
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,206
I started memorizing prescriptions
when I was three

223
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:44,685
and have practiced medicine for decades.

224
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:46,805
I know inspection,
auscultation, and pulse-taking.

225
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,525
Just now, I took a distant look.

226
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:49,326
At this moment,

227
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:51,805
I took a quiet auscultation.

228
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,685
No need to ask.
No need to feel the pulse.

229
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:55,685
Buddy.

230
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:57,726
You have a kidney failure.

231
00:12:58,086 --> 00:12:59,446
Your heart meridian is damaged.

232
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:00,925
In half a year.

233
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:02,685
Or a year, tops.

234
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,086
I can recover in half a year?

235
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,086
You will die in half a year.

236
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:08,685
Buddy, if you want to seek treatment,

237
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:09,446
you...

238
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:11,726
Master.

239
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:12,645
Be careful.

240
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,165
Are you mad?

241
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:15,326
Can't believe you pushed him.

242
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:16,405
Are you alright?

243
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:17,645
These soldiers

244
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,165
aren't even afraid of death.

245
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,525
It seems that Keling
has gotten into big trouble this time.

246
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:26,565
Master, your trick
didn't work either, did it?

247
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:27,326
Peilan.

248
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,446
Do you still have
those poisonous mushrooms?

249
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,846
Which make you feel like you're
turning into a fish.

250
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,165
No.

251
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:34,885
No poisonous mushrooms.

252
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:36,285
But I've got this.

253
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:37,165
Poison?

254
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:37,966
Laxative.

255
00:13:38,045 --> 00:13:39,405
The last time Lu Jiang was here,

256
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:40,126
I prepared it.

257
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:42,206
When he came,

258
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:43,925
I was particularly
anxious and irritated.

259
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,525
I suffered constipation,

260
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,126
so this is what I prepared for myself.

261
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:48,805
This won't kill anyone, will it?

262
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:50,685
No, but it can guarantee
they will be too busy

263
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:51,805
with diarrhea to notice us.

264
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:52,726
Good. That's good.

265
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:55,086
Mother, let me do it.

266
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:56,726
Do what?

267
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,966
I'm going to poison them.

268
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:01,645
Jinrong.

269
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:05,765
I am adept at it.

270
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:14,925
Go back. What are you doing?

271
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,086
Thank you for your hard work.

272
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:22,645
Come on. Have some tea and snacks.

273
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,006
We never know
when Chun Keling will be back.

274
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:27,685
Are you going to
stand here all the time?

275
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:28,685
It's so tiring.

276
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:31,165
Look how tired this big guy is.

277
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:33,206
So sweaty you are.

278
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:34,326
Come on.

279
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,525
Take a break.
How about some tea and snacks?

280
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:39,446
Those three guys over there,
come and have some.

281
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:41,966
- Jinrong.
- Jinrong.

282
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:43,805
There's definitely
something wrong with you.

283
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:44,645
Getting aggressive again.

284
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,366
If you don't want to eat, then don't.

285
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,086
Rude.

286
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:49,405
Eunuch Wang has instructed us.

287
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:51,606
Before we find Chun Keling,

288
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:53,685
I will be watching you closely.

289
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:55,846
You better not play any tricks on me.

290
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,045
Okay.

291
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:58,726
Aren't you just curious

292
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,165
to know where Chun Keling is?

293
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:00,846
I'll say.

294
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:02,726
Chun Jinrong, what are you doing?

295
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:03,765
Jinrong.

296
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,645
Chun Keling must be
in the Nanhu Academy now.

297
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,966
If you are so capable, go find her.

298
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:11,645
- How could she possibly be there?
- You.

299
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,045
Exactly, Jinrong.

300
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,885
How could Chun Keling
be in the Nanhu Academy?

301
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,966
She must be wandering around
by Jinxiu River.

302
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:18,446
Are you guys crazy?

303
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:20,165
Chun Keling is your sister, after all.

304
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:21,326
What sister?

305
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:23,805
Mother, you can't be biased like this.

306
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:25,885
Chun Keling acts recklessly outside,

307
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,925
whereas we are locked up in here.

308
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:28,966
Perhaps,

309
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:31,885
she is enjoying a lavish meal
at the Spring River Restaurant.

310
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:32,405
Exactly.

311
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:34,045
There's no sister like you,

312
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:35,565
especially you, Chun Jinrong.

313
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,206
I don't care. I can't stand it anymore.

314
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,006
Let's go! Follow me and search for her.

315
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:42,846
Don't miss any places

316
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:43,885
they mentioned just now.

317
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,206
- Yes.
- Yes.

318
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:48,086
Sir, please spare us.

319
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,525
They left?

320
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,086
You scared me off.

321
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:01,285
You should have given me a hint.

322
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:03,006
You made a perfect line.

323
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:06,885
Lure the enemies away from us.

324
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,925
Lure the enemies away from us.

325
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:15,645
Lu Buping, check it out up there first.

326
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:16,246
Okay.

327
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,885
Quick. Watch out.

328
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,045
Be careful.

329
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:22,405
How is it?

330
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:23,925
No one.

331
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:25,726
Quick. Climb over it.

332
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:30,726
Is that okay?

333
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,606
Clear. Come quickly.

334
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:33,685
Quick. Okay. Up. Up.

335
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:34,405
- Mother, go.
- Go.

336
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:35,246
Get out of here.

337
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:36,805
You can move fast.

338
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,565
You go up first. Listen to me. Hurry up.

339
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:39,326
Banxia, you go first.

340
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,405
Be careful, Banxia. Watch out.

341
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:42,645
Take it easy.

342
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:45,685
I'm leaving, Mother.

343
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:47,846
Come on, Jinrong. Up.

344
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:54,685
Okay. Come on, Peilan.

345
00:16:59,246 --> 00:16:59,966
Peilan.

346
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,086
If you find Keling,

347
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:03,405
never let her come back.

348
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:04,525
Mother, come on up.

349
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,206
Guo Zhensheng, up now.

350
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:07,646
Ruyu, what are you doing? After you.

351
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:09,805
Go up. Stop nagging.

352
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,166
Go and take care of them.

353
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:13,646
What are you going to do?

354
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,565
Stop nagging and go up.

355
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:18,085
How could I possibly
leave you here alone?

356
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:18,765
Are you joking?

357
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,686
Mother, we leave together.

358
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:22,805
You leaving or not?

359
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:23,446
I won't go.

360
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:27,726
You must find Keling.

361
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:28,886
Mother, but...

362
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:30,206
Don't worry.

363
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:31,646
I'll stay to take care of her.

364
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:33,246
Be very careful.

365
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:35,646
Go down. Just go down.

366
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:39,605
Stay safe and sound.

367
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:43,166
Go.

368
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,486
- You're heavy.
- Go.

369
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:47,765
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

370
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:53,646
There was nobody just now.

371
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,765
Three, two, one, run!

372
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:05,726
Hurry up.

373
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,886
Keep up.

374
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:12,605
Wait a minute.

375
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,966
You've got no arrest warrant.
Why do you arrest us?

376
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,285
Yes. You have to give us an explanation.

377
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:20,765
We are innocent.

378
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,206
Why are you running
if you are not guilty?

379
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:26,125
We really need to do something.

380
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:27,686
Let us go.

381
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:28,486
You have to go?

382
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:30,285
Go and talk to the superiors.

383
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:31,406
Wait.

384
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,446
Mother, what should we do?

385
00:18:34,486 --> 00:18:35,525
Don't panic.

386
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:37,686
They won't hurt us, will they?

387
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:39,006
We didn't break the law.

388
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:40,926
Do they look like they respect the law?

389
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,886
What are you doing? Let me in.

390
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:45,166
No one is allowed to enter the cell.

391
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:46,845
What do you mean no one?
Do you know who I am?

392
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:47,285
Young Lord?

393
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:48,206
Young Lord,

394
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:49,926
please don't give me a hard time.

395
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,006
I won't make it difficult for you.

396
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:53,805
Can I just say a few words?

397
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:54,246
But...

398
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,446
What do you mean by "but"?

399
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,006
Li Tengyun, reason with them. Make way.

400
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:57,805
Young Lord.

401
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:58,726
Buddy.

402
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:00,365
Let's talk.

403
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,365
Jinrong.

404
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:02,206
Young Lord.

405
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,446
Jinrong, Jinrong.

406
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,765
You've suffered, haven't you?

407
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:07,446
You must think of a way to save us soon.

408
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:08,125
I...

409
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:10,646
This is an order from Eunuch Wang.

410
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:12,525
It might even be
a command from higher up.

411
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:13,686
I am helpless now.

412
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:16,085
But rest assured.
I will definitely figure it out.

413
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:19,486
Young Lord, what on earth happened?

414
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,486
Actually, I just heard about it.

415
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:25,486
Chun Keling ran away
before entering the palace.

416
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,686
Fourth Prince also sneaked away.

417
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:28,726
When the palace found out,

418
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:30,166
the two were already missing.

419
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,686
The palace was furious
and sent Eunuch Wang to apprehend them.

420
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:35,726
But Keling wouldn't

421
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,006
- run away for no reason.
- Right.

422
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:39,886
Could she have eloped
with Fourth Prince?

423
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:40,845
Nonsense.

424
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:41,966
They're not that kind of kids.

425
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:43,406
- Quick.
- We'll leave here soon.

426
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:46,085
Young Lord, we have to go.

427
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,246
Staying here won't solve anything.

428
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:50,246
Jinrong. Mrs. Chun, don't worry.

429
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,006
I will surely find a way to save you.

430
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:52,845
Wait for me.

431
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:53,765
Mrs. Chun, don't worry.

432
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:54,726
- Jinrong.
- We'll wait.

433
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:55,525
Wait for me.

434
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:56,886
- Come.
- Take good care of yourselves.

435
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,686
Young Lord.

436
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:02,085
Where could she have gone to?

437
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,045
She wouldn't be in trouble, would she?

438
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:06,686
Mother, don't worry.

439
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:07,966
She's a lucky girl.

440
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,206
Keling will be fine.

441
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,166
Keling. Keling.

442
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:30,646
Don't sleep. Wake up, Keling.

443
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,406
I'll keep watch here with Fa Cai.

444
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:15,886
You go and send the message tomorrow.

445
00:21:19,006 --> 00:21:19,646
Boss.

446
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:22,966
Shall we...

447
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,926
We haven't heard anything all day.

448
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,246
No food. No water.

449
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:49,246
We're not going to starve here, are we?

450
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:52,406
Starve? That shouldn't happen

451
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:55,805
I wonder when Young Lord
will be able to save us.

452
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:57,646
Maybe even he can't do anything.

453
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:00,166
It looks like we'll have to wait here

454
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,845
before Keling and A-Si are found.

455
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:03,845
Better conserve our strength
and stop talking.

456
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:06,726
What if they're never found?

457
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:07,845
Shut up.

458
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:09,765
It's time to eat.

459
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:11,486
Here. Here.

460
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,845
Do you have fish? Meat.

461
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:17,525
Let me see. Let me see.

462
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,085
Do you have chrysanthemum tea?

463
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,605
Everyone seems a little irritable.

464
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,365
Do I look like chrysanthemum tea to you?

465
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:34,285
Buddy.

466
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:36,646
When will you let us out?

467
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:38,686
Eat it when you can.

468
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:40,125
Stop talking so much.

469
00:22:41,805 --> 00:22:44,886
Sir, do you have any news
from Young Lord?

470
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:46,006
No.

471
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,166
What about a message?

472
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,726
- Didn't he send you any messages?
- Let's go.

473
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:50,845
You...

474
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,125
Do you know?

475
00:22:58,285 --> 00:23:00,486
We can't avoid it if it's fate.

476
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:04,006
If we are destined to
face this disaster,

477
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:06,486
we can't just lie down now.

478
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,886
Come on. Let's sit down and eat.

479
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,525
Right. We must be strong.

480
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:12,525
When a family is together,
what's to fear?

481
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:14,006
Just prison time, right?

482
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:15,845
Master is right.

483
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:17,085
Just deaths.

484
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,166
Hand in hand
on the road to the underworld.

485
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:20,446
Accompany each other forever.

486
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,246
Dig in.

487
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:22,365
Knock on wood.

488
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:24,486
Stand up. How could you be so clueless?

489
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:26,006
- Master, come and sit.
- No, thanks.

490
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:27,365
- Sit down, Master.
- No need.

491
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:28,166
- Here.
- Sit.

492
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:30,605
- Just sit.
- Master. Master.

493
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:31,845
Why do you give it to him?

494
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:32,605
It's okay.

495
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,686
- Stop pulling, Master.
- Master, come over here.

496
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:35,206
Just right.

497
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:36,646
- Just right for you.
- Listen to me.

498
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:37,886
- Right? Master.
- You two.

499
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:39,966
- Just right for you two girls.
- Eat.

500
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,486
Here, Master, your rice.

501
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:43,166
Thank you.

502
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:44,006
You are welcome.

503
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:44,886
Thank you.

504
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:48,525
Your stomach is not good.

505
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:49,966
You should tear it into small pieces.

506
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:51,926
Tengyun.

507
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,966
Why do they fail to find them

508
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,845
after so many days?

509
00:23:57,966 --> 00:23:59,765
Where exactly are they?

510
00:24:00,845 --> 00:24:01,565
Young Lord,

511
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,446
you must cheer up.

512
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:04,886
But what if they...

513
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:06,486
Young Lord. Young Lord.

514
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:07,686
Young Lord.

515
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:08,726
Have they been found?

516
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:09,886
Someone seeks an audience.

517
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:10,486
Get out.

518
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:11,646
He said...

519
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:12,525
Get out.

520
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:14,966
Young Lord asked you to leave.

521
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:16,726
- Yes.
- Didn't you hear? He's so annoyed.

522
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,845
Young Lord, don't be anxious.

523
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,365
We have to stay calm now.

524
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:23,365
Okay.

525
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:27,125
Young Lord asked you to leave.

526
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,446
I didn't make it clear.

527
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:31,006
Or did you guys not understand?

528
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,646
Sir, I'll say it again.

529
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:35,726
There are two important figures
from your mansion

530
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,726
in our hands.

531
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:38,565
No, at our place.

532
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:39,486
Get lost.

533
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:43,605
I'll talk to Young Lord in person.

534
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:45,646
Put it down.

535
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:52,726
Young Lord!

536
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,285
Have you made it clear?

537
00:24:58,525 --> 00:24:59,765
I made it clear.

538
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:02,446
When I arrived at his gate,
a blade was already drawn.

539
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:03,605
I ran over yelling,

540
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:04,966
"Young Lord! Young Lord!"

541
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,446
And he kicked me out right away.

542
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:10,285
It seemed I didn't say it.

543
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:14,166
You're an adult.

544
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:16,285
But you can't even
handle such a small task.

545
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,365
Boss, why don't we
go to that woman's house?

546
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:21,565
I'm sure I can beat them.

547
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,166
Calm down. Calm down.

548
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:26,486
Alright.

549
00:25:27,246 --> 00:25:29,446
Is that girl richer than the Lord?

550
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,886
Fa Cai, go ahead.

551
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:35,605
Okay.

552
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:36,926
Wait a moment.

553
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:41,845
Take this with you this time.

554
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,805
This is from the Lord's son.

555
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,446
Let them see it properly.

556
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:47,246
Don't worry, Boss.

557
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:49,045
As long as I have this,

558
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:52,525
I absolutely won't be kicked out.

559
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,285
Tricked us?

560
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:56,486
Don't hit me.

561
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:58,085
I really need to see Young Lord.

562
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,646
I have a token.

563
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,646
We have someone you want.

564
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,686
Go away.

565
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:07,966
Don't hit me.

566
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:08,765
Young Lord.

567
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:09,886
Where are you going?

568
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:11,406
I can't wait any longer.

569
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:12,525
Then I will go with you.

570
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:14,406
Hasn't Princess Ulan summoned you?

571
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,246
Let's save the Chun family first.

572
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:16,845
Fine.

573
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:17,406
Stop hitting.

574
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:19,686
Still talking? I'll continue.

575
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:21,805
Stop it.

576
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:25,886
Where does it come from?

577
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,125
It's his.

578
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:30,845
We really have someone you want.

579
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:32,926
Young Lord!

580
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:35,646
Brother.

581
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,085
You. Beat them.

582
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:42,765
- Yes.
- Yes.

583
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,864
What's going on? No.

584
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,944
Do you know who you caught?

585
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:49,765
Punishing your families
wouldn't be enough.

586
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:52,926
What do we do, Young Lord?

587
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:54,365
Brother.

588
00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:58,246
A-Si.

589
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:00,406
What's with your leg?

590
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:05,125
Break their legs!

591
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,206
All of them.

592
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:08,125
No, no, no.

593
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:10,166
Brother, stop now.
It has nothing to do with them.

594
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:11,206
Leave one.

595
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:16,365
What's the matter?

596
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:18,525
Brother, this is what happened.

597
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:21,125
- Come on. Put her here.
- Hurry.

598
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:21,845
Hurry up.

599
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:24,085
- Be careful.
- Watch out.

600
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:27,646
Let me check.

601
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:31,926
Do something to save her.

602
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,525
It's fine. It's a small problem.
She bumped her head.

603
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,646
I have experience with this.

604
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:38,686
Go get the healing medicine
that Doctor Wang gave me.

605
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:39,166
Okay.

606
00:27:42,886 --> 00:27:43,525
Keling.

607
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:45,285
The chicken soup is here.

608
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,166
Put it here.

609
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:50,406
When she wakes up, she will be fine

610
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:51,726
after drinking some soup.

611
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:53,085
Thank you for saving us.

612
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:56,285
Can you go to Lord Ling's Mansion

613
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:57,765
and deliver a message
to Young Lord for me?

614
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:01,246
If we go like this,
in what we're wearing...

615
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:03,285
I will definitely
reward you after I return.

616
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:04,686
- Okay.
- Okay.

617
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:08,886
Who dug the pit that you fell into?

618
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:09,605
Me.

619
00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:12,085
We dug it.

620
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:14,285
We originally wanted to
correct our mistakes

621
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:15,726
and fill in the pit.

622
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,406
Then we found them.

623
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:19,166
You may not believe us,

624
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:22,646
but you really can't make much money
by doing bad things.

625
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:24,246
We didn't have a choice before.

626
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:27,886
Now, we just want to be good.

627
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:31,285
Whose blood is that?

628
00:28:31,886 --> 00:28:34,365
The girl said she wanted chicken soup.

629
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:36,045
So we cooked three chickens.

630
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:38,525
The already poor family

631
00:28:38,805 --> 00:28:41,246
is now facing even more hardships.

632
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,246
Well, no matter what,

633
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:49,285
you should have told us earlier.

634
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:50,845
- I told you.
- We told you.

635
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:52,285
You started beating us when you saw us.

636
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:54,006
How could we say it?

637
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:55,246
Let's not dwell on it anymore.

638
00:28:56,206 --> 00:28:57,926
Brother, let's hurry back.

639
00:28:58,565 --> 00:28:59,646
What's the hurry?

640
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:00,966
Particularly urgent.

641
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:03,166
Your entire family
is now locked up in jail.

642
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,525
It's fine. As long as you go back,

643
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:06,605
everything will be resolved.

644
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:07,765
How did they end up in jail?

645
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:08,966
Walk and talk. Walk and talk.

646
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:10,006
Hurry up.

647
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:10,765
What's going on?

648
00:29:21,285 --> 00:29:22,365
Chun Keling.

649
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:23,926
Mother.

650
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:25,845
Why are you all here?

651
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:28,726
Mother, don't hit me.

652
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:29,966
I'm hurt.

653
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,006
W-Why did you...

654
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:41,845
What's going on, Keling?

655
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:45,206
I...

656
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,765
I followed Eunuch Wang to the palace.

657
00:29:49,845 --> 00:29:52,085
On the way, he kept

658
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,085
babbling about rules to me.

659
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:56,206
The more I listened, the more I felt

660
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:59,085
I hadn't really thought through
about entering the palace.

661
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:01,365
In my impulse and urgency,

662
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:02,726
I ran away.

663
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:04,926
Then, A-Si came to find me.

664
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:13,605
Keling, why are you here?

665
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:16,845
I don't want to talk to you.

666
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:20,085
What happened exactly?

667
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:21,886
You have to tell me.

668
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:24,166
Keling, slow down.

669
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:25,726
Where are you going?

670
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,646
Stop following me.

671
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:29,646
I-I'm not entering the palace.
I regret it.

672
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,206
What's wrong with you?

673
00:30:32,406 --> 00:30:33,365
Don't follow me.

674
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:42,006
Grandmother.

675
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,406
It's my fault I ran out of the palace.

676
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:47,006
The Chun family is innocent.

677
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:50,085
Chun Keling was disrespectful
to the imperial servants.

678
00:30:50,406 --> 00:30:51,446
She kidnapped the prince

679
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:52,966
and caused you injury.

680
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:54,365
These are all facts.

681
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:57,246
It's my fault
that I ran off without notice

682
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:58,365
to find Keling.

683
00:30:58,726 --> 00:30:59,966
I broke the palace rules.

684
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:01,605
It was my moment of urgency.

685
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:03,166
I should be punished.

686
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:04,845
Please punish me.

687
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:08,406
You are trying to shield Chun Keling.

688
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:09,926
I am not shielding Keling.

689
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:12,525
Keling was wrong.
She should be punished.

690
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,686
But she has already paid the price.

691
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,365
And the entire Chun family
is being punished with her.

692
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:19,686
Sure, the Chun family was wrong.

693
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:22,365
But no one is perfect.

694
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:24,166
And the punishment they are enduring now

695
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:25,486
is no longer for their faults

696
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:27,125
but for me.

697
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:28,045
Absurd.

698
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:29,246
You are a prince.

699
00:31:29,446 --> 00:31:31,166
There cannot be
only this family in your mind.

700
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:33,006
But it is this family

701
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:34,486
that taught me many things

702
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:35,686
that I didn't learn in the palace.

703
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:43,085
Help Fourth Prince back to rest.

704
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:43,726
Yes.

705
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,408
- Fourth Prince.
- I won't go.

706
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:47,765
Help him leave.

707
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:48,365
Yes.

708
00:31:48,646 --> 00:31:49,966
- Fourth Prince, please.
- I won't.

709
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:50,765
Leave.

710
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:51,525
Grandmother.

711
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:52,886
Fourth Prince.

712
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:53,765
Grandmother.

713
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,406
I didn't know it would be this serious.

714
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:06,446
If I had known,

715
00:32:06,486 --> 00:32:07,926
I definitely wouldn't have run away.

716
00:32:08,486 --> 00:32:09,206
Keling.

717
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:10,726
Don't say that.

718
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,605
Right.

719
00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:14,686
How could everything be blamed on you?

720
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:18,525
I should be blamed.

721
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:20,966
Mother, beat me.

722
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:23,926
Does your head still hurt?

723
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:26,845
Mother.

724
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,246
I shouldn't have met A-Si.

725
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:34,926
I shouldn't have entered the palace

726
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:37,486
and impulsively run away.

727
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:40,125
I caused everyone trouble.

728
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:41,926
Don't say that.

729
00:32:42,486 --> 00:32:43,525
You are still so young.

730
00:32:43,605 --> 00:32:45,966
You may not be able
to consider it comprehensively.

731
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:48,845
No matter what happens,

732
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:51,365
you shouldn't regret it.

733
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:54,246
The life in the palace is complex.

734
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:56,285
The current life is good.

735
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:58,525
The family reunites, right?

736
00:32:58,646 --> 00:32:59,886
It's okay, Keling.

737
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:04,805
If A-Si goes back,

738
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:06,406
they have no reason to lock us.

739
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,646
Sir.

740
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:13,686
Officer, what are you doing?

741
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:14,246
Officer.

742
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,125
Let's talk it out.

743
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:16,966
- What's wrong?
- Let's talk.

744
00:33:17,406 --> 00:33:18,085
What for?

745
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:18,765
What are you doing?

746
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:20,166
Do you have an arrest warrant?

747
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:20,686
I'm sorry.

748
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:22,206
Officer, we didn't do anything.

749
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:24,605
- We didn't do anything illegal.
- Let me go!

750
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:25,726
- Stop.
- Let her go.

751
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:44,246
You are...?

752
00:33:47,246 --> 00:33:49,285
I am the grandmother of Fourth Prince.

753
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,486
Greetings, Your Majesty.

754
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,726
Eunuch Wang, grant her a seat.

755
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:58,646
Please sit down.

756
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:06,006
I know all about the situation
between my grandson

757
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:07,206
and your daughter.

758
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:09,846
Eunuch Wang went to
your house to arrest you

759
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:12,645
because I was anxious.

760
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,605
But now, all of your family are safe.

761
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:17,286
Thank you, Your Majesty.

762
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:19,085
As long as it has been cleared up.

763
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:22,565
I'm very grateful
for your care for Fourth Prince.

764
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:24,446
He has changed a lot.

765
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:26,685
I'm deeply gratified.

766
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,926
No, no. A-Si...

767
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:33,406
No. Fourth Prince.

768
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:36,205
Fourth Prince himself is a good boy.

769
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:38,846
With all you've done for Fourth Prince,

770
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:40,286
you should be rewarded.

771
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,326
Take these rewards

772
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:45,326
and leave Jianglin.

773
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:47,605
Find a place to live well.

774
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:50,525
I-I don't understand what you mean.

775
00:34:51,446 --> 00:34:53,886
I feel very regretful

776
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,725
about my grandson and your daughter.

777
00:34:57,006 --> 00:35:00,286
He is a prince.

778
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,966
He doesn't have a choice in love.

779
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,006
This is what fate requires of him.

780
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:11,326
It's also the responsibility
he should bear to the world.

781
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,366
On this matter,

782
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:16,886
I won't allow him the slightest mistake.

783
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:25,406
I should be responsible
for my own actions.

784
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:26,406
I will go instead.

785
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:28,966
Keling, don't be impulsive.

786
00:35:28,966 --> 00:35:29,806
Let go of me.

787
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:32,486
Chun Keling, we need to
know the situation.

788
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:33,406
Let go of me.

789
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:34,286
Chun Keling!

790
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:37,085
Do you think the trouble
you've caused is not enough?

791
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:40,085
Keling, listen. Don't go.

792
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:41,766
You have a wound on your head.

793
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:43,366
Leave it to me.

794
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:46,286
- I'm going to save her.
- Master, Master.

795
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:49,446
- I'll see Ruyu.
- Master, no, no.

796
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:51,525
Ruyu.

797
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:53,645
These rewards are enough

798
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:57,926
for you to live without worries
for the rest of your lives.

799
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:01,006
It's also my compensation
for your whole family.

800
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:03,245
Thank you for your reward, Your Majesty.

801
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,245
But I really dare not to take

802
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,326
your money.

803
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:10,846
I heard about it.

804
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:13,446
Mrs. Chun has integrity.

805
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:14,806
What?

806
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,766
Do you want me to apologize to you?

807
00:36:18,605 --> 00:36:20,085
Your Majesty, you misunderstood.

808
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:23,286
It's I who think I was wrong.

809
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:25,045
What mistake did you make?

810
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:27,725
I didn't stop Keling
from entering the palace.

811
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:29,966
I was being soft-hearted

812
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:32,406
and believing A-Si's words.

813
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:33,525
Impudent.

814
00:36:35,685 --> 00:36:37,045
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

815
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:41,806
To be honest,

816
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:46,286
when Fourth Prince first said
he wanted to take Keling here,

817
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:47,886
I didn't agree either.

818
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:51,846
However, he said something to me.

819
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,366
Among which, there was a line

820
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:55,525
that touched me instantly.

821
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:58,645
He said it was his first time

822
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:01,006
that he worked so hard for something.

823
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,006
I am also afraid that my daughter

824
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:05,966
might miss someone
who truly cares for her.

825
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:09,846
But he is a prince.

826
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:13,525
There are many other things
he should be striving for.

827
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:17,766
Yes. I should have known
what it meant to be a prince.

828
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:20,125
I am just a tofu seller.

829
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:21,525
I have no remarkable skills.

830
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:23,366
I worked hard for most of my life

831
00:37:24,605 --> 00:37:28,486
to give my children the freedom
to make their own choices.

832
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:31,326
It seems

833
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:34,245
I still haven't done enough.

834
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:55,366
Here, Buping.

835
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:56,725
How come you all know?

836
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:58,165
Am I the only one in the dark?

837
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:05,565
What are you all doing here?

838
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:09,446
Ruyu.

839
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:10,846
Ruyu.

840
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:12,966
Get away.

841
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:14,125
Mother.

842
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,125
Mother.

843
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:16,766
Mother.

844
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:17,846
Mother.

845
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,605
Mother, are you alright?

846
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:21,366
Mother, did they do anything to you?

847
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:23,006
Mother, what happened on earth?

848
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:23,966
Mother.

849
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,406
Can I have some water first?

850
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:28,806
Yes. I will make you a cup of water.

851
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:31,605
Mother.

852
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:39,486
She asked me to move out.

853
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:40,565
- Move out?
- Move out?

854
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:41,886
I told her I won't.

855
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:42,766
And then?

856
00:38:42,806 --> 00:38:43,725
She agreed.

857
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:46,245
Agreed?

858
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:48,406
What about Keling and A-Si?

859
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,085
That's their own problem.
Let them handle it.

860
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,806
Then, we are fine.

861
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:57,725
Scared me off.

862
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:59,886
I thought I was going to die here.

863
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:02,446
She seems more open-minded
than I thought.

864
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:03,926
Don't talk nonsense.

865
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:05,806
Be cautious about what you say.

866
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:07,085
Sorry.

867
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:09,525
We've been busy for several days.
I am exhausted.

868
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:11,205
Take a bath and go to bed.

869
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,645
Also, Chun Keling.

870
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:17,006
Throw away all your junk.

871
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,486
It would kill Keling.

872
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:22,806
But can you

873
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:23,966
give it to me?

874
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:25,486
- I like this.
- You can give the knife to me.

875
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:27,286
I can help you sell it.

876
00:39:29,006 --> 00:39:31,205
- Don't.
- I want this too.

877
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,766
I think it can chop vegetables.

878
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:34,605
It can cut ribs.

879
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,565
- It can cut ribs.
- Yes.

880
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:37,565
Don't leave me. No.
