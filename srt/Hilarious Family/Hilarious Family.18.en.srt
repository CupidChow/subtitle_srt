A guest is coming. Where is everybody?

In their rooms, perhaps.

38
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,457
Get them to the hall.

00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:08,704
Alright.

Mr. Lu.

Flowers.

44
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:23,497
Look.

45
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:24,448
Is it for me?

I'll go get the others.

pardon me.

68
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:37,657
I know I've made

69
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:40,018
many mistakes before.

70
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:41,617
Please allow me

71
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:43,698
to apologize to you.

72
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:50,858

74
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:55,040
And what are we doing?

00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:57,120
Offering hospice care.

76
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,440
I know

77
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:07,378
I'm at the end of my days.

78
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:09,098
I thought

79
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,538
I had plenty of time

80
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:14,897
to get a full taste of life.

81
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,777
But God wouldn't let me.

82
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:22,537
Before I die,

83
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:26,018
there are things I must say.

84
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:28,657
Mrs. Chun, let me drive him away.

85
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:29,504
Quiet.

86
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,178
You may not know me well.

87
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:36,097
I've been building my career
for over a decade.

88
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,977
I've been through

89
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:42,857
all kinds of hardship.

90
00:04:44,457 --> 00:04:45,498
Mrs. Chun.

91
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,018
Sometimes I wonder

92
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,337
what the point of hanging in there is.

93
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:54,112
What's the point?

94
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,097
At the final moment of my life,

95
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:01,337
I finally found the answer.

96
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:05,097
Because I met you,

97
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:08,777
Peilan.

98
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,178
Mrs. Chun, will you say something?

99
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,258
How can you be so inconsiderate?

100
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:20,417
Child.

101
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,258
Master.

102
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:24,777
No need.

103
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:26,777
Your pulse is bouncing

104
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:28,578
up and down like a soccer ball.

105
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,178
Don't get emotional.

106
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,138
Or you may pass away anytime.

107
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:35,296
Mr. Li, let's send you home to rest.

108
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:36,160
No.

109
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:37,578
Mrs. Chun.

110
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:39,578
Please don't drive me away, okay?

111
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,097
I want to be with you all

112
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,378
before I die.

113
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:49,337
Come on, don't jinx it.

114
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:51,178
You'll be fine.

115
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:56,618
Don't die in our house.

116
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:57,537
Bad luck.

117
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,217
It'll be a haunted house.

118
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:02,400
It'll be hard to sell.

119
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:18,464
It was all my fault.

120
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:22,138
Why did I want Baozi that day?

121
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,378
Mr. Lu, don't say that.

122
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:28,698
If I hadn't wanted Baozi,

123
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,217
I would have been there

124
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,698
to save you right there.

125
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:38,618
He would have no chance.

126
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:40,320
Mr. Lu.

127
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,457
You know how I feel.

128
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:46,657
I know how you feel.

129
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:49,664
But he is

130
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:52,417
pushing it.

131
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,498
Mr. Lu, don't say that.

132
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:57,138
He saved me, after all.

133
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:58,977
Besides, he's...

134
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:06,018
He's lurking around.

135
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:08,977
What if he...

136
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:09,952
Mr. Lu.

137
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:11,904
Enough.

138
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:13,537
I'll stay away from him.

139
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:17,777
But I don't know
how many days he has left.

140
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:20,864
Let's not hurt him again.
What do you say?

141
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:30,698
The moonlight looks miserable tonight.

142
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:46,537
You're obviously better than yesterday.

143
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:50,417
The key is to stay cheerful.

144
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,217
Don't pressure yourself.

145
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:54,217
I see, Master.

146
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:57,097
It's a gain
whenever I survive another day.

147
00:07:58,097 --> 00:08:00,258
Don't be so petty. Just eat.

148
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:01,696
Alright.

149
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:08,800
Peilan.

150
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:10,496
Let me feed you.

151
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:12,058
No need. I got this.

152
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,472
Alright.

153
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:22,048
Mrs. Chun.

154
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:24,217
I've been thinking all night.

155
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:26,657
Will you do me a favor?

156
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:28,512
What is it?

157
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:29,977
I'll do my best to help.

158
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:33,792
I don't want to

159
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,218
waste my last days.

160
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,738
I want to see the flowers
on the West Mountain today.

161
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:42,577
Right, it'd be great if Peilan
could come and look after me.

162
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:44,378
You want to see flowers?

163
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,018
I can go with you.

164
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,072
No need.

165
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,577
I'm the best chaperone.

166
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:50,258
Yeah, I can also come along.

167
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,417
No, I hate to bother you.

168
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:55,378
I just want Peilan there.

169
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:57,248
A-Alright.

170
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:59,817
No, Mother, I still have work to do.

171
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:01,258
Yeah, she still has work to do.

172
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:04,512
Master.

173
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:07,218
Why don't I feel my arm anymore?

174
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,080
Cough over there.

175
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,417
I'm so dizzy.

176
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:14,417
He's agitated.

177
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:15,417
Blood rushes

178
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:16,288
to the brain.

179
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:19,937
I wonder if I'll see

180
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:22,297
the flowers on the West Mountain

181
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:24,138
this time next year.

182
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,338
Peilan, get him out of our house.

183
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:29,218
Yeah, if he dies here,

184
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:30,858
our house

185
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:32,498
will lose its value.

186
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,978
Ouch.

187
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:37,697
Stop pretending.

188
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:40,258
Ouch.

189
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:42,057
Lu Buping, what are you doing?

190
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,297
Peilan, leave the work for tomorrow.

191
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,138
Take Mr. Li

192
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:52,817
to the West Mountain for a walk.

193
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:54,297
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

194
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:57,312
Thank you, Peilan.

195
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:10,496
Peilan.

196
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,096
Peilan.

197
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,112
Mr. Lu.

198
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,537
You're leaving?

199
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:20,288
Mr. Lu, rest assured.

200
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,577
I'll find a chance

201
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:22,618
to make things clear.

202
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:24,480
I know.

203
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,657
Mr. Lu, are you still worried?

204
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:27,657
Of course, I am.

205
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:33,458
I brought you

206
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:35,138
some water for the trip.

207
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:37,417
If he dares to get touchy,

208
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,297
hit him with this.

209
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:40,832
Thank you.

210
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,016
No problem.

211
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:45,618
Peilan, let's get going.

212
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:47,616
I'm leaving then.

213
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,800
Go ahead.

214
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:56,032
- Be careful.
- Come here.

215
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:58,752
What do you want?

216
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:00,738
Li Tengyun.

217
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,657
I hope you won't cross the line.

218
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:04,218
Be decent, okay?

219
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:06,937
What does it have to do

220
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:08,697
- with you?
- Mr. Lu.

221
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:10,048
Come with us.

222
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,392
Alright.

223
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,408
You don't fit.

224
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:14,688
Giddyap!

225
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:16,138
Mr. Lu.

226
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:17,657
Mr. Lu.

227
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:28,576
Peilan.

228
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,858
What a lovely day for a pleasant

229
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:35,392
ride.

230
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:39,338
You're coughing so much. Just rest.

231
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,320
Mr. Li.

232
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:45,618
Today...

233
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:46,657
Peilan.

234
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:47,657
The weather is perfect

235
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:49,338
for flower viewing.

236
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,937
No, I'm trying to say...

237
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:56,937
Are you okay? Should we go back?

238
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:57,792
No need.

239
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,458
Maybe I'm carsick.

240
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:03,104
Peilan.

241
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:05,577
Do you hear someone calling me?

242
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:10,338
That's the loud cry from my heart.

243
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:13,856
Giddyap!

244
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:14,208
Stop!

245
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:14,817
Giddyap!

246
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,378
- Stop!
- Whoa.

247
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:17,504
Stop!

248
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:21,280
Are you kidding me?

249
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:23,378
Mr. Lu, what's wrong?

250
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,378
Peilan, I packed some medicine.

251
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:27,584
What's your problem?

252
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:29,618
Why would you bring her medicine?

253
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:30,784
It's not for Peilan.

254
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:31,738
Master sent me here

255
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:33,098
so you don't die out there.

256
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,258
Thank you. You may leave.

257
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,777
Mr. Lu, since you're here,

258
00:12:37,777 --> 00:12:38,738
let's go together.

259
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:39,648
Alright.

260
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:40,498
No.

261
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:41,577
Just get in.

262
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:42,944
Hurry up.

263
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:46,976
Peilan.

264
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:48,537
It's not like I don't trust you.

265
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:49,978
I know, Mr. Lu.

266
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,057
I'm just worried about Mr. Li.

267
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:53,344
I understand.

268
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:56,537
This is the broken one.

269
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,498
You're so careless, Mr. Lu.

270
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:01,057
Silly me.

271
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:02,498
I wasn't paying attention to him.

272
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:04,736
Peilan.

273
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:06,098
I'm dying.

274
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:07,858
How can you be so happy?

275
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:09,937
Sorry, Mr. Li.

276
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,008
Let me take it off.

277
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:18,656
Look at him.

278
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:19,777
Let him be.

279
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:21,984
Look.

280
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:23,808
Isn't it pretty?

281
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:24,672
Yeah.

282
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:54,560
"Poopoo"?

283
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,577
Banxia, you're counting money?

284
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:18,777
Where did you get it?

285
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:20,352
I found it somewhere.

286
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,577
So you found my money!

287
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,338
It's mine.

288
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:27,817
Why should I believe you?

289
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:29,577
I lost it some days ago.

290
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,937
And you happen to find it.

291
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,138
Give it to me.

292
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,088
How much is it?

293
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:34,784
Ten taels.

294
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:36,032
No.

295
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,417
Fifteen... Sixteen.

296
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:39,378
Twenty.

297
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:40,544
Is it 20 taels?

298
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:43,618
It's 20 taels. I know it.

299
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:44,657
What did you put it in?

300
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:46,537
A purse, of course.

301
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:47,777
What's sewn on it?

302
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:55,218
You know how many purses I have.

303
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:57,897
Which one did I use?

304
00:14:58,417 --> 00:14:59,458
Which one did I use?

305
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,618
Is your name "Poopoo"?

306
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:02,208
Poopoo?

307
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:05,738
It's obviously not yours.

308
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:08,640
Yes.

309
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:10,816
Banxia.

310
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:12,258
You have no idea.

311
00:15:12,498 --> 00:15:13,697
You were a baby,

312
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,098
so you don't remember.

313
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:17,577
Our father used to call me Poopoo
when I was young.

314
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,817
It was a nickname of affection.

315
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,378
This nickname brings back

316
00:15:22,378 --> 00:15:23,577
so many memories.

317
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:26,144
I'm Poopoo.

318
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:31,904
I'll ask our mother.

319
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:34,978
Or we can split the money, Banxia.

320
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:37,858
I swear it's my money, Banxia.

321
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,657
What's wrong? What money?

322
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,138
I found some money.

323
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,897
She insisted that it was hers.

324
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:43,738
That's the truth.

325
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:45,417
You don't even know how much it is.

326
00:15:45,498 --> 00:15:47,338
Alright, let's be fair.

327
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:48,416
That's my money.

328
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,458
Oh, come on.

329
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,577
How do you have money?

330
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,738
I swear it's mine.

331
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:53,858
It's from Yao Wen and Yao Wu.

332
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:54,848
Look at her.

333
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:55,777
How much?

334
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:56,640
Twenty taels.

335
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,272
What else is there?

336
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,417
A purse.

337
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:04,738
What else?

338
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:06,816
A letter.

339
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,537
- Not a letter. It's...
- Banxia!

340
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:13,120
Banxia.

341
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:18,138
Sir, come on in.

342
00:16:19,618 --> 00:16:20,512
Upstairs, please.

343
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:38,098
Peilan, let me.

344
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,416
Thank you.

345
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:54,688
Waiter.

346
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,224
Twenty taels?

347
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,520
Mother.

348
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,618
I swear it's my savings.

349
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:04,658
Mother, I swear
it's from Yao Wen and Yao Wu.

350
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:05,658
How do I explain it

351
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:06,698
if I lose the money?

352
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:08,978
Mother, I really think it's left

353
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:10,498
by the previous house owner.

354
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:12,032
Really?

355
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:13,698
It has a name on it.

356
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,777
W-What does it say?

357
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:17,920
Poo...

358
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:19,328
Poopoo.

359
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:20,832
Poopoo?

360
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,738
Chun Jinrong says it's her name.

361
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:25,600
Father

362
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,178
used to call me Poopoo.

363
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:30,658
It was my nickname. Remember, Mother?

364
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:41,024
What are you doing?

365
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:42,240
Mother.

366
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:44,137
Dog-eat-dog is not the way out.

367
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,537
Mother, we bought this house.

368
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,258
If it's left by the previous owner,

369
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,097
then it's ours now, right?

370
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:53,137
Can you convince yourself of that?

371
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:54,577
You can trick our mother, but not me.

372
00:17:57,218 --> 00:17:58,337
L-Listen to me.

373
00:17:58,817 --> 00:17:59,712
Banxia.

374
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:01,617
Ask around and keep it

375
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:02,938
if no one wants it.

376
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:04,032
Mother.

377
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,377
Fine, do you as wish.

378
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,400
Here you are.

379
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,297
Hey, let go.

380
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:12,577
- Let go.
- Let go.

381
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:15,377
- Let go.
- Let go.

382
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:16,377
- Let go.
- Let go.

383
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,337
She bites for real.

384
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,498
There are marks.

385
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:28,898
We could have split it.

386
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:30,498
Why bother fighting?

387
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:45,337
Peilan, try this. It's good.

388
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:48,577
Peilan, try this. It's good.

389
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:49,577
Try this.

390
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:50,857
And this.

391
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:52,738
I'm stuffed.

392
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:55,057
Mr. Li, I see you've finished the meal.

393
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,498
I have something to tell you.

394
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:57,760
Peilan.

395
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:00,097
We haven't seen the flowers yet.

396
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:04,537
I'd better make things clear first.

397
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:10,208
Mr. Li.

398
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:11,738
Why is your nose bleeding?

399
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:16,320
Sorry, Peilan.

400
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:17,777
Did I scare you?

401
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,097
Are you okay?

402
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:20,448
I'm dying, anyway.

403
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:22,458
It's just a nosebleed.

404
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,658
Please don't say that.

405
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:28,576
Peilan.

406
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,337
What were you saying?

407
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,264
I…

408
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:36,192
Mr. Li.

409
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:38,698
I'll get you some medicine.

410
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:40,097
Peilan.

411
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:40,617
Peilan.

412
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:41,857
Peilan, it's all fake.

413
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:42,377
Peilan.

414
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:42,857
He...

415
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:43,857
Thank you.

416
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:50,898
You're dying, huh?

417
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:52,544
Within the day?

418
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:55,328
Lu Buping.

419
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:57,297
We're going to see the flowers.

420
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,738
I hope you don't tag along.

421
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,376
I won't let you off

422
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:02,577
if I see you again.

423
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:04,097
Li Tengyun.

424
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,498
You know what Peilan wants to say

425
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:08,258
but you keep playing sick.

426
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,097
Come up with something new, okay?

427
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:12,418
Lu Buping.

428
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,898
I'm dying because

429
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:15,178
I tried to save Peilan.

430
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:17,297
I dare you to save Peilan

431
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,738
at the cost of your life, too.

432
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:19,776
Considering

433
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,377
how despicable you are,

434
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,577
I doubt you risked your life for Peilan.

435
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:27,178
Who's despicable?

436
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:28,960
What?

437
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,498
You're despicable. Want to fight?

438
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:33,297
You think my wounds are fake?

439
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:34,218
Huh?

440
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:35,617
Master diagnosed me wrong?

441
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,337
Take a look. Look for yourself.

442
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,738
Go ahead. Take a look.

443
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,777
- Look.
- Go away.

444
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:43,577
How dare you push me?

445
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:45,537
What about it?

446
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:46,938
I also want to beat you up.

447
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:47,936
You…

448
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:52,000
You're just...

449
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:54,912
I…

450
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:57,248
I didn't touch him.

451
00:20:58,137 --> 00:20:59,072
Get up.

452
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:02,528
Stop pretending.

453
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:09,408
You…

454
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,617
Master, help!

455
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:32,377
That's all you've got?

456
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:34,898
I finally got rid of you.

457
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:38,720
Jinrong.

458
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:40,178
Xiaoxiao.

459
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:44,137
Why are you here?

460
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,178
I invited her.

461
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,537
It's mine.

462
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:48,297
Mine.

463
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:49,617
It's mine.

464
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:51,777
Xiaoxiao, sit.

465
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:53,978
The money could be

466
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:55,537
left by the previous owner.

467
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:57,178
So I asked Xiaoxiao to bring it to him.

468
00:21:57,938 --> 00:21:58,784
You…

469
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,498
You are so upright.

470
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:05,057
Fair and selfless.

471
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:07,777
I said it was unnecessary.

472
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:09,297
It's just a few taels of silver.

473
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:11,537
But Banxia insisted on it.

474
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:12,857
I disagree with you.

475
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:14,137
It's not our money, after all.

476
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:16,096
Dong Xiaoxiao.

477
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:17,297
We're like sisters.

478
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:18,577
You can't get the money.

479
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm not getting it.

480
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:21,760
I'm in a dilemma.

481
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:24,698
Chun Banxia, think carefully.

482
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:26,057
You can't get the money back

483
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,258
once you give it to her.

484
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:28,938
It's not ours. Why would I want it back?

485
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:31,658
Wait, Xiaoxiao.

486
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:34,097
Is there a "Poopoo"
in the previous owner's family?

487
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:35,938
I'm not sure.

488
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:37,978
But I don't think

489
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:39,218
it's their money for sure.

490
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:41,418
Why don't you keep it?

491
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:43,337
Take it, Xiaoxiao. I trust you.

492
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:45,938
Then I'll ask my brother-in-law.

493
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:48,418
Dong Xiaoxiao, don't be a hypocrite.

494
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:50,176
Put it down.

495
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:52,192
I'm a hypocrite?

496
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:53,898
Take it, Xiaoxiao. I trust you.

497
00:22:57,857 --> 00:22:58,816
She trusts me.

498
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:00,898
Dong Xiaoxiao, I'm severing our tie

499
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:02,178
if you walk out of here.

500
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:04,288
What...

501
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:05,817
Who applied for notarization?

502
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,104
Me.

503
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:12,384
Peilan.

504
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:13,698
Mr. Li, why are you here?

505
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:16,000
Where is Mr. Lu?

506
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:18,738
He's on his way back.

507
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,032
He left?

508
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:21,817
He said he'd wait for us at home.

509
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:25,057
Peilan, it's getting late. Let's go.

510
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,418
Wait, Mr. Li. Are you fine now?

511
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:29,280
Yeah, I'm fine.

512
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,258
Are you sure?

513
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:31,537
I'm sure. Let's go.

514
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:33,978
No, I think you should see Master first.

515
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:35,738
Peilan, you agreed to it.

516
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:37,097
Hurry up.

517
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:39,218
No, you don't look very well.

518
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,738
I think we should see Master.

519
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:45,978
Okay, take a look.

520
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:51,297
I want a notarization so that

521
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:53,057
we won't have a problem

522
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:55,297
if someone comes for the money.

523
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:56,352
Yes.

524
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:58,817
Well written.

525
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:01,898
Once you sign it,
you admit to taking the money.

526
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:03,537
Make the owner sign a receipt

527
00:24:03,537 --> 00:24:05,097
once he takes the money back.

528
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:06,898
Then everything's clear even if someone

529
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:08,000
takes it to court.

530
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,898
Yeah.

531
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:09,777
Yeah.

532
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:10,978
But it's unnecessary.

533
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:12,978
Just in case, Xiaoxiao.

534
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:14,738
Sign it.

535
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:18,624
Here.

536
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:27,698
Forget it, Jinrong.

537
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:33,938
What does it have to do with me?

538
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,537
It's just a few taels of silver.

539
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,178
You can have my share.

540
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,777
W-What are you talking about?

541
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:43,072
I don't understand.

542
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:48,018
I'll let you talk.

543
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:50,496
I...

544
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,368
My honey is calling me.

545
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:56,192
Coming.

546
00:24:56,817 --> 00:24:57,696
You talk.

547
00:24:58,617 --> 00:24:59,520
Dong Xiaoxiao.

548
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:00,738
Dong Xiaoxiao.

549
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:03,552
You're...

550
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,368
Way to go, Chun Jinrong.

551
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:11,978
Trying to cheat, huh?

552
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,112
Way to go, Chun Jinrong.

553
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:15,520
Why didn't I think of it?

554
00:25:19,377 --> 00:25:20,256
I will keep the money

555
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,297
before the owner shows up.

556
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:24,377
Welcome to supervise me.

557
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:26,537
Sir, I'll walk you out.

558
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:27,424
Alright.

559
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,938
Come on.

560
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:33,978
Why didn't you ask me?

561
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:35,137
We could have split the money.

562
00:25:35,537 --> 00:25:36,898
Don't make me slap you.

563
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:38,018
You started it.

564
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:43,232
What a pity.

565
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:46,976
Not even a penny.

566
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:54,057
Peilan, look how pretty it is.

567
00:25:57,218 --> 00:25:58,080
Peilan.

568
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,498
I may not have much time left,

569
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:02,498
but I feel extremely happy.

570
00:26:03,498 --> 00:26:04,377
I used to get by

571
00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:06,218
in my stall on the street.

572
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:08,258
Now, I work in Lord Ling's Mansion.

573
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:10,297
And

574
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:11,617
I met you

575
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:13,184
in my last days.

576
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:16,297
Peilan.

577
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:17,337
I've thought about it.

578
00:26:18,698 --> 00:26:19,698
Once I'm gone,

579
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,857
I'll leave you all my savings.

580
00:26:25,857 --> 00:26:26,752
Mr. Li.

581
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,377
I think you should
keep your money and time

582
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:30,418
for more important people,

583
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:32,337
such as your family members.

584
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:35,258
In fact, I gave you that egg

585
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,537
just to show concern.

586
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:37,817
Nothing else.

587
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:40,480
That's enough, Peilan.

588
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:41,888
I get it.

589
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:44,097
You don't have feelings for me yet.

590
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:45,857
But I believe that

591
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:47,658
you know my feelings for you, right?

592
00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:51,898
Mr. Li, you're a nice guy.

593
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,498
You're kind and hard-working.

594
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:55,040
But I...

595
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:00,352
Peilan.

596
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,336
Can you

597
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:03,938
fetch me some water?

598
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:05,498
I'll wait for you there.

599
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,137
I-I'll wait for you.

600
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:09,537
Come and look for me.

601
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,337
Li Tengyun, don't give up.

602
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:24,738
She may be moved by your sincerity.

603
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:36,352
Peilan.

604
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:39,018
Please accept my love for you.

605
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:42,752
Li Tengyun.

606
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:44,978
Despicable creature!
How dare you lie to me?

607
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:47,978
When will you leave me alone?

608
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:52,817
Lu Buping, I'm going to kill you!

609
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,208
Come on.

610
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:56,128
Let's...

611
00:27:58,978 --> 00:27:59,978
You brat.

612
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,698
We finally caught you.

613
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:03,520
It's you again?

614
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:05,337
Boss, look at the flowers.

615
00:28:06,258 --> 00:28:07,136
I think he's confessing.

616
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:08,832
Who cares?

617
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,377
Catch this guy!

618
00:28:12,777 --> 00:28:14,178
I'm having a good chat with him.

619
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:16,192
You got me wrong.

620
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:17,344
It was a misunderstanding.

621
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:19,097
Look, you've taken revenge.

622
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,857
Forget it. Go home.

623
00:28:21,337 --> 00:28:22,418
Cut the crap. Get him.

624
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:23,840
Don't.

625
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:26,097
Easy.

626
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:26,944
Stop!

627
00:28:29,857 --> 00:28:31,377
You're the ones who hit me?

628
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:32,698
Do you know who I am?

629
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:34,432
I don't care.

630
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:37,097
(Peilan will be in trouble
if she comes back now.)

631
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:39,418
You're in serious trouble. Don't go.

632
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:42,377
Boss, he's challenging us.
Let's take him with us.

633
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:44,128
Let me go.

634
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,240
Li Tengyun.

635
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:47,418
It's none of your business.

636
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:48,480
Hurry up and go.

637
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:50,738
Lu Buping.

638
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:51,712
Stop being a hero here.

639
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,458
I'm dying anyway. Whatever!

640
00:28:54,938 --> 00:28:55,857
Sir,

641
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:56,736
I'm the one you want.

642
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:57,777
Take me with you.

643
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,898
Let's go.

644
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,617
Nobody leaves!

645
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:03,097
Li Tengyun, just shut up.

646
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:04,544
Take Peilan away.

647
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,097
Alright, problem solved. Let's go.

648
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:08,288
- Let's go.
- Stop!

649
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:19,777
You know the deal.

650
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:21,057
What else do you have?

651
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:22,938
You don't know what it is?

652
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,337
It's a token.

653
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:25,857
I work for Lord Ling.

654
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,577
You...

655
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:29,537
So what?

656
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:30,432
You...

657
00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:34,258
Take Peilan away.

658
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:36,057
Come and get me.

659
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:42,218
What's wrong with you?

660
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:43,458
Lu Buping, easy.

661
00:29:43,978 --> 00:29:45,137
There are only three of them.

662
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:47,808
Take it.

663
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:51,104
For Peilan.

664
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:53,248
For Peilan.

665
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:56,160
Let's go.

666
00:30:06,057 --> 00:30:07,898
Lu Buping, you're a real man.

667
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:10,458
You too.

668
00:30:17,577 --> 00:30:18,464
Mr. Lu.

669
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:19,744
Mr. Li.

670
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:20,978
Mr. Lu.

671
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:23,537
Mr. Lu.

672
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:24,377
Mr. Lu, are you okay?

673
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:37,056
Mr. Lu.

674
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,057
Mr. Lu, you woke up.

675
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:44,817
Peilan, why are you crying?

676
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:47,938
I'm fine. I'm just worried about you.

677
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:49,824
Thankfully, you're fine.

678
00:30:50,537 --> 00:30:51,617
Sorry, Peilan.

679
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:53,698
I made you worry.

680
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:57,738
Did you tell Li Tengyun...

681
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:05,248
Never mind.

682
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,624
Mr. Lu.

683
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:08,658
I haven't told him yet.

684
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:10,272
It's okay.

685
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:11,712
Help me up.

686
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:21,018
Peilan.

687
00:31:22,658 --> 00:31:23,698
Mr. Li, you woke up.

688
00:31:24,738 --> 00:31:25,600
Are you okay?

689
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,320
I...

690
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:30,624
Are you okay?

691
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,024
I'm fine.

692
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,057
Actually, Peilan and I...

693
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:45,617
You were saying?

694
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:50,400
Forget it.

695
00:31:51,218 --> 00:31:52,137
Wait until you get better.

696
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:53,698
Mr. Lu.

697
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,072
Peilan.

698
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,178
Just say it.

699
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,698
I figured it out a long time ago.

700
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:09,377
I just couldn't accept it.

701
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:11,857
I'm dying

702
00:32:14,137 --> 00:32:16,297
and finally find a good girl.

703
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:18,418
And you're competing with me.

704
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,698
But I can tell that

705
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:28,658
you're a trustworthy guy.

706
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:31,658
I can entrust Peilan

707
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:33,938
to you.

708
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:39,097
In fact, I know that

709
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:41,898
Peilan is out of my league.

710
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:44,160
Mr. Li.

711
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:45,857
Please don't say that,

712
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,377
although it's true.

713
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:51,136
Help me.

714
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:53,600
Be careful, Mr. Lu.

715
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:56,064
If

716
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:58,458
there is a chance in the next life,

717
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,337
I will be brothers with you.

718
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,857
Once I die,

719
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:06,097
you must take care of Peilan.

720
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:10,458
Or my spirit will haunt you forever.

721
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:13,617
Let me be.

722
00:33:15,178 --> 00:33:18,978
I will bless you from the Heaven.

723
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:28,658
Peilan.

724
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:30,698
You...

725
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:31,552
What's wrong?

726
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:32,480
You...

727
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:48,377
What happened? Why are you hurt again?

728
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:51,617
It's okay, Mrs. Chun.

729
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,978
I'm dying, anyway.

730
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,938
At least,
I've lived this day to the full.

731
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:58,258
Stop talking nonsense.

732
00:33:58,418 --> 00:33:59,392
Don't jinx it.

733
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:04,608
What's going on?

734
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:08,818
It doesn't make sense.

735
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:10,368
Master.

736
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,858
I know death is coming closer.

737
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:16,898
Just say it. I can handle it.

738
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:18,778
Your pulse

739
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,418
has steadied down.

740
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:25,778
I've recovered?

741
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:27,488
What...

742
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:28,672
Are you

743
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:30,418
still dizzy?

744
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:33,312
No.

745
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:36,298
The brain clots are gone.

746
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,577
What do you mean?

747
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:40,737
I mean, your brain clots are gone.

748
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:42,688
So I...

749
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:43,898
Why is your nose bleeding?

750
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:46,978
It's been like this all day.

751
00:34:51,577 --> 00:34:52,480
Master.

752
00:34:52,697 --> 00:34:53,818
Could it be

753
00:34:53,818 --> 00:34:55,617
the clots in my brain?

754
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:56,938
The medical book says

755
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:58,537
that clots in the brain

756
00:34:58,537 --> 00:35:00,177
can be released from the earlobes

757
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:01,737
and fingers via acupuncture.

758
00:35:02,257 --> 00:35:03,577
I've never heard about

759
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:05,018
a nosebleed in this case.

760
00:35:05,257 --> 00:35:06,378
It's worth noting.

761
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:07,737
What else happened?

762
00:35:08,577 --> 00:35:10,778
I-I just had lunch

763
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:12,160
and a fight.

764
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:13,978
He got hit on the head.

765
00:35:15,818 --> 00:35:16,737
He did?

766
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:18,737
That may be the key.

767
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,137
It's also worth noting.

768
00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:22,577
Banxia, prepare
the brain meridian chart and pen.

769
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:24,978
Mr. Li, rest well.

770
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:26,737
Let's go.

771
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:28,537
Wait, am I dying or not?

772
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:29,498
Not yet.

773
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:30,858
Great! You won't die!

774
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:32,177
I'll tell Menglong.

775
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:33,778
Wait, Mrs. Chun.

776
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:35,057
This is great, Mr. Li.

777
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:36,697
Since you're fine, I'll take Mr. Lu

778
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:37,664
to rest in his room.

779
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,057
Lie down and rest,

780
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,057
my next-life brother.

781
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:43,537
Everybody's leaving.

782
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:44,938
No sympathy at all.

783
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:45,888
Seriously.

784
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:48,704
Is everything okay?

785
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:51,617
Then hurry up and go back.

786
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:53,338
Once you're back,

787
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:54,898
tell the Young Lord that

788
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:56,537
Madam Wu is holding a Product Appraisal

789
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:57,858
tomorrow afternoon.

790
00:35:57,858 --> 00:35:58,858
I will be there.

791
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:01,697
Don't tell the Young Lord
that it's my idea.

792
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:03,097
Just mention it discreetly.

793
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:05,737
Advise him to go

794
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,858
and show me support.

795
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,898
I...

796
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:09,824
Remember?

797
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,018
Get some rest.

798
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:18,498
What a family.

799
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:20,160
I...

800
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:38,400
Nothing?

801
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,298
Why is my purse?

802
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:45,664
Wasn't it here?

803
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:50,498
Planting a tree here?

804
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:52,512
No, Master.

805
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:53,858
Have you seen my purse?

806
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:55,097
It has my nickname.

807
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:56,480
What's your nickname?

808
00:36:56,737 --> 00:36:57,898
Poopoo.

809
00:36:59,097 --> 00:36:59,978
"Poopoo"?

810
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:01,818
That's quite

811
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:03,418
expressive.

812
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:05,418
You left it here?

813
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,338
Yeah. It's gone.

814
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:08,938
You're quite innovative.

815
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:10,737
A dangerous place may turn out

816
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,418
to be dangerous.

817
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:14,272
I didn't see it.

818
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:15,712
Keep looking.

819
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,097
- I will get hot water
- Okay.

820
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:17,978
for you to wash up.

821
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:18,880
Thank you, Master.

822
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:21,577
Where did I leave it?

823
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:31,008
(Chun)

824
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:36,256
Coming.
