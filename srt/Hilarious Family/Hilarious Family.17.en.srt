00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,530
Master Lu, wipe your sweat.

35
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:05,824
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

36
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,584
Mrs. Chun.

37
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,250
We've been bothering you for a while.

38
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,529
I'd better take Buping and leave today.

39
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,970
W-What's the rush?

40
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,049
You haven't recovered.

41
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:18,290
Stay a bit longer.

42
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,609
I'm almost fine now.

43
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,450
Hey, you.

44
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,089
Get some ginseng from the pharmacy.

45
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,809
Master Lu can use some nutrition.

46
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,048
There is none.

47
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,290
How can it be?

48
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,728
Actually...

49
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,130
Go ahead, please.

50
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,840
Mrs. Chun.

51
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,120
It's unnecessary.

52
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,176
It's okay.

53
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,170
I'm not asking for
that century-old ginseng.

54
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,690
Ginseng is a remedy,

55
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,010
not an ingredient for soup.

56
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,410
You'd better not make me mad.

57
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:04,512
Mrs. Chun.

58
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,089
Other pharmacies have ginseng.

59
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:07,360
Go and buy some

60
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:08,690
if you want.

61
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,970
Guo Zhensheng, you can try me.

62
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,410
I don't know
what's wrong with him these days.

63
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,250
Here you are.

64
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,089
I'll go get changed.

65
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:25,730
Yeah, go ahead.

66
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,890
Don't catch a cold.

67
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,576
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

68
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,410
What a bummer.

69
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,592
(Chun Menglong)
Father.

70
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,649
You know what I'm thinking.

71
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:45,489
Mr. Lu is the son
of the martial arts alliance leader

72
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,609
who owns Lu's Manor.

73
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,970
He's meant to be a hero.

74
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,089
How can I keep him here?

75
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,809
I know what Mr. Lu thinks.

76
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,489
Will he stay if I confess

77
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,489
my love to him?

78
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,089
(Chun Menglong)
But he's meant to be a hero.

79
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:11,890
How can I hold him back?

80
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,690
And I have so many house chores.

81
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,529
I shall stay with you
and mother forever.

82
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,920
She likes me.

83
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,576
She doesn't.

84
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,289
She likes me.

85
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,424
- Mr. Lu
- She likes...

86
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,304
Peilan.

87
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,130
Sorry, I lost my cool yesterday.

88
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,729
Mr. Lu, it was my fault.

89
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,490
I should have said no to Mr. Li.

90
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,890
But rest assured. I promise I'll return

91
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,209
his shoes next time.

92
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,690
You're leaving soon.

93
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,450
I hope you can

94
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,490
stay cheerful and carefree.

95
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:25,984
Peilan.

96
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:27,904
Peilan.

97
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,440
Here you are, Peilan.

98
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,336
Mr. Li.

99
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:31,264
Listen.

100
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,409
Peilan.

101
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,169
I picked the vegetables. Go and cook.

102
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,010
Mrs. Chun and my father will be hungry.

103
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,272
No rush, Peilan.

104
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,010
I'll talk to mother if she's mad.

105
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,810
Who's your "mother"?

106
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:43,849
Why are you yelling?

107
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,440
What's wrong with you?

108
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,969
Peilan is your master.

109
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:47,969
You're a servant.

110
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,649
How can a servant tell a master to cook?

111
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,089
Why do you care?

112
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:53,450
It's a family affair.

113
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,769
Mind your words. Who's your "mother"?

114
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,209
You won't shut up?

115
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,610
"It's a family affair"?

116
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:00,930
You're their family?

117
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:02,769
Know your place.

118
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,370
You're just their servant.

119
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,856
What did you say?

120
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:06,769
You're their servant.

121
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:07,810
Let's go. One on one.

122
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,672
Let's go.

123
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:09,536
Wait.

124
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,690
Mr. Li, since you're here,

125
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:14,930
I'll bring your...

126
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:15,936
Peilan.

127
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,130
I got carried away.

128
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,250
Actually, I came here

129
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:22,969
to invite you to dinner.

130
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,704
Dinner?

131
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:26,209
Why?

132
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:27,409
Because you gave me an egg.

133
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,729
I booked a table
at Spring River Restaurant at 18:00.

134
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,000
See you there.

135
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,490
Mr. Li, I won't go.

136
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,256
I just remembered.

137
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,169
Young Lord is taking me to meet

138
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,729
the new Assistant Minister of Justice.

139
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,184
I have to go.

140
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,450
I'll wait for you.

141
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,529
Mr. Li, I won't go.

142
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,690
Mr. Li, I won't go.

143
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,890
Why doesn't he listen to me?

144
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,072
An egg?

145
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,250
What does he mean by "an egg"?

146
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,969
Master, your hand.

147
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,450
Guo Zhensheng.

148
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:14,769
What were you thinking?

149
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,209
You almost cut your fingers!

150
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,370
Why are you yelling?

151
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,250
You scared me.

152
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:22,050
I didn't sleep well.

153
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:24,576
Banxia.

154
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,592
Don't you think your mother is too kind

155
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,512
to Master Lu?

156
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,504
Isn't that normal?

157
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,169
Normal?

158
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,329
He's a guest.

159
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,656
Besides,

160
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,930
Lu Buping has helped around a lot.

161
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,370
My mother may say mean things,

162
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,010
but she's grateful.

163
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,130
Right, I just remembered.

164
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,969
I heard that mother
asked you for ginseng

165
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,810
to help Master Lu recover,
and you said no.

166
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:54,176
Really?

167
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,280
Master.

168
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,370
Lu Buping has helped us
unload the herbs before.

169
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,112
You're too stingy.

170
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:03,570
No.

171
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,448
"No"?

172
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,089
This is wrong.

173
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,392
Think about it.

174
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:09,409
I'll get some herbs.

175
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,192
Be careful.

176
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,289
Even Banxia criticized me.

177
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,409
Did I really do wrong?

178
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:22,209
That's about it.

179
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,490
I don't know why Mr. Li

180
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,169
cares so much about that egg.

181
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,050
Of course, he cares.

182
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,649
You helped him when he

183
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:28,544
needed it the most.

184
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,890
I know exactly how he feels.

185
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,330
Mr. Lu,

186
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:33,449
I swear it was just

187
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:35,130
an innocent move.

188
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,096
- I was just...
- Peilan.

189
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,250
Come with us to Lu's Manor.

190
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,096
No.

191
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,769
I know you'd be worried
about your family.

192
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,416
What if

193
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:45,649
I tell my father?

194
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,130
No.

195
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,289
He will call me a loser.

196
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,664
Peilan,

197
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,090
how can I just leave you?

198
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,768
Mr. Lu.

199
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:58,336
Rest assured.

200
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,090
I won't be in touch with him
after you leave.

201
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,850
I worry the most about you.

202
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,352
You're just saying that.

203
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,850
You can't reject people at all.

204
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,569
You said you'd return his shoes.

205
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:09,929
Now you have a dinner date.

206
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,689
I didn't agree to go.

207
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:12,890
You heard me.

208
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,569
I did, but did he?

209
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:16,569
How would I know if he did?

210
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,409
Of course, he did

211
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,488
but ignored it.

212
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,169
Peilan, I'm sorry.

213
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,210
I've been very irritable.

214
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,730
I do want to create

215
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,850
some sweet memories before I leave.

216
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,090
B-But Li Tengyun keeps

217
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:45,449
messing with us.

218
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:48,010
Mr. Lu, can we stop talking about him?

219
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,890
He means nothing to us.

220
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,010
Mr. Lu, don't be mad.

221
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,529
Fine, I won't be.

222
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,330
Your nose is bleeding.

223
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,809
Mr. Lu.

224
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,929
It's so easy to piss you off.

225
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,090
Is he okay?

226
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:23,970
Nothing serious.

227
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:25,529
A rush of anxiety.

228
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,072
Mother scolded you again?

229
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,569
I'll boil some medicine.

230
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:33,049
Bring it to him later, Peilan.

231
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:34,850
Rest well. Drink water.

232
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:36,352
I'm leaving.

233
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:37,248
Thank you, Banxia.

234
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:38,336
No problem.

235
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:43,970
Mr. Lu, take the day off.

236
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:46,370
I'm fine. Let me help

237
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,769
with all those chores.

238
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,490
Banxia told you to rest and drink water.

239
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,929
Just rest for a day.

240
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,304
Where are you going?

241
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:56,529
I'll make you something to eat.

242
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,610
Rest assured.
I won't go anywhere tonight.

243
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,730
What's wrong? Are you sick?

244
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,528
Are you sick?

245
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:23,936
No.

246
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:27,169
The shopkeeper
of the rouge store is busy.

247
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:28,250
I'm bringing her the medicine.

248
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,529
Do I look sick?

249
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:49,632
Peilan.

250
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,200
Peilan.

251
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:52,576
Peilan.

252
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,330
Peilan, I waited for four hours.

253
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,210
Where were you?

254
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,449
I was worried that

255
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:58,769
something went wrong.

256
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:00,169
So I rushed here.

257
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,024
- I just...
- Mr. Li.

258
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:03,169
I told you I wouldn't go.

259
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,250
And Mr. Lu is sick.
I'm taking care of him.

260
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:07,072
Lu Buping?

261
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:08,809
Is he pulling a trick?

262
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,144
Of course not.

263
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,224
Fine.

264
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,809
It's late. Thankfully, you're fine.

265
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,090
Maybe tomorrow...

266
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:19,360
Mr. Li.

267
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,210
Please don't come to me again.

268
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,929
And wait here.

269
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:25,344
Peilan.

270
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,250
Mr. Li, you'd better refund your shoes.

271
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,296
Go home.

272
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:32,480
Peilan.

273
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,210
B-But worn items are not refundable.

274
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,488
Peilan.

275
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,152
Peilan.

276
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:38,689
What happened, Peilan?

277
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,288
Peilan.

278
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,792
Mr. Lu.

279
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:51,850
I made some soothing herbal tea.

280
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,048
Thank you.

281
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,769
Are you better?

282
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,409
I'm fine. It's just some nosebleed.

283
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,970
I'll cut some wood today.

284
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,929
You're leaving. So stop working.

285
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,104
It's okay.

286
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,370
You'll do all the work

287
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,730
once I'm gone.

288
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,490
I might as well do more now.

289
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,610
It's fine.
I'll do those little by little...

290
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,569
Li Tengyun, it's you again?

291
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,610
Peilan, I'm cutting wood for you.

292
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:26,610
Mr. Li.

293
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:28,960
Morning, Jinrong.

294
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,248
Go ahead.

295
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:34,769
What did the Young Lord say?

296
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,210
Nothing for now.

297
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,049
So why are you here?

298
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,689
I'm helping Peilan.

299
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,130
Mr. Li.

300
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,130
You've been lurking around Peilan

301
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:51,529
these days.

302
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:52,928
Right?

303
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,528
Not exactly.

304
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,210
I just hate to see

305
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,610
Peilan doing so many chores.

306
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,850
And your only servant is a weakling

307
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:02,970
who just fell sick.

308
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,169
Li Tengyun, make it clear.

309
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,370
Who's a weakling?

310
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,049
Peilan works hard.
I'm taking care of her.

311
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,569
Stop sweet-talking her.

312
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,490
It's none of your business.

313
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:15,712
Lu Buping.

314
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,409
You're so ungrateful.

315
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:20,490
Peilan told me
that you were sick last night.

316
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,409
That's why I'm here to help around.

317
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:23,744
Seriously.

318
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,896
Last night?

319
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,130
So you met last night?

320
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,769
You said you wouldn't go.

321
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,929
No, he came here to see me.

322
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,088
He came here?

323
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:35,330
You...

324
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,192
You...

325
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,730
What else are you hiding from me?

326
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,712
Nothing.

327
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,120
Lu Buping.

328
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,176
Don't touch me.

329
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:43,040
Come on.

330
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:45,610
Does Peilan have to
report everything to you?

331
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:47,130
Who do you think you are?

332
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,056
Peilan.

333
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:51,289
Should I get the dry clothes?

334
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,649
Mr. Li, please go home.

335
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,449
I can handle these chores.

336
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:57,890
Okay, I'll go on with the wood.

337
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,090
Drop the axe now.

338
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,970
Mr. Lu, calm down.

339
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,130
- Your nose will bleed.
- Give me.

340
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:04,970
- Go away.
- Mr. Lu.

341
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,976
Mr. Lu.

342
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,449
- Take it easy.
- Li Tengyun.

343
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:09,664
You...

344
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,330
Mr. Lu, your...

345
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,010
your nose is bleeding again.

346
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,970
You can take care of Peilan like that?

347
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:19,529
I bet Peilan is taking care of you.

348
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:21,010
Should I help her with that?

349
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,490
Y-You've crossed the line.

350
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,368
Are you ready?

351
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:27,232
Yeah.

352
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:32,608
Master Lu.

353
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,809
Great stamina.

354
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,330
You play better than my master.

355
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,744
Good shot.

356
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:40,689
Master Lu.

357
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,569
Mrs. Chun.

358
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:43,850
Come for water

359
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,250
if you're tired.

360
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,144
All right, Mrs. Chun.

361
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,210
I'm not tired, Mother.

362
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,792
Come and join us.

363
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,890
No way, I'm too old for this.

364
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,809
Mrs. Chun, exercise is good for health.

365
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:57,490
One more.

366
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,569
Nice move.

367
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:05,649
Keling, take it.

368
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,569
Guo Zhensheng.

369
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,090
Perhaps

370
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,169
it's time to give up.

371
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:32,480
Peilan.

372
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:34,409
Peilan.

373
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:35,296
Mr. Lu.

374
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:36,576
Mr. Lu.

375
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,464
You woke up.

376
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:39,569
Are you better?

377
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:43,392
Peilan.

378
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,169
I lost a lot of blood.

379
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,689
Don't tell my father.

380
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,529
I didn't want to worry him
so I didn't tell him.

381
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,704
That's good.

382
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,850
Is Li Tengyun gone?

383
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,064
Yeah.

384
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,064
Help me up.

385
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:06,969
Mr. Lu, stay down.

386
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,449
Rest a bit longer.

387
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,009
Sorry, it's all my fault.

388
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:13,130
How is it your fault?

389
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,610
He's too shameless.

390
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,770
I've never seen such a shameless person.

391
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,520
He's awake?

392
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,409
Peilan, feed him.

393
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,528
Okay.

394
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:27,712
Mr. Lu, have the medicine.

395
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:28,576
I can do it myself.

396
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,736
Slowly.

397
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:35,810
Oh right, Li Tengyun brought the herbs.

398
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,090
Thank him once you recover.

399
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,336
Okay.

400
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,729
Mr. Lu, what are you doing?

401
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,890
When is he going to stop?

402
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,249
Mr. Lu, come on.

403
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:49,409
Don't be mad. You already drank some.

404
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,009
That rascal is pestering you.

405
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,850
Mr. Lu, rest assured.

406
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,449
How can I rest assured?

407
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,969
I have to leave but I just can't.

408
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,850
There's only one solution.

409
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,256
What is it?

410
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:07,424
Come with me.

411
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,330
Mr. Lu, I'm not going to Lu's Manor.

412
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,570
We're not going there.

413
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:12,928
We're going to Dali.

414
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:13,824
Didn't I say I'd

415
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:14,784
take you there?

416
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,810
I'm serious.

417
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,688
I say we should

418
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,544
leave tonight.

419
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,810
Just the two of us.

420
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,169
Nobody will ever bother us.

421
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,530
Your father is still here.

422
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,890
I'll leave him a letter.

423
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,169
I believe he's going to understand.

424
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:32,649
But I...

425
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:34,848
Peilan.

426
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,050
I know you care about your family.

427
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,008
Be brave for me

428
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,370
just once, please.

429
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,370
Abandon everything.

430
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:43,770
Let's find our happiness.

431
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,489
As long as we're happy,

432
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:46,649
your mother and my father

433
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,649
will be happy for us.

434
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,696
Really.

435
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,744
Ruyu.

436
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,536
I'm leaving.

437
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,249
I wish you happiness.

438
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,008
What are you doing?

439
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,568
Just passing by.

440
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:43,290
I stewed the chicken soup the whole day.

441
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,192
Let's go have some.

442
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:46,112
You

443
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,449
asked me for ginseng

444
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,130
to make chicken soup for me?

445
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:52,352
No.

446
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:53,929
It's for everyone.

447
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:57,120
By the way.

448
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,729
Tidy up Keling's room later.

449
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:59,729
She will sleep there.

450
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,728
Where is Lu Jiang?

451
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,328
He's gone.

452
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,890
Where is Lu Buping?

453
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,770
Also gone.

454
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,489
That's why you'll tidy up the room.

455
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,152
Have some soup first.

456
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,544
Where are you going?

457
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,929
You told me to

458
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:15,330
tidy up the room.

459
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,810
It's more urgent than the soup.

460
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,169
What's taking her so long?

461
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,640
(To My Father Lu Jiang)

462
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:48,224
Father.

463
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:49,664
I'm sorry.

464
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:53,530
Peilan and I are going to
pursue our happiness.

465
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:56,608
Peilan.

466
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,449
F-Father.

467
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:00,649
W-What are you doing here?

468
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,009
Am I still your father?

469
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,032
What...

470
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,929
Mr. Lu.

471
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,969
Help, someone robbed my purse.

472
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,969
Don't worry, Miss.

473
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,290
I came down the mountain
to do people justice.

474
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,449
I brought you another quilt.

475
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,249
So you won't
fight over it in your sleep.

476
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:33,824
Thank you.

477
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,969
Hot?

478
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:36,570
Are you okay?

479
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,249
I'm fine.

480
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:40,352
Are you okay?

481
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:43,850
Why are you so careless, Lu Buping?

482
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:47,168
Open it.

483
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,810
Look, shooting stars.

484
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,544
Uncle Lu,

485
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,890
I'm so sorry that

486
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:12,850
I agreed to go to Dali with him
behind your back.

487
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,810
It's because he was in so much pain.

488
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:17,810
He will wait for me

489
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,449
at the city gate
from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM.

490
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,248
Take him away.

491
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,169
A short-lived pain
is better than a lasting agony.

492
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,130
Mr. Lu may feel hurt but he will

493
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,009
forget me soon.

494
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:36,209
You're a good girl.

495
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,090
I didn't expect you to be

496
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:41,449
so considerate of him.

497
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:44,169
Thank you for that.

498
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:48,064
Uncle Lu,

499
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,810
this is the sword tassel I made for him.

500
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:53,689
Please bring it to him.

501
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,224
(I'm sure he'll)

502
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,929
(become a well-respected hero.)

503
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:06,090
Look at you.

504
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,320
You're a grown man.

505
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:09,890
But Peilan is much more mature.

506
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,249
You wanted to run off with her?

507
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:13,344
What will happen

508
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,530
to Peilan and her family?

509
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:19,290
You think running off solves everything?

510
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:21,729
You're not being brave.

511
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,456
You're escaping.

512
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:25,312
But, Father,

513
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:28,449
I don't want to go back.

514
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,090
I like Peilan.

515
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:32,770
I like my life here.

516
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,330
Just answer me.

517
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:36,969
Are you coming back with me?

518
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:41,850
No.

519
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,816
Are you?

520
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,672
No.

521
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,449
Good boy.

522
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,048
You've grown up.

523
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,680
If a man

524
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,290
can't protect his love,

525
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:04,770
then he's no hero even if

526
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,009
he masters martial arts.

527
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,130
If you agree to

528
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,689
go home with me,

529
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,449
you truly let Peilan down.

530
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,570
I've been an upright man my whole life.

531
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:36,050
I've never done anything I regret

532
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:38,249
except that I haven't

533
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,050
kept your mother company.

534
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,216
I'm leaving.

535
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,992
Father.

536
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,776
Remember.

537
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,409
Keep training.

538
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:02,880
Got it, Father.

539
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,969
Father, that boat is sailing to Dali.

540
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:20,689
A romantic trip is exactly what I want.

541
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:55,610
Greetings, Grandmother.

542
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,824
Mind your steps.

543
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:07,904
Sit down.

544
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,209
What were you thinking?

545
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,264
Nothing.

546
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:21,330
It's getting chilly.

547
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,290
You should rest in your room.

548
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:25,449
The Imperial Physicians

549
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,090
said that Her Majesty
has almost recovered

550
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,689
and should walk more.

551
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:33,632
Oh, right.

552
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:36,050
You mentioned crepe cake last time.

553
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,489
I sent someone to get me some.

554
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,370
The folk foods

555
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:42,770
may not have the best ingredients,

556
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,969
but they do taste quite exotic.

557
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:47,050
It's really good.

558
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,169
What delicious food

559
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,610
did you buy for our boss?

560
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:03,249
Your favorite crepe cake.

561
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,409
Boss, you're really prescient.

562
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,024
Your Highness.

563
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:11,936
Your Highness.

564
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:17,449
Are you bothered by something?

565
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,288
Grandmother,

566
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,090
I'd like to go out again.

567
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:24,160
Your Highness.

568
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,009
You're just back and have barely
kept Her Majesty company.

569
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:28,330
You're leaving again?

570
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,416
There is someone

571
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:33,729
I'd like to meet again.

572
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,810
Or I just can't let go.

573
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:39,969
Who is that person?

574
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:52,649
His Majesty said

575
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,810
that you're much more mature

576
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,090
after this trip

577
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,689
and offered advice

578
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,009
on the security of Jianglin

579
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,090
and the self-discipline of officials.

580
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,409
I am truly surprised.

581
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:08,810
You used to show

582
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,969
absolutely no interest in these matters.

583
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,496
Grandmother,

584
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:16,850
I learned out there

585
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:19,050
that the world was different

586
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,929
from what I imagined.

587
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,090
You lost. Drink.

588
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:36,850
Master Lu left without saying goodbye.

589
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:49,290
Is it true that
people are bound to part?

590
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:52,770
I just punched A-Si once.

591
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,850
Does he have to leave?

592
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:00,530
Yao Wen and Yao Wu said that
he would never come back.

593
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,050
I don't think so.

594
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:11,409
When did I become so easily bothered?

595
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,169
Annoying.

596
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:21,536
Who is it?

597
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,224
Me.

598
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,728
Is it a good time?

599
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:27,290
Why did you come?

600
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:30,144
First things first.

601
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:31,929
I bear no ill will.

602
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,144
Why do you sound guilty?

603
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:37,409
No, it's just that
we have some misunderstandings.

604
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,570
I can't explain myself.

605
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:41,729
I didn't mean to make you move out.

606
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:42,729
I got carried away.

607
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:44,689
Don't tell my brother, okay?

608
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:47,072
Your brother?

609
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:49,290
He's back?

610
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,144
He...

611
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,648
Right.

612
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:53,536
It's his letter to you.

613
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,009
I want him to come back, too.

614
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:58,489
If he's back,

615
00:29:58,689 --> 00:30:00,480
you two should get along.

616
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,344
Okay?

617
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:02,610
Forget about Heroine in Jianglin.

618
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,689
Tell me whatever you want.

619
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,050
I can take you
wherever you want to go for fun.

620
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:07,456
You may leave.

621
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,632
So we have a deal.

622
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,570
You decided to move.

623
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,209
You're such a warrior.

624
00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:17,600
Okay.

625
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,816
I'll leave you to it.

626
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,680
You've opened it?

627
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,370
What? No.

628
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,729
Of course not.

629
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,249
Read it carefully.

630
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:40,864
(Keling.)

631
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,449
(I hope you're well.)

632
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,649
(I left without telling you)

633
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:45,890
(because my Grandmother)

634
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,489
(fainted in the Palace.)

635
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,489
But don't worry.

636
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:51,090
She's fine now.

637
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,169
I've been missing you every day.

638
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,290
You may not like me,

639
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,969
but I won't give up.

640
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:03,209
I believe we will

641
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:04,570
meet soon.

642
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:06,912
By A-Si.

643
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,449
Brat!

644
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,169
Who says I don't like you?

645
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,440
Mr. Lu.

646
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,209
Your father let you stay for real?

647
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:28,330
Yeah.

648
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,330
You won't be a hero?

649
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:31,290
My father said,

650
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,570
"If a man can't protect his love,

651
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:36,050
then he's no hero
even if he masters martial arts."

652
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,272
But you

653
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,009
shouldn't lie to me again.

654
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,449
I will be really upset.

655
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:42,304
I'm sorry.

656
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:46,656
Peilan.

657
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:48,810
I've been through so much.

658
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,409
I believe nothing can

659
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,649
separate us ever again.

660
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,209
Let's take care of this family.

661
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,464
So...

662
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,290
When should my father
bring the betrothal gifts?

663
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:07,409
He just left. No rush.

664
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:09,009
I have to take care of my family.

665
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,489
I'm just asking.

666
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:14,009
Okay, whatever you want.

667
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,130
Do as you wish.

668
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:16,610
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

669
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,130
It's such a happy thing
to walk the street with you.

670
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,729
That's your favorite Baozi store.

671
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,050
I'll go this time.

672
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,610
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

673
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,384
Peilan.

674
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,824
Get out of the way.

675
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,570
Peilan, watch out.

676
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,969
Trampled by hooves on the head

677
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,009
and you're still awake?

678
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,176
I'm okay.

679
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,570
I did this for Peilan.

680
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,050
Thank you, Mr. Li.

681
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,130
You saved my life.

682
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,290
Mr. Li, you scared us.

683
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:17,376
I'm okay.

684
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,689
Peilan, are you fine?

685
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:20,689
Stop talking.

686
00:33:20,689 --> 00:33:21,890
You're in danger.

687
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:24,249
Are you dizzy?

688
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:27,840
Not so much.

689
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:29,649
The wounds on the body can heal.

690
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,409
But the trauma on the head

691
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,890
has a high chance of turning you blind.

692
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,216
I'll be blind?

693
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,729
That's not the worst.

694
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,489
The worst is

695
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:42,409
there's a high chance of

696
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,850
amnesia.

697
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:45,530
Amnesia?

698
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,610
None of these matters.

699
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,449
Most importantly, you may never

700
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,040
fall asleep forever.

701
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,570
W-What...

702
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,770
Is it that bad?

703
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,449
He seems pretty clear-minded.

704
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:00,729
Kid, stay awake. Don't fall asleep.

705
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:01,649
Mother.

706
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:03,409
Mother, take it easy.

707
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,728
Master, did you make a mistake?

708
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:06,649
Take my pulse again.

709
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:08,250
Think of something.

710
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,690
There's nothing we can do?

711
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,529
I saw a guy hit by a racing horse

712
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:13,929
in Qing City.

713
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,529
He stood up and said with a smile,

714
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:16,449
"I'm fine."

715
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,569
Then he spewed blood

716
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:19,296
and was dead before I could react.

717
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:20,192
He was only hit.

718
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,890
It's much worse to be trampled over.

719
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,810
Don't say it in front of him.

720
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,170
I don't want to die.

721
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,049
I need to support my parents.

722
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:35,250
I can't die before them
and leave them in grief.

723
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:38,730
My life is finally getting better.

724
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,489
I can't die now.

725
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,770
I can't die now.

726
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:42,850
I-I...

727
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:43,712
What...

728
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,049
Mr. Li...

729
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,409
He's breathing.

730
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:50,784
He's breathing.
