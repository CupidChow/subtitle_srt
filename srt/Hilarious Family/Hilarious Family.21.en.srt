36
00:01:57,978 --> 00:01:58,857
I had one too.

37
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:01,472
Miss, do you need a ticket?

38
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:02,528
No, thanks.

39
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:05,137
- Do you need a ticket?
- Please line up.

40
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:06,496
Don't push.

41
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:08,778
Come forward one by one.

42
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:10,498
Don't push.

43
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:12,978
I guess my family
doesn't realize I've left.

44
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:15,897
Leave. Hurry up.

Mr. Lu is not feeling well today.

49
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:33,778
Every time there is work to do,
he doesn't feel well.

50
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,297
Not really, Mother.

51
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:40,338
Have you heard about
the annual performance

52
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:41,857
at Spring River Restaurant
was about to start

53
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:42,697
when being on the street?

54
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,297
They have invited a famous performer
from the Western Region.

55
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:49,417
Yeah, sort of.

56
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,368
Right?

57
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:52,617
You will get chocked.

58
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:53,457
I won't.

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,688
You are going out?

60
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:55,617
No, I'm not.

61
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:56,577
Well, that's good.

62
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,457
You can help Peilan
with the housework today.

63
00:02:58,538 --> 00:02:59,737
No, Mother. I have something to do.

64
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:01,177
What serious thing do you have?

65
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:02,417
Mother, I don't need her.

66
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:03,712
What do you mean by that?

67
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,177
You've always spoiled her.

68
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:06,177
So she can't do any chores.

69
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,098
You must do housework today.

70
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:10,338
What are you doing when we clean up?

71
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,017
Do you think I am idle?

72
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:13,857
Adults have their own things to do.

73
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:15,697
Hurry up. I will inspect later.

74
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,098
I think you seem pretty idle every day.

75
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:21,378
Peilan, where's Lu Buping?

76
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:22,417
Why isn't he helping you?

77
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:23,697
I've told Mother.

78
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,258
Mr. Lu isn't feeling quite well.

79
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:27,978
He's not feeling well?

80
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:30,538
So I'm the only one who's all right?

81
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:47,258
What did you do?

82
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,737
Famous performer Ye Xiaolou

83
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:54,697
is coming to perform here.

84
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,697
It's packed outside.

85
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,528
Really?

86
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,737
Is your mother free today?

87
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:06,897
I'm not her.

88
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,177
How would I know if she's free or not?

89
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,498
Why don't you ask her yourself?

90
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:12,258
Alright. I will ask her.

91
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:17,538
(Hu Nana)

92
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:18,417
Cousin.

93
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:22,458
It's me.

94
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:24,978
Nana.

95
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:26,112
A-Sheng.

96
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:27,817
Nana, what brings you here?

97
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:28,960
A-Sheng.

98
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:32,257
Why did you come?

99
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:34,338
You didn't even inform me beforehand.

100
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:36,978
I had such a hard time
finding you, A-Sheng.

101
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:41,218
Take a seat.

102
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,368
Sit.

103
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,218
When I saw you as a child before,

104
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,497
you fell down nine out of ten times.

105
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,898
Who could forget that?

106
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:50,912
Master.

107
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,177
My cousin. Call her Auntie Hu.

108
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:07,168
Nana.

109
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:08,928
This is Banxia.

110
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:10,658
She is Banxia?

111
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:12,297
She has grown up.

112
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:13,216
Hello, Auntie.

113
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:14,458
Cousin.

114
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,177
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

115
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,344
Yeah.

116
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:20,417
It's been over ten years
after you got married.

117
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:22,297
You've lost weight.

118
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,576
Annoying.

119
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:27,578
Didn't your husband come with you?

120
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,458
Don't bring it up.

121
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:35,737
Some years ago,

122
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:37,057
he passed away.

123
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,617
What illness did he have?

124
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,658
Why didn't you write to me about it?

125
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:43,098
It was fate.

126
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:45,417
Fate makes fools of us.

127
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:47,808
Have some water.

128
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:50,578
Where are you staying

129
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,218
this time?

130
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,978
I just arrived

131
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:56,978
and I haven't found a place to stay yet.

132
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,698
I've asked around outside.

133
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:00,617
All the inns are full.

134
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:01,978
It isn't a right time.

135
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,497
Ye Xiaolou is performing here.

136
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:06,138
All are fully booked.

137
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:07,937
No wonder. It's that dancer, Ye Xiaolou.

138
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:11,778
So, there's no room available now.

139
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:12,978
What do I do then?

140
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,297
A few inns in the west of the town
should still have rooms.

141
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:17,417
Why don't you go check it out?

142
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,538
Alright then.

143
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:25,458
It's just a bit farther.

144
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:26,778
Or,

145
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:29,458
I could find
a run-down temple to stay in.

146
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:30,658
I'm not afraid.

147
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:32,937
Although I'm not young anymore,

148
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,698
I am still charming, right?

149
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:35,737
I believe

150
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:37,778
those brutes wouldn't
pay attention to me.

151
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:38,937
Cousin, don't stop me.

152
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:39,778
I'll go.

153
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:40,737
I'll just go.

154
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:41,898
Nonsense.

155
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:43,937
You will stay in a crappy temple?

156
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,458
Are you kidding me?

157
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:46,698
What do I do then?

158
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:48,978
I can't bother you, A-Sheng.

159
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:51,098
It's not convenient to stay

160
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:53,098
in the place where you live, right?

161
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:01,578
What should I do then?

162
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:02,778
Alright. Alright.

163
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,978
I came here to see a doctor
in the first place

164
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:09,538
and to visit you by the way.

165
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:10,978
Now that I knew

166
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,338
you look fine,

167
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:14,578
I am relieved.

168
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:15,898
You don't need to worry about me.

169
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,538
Just let me go.

170
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,377
You almost coughed up your lungs.

171
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:24,458
After all these years,
hasn't your disease been cured?

172
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:26,177
You know it.

173
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:27,578
It's a disease of over ten years.

174
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:30,057
I'll go see a doctor if I can be cured.
If I can't,

175
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,218
I'll let it go and die.

176
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:34,458
Nonsense.

177
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:47,072
Peilan.

178
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,698
Is there anything you need help with?

179
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:49,937
No, Keling.

180
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:51,617
I'll help you make a fire.

181
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,538
Be careful and don't get burned.

182
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:57,257
It's for cleaning the pots.

183
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,737
Leave it here. I will handle it.

184
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,778
Peilan, I'm going to the toilet.

185
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,016
Go ahead.

186
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:18,464
Boss.

187
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,698
What are you two up to?

188
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:21,377
Boss, we are going hunting.

189
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,177
A new hunting ground
is opened outside the town.

190
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:24,377
Grand opening with grand rewards.

191
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,018
But...

192
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:28,018
What?

193
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:29,257
Call A-Si and go together.

194
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,136
Forget it.

195
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:32,480
What happened?

196
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:35,617
A-Si is sick.

197
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:37,298
I also need to help with
the clean-up at home.

198
00:08:38,098 --> 00:08:38,944
Wait.

199
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:40,377
Why did he easily get sick?

200
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,440
Clean-up?

201
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:44,857
I grew up. I have to help
my family with some chores.

202
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,617
You guys go ahead.
It's getting dark soon.

203
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:48,098
I will leave you. I am going to clean.

204
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:52,288
Buddy.

205
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:53,728
So, are we going or not?

206
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:55,978
Yeah.

207
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:57,218
The arrows are already on our backs.

208
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:01,257
Watch your step.

209
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:04,657
Cousin,

210
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:06,617
the place where you live is so big.

211
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,058
Not really.

212
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:09,657
We'd better discuss with Ruyu

213
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:11,418
that you live here.

214
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,698
You are with Ruyu now?

215
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:18,298
Are you two together?

216
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:22,298
No.

217
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,377
I live there. She lives back here.

218
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,257
That's good.

219
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:28,160
Where does she live?

220
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,178
She should be around here.

221
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:30,432
Alright.

222
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,712
Master.

223
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,178
Your sweetheart?

224
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,978
What nonsense are you talking?

225
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:37,617
My cousin. Call her Auntie Hu.

226
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:39,168
Auntie Hu.

227
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:41,497
Ruyu's youngest daughter, Keling.

228
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,200
She...

229
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,178
You don't plan to pursue
my mother anymore?

230
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,137
Nonsense.

231
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:50,657
That's good. I'm relieved.

232
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:52,578
Auntie Hu, I'm leaving now.

233
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:53,537
Okay.

234
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:57,657
Why does Ruyu's daughter
behave like a boy?

235
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:58,657
She's always been like this.

236
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:00,352
It's pretty good.

237
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:01,418
Where shall we go?

238
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,298
Ruyu should be here.

239
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:03,232
Okay.

240
00:10:05,298 --> 00:10:06,144
Cousin.

241
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:07,904
Luckily, you are here.

242
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:09,418
What are you...

243
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:14,137
This is...

244
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:15,617
My cousin. I...

245
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:16,897
Ruyu,

246
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:18,080
you don't recognize me?

247
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:20,137
I'm Nana.

248
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,120
Nana. Right.

249
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,152
Nana.

250
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:27,904
Peilan.

251
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,218
Master brought a woman back.

252
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:33,056
Who?

253
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,617
Auntie Hu. Do you know her?

254
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:37,938
No.

255
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:39,680
Auntie Hu.

256
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:42,137
Are these vegetables for the meal?

257
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:47,777
What are you doing, Keling?

258
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:49,298
I am helping you.

259
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:50,657
Keling,

260
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:51,938
if you are busy, you can go now.

261
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:53,377
Just leave it to me.

262
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:55,338
Mother...

263
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,137
If Mother asks, I'll say you've helped.

264
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,818
You are always nice to me.

265
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:03,424
Righteous.

266
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,257
Stay for a few days?

267
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:12,960
Is that okay?

268
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,377
I'm staying at my cousin's house.

269
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,377
Ruyu won't refuse it, right?

270
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:21,017
Of course not.

271
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:23,298
You can sleep with Keling then.

272
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,137
At such a large house,

273
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:26,897
I still have to
share a room with others?

274
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:27,978
Thank you.

275
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:29,218
I'll take your luggage

276
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:30,777
to Keling's room now.

277
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:33,137
Thanks, Cousin.

278
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:37,497
Ruyu.

279
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:41,537
I didn't expect
that you moved to Jianglin.

280
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:44,497
Speaking of which,

281
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:46,298
you've been lucky since childhood.

282
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,377
Unlike me.

283
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,657
I also weathered the storms.

284
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,058
Cousin, don't be discouraged.

285
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,338
I'm fine, Ruyu.

286
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:57,377
Now, I met my cousin, right?

287
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,617
I feel like my good luck
is about to come.

288
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:02,537
You came this time...

289
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:05,178
This time, I mainly came for my cousin.

290
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:06,178
You also know

291
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,058
that we missed each other back then.

292
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:10,528
I don't

293
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:12,657
want to miss him again.

294
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,800
Quite good.

295
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,298
I've done.

296
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,257
Cousin, thank you. You worked hard.

297
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:22,497
You are so kind to me.

298
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:23,392
It's nothing.

299
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:24,537
Being kind to you is because

300
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:26,818
we are relatives, right?

301
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:30,098
Seeing the three of us here,

302
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:31,418
I feel especially emotional.

303
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:34,218
It reminds me of our time
back in Qing City.

304
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:36,657
Ruyu and Menglong.

305
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:39,058
You and me.

306
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:40,537
Cousin, look.

307
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,178
I'm still wearing the bracelet

308
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:43,497
you gave me back then.

309
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:46,496
It's been a long time.

310
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:47,904
You are still wearing it.

311
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:48,897
Of course.

312
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:51,617
How could I bear to throw away
what you gave me? Look.

313
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:53,897
Your hand is almost up in the air.

314
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:55,338
Still mentioning it.

315
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,897
Why don't you chat with
your cousin for a while?

316
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:59,298
I'm going to find Peilan.

317
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,384
- I tell you something.
- Okay.

318
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:01,938
- No problem.
- I tell you something.

319
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:06,897
This is Keling's room.

320
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,448
Be careful.

321
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:09,818
You stay here first.

322
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:11,552
Don't bump into it.

323
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:14,178
Good. Very good.

324
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:15,818
Is there a need to be so exaggerated?

325
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:17,137
Master.

326
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,298
Auntie Hu.

327
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,458
It is the blanket my mother
asked me to prepare for you.

328
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,617
I'll put it here.

329
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,137
- Thank you.
- Who's she?

330
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:24,418
Second Miss, Peilan.

331
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:25,440
Peilan.

332
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:28,377
Peilan, don't rush to leave. Stay.

333
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:30,298
Help me unpack the luggage.

334
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:32,698
I-I have to...

335
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:34,137
Today, she has to clean up.

336
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:35,298
She's busy as a bee.

337
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,058
What's wrong with
you unpacking by yourself?

338
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:38,880
I'm going to the pharmacy.

339
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,137
Cousin, don't go.

340
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:43,737
Peilan,

341
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:46,098
I need to talk to my cousin.

342
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:47,418
Would you...

343
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:52,818
Yes, Auntie.

344
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:59,497
Fine, fine. I'll make the bed for you.

345
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:01,377
It's your first day here,

346
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:02,537
so I will make the bed for you.

347
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:03,617
Cousin, don't go.

348
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:06,657
What's up?

349
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:07,657
Let's chat for a while.

350
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:09,257
It's been a long time. Let's chat.

351
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:13,537
Such a wide bench. Why do you...

352
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,017
Cousin.

353
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:16,897
Can you lend me money?

354
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:21,218
How much?

355
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:22,657
Only ten taels.

356
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:24,537
Ten taels?

357
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:25,737
Too much?

358
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,298
It is not a small amount.

359
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:28,698
Well, Cousin.

360
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:31,137
Seems like your pharmacy
isn't doing well.

361
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,338
I really don't have ten taels.

362
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:34,698
If I had it, I would give it to you.

363
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:41,178
Let me discuss with Ruyu.

364
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:42,857
Well.

365
00:14:42,857 --> 00:14:44,058
It's your own money.

366
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,418
Why do you need to discuss with her?

367
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,298
It is really strange.

368
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:47,520
Cousin.

369
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:49,218
Tell me honestly,

370
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:51,777
what is your relationship

371
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,777
with Ruyu now?

372
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:55,897
Move a bit farther.

373
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,777
It's a long story.

374
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:03,657
After they moved here,

375
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:05,137
I came too.

376
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:06,818
After I arrived, I lived here.

377
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:08,178
Indeed, it's not quite appropriate.

378
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:16,298
So, you gave the money you earned

379
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,777
to them for buying a house.

380
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:20,736
And you'll still have to

381
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:21,737
give them money every month.

382
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:22,818
That sounds so bad.

383
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:24,058
We are sharing profits.

384
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:27,017
Cousin, are you too honest?

385
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:28,777
Were you tricked by them?

386
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:30,698
But I like it.

387
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,377
Thank you.

388
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,617
The point is
I did this completely voluntarily.

389
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,178
This has nothing to do with Ruyu at all.

390
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:37,344
Well.

391
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:39,777
I don't think Ruyu

392
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,818
is an unreasonable person, right?

393
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:42,897
What's more,

394
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:44,657
are you her cousin or my cousin?

395
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:45,537
You use your own money.

396
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:46,657
Why do you talk so much?

397
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,377
What's wrong with asking her?

398
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:50,017
Then ask.

399
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,017
Why are you so angry at me, Cousin?

400
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:53,777
It's really a waste of my time.

401
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:09,298
I brewed some herbal tea for you.

402
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:10,938
Put it here.

403
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:20,418
It's a bit cliché. I...

404
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,017
Actually, I...

405
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,377
I have important matters to discuss.

406
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,008
What's the matter?

407
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:30,377
I need to borrow some money.

408
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:33,418
What do you need the money for?

409
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:34,497
How much do you want?

410
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:37,497
That much?

411
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:41,137
What are you going to do?

412
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:43,938
Should I give
all the money to you and go starving?

413
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:45,617
I... Well...

414
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:47,698
I'm sorry.

415
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:48,818
Ruyu.

416
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:52,058
Please don't blame my cousin.

417
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:54,058
You've been eavesdropping there?

418
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:55,698
Actually, it's me.

419
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,657
I asked my cousin to come over.

420
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,257
Look, I just got here, right?

421
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,097
Medical care did cost a lot.

422
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:07,817
I think since I just got here,

423
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,418
I need to buy some necessities

424
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:12,057
to make myself look decent.

425
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:14,537
I can't embarrass my cousin, right?

426
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:16,960
Cousin.

427
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,057
It's not that I don't lend you money.

428
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:21,537
It's just that the family
really can't afford it.

429
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:26,337
Indeed, I oversimplified things.

430
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:27,978
I really didn't expect

431
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,817
my cousin to make money
by running a pharmacy

432
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,737
and have to spend it on others.

433
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:38,138
I'm completely willing.

434
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:41,537
Ruyu, don't blame me for being blunt.

435
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:42,938
I didn't mean to blame you.

436
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,138
Really. I just think

437
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:48,618
my cousin is too honest.

438
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:51,737
We can't bully honest people, can we?

439
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:56,378
Guo Zhensheng,
if you think I've been bullying you,

440
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,057
you can leave at any time.

441
00:17:58,418 --> 00:17:59,898
I have never thought of that.

442
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:01,497
I have never thought of that.

443
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:03,698
Why are you saying these things?

444
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,378
Ruyu,

445
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,017
I am straightforward.

446
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:09,337
Don't take it to heart.

447
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:10,777
Actually, I think

448
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:12,817
my cousin is all alone out there.

449
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:15,057
There is no one by his side to help him

450
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,378
and give him some advice.

451
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,458
If he gets bullied,
what's he supposed to do?

452
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:20,218
If there's no money,

453
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:21,658
it doesn't really matter.

454
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:23,618
You two mustn't let anything I do

455
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,658
cause any misunderstandings or quarrels.

456
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,337
All right. No more crying here.

457
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:30,218
I don't have ten taels,

458
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:32,178
but I can still afford two taels.

459
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,537
If you need them urgently,

460
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,698
you can take and spend them.

461
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:39,138
As for my relationship
with Guo Zhensheng,

462
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:40,458
if you do not understand it,

463
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:42,618
do not make comments here.

464
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:47,808
Is there anything else?

465
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:52,378
Drink the herbal tea.

466
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,297
Don't drag me. What's wrong?

467
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:57,618
- What's the rush?
- Why did you do it?

468
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:59,418
How would I know
she has become so petty now?

469
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:00,832
Cousin,

470
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:03,017
do you want to
go shopping with me this afternoon?

471
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,458
The public safety in Jianglin is good.

472
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,458
- You can go alone.
- Cousin,

473
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,017
don't hold me. I can manage myself.

474
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,577
Cousin, you're so thoughtful.

475
00:19:16,337 --> 00:19:17,248
Keling,

476
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,458
this is our first time...

477
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:21,938
Don't speak. Be careful.

478
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:23,698
Of what?

479
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,817
Not to be seen.

480
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:28,178
By whom?

481
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:30,720
No one.

482
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,658
Are you not willing to date me?

483
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:37,938
No. Don't be so sensitive.

484
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:44,337
Do you want to eat candied hawthorn?

485
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:46,138
I'll go buy it for you.

486
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:48,577
I don't want it!

487
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:50,848
Boss!

488
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,178
What don't you want?

489
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,497
Who are you talking to?

490
00:19:55,218 --> 00:19:56,138
What are you doing here?

491
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:57,618
What a coincidence. Sit down.

492
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:01,178
Didn't you two go hunting?

493
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:02,698
Boss, since you didn't go,

494
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,178
it wouldn't be fun if we were to go.

495
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:05,458
Why are you here?

496
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:07,297
Didn't you say
you were doing a clean-up?

497
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:08,658
What are you doing here?

498
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,257
Yes, I'm cleaning up.

499
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,577
I need to buy a broom for a clean-up.

500
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,360
So where's the broom?

501
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,218
I haven't bought it yet.

502
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:17,577
Let's go. Let's go buy it together.

503
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:18,658
You need to finish your meal.

504
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:20,097
No. It's okay. We'll help you.

505
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,737
Then we can hang out after we finish it.

506
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:23,138
Right. Why are you
being so polite with us?

507
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,938
Yes. Let's go.
Let's hang out after cleaning.

508
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:26,378
No, thanks. It's very tiring.

509
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:27,264
- I can do it.
- Okay.

510
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,017
We're free. You don't need to
be polite with us.

511
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:29,898
- No need.
- Go ahead. Go.

512
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,337
How did I end up

513
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,418
bringing them back to clean?

514
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:45,337
It struck me

515
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:46,497
that I have to give food to A-Si.

516
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,418
Isn't he sick?

517
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:50,458
Yes, he's sick.

518
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:53,097
He can only eat what Peilan makes.

519
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,938
Let's clean another day.

520
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:56,497
Let's go together then.

521
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:58,497
Yes. A-Si is our brother after all.

522
00:20:58,497 --> 00:20:59,392
No. No.

523
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,537
It won't be appropriate

524
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,737
if too many of us
enter his mansion, right?

525
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:06,898
Well.

526
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,577
I'll go now. You guys go home quickly.

527
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:10,297
You can go hunting as well.

528
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:11,938
I have to go. Bye. See you another day.

529
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,584
Where is he?

530
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,497
Thank goodness.

531
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:28,618
I'm glad you're still here.

532
00:21:28,858 --> 00:21:29,760
Let's go.

533
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:31,552
Where did you go?

534
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:33,858
I-I-I...

535
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:35,458
Let's leave here first.
I'll explain on the way.

536
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,257
Wait. I've been looking for you
for a long time.

537
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:39,057
Sorry. It's my fault.

538
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:40,178
Let's walk and talk, shall we?

539
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:42,138
Wait. Tell me now.

540
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:43,257
How much is a bowl of noodles?

541
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:43,858
Five Wen.

542
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:45,337
Five Wen. It is cheap. Okay.

543
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:46,720
I am going to eat noodles.

544
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,138
I can't figure it out all the way.

545
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,178
I have to ask you.
I understand whatever you buy,

546
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,257
but why are you buying a wedding dress?

547
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:53,658
Cousin,

548
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:56,777
do you think
I look particularly good in this dress?

549
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:58,618
I'll tell you. A good-looking dress

550
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:00,537
is needed to share with everyone,

551
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:01,497
isn't it?

552
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:03,938
And the biggest regret of my life

553
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:05,698
is failing to be with the person I like

554
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:08,458
while wearing beautiful clothes.

555
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,178
Put it away. Hurry up and put it away.

556
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:11,497
Master.

557
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:16,497
What are you doing here?

558
00:22:17,618 --> 00:22:20,138
I'm going shopping with my cousin.

559
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,088
Auntie Hu.

560
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:22,938
Auntie Hu?

561
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,418
Jinrong. The eldest daughter of Ruyu.

562
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:27,418
So, this is Jinrong.

563
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:29,938
Such a grown-up.

564
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:31,898
- It's just in time. Help me check it.
- You.

565
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:33,097
Take a look at this style.

566
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:34,297
Isn't it the most popular color

567
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:35,777
in the town this year?

568
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:37,057
Did I make a good choice?

569
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:38,497
Take a look

570
00:22:38,497 --> 00:22:40,698
if we two match well in these clothes?

571
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:45,257
Master, is such a good thing

572
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:46,737
known to my mother?

573
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:49,138
What good thing? There's no good thing.

574
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,297
No, it's not what you think.

575
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:52,178
Master.

576
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:54,577
I originally thought
you were a very loyal person.

577
00:22:54,577 --> 00:22:55,817
Yes, he's loyal.

578
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:57,178
Your master

579
00:22:57,178 --> 00:23:00,737
has never changed
his feelings for me over the years.

580
00:23:01,218 --> 00:23:02,418
Then I won't bother you.

581
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:04,618
Jinrong, Jinrong.

582
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:05,698
- Wait. Don't go.
- Jinrong.

583
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:06,858
I want to eat some noodles.

584
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:07,978
- Jinrong.
- Hurry up.

585
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,218
Mother, they are about to get married.

586
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:12,618
Are you going to interfere or not?

587
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:17,440
They're back.

588
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:20,192
Ruyu.

589
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:21,537
It is not the truth.

590
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:23,497
So you borrowed money from me

591
00:23:23,497 --> 00:23:25,218
as there will be a good thing, right?

592
00:23:25,218 --> 00:23:26,218
You should have told me.

593
00:23:28,337 --> 00:23:29,257
Let me explain to you.

594
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:31,138
I wish you a happy marriage.

595
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:32,418
You don't have to pay back.

596
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:33,898
Consider it as my gift.

597
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:35,057
It's indeed what you should do,

598
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:35,978
isn't it?

599
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:38,097
After all, the money

600
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:39,978
was earned by my cousin.

601
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,152
Jinrong.

602
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:42,944
Alright.

603
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:45,178
I'll give you a bigger present later.

604
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:47,257
Speaking of which,

605
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,618
my cousin also owns
a part of this house, right?

606
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:52,097
What nonsense are you talking?

607
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:52,938
So,

608
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:54,938
do you want to split my house in half

609
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,178
as your marital home?

610
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,497
That's not necessary.

611
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,097
Thanks for your blessings, Ruyu.

612
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,458
Hurry up, Cousin.

613
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:02,658
Thank her.

614
00:24:03,537 --> 00:24:04,698
Blessings.

615
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:07,858
I have a lot of them to give.

616
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:10,378
Guo Zhensheng,

617
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:13,138
you are indeed a doctor.

618
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:14,658
Good for you at this age.

619
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:16,178
Jinrong, let's go.

620
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:20,938
Extremely smutty.

621
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:28,618
Impolite.

622
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:37,178
What exactly do you want?

623
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:38,777
Cousin,

624
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:41,138
I was just speaking the truth.

625
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:44,057
But there are things

626
00:24:44,658 --> 00:24:46,378
that I haven't told you.

627
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:48,898
Actually,

628
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:50,898
I didn't come here

629
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:53,458
solely for treatment.

630
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,858
I came...

631
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:00,737
I came to tell you something.

632
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:03,497
We missed each other back then, right?

633
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:05,057
Actually, I still

634
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:07,658
have feelings for you.

635
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:11,136
Nana,

636
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:13,858
as a pharmacy owner,

637
00:25:13,938 --> 00:25:15,658
I responsibly tell you

638
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:17,898
your lumbar canal is not narrow,

639
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:19,378
the ankle joint is not loose,

640
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:21,097
and the circulation
responsible for movement

641
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:22,497
has no problems.

642
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:24,017
When you were a child,

643
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:25,618
once you fell,

644
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:28,577
all your family members
would gather around to care for you.

645
00:25:28,858 --> 00:25:30,737
Your mother would stomp

646
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:32,898
and accuse the uneven floor,

647
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,898
blaming it for causing you to fall.

648
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:37,378
Your cough is not because
your lungs are bad.

649
00:25:38,017 --> 00:25:39,737
Your complexion is rosy.
You are healthy,

650
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,057
and full of energy.

651
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:43,618
When you were a child, once you coughed,

652
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,138
the family members
would stack all snacks

653
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,698
and drinks in front of you.

654
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:48,898
You could get whatever you wanted.

655
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:50,378
You used this method

656
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,257
to solicit the care

657
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:53,737
of your family.

658
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:56,864
Nana,

659
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,178
those are your family members.

660
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:02,497
We all are growing up and getting old.

661
00:26:03,698 --> 00:26:04,737
Those

662
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:06,698
who once cared for us deeply

663
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,817
are also slowly growing old and then,

664
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:11,898
leaving us one by one.

665
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:13,178
This is natural.

666
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:15,618
Nana, why do you choose to let yourself

667
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:17,418
become obsessed with this kind of love

668
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:19,017
obtained through deception?

669
00:26:19,297 --> 00:26:20,658
Life is naturally rough.

670
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:21,898
What does it matter if you fail?

671
00:26:22,017 --> 00:26:22,944
Back then,

672
00:26:23,057 --> 00:26:25,178
why did your mother
sever relations with my mother?

673
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,097
I cherished you the most

674
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:28,658
among your nine cousins.

675
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:31,218
Your mother wanted me to marry you. Why?

676
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,017
She hoped a man

677
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:34,097
would be always good to you.

678
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:36,458
She hoped you would not
be wronged for a life time.

679
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:39,057
Who doesn't have grievances in life?

680
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,817
Even emperors have them.

681
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:03,936
Cousin.

682
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,337
I'm sorry.

683
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,938
I am here to say goodbye.

684
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:20,938
No wonder you didn't dine with us.

685
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:22,257
It turns out you had an appointment.

686
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:24,257
S-She came to say goodbye.

687
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,057
Whatever.

688
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:28,138
As you please.

689
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:30,858
Is your mother okay?

690
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:37,737
I've thought about it too.

691
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:39,577
You are right.

692
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:41,418
I can't always

693
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:43,418
rely on your sympathy to live.

694
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:45,218
So many years have passed.

695
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:48,178
We should live our own lives.

696
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:50,816
I wish you

697
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:53,057
live a happy life with Ruyu.

698
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:55,418
Is that really what you think?

699
00:27:55,537 --> 00:27:56,858
You don't even believe me now?

700
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:59,337
Fine. I deserve it.

701
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:01,057
I didn't mean that.

702
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:03,618
After you scolded me, I understand

703
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,458
you really care about me.

704
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,378
Well, I am leaving.

705
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:09,057
Take good care of yourself.

706
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:11,057
Have a meal before leaving.

707
00:28:14,017 --> 00:28:15,737
That's not appropriate, right?

708
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,418
I feel too guilty to see them.

709
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:21,817
As you already sat down,
feel free to eat anything.

710
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:23,057
Cousin.

711
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:24,672
Do you have wine?

712
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:33,888
Drink less.

713
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:43,057
20 taels of silver. Take them.

714
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:45,152
Well.

715
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:47,737
Where did you get them?

716
00:28:48,218 --> 00:28:49,737
I borrowed them from the winery owner.

717
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,378
Borrow 20 and return 30 over five years.

718
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:54,378
So you do have a way.

719
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,698
Where are you planning to go next?

720
00:28:58,297 --> 00:28:59,232
Suzhou.

721
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,458
They are recruiting embroiderers
and I know a bit.

722
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:04,218
That's nice.

723
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:08,800
What are you doing?

724
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,400
Feeling a bit hot.

725
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:13,497
What kind of wine did you give me?

726
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:14,577
Why am I feeling so hot?

727
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:15,858
I only have medicinal wine here.

728
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:19,040
Cousin.

729
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:21,178
Once I leave,

730
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:22,698
we won't be able to see each other.

731
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:24,378
You need to take good care of yourself.

732
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:26,497
I also wish you and Ruyu

733
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:27,936
happiness.

734
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,737
May you be warm in winters.

735
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,418
May you not be cold in springs.

736
00:29:35,097 --> 00:29:36,138
May you be courageous.

737
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:37,737
May you be safe.

738
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:39,378
I will open a window. It's a bit hot.

739
00:29:41,418 --> 00:29:44,418
May you have no suffering
and live simply.

740
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:49,218
You're still young.

741
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:52,057
Things will surely get better
in the future.

742
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:53,664
That's all?

743
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:54,624
That's all.

744
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:58,497
Someone! He's harassing me!

745
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,378
When did I harass you?

746
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,568
Aren't you

747
00:30:02,297 --> 00:30:04,017
harassing me?

748
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:05,418
No. You are doing that yourself.

749
00:30:05,418 --> 00:30:07,178
How did I harass you?

750
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:08,858
Cousin, I am just joking with you.

751
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:10,138
Come on. It's okay. Come here.

752
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:11,577
Hu Nana.

753
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,440
What on earth do you want?

754
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,336
Nothing.

755
00:30:14,336 --> 00:30:15,257
What do you want to do?

756
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:16,458
Come here.

757
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,057
Everyone, look!

758
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:19,297
Guo Zhensheng of the Jiren Pharmacy

759
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:20,817
is harassing a decent woman.

760
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,537
Hu Nana, what nonsense are you talking about?

761
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:24,057
No. Don't look. Stop looking.

762
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:26,458
- Don't come over. Don't, Cousin.
- What's happening?

763
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,418
- What's wrong?
- Don't.

764
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:37,898
Your master harassed me.

765
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,658
What's going on, Master?

766
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,497
When did I harass you?

767
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:45,898
Guo Zhensheng of the Jiren Pharmacy

768
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:48,017
harassed a decent woman
in broad daylight!

769
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:49,218
Someone!

770
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:51,458
Someone! Someone!

771
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:54,720
What happened?

772
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:57,600
What are you doing?

773
00:30:58,817 --> 00:30:59,712
Sit.

774
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:00,864
What happened?

775
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:05,497
This woman said Master harassed her.

776
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,497
I thought something else happened.

777
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:09,817
What's wrong? What's wrong?

778
00:31:10,297 --> 00:31:11,337
Sit, Banxia.

779
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:14,898
This woman said Master harassed her.

780
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:17,184
Well,

781
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,938
how did I harass you?

782
00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:23,097
Cousin, you can't deny it.

783
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:27,057
Enough. Are you still acting?
Aren't you tired?

784
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:28,418
Exactly. Even I can tell

785
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:29,458
Master doesn't like you.

786
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,257
Even if you lent him guts,
he wouldn't dare to do it.

787
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:33,497
My master is just an honest fellow.

788
00:31:33,618 --> 00:31:35,938
In such a broad daylight...

789
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:38,658
Just go back where you came from.

790
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,737
You little girls.

791
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:42,698
Are you siding with Du Ruyu
and driving me out?

792
00:31:42,698 --> 00:31:44,257
I tell you. It's not that easy.

793
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:45,777
Today, you must be responsible for me.

794
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:47,378
Your family must be responsible for me.

795
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:50,138
Tell me if you handle it publicly
or privately. It's fine with me.

796
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:53,057
Hu Nana, what exactly do you want to do?

797
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,178
Cousin, let me tell you.

798
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:57,138
You can't deny this.

799
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:58,858
You've already done it.

800
00:31:58,858 --> 00:32:00,577
Are you trying to mess with me
by dumping me?

801
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:02,537
What do you mean by that?

802
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:04,017
Am I dumping you?

803
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:04,938
Master.

804
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:07,418
Let her go to the court if she wants to.

805
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:08,817
We can sue her for defamation.

806
00:32:08,817 --> 00:32:10,057
She's going to be spanked.

807
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:13,057
This girl is arrogant. Great.

808
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,097
Then I'll show the neighborhood

809
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,257
the character of your family.

810
00:32:15,418 --> 00:32:16,458
Is anyone there?

811
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,378
- Come here.
- What?

812
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:18,458
Are you bullying us, aren't you?

813
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:21,792
Ruyu.

814
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:23,577
You came at perfect time.

815
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:25,618
My cousin.

816
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:26,858
He harassed me.

817
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:28,577
- Stop watching.
- Isn't this just perfect?

818
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,418
Isn't this what you wished for?

819
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:32,218
Why are you shouting here?

820
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:34,138
If you have the guts,
go shout it on the main street.

821
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:37,978
What kind of people are in your family?

822
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:39,296
You think I wouldn't dare?

823
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,178
I'll shout it out.

824
00:32:40,178 --> 00:32:42,138
What can't you do?

825
00:32:42,138 --> 00:32:43,497
You should go out and ask around.

826
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:45,938
Who on this street doesn't know
that Guo Zhensheng is an honest person?

827
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:47,337
Who would believe that he harassed you?

828
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,978
Whether they believe it or not,
it doesn't matter.

829
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:51,777
It matters if the court believes it.

830
00:32:51,777 --> 00:32:53,418
Come here. Take a look.

831
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:54,938
A man and a woman in the same room.

832
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:56,138
My clothes are disheveled.

833
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:57,737
Who'd believe that nothing happened?

834
00:32:57,817 --> 00:32:58,737
The court, right?

835
00:32:58,817 --> 00:32:59,737
- Banxia.
- Right.

836
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:00,978
Accompany him to report to officials.

837
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:03,057
Don't come back if this woman

838
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:03,898
isn't spanked.

839
00:33:03,978 --> 00:33:06,378
Yes, Mother. I try to get the court
to charge her with

840
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:08,257
blackmail and extortion,
and send her to jail.

841
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:09,777
Auntie, don't be afraid.

842
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:11,337
If you're in the jail,
I'll bring you food.

843
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:12,858
Chattering woman.

844
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,698
Let's see how you're going to play next.

845
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:17,097
Alright.

846
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:18,817
Enough.

847
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:21,898
They're bullying me
because they outnumber me.

848
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:23,658
All these women are ganging up on me.

849
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:24,737
Won't you do something about it?

850
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:25,777
Won't you?

851
00:33:25,777 --> 00:33:27,497
I'll fight her.

852
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:29,297
- Enough. Sit down.
- I'm giving you guts?

853
00:33:29,297 --> 00:33:30,208
Jinrong.

854
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:35,136
Cousin.

855
00:33:35,618 --> 00:33:36,608
Are you now

856
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:39,497
helping the outsiders?

857
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:42,978
Fine. I'll show everyone
your true colors.

858
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:45,698
Someone! Come and see.

859
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:48,418
They're bullying me.
I want to commit suicide.

860
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:56,858
You bad man.

861
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:58,297
My mother died early.

862
00:33:58,297 --> 00:33:59,577
So, you won today.

863
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:01,378
Think about how good
my mother was to you.

864
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,057
I'll fight you.

865
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:04,032
I don't want to live.

866
00:34:04,817 --> 00:34:06,057
I don't want to live anymore.

867
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,218
Mother. Mother.

868
00:34:07,218 --> 00:34:08,418
- Let her smash them.
- Is it enough?

869
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:09,898
Our family is not lacking this.

870
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:10,818
I'll fight him.

871
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:13,632
Stop it.

872
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:15,712
What are you doing?

873
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:17,697
Who reported to the court?

874
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:18,624
It was me.

875
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:20,497
This woman was throwing a tantrum,

876
00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:21,978
extorting and blackmailing
in our pharmacy.

877
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,258
All these on the ground are evidence.

878
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:24,217
You also saw it

879
00:34:24,217 --> 00:34:25,177
when you came in just now.

880
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:26,177
So, please.

881
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:26,778
Take her away.

882
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:27,648
No, no.

883
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,938
She's making false accusations.

884
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:30,858
Cousin, don't. Cousin, save me.

885
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:32,978
Who dares to bully my mother?

886
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:34,378
I'm here to save you, Mother.

887
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:37,738
Am I too late?

888
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,408
(Jianglin Court)

889
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:03,818
So you're leaving?

890
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:08,224
What?

891
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:09,858
You want to detain me?

892
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:12,497
Not really.

893
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:16,992
Although what you've done
doesn't seem quite right,

894
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,617
my kids were indeed
somewhat impulsive just now.

895
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:22,418
Don't take it too seriously.

896
00:35:24,258 --> 00:35:25,938
Where are you planning to go next?

897
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,097
I have a few cousins in Yangzhou.

898
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:35,217
I would go to live with them.

899
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,097
You'd better rely on yourself than on men.

900
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:52,640
Ruyu.

901
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:54,778
I get all that.

902
00:35:56,778 --> 00:35:58,057
But in this world,

903
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:00,738
not every woman is as strong as you are.

904
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:03,338
Especially for someone like me.

905
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:04,778
Other than being beautiful,

906
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:06,978
I'm useless.

907
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:12,617
If I don't rely on men,

908
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:14,938
what else can I do?

909
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:17,184
Enough.

910
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:19,177
I have to leave now.

911
00:36:19,697 --> 00:36:20,537
See you.

912
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:37,664
Ruyu.

913
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:40,458
I've seen you.

914
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:43,057
I just have a couple of things
I want to tell you.

915
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:48,378
It's been a day of mixed emotions.

916
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,177
Let's begin with the sadness.

917
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,537
Honestly, seeing my cousin's life
turn out like that,

918
00:36:53,617 --> 00:36:55,217
I find it extremely painful inside.

919
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:57,497
I mean no offense.

920
00:36:57,497 --> 00:36:58,497
Now, onto the joyful part.

921
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,497
The joy is that you stood up today

922
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:03,057
to defend me,

923
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:05,298
and spoke out for me.

924
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:07,378
You trusted me so much

925
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:08,898
and protected me.

926
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:12,338
It made me feel

927
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,017
so warm,

928
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,017
and happy.

929
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:18,017
I am elated.

930
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:22,697
Actually, I came here

931
00:37:22,697 --> 00:37:24,177
because I have something more important

932
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:26,057
to tell you.

933
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:30,458
I borrowed 20 taels of silver

934
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,458
from the owner of the opposite store.

935
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,818
I have to repay 30 taels in five years.

936
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:38,177
Repay that money yourself.

937
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,017
Yes, of course. I'll repay it myself.

938
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:41,818
I'll pay him back from my own dividends.

939
00:37:41,818 --> 00:37:43,298
I just feel a bit improper

940
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:44,778
not having informed you beforehand.

941
00:37:44,778 --> 00:37:46,697
So, telling you now
isn't too late, right?

942
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:48,017
You're not mad at me, are you?

943
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,017
I'll think about it.

944
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:52,544
You're still angry with me.

945
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:53,458
Back then, I...

946
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,298
- Be outside.
- Back then...

947
00:38:02,938 --> 00:38:04,858
There was the act of
asking for punishment,

948
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:06,818
and now, there's Guo
admitting his mistake.

949
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:09,378
Ruyu, if you're still not appeased,

950
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:10,657
you can hit me, alright?

951
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:11,697
Hit me until you feel better.

952
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,657
What does it look like if it's seen?

953
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:15,497
I know you must still be angry with me.

954
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,057
Well, if you don't hit me,

955
00:38:17,057 --> 00:38:18,057
I'll bump into something.

956
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:19,577
Look. Look at this.

957
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:20,497
I bump.

958
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:23,657
Did this make me seem insincere?

959
00:38:23,657 --> 00:38:25,664
Then, I will hit myself.

960
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:27,778
Guo Zhensheng, you bad.

961
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:29,177
Guo Zhensheng, you bad.

962
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:30,738
You bad Guo Zhensheng.

963
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:32,544
You.

964
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,080
Are you okay?

965
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:38,137
It's fine. It doesn't hurt.

966
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:40,418
You are not angry now?

967
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:44,512
There's another thing I want to ask you.

968
00:38:44,512 --> 00:38:45,378
That's...

969
00:38:45,378 --> 00:38:46,818
What else do you need?

970
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:48,537
Tonight,

971
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:50,976
are

972
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:53,248
you free?

973
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:57,418
The ticket is hard to get.

974
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:00,704
You are smiling.

975
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:04,378
Don't push. Take care.

976
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:06,778
Come on. Have your tickets ready.

977
00:39:09,938 --> 00:39:10,898
Have them ready first.

978
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,258
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

979
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:17,298
The performance begins.

980
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,617
Line up.

981
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:21,418
Don't push.

982
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:33,858
It's so lively.

983
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,258
Right. If someone asks you,

984
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:37,537
just say you're sick.

985
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:39,338
Who would ask me?

986
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,617
In case you are asked.

987
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:45,472
I...

988
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:46,464
Let's go.

989
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:50,976
Okay, okay.

990
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:52,768
Come here.

991
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,577
What's wrong?

992
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:56,697
My mother is here too.

993
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:57,920
Don't look.

994
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:00,978
Don't notice me.

995
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:03,738
Don't worry. The kids are all at home.

996
00:40:04,258 --> 00:40:05,617
They all have things to keep them busy.

997
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,217
What do I have to worry about?

998
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:10,978
I came to see Ye Xiaolou's performance,

999
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:12,298
not because of you.

1000
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:14,497
Of course.

1001
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:16,818
Right here.

1002
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:17,898
Okay. Sit.

1003
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:30,657
Lower your head.

1004
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:31,497
What's wrong?

1005
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:33,298
That naughty girl. Why did she come?

1006
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,298
Stop looking.

1007
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:35,938
What should we do? Let's go.

1008
00:40:36,097 --> 00:40:37,217
I asked others

1009
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,738
to get these tickets at a high price.

1010
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:40,778
You're still thinking about it.
Let's go.

1011
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:41,858
Understood.

1012
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:43,577
Cover your face.

1013
00:40:43,577 --> 00:40:44,858
Cover my face.

1014
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:47,858
Hurry up. Cover your face well.

1015
00:40:48,137 --> 00:40:49,378
Understood.

1016
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,378
Hurry up. Let's go back.

1017
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:53,258
What's wrong again?

1018
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,537
Peilan, Peilan.

1019
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:55,104
Peilan?

1020
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,298
Stop looking.

1021
00:40:56,898 --> 00:40:57,778
There're seats.

1022
00:40:59,177 --> 00:41:00,617
The seats are good.

1023
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:02,858
Here. Have a cup of tea.

1024
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:09,697
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

1025
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,338
Look at those two people.

1026
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:18,818
They're asleep before the show starts.

1027
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:20,217
Oh, my.

1028
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:24,697
That figure looks so familiar.

1029
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:25,217
Which one?

1030
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:26,858
Oh, no. Jinrong is here.

1031
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:29,728
Young Lord.

1032
00:41:30,537 --> 00:41:32,858
Do you think
we will be found by your father

1033
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:35,298
if we act so blatantly?

1034
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:38,217
I'm not afraid of him.

1035
00:41:39,057 --> 00:41:40,000
Jinrong,

1036
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:42,418
I know you're suffering, but believe me.

1037
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:44,418
We will pull through together.

1038
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:45,378
I don't believe

1039
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,577
my father insists on me marrying

1040
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:48,418
a woman I don't like, right?

1041
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:50,848
Here.

1042
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,298
Have a grape.

1043
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,080
Keling.

1044
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:00,057
Why don't we go over and say hi?

1045
00:42:00,137 --> 00:42:01,577
This can't go on.

1046
00:42:02,097 --> 00:42:03,072
Shut up.

1047
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:05,057
If my daughters

1048
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:07,057
see me watch a performance
of Ye Xiaolou with you,

1049
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:08,858
how can I face them?

1050
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:11,577
Oh, my. Buping.

1051
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:12,858
If Jinrong knows we're here,

1052
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:14,258
my mother must know it too.

1053
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:15,818
It's fine, Peilan.

1054
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:16,778
We're close to the door.

1055
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:17,978
Let's run away after it ends.

1056
00:42:17,978 --> 00:42:19,378
They definitely won't discover us.

1057
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:24,160
What happened?

1058
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:28,217
I always feel like someone
is watching me from behind.

1059
00:42:28,418 --> 00:42:29,344
Really?

1060
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:35,858
You're too sensitive.

1061
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:37,537
Are you sure there's none?

1062
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:42,048
Look.

1063
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:46,617
Ye Xiaolou is here.

1064
00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:48,537
- Great!
- Great!

1065
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,497
- Great!
- Great!

1066
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:08,537
- Great!
- Great!

1067
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:31,017
Lu Buping.

1068
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:34,537
Peilan said you were feeling unwell.

1069
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:36,217
What's wrong with you?

1070
00:43:36,577 --> 00:43:37,818
- Stomachache.
- I have a headache.

1071
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:41,617
I have both

1072
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:43,017
headache and stomachache.

1073
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:43,858
Right.

1074
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:46,418
Really? Have you taken any medicine?

1075
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:48,258
I'm much better now. No need to take it.

1076
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:49,858
Thank you for your concern.

1077
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:53,458
Master, where did you go this afternoon?

1078
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,400
I didn't see you.

1079
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:56,960
I had plans.

1080
00:43:58,617 --> 00:43:59,458
What plans?

1081
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:01,938
No. It was just...

1082
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:06,097
Adult's business.

1083
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:13,568
Keling.

1084
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,577
Did you help Peilan
with housework today?

1085
00:44:16,137 --> 00:44:17,537
I helped.

1086
00:44:17,537 --> 00:44:18,778
Yes, she helped.

1087
00:44:18,778 --> 00:44:19,818
Keling was very helpful.

1088
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:20,898
Really?

1089
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:21,760
Yes.

1090
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,258
I saw a lot today

1091
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:26,057
and learned a lot as well.

1092
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:33,938
What are you laughing at?

1093
00:44:36,577 --> 00:44:37,418
Tofu.

1094
00:44:38,418 --> 00:44:39,537
It really smells like tofu.

1095
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,577
There's a hint of tofu.

1096
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,657
A famous artist
named Ye Xiaolou came here.

1097
00:44:45,657 --> 00:44:47,217
Let's all go see him together one day.

1098
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:52,898
Go together and have a look?

1099
00:44:58,617 --> 00:44:59,497
Could you pass me some?

1100
00:44:59,818 --> 00:45:01,017
Have all of you seen it?

1101
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:01,978
Here. It helps to grow tall.

1102
00:45:02,137 --> 00:45:03,137
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

1103
00:45:04,177 --> 00:45:05,217
You've seen it, haven't you?

1104
00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:14,697
It's too salty.

1105
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:15,537
Too salty?

1106
00:45:15,537 --> 00:45:16,137
Which one?

1107
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:16,617
Salty.

1108
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:17,338
- Salty.
- Which one?

1109
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:17,858
Which one?

1110
00:45:17,858 --> 00:45:19,497
- I just said your soup is salty.
- This one?

1111
00:45:19,497 --> 00:45:20,458
- The soup is salty.
- A bit.

1112

Is this one salty?

1113
00:45:21,097 --> 00:45:23,017
- No, Master.
- Put it here.

1114
00:45:23,017 --> 00:45:24,378
- I'll do it.
- I'll go. I'll go.

1115
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:25,497
I'll handle it. Don't waste it.

1116
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:26,818
- Just rinse it.
- Change one.

1117
00:45:26,818 --> 00:45:27,738
- It'll be ready.
- Rinse it?

1118
00:45:27,738 --> 00:45:29,177
I'll reheat it, and it'll be ready.

1119
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:30,458
There's still some in the pot.
