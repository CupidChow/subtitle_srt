(The righteous Keling Gang was trapped)

34
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:03,558
Peilan, I always feel like
there's endless laundry

35
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:04,558
in your house.

36
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:06,077
We have many people in our house.

37
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,558
Do you think the number of soldiers
will drop these days?

38
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:16,037
Mr. Lu, there are still
many soldiers outside.

39
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:17,197
You must be careful.

40
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,118
Why about making
stir-fried eggs with chives for lunch?

41
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:29,798
Mr. Lu, are you hungry?

42
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:31,358
I've lost weight these days.

43
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:34,157
Okay.

44
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:35,317
How many eggs should we use?

45
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:36,477
Four or five.

46
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:38,518
What are you doing here?

47
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:40,798
Mother, I'm teaching Mr. Lu
how to do the laundry.

48
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:42,877
Is he trash?
Which of you is the servant?

49
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:46,157
Not good at anything,
but never full however much you eat.

50
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:47,877
If you can't finish it within two hours,

51
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,398
then get out of here. Understand?

52
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:51,717
Yes, yes.

53
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:52,798
Peilan, let's go.

54
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,304
Mother.

55
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:58,656
Go.

56
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,358
The business is worse with no customers.

57
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,197
Master, your bed is not bad.

58
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:33,678
It's much better
than a woodshed, isn't it?

59
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:36,838
Get off.

60
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:39,597
You can't blame your sister
who asked you to get off.

61
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:42,157
It is specially prepared
for the patients.

62
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:44,518
If we sleep here, it will get dirty,

63
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:45,558
and that's not good.

64
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,037
Master, why did you call me here?

65
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:52,398
Banxia, the medicine on the platform
needs to be turned over.

66
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:56,000
Be careful.

67
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:00,317
Chun Keling, don't touch anything here.

68
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:01,317
I'm warning you.

69
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:14,798
I called you here
to discuss something with you

70
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:15,877
because you're pretty cunning.

71
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:18,238
Master, I'm not cunning.

72
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:20,637
I've behaved lately.
Don't complain about me to Mother.

73
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,358
Keling, don't misunderstand me.

74
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:23,678
I'm on your side.

75
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:28,397
You've been doing
great deeds of chivalry all along.

76
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:30,757
It's very good. I should learn from you.

77
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,118
Learn from me?

78
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:36,718
Look, when the heroes

79
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:39,598
see the rise and fall of the world
as their own responsibility,

80
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:41,238
they're bound to
have some bruises, right?

81
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:43,277
And they will have
internal or external injuries, right?

82
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:44,598
So, I hope that you can

83
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:46,837
bring these heroes to the pharmacy.

84
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:48,598
I'll treat their wounds,

85
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:51,678
which is also a small contribution
to your world of martial arts.

86
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,598
I didn't expect that you are also

87
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:55,437
a man of the martial world.

88
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:58,238
- It's my duty.
- As I am Heroine in Jianglin,

89
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,718
why don't you call yourself
Pharmacist Hero in Jianglin?

90
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:03,197
No need.

91
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:04,998
Master, you need a title.

92
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:05,957
When you do good deeds,

93
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,798
people will know your name,
which is only fair.

94
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:09,558
Well, I do good deeds
without leaving my name.

95
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:11,517
As long as they leave the money.

96
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:13,757
Money? You still want money?

97
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:16,038
The pharmacy hasn't been doing well.

98
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:18,238
You have to help me and the family.

99
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:21,158
Master, you'd better not call yourself

100
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,238
Pharmacist Hero in Jianglin,
but Piggy Bank Hero in Jianglin.

101
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:26,718
Discount. Ten percent off?
Twenty percent off? How is it?

102
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:36,896
Hey, you.

103
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:38,998
Make me a cup of tea

104
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,118
of goji berry, red date, lily, longan,
and lotus seed. Bring it to my room.

105
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,077
Do you mean porridge?

106
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:47,877
What did you say?

107
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:49,757
I haven't finished doing the laundry.

108
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:50,598
So?

109
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:51,798
I'm busy.

110
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:52,918
So?

111
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,277
So, can't you make a cup of it yourself?

112
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:56,877
Are you a servant or am I?

113
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:58,598
Time for real action.

114
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:04,448
I won't wash anymore.

115
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,238
Hey, scrape the bottom of the wok later.

116
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:15,837
What's the point of cleaning the bottom?

117
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:19,397
What do you know?
The ash is a medicinal ingredient.

118
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:24,038
Haven't you done yet?

119
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:25,598
What have you been doing all this time?

120
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,397
I-I've been washing all the time.

121
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:28,877
And you haven't finished yet?

122
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:30,558
So much of it.

123
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:33,598
So?

124
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:34,678
So?

125
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:35,957
So I'm not cooking your meal.

126
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,400
No. I...

127
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:42,837
Remember to scrape the bottom.

128
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:51,199
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

129
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:56,960
Your Highness. Your Highness?

130
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:58,317
He might still be sleeping.

131
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:05,517
Your Highness, it's me, Tengyun.

132
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,277
Why do I have a bad feeling?

133
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:12,704
No way.

134
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:20,837
Your Highness? Your Highness?

135
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:24,877
Look. I knew it.

136
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:27,598
Young Lord, here is a letter.

137
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,158
I'll be out for a few days.
Don't forget our deal.

138
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:41,837
Brother, can you do me another favor?

139
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,077
What is it?

140
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:45,158
I might go out often in the future.

141
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,678
Please cover for me. Don't tell others.

142
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,277
It seems that Fourth Prince

143
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,877
still doesn't trust us, huh?

144
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:54,718
If something happens to him outside,

145
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,317
what am I supposed to do then?

146
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,877
Young Lord, this time
he chose to go out on his own.

147
00:07:58,877 --> 00:07:59,957
It's none of our business.

148
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:01,158
You fool.

149
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:03,517
Do you want Father to blame me
for not protecting him properly?

150
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,517
Then we should
go explain to His Highness now.

151
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,837
Fool. Do you want Fourth Prince
to blame me for disobeying the order?

152
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,118
T-Then, what should we do?

153
00:08:11,118 --> 00:08:12,837
What should we do?
Hurry up and find him!

154
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:13,678
Guards!

155
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:15,277
Do you know what a covert mission is?

156
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:16,158
There you off!

157
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:17,038
Keep it down!

158
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:21,558
Young Lord, should we
find him ourselves?

159
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:25,598
You tell me. Hurry up and go!

160
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:28,397
Stupid.

161
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:47,438
Boss.

162
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:49,757
Here you are.

163
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:52,118
You too. How's your arm?

164
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:53,917
It's healed.

165
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,557
That's good.

166
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:56,637
Did you bring them?

167
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:59,757
Boss, what's going on?

168
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:02,478
My sister said
that there were robbers nearby.

169
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:04,238
Isn't it time for the Jianglin Trio

170
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,438
to fight the strong,
help the weak, and do justice?

171
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:11,438
But we pawned ours.

172
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:13,958
Pawned? Why?

173
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,598
We have to pay the rent, right?

174
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,198
A penny stumps the hero.

175
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,598
What about you? Did you bring any?

176
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:24,478
What?

177
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:27,757
Knives, swords, maces,
or a two-section cudgel.

178
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:28,757
So, weapons.

179
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,118
Or what?

180
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:32,224
I didn't bring them.

181
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:35,358
Good for you three.

182
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:37,757
Venturing into the world of martial arts
without weapons.

183
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:42,998
But I know where we can find some.

184
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:46,998
Young Lord.

185
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:48,128
Found him?

186
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:49,358
Wait a moment.

187
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:50,198
Where are you going?

188
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:54,998
Good news and bad news.

189
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:56,877
Quit it. Have you found him or not?

190
00:09:56,998 --> 00:09:58,198
We have already sent more people,

191
00:09:58,238 --> 00:09:59,998
but we failed
to find out his whereabouts.

192
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:00,998
What about the good news?

193
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:02,517
We didn't find his body either.

194
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,598
I'd say he should still be alive.

195
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,557
Still alive, huh?

196
00:10:05,557 --> 00:10:06,557
Hurry up and go look for him!

197
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:08,877
His Highness has arrived!

198
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:10,517
I'm doomed.

199
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:11,438
What should we do?

200
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:13,718
Heaven is against me.

201
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:18,238
- What should we do?
- Fourth Prince.

202
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,598
- Go and hide quickly.
- I am here to invite you to meals.

203
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:24,157
Your Highness?

204
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:28,198
Your Highness?

205
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,757
Father.

206
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,757
What are you doing here?

207
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:35,637
I am...

208
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:36,718
Where is Fourth Prince?

209
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:38,958
He's not feeling well.
He is already resting.

210
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:39,998
Not feeling well?

211
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:42,637
- Father.
- Your Highness.

212
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:44,480
Father.

213
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,598
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

214
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,517
It's all due to our poor care.

215
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:49,797
I will invite an imperial doctor now.

216
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:51,358
No.

217
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,358
He just needs some rest.

218
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:55,958
Shush. I'm talking to His Highness.

219
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,358
How dare you interrupt here?

220
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:05,157
Your Highness. Your Highness? Your...

221
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:06,358
Why doesn't he speak?

222
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,078
He...

223
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:09,438
I have no major problems.

224
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:12,318
What's with his voice?

225
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:15,358
It's a cold. It's usual.

226
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,358
Father, let's go now. Otherwise...

227
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,757
Otherwise, we will also get infected.

228
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:21,637
If that's the case,

229
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:23,118
I will take my leave now.

230
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:25,277
Your Highness, take a good rest.

231
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:47,157
Mr. Lu.

232
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:48,118
Come on. Put it inside.

233
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:52,838
Where's the ash?

234
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,877
I've dumped it for you.

235
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,238
You dumped the ash?
I finally got them from the wok.

236
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:58,637
What are you doing?

237
00:11:58,637 --> 00:11:59,517
No.

238
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:00,998
- You dare to scold Peilan?
- I...

239
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:02,478
She...

240
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:03,598
I can't even bear to yell at her.

241
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:04,637
No, Mother.

242
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:05,917
Don't always side with him.

243
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:07,238
She dumped the ash.

244
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:08,718
I had barely scraped it.

245
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,037
If it got dumped, just scrape again.

246
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,557
What are you yelling at her for?

247
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,958
And you, why did you dump it?

248
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:16,118
I don't know.

249
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,078
Can't do any work right.

250
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:19,757
Have you ever been a servant?

251
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:26,998
If you can't finish it within two hours,

252
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,517
then get out of here. Understand?

253
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:29,718
Are you a servant or am I?

254
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:30,998
Time for real action.

255
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:32,438
Scrape the bottom of the wok later.

256
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:34,958
Mr. Lu, I've dumped it for you.

257
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:42,958
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu. Your face is dirty.

258
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:44,438
I can't stand it anymore.

259
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:46,397
Where are you going, Mr. Lu?

260
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,078
Don't be angry, Mr. Lu. I was wrong.

261
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:53,718
Peilan, I started washing clothes
early in the morning,

262
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:54,958
then I did all the chores.

263
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,557
I really haven't stopped for a moment.

264
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:57,877
Look at your mother's attitude.

265
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,198
You really treat me as a servant?

266
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:02,157
Mr. Lu, aren't you a servant?

267
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:07,438
Wait, Peilan. Something's wrong.

268
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:08,718
Let's figure it out.

269
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:10,198
What did we agree on?

270
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:12,718
How did I become your family's servant?

271
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,238
You closed the door and said,
"It's okay to sleep in the woodshed."

272
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,998
Let's put it aside.
As for being a servant,

273
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:26,677
who suggested it first?

274
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,318
That was indeed what I brought up.

275
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:30,958
See? I've never mentioned this.

276
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:32,677
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

277
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,037
I thought mother wouldn't agree.

278
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:35,838
Peilan, I know you're a good girl.

279
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:37,198
So I've never blamed you.

280
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,358
The thing is, there are
too many chores at your home.

281
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:41,358
And I've lived in your house
for several days.

282
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:42,877
I think it should be safe outside.

283
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,478
Let's part here. Here, take it.

284
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,557
Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu, don't be impulsive.

285
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:49,198
Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu.

286
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:59,557
Peilan, I am sorry I acted impulsively.

287
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,157
Yes, you were impulsive.

288
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,598
Mr. Lu, let's go back to work.

289
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:06,838
Peilan. Peilan,
can you talk to your mother

290
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,238
and ask her to give me a new job?

291
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:09,797
I don't want to be a servant anymore.

292
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:11,877
Then what do you want to do?

293
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:13,478
Just tell her

294
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:17,797
I can be a tutor.
I've been to school before.

295
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,032
A tutor?

296
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,877
I-I...

297
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:32,557
Young Lord, please calm down.

298
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:34,718
You dodged quite quickly, huh?

299
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:36,677
Go on. There you go.

300
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:37,797
Young Lord.

301
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:38,838
Where is he?

302
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,797
Young Lord, Fourth Prince
is blessed by Heaven.

303
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:43,757
He must be fine.

304
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:46,877
And besides, didn't he always
tell us to lay low?

305
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,438
He definitely has his own arrangements.

306
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,078
But what if something happens to him?

307
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,718
- If so, I'll kill you first!
- Yes.

308
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,198
Then I will commit suicide!

309
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:56,576
Who's there?

310
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:57,757
Young Lord.

311
00:14:57,838 --> 00:14:59,157
What's wrong?

312
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:00,358
Have you seen Fourth Prince?

313
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,238
No.

314
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,517
Well, His Highness went to his room

315
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,718
and found that he was not there.
Could he have gone out?

316
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,478
- No, no.
- No, no.

317
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:09,557
Then where is he?

318
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:11,958
He...

319
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,118
Didn't you see him before?

320
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:16,238
- W-Where is he?
- I...

321
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:19,478
He... might be in the backyard.

322
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:20,757
- I...
- Backyard?

323
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,757
Then I have to
report to His Highness now.

324
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:25,998
Mr. Chen.

325
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:28,438
Hurry up! Go now! Quickly.

326
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,478
- Where to go?
- To the backyard.

327
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:32,838
Young Lord, I was able to fool them
under the covers last time.

328
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:33,998
But I can't make it this time!

329
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:35,677
I don't care. You said
he was in the backyard.

330
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,838
Go quickly. Right now.

331
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:40,358
Don't betray me.

332
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:43,917
Father, Fourth Prince
would like to stay alone for a while.

333
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,198
Alone? How lonely.

334
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:46,078
No, Father.

335
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:47,438
It's best not to disturb him.

336
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:48,478
Uncivilized.

337
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:51,118
- It's best not to...
- Greetings, Your Highness.

338
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:54,238
I wonder how you are feeling now.

339
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:59,718
Look, he's even waving at me.

340
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,118
- No.
- Your Highness.

341
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:02,318
- No.
- Let me tell you.

342
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:03,757
(Stop)

343
00:16:03,757 --> 00:16:06,080
Stop.

344
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:12,998
(Back off)

345
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:15,238
Back up. Father, he asked us to back up.

346
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,917
Wait, why isn't he speaking?

347
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,078
It's because...

348
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:23,413
(Sudden throat ailment)

349
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,677
He has a sudden throat disease.

350
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,838
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

351
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:28,118
It's all due to my son's poor care.

352
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,557
I'll break his legs immediately.

353
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:30,557
Father, it wasn't my fault.

354
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,358
- Come here.
- It wasn't me.

355
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:33,984
- Father.
- Ouch.

356
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,677
Don't scold him. He means me.

357
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,358
Young Lord has taken good care of me.

358
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:42,838
I've been living well
in Lord Ling's Mansion these days.

359
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,358
I've never slept in
such a soft bed before.

360
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,118
This child can't speak,

361
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,958
- but he writes pretty fast.
- Tell me about it.

362
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:56,277
Revert it.

363
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,078
(Back off)
Father, he asked us to back off.

364
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,838
Wait. I haven't finished yet.

365
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:02,397
Father, let's go.
You want to exhaust His Highness?

366
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,256
Let's go.

367
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:18,077
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

368
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:19,317
Why did you bring us here?

369
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,117
The weapons are inside.

370
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:23,077
You are capable,

371
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:24,918
even daring to steal from the Lord.

372
00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:27,517
Steal? No need to steal.

373
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:39,557
Boss, I told you so.

374
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:41,238
He's an idiot. We'd better leave.

375
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:43,277
You have guts.

376
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,797
But we don't enter
through the main gate when stealing.

377
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:48,037
I've already said it's not stealing.

378
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,504
Go.

379
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:54,837
What for?

380
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:55,757
Climb the wall.

381
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:57,037
No, there's really no need.

382
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,837
Hurry up, or we'll be too late. Quickly.

383
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:04,797
You're such a fool. Hurry up.

384
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:06,117
Come on.

385
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,678
Boss, can he do this alone?

386
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:16,317
Let's test him out.

387
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:25,158
Fourth Prince is a bit bewildering.

388
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:27,072
Is he?

389
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:31,878
However, he seems
quite satisfied with you.

390
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:33,678
That's the result of your good teaching.

391
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:38,718
But he seems to have
a big issue with me.

392
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,896
- No, no, he absolutely doesn't.
- No?

393
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:41,678
No.

394
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:43,878
He even praised you in front of me.

395
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:46,718
Saying that you are fortunate.

396
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,718
Good luck follows you.

397
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:51,678
That's more like it.

398
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:53,398
Let me tell you.

399
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:55,597
You have to serve him well.

400
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:56,878
Such a good opportunity.

401
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:59,718
Don't mess it up. Got it?

402
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:01,088
Understood.

403
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:17,478
Young Lord, how did it go?
Didn't give us away, did it?

404
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:20,158
No, no, but sooner or later it will.

405
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:22,638
Dispatch more people and keep looking.

406
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,958
You must find him

407
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,757
even if you have to
turn Jianglin City upside down.

408
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:28,192
Yes, yes.

409
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,158
Your Highness.

410
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,478
Greetings, Your Highness.

411
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,878
Your Highness.

412
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:47,918
Fourth Prince,
is your throat better now?

413
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,678
Should I go to the Imperial Hospital

414
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:50,757
and have someone check on you?

415
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:54,797
No, thanks. Your Highness,
could you give me some weapons?

416
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:57,998
Weapons? What do you need them for?

417
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:00,837
Emergency.

418
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:02,998
Then what weapons do you want?

419
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:04,638
All kinds, please.

420
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:12,998
How did you get these?

421
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:14,797
I borrowed them.

422
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:16,797
You are quite something.

423
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,678
Daring to ask His Highness for weapons.

424
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:21,918
Boss, official soldiers.

425
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,158
The official soldiers are here. Run.

426
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:34,878
Red dates.

427
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:38,757
Longan. This one.

428
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:42,478
Goji berries.

429
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:44,797
Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu.

430
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:46,037
Wait a second.

431
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,158
My mother agreed.

432
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:49,958
Really?

433
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,438
My mother agreed to you being a porter.

434
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,597
Porter? It's "tutor."

435
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:55,878
What I said was "tutor."

436
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:57,277
What's the difference?

437
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,638
Of course, they are different.

438
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:00,117
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

439
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:01,277
I'll talk to my mother again.

440
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:04,277
Wait, I'll go talk to Mrs. Chun.

441
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,238
Could you help me take this porridge

442
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:07,438
to your eldest sister?

443
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:09,198
Add some water and put in some peanuts.

444
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,712
Peanuts.

445
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:25,597
Mrs. Chun, there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

446
00:21:25,878 --> 00:21:27,808
Come in.

447
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:39,488
Sit.

448
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:48,277
Mrs. Chun, first of all,
I'm very grateful that you let me stay.

449
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,678
Secondly,

450
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,757
I don't think this job

451
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:52,918
is quite right for me.

452
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:56,678
As for me,

453
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:58,797
- actually...
- You want to leave?

454
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:01,638
No, no.

455
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:02,638
You want a salary?

456
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,158
Not exactly.

457
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:06,998
I just want to change a job.

458
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,398
Change a job? No problem.

459
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:11,317
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

460
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:12,958
Don't rush to thank me.

461
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:15,277
Based on your performance
these past few days,

462
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:16,757
I came up with a question.

463
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,398
Have you ever been a servant before?

464
00:22:19,936 --> 00:22:21,158
Yes, I have.

465
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:22,837
You didn't want a salary before either?

466
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:25,077
I did want a salary before.

467
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:27,037
Then why would you
rather not take a salary

468
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:28,517
and stay in our house?

469
00:22:35,478 --> 00:22:36,398
Well.

470
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:39,918
You know martial arts,
and you've been to school.

471
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:41,918
You can get a salary elsewhere,

472
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:44,037
but why do you cling to our family

473
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:45,998
and want nothing?

474
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,438
What exactly is going on...

475
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:52,638
Mrs. Chun. Well, it's hot.

476
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,557
Mrs. Chun, I just remembered something.

477
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:56,557
I haven't delivered the tea
to Miss Jinrong yet.

478
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:57,998
I'll leave you and run the errands.

479
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,616
Listen, that was so close.

480
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:08,557
What happened?

481
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:11,317
I almost made a mistake.
Good thing I reacted quickly.

482
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:13,398
Just thinking about it scares me.

483
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:15,424
Mother?

484
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,037
Mother. Banxia.

485
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,918
Peilan, tell the truth.
Who is he exactly?

486
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:26,878
He is Lu Buping.

487
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:30,517
Where did you two meet?

488
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:31,968
- Outside the door.
- On the street.

489
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:36,158
On the street outside the door.

490
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:37,878
Why did you come to our house?

491
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,718
Because of... The fate?

492
00:23:40,757 --> 00:23:41,958
Banxia.

493
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:42,918
You can remain silent.

494
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:45,037
Anything you say
can be used against you in court.

495
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:46,117
Tell me, what fate?

496
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,597
T-The fate is...

497
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:50,757
When I walked here
and she opened the door,

498
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:51,718
the fate arrived.

499
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:53,158
Why don't you want a salary?

500
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:56,117
Because... Well, because...

501
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,878
Did I say I didn't want it?

502
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:01,277
Look, how strange it is.

503
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,478
Who else would be willing
to sleep in a woodshed?

504
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:05,837
Let me be honest,

505
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:06,918
everyone has the right

506
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:07,878
to pursue their own life.

507
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:08,797
Everyone can choose.

508
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:10,317
Jobs are not ranked by nobility.

509
00:24:10,357 --> 00:24:12,037
Mother, you can't target him

510
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,478
just because he's a servant.

511
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:15,718
Did I ask you to reason with me here?

512
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:17,198
People should reason, right?

513
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:18,878
Don't talk to me like that.

514
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:20,277
It's you who need to control yourself.

515
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:21,478
Am I out of control?

516
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:23,104
Right, right.

517
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:26,398
So, what exactly
did you pursue in our house?

518
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:27,878
- Well, I...
- He...

519
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:29,998
- I just...
- Well, I...

520
00:24:30,317 --> 00:24:32,638
Report him. There must be
something wrong with him.

521
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:35,238
And not just he who has a problem.

522
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:39,398
- He won't even explain.
- Mother.

523
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:40,718
He can't stay at our house.

524
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:41,718
- Mrs. Chun.
- Leave now.

525
00:24:41,757 --> 00:24:43,438
- Mrs. Chun, I really can't say it.
- Go.

526
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:45,478
- What you can't say?
- Mother.

527
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,037
- I won't leave.
- Hands off.

528
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:47,936
- I won't leave.
- Mother.

529
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:48,438
Let go of it.

530
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:49,678
- Let go.
- He's really a good person.

531
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:52,398
Mrs. Chun, I work hard every day
and do so much work.

532
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:53,517
Why are you driving me away?

533
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:54,438
What have you done?

534
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:56,077
- Leave.
- Mother, he made tea.

535
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:56,958
You made for him.

536
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,117
No. He also did the laundry.

537
00:24:58,158 --> 00:24:59,117
You washed for him.

538
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:00,037
I swept the floor.

539
00:25:00,037 --> 00:25:01,277
You have the nerve to say that?

540
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:03,638
Lu Buping, how dare you
to stay in this house?

541
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,317
What right do you have
to stay in this home?

542
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:07,117
I must leave today, right?

543
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:08,037
What do you think?

544
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:10,438
- Fine, I'll leave.
- Mr. Lu.

545
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,837
Alright then, I'll just say
one last thing before I leave.

546
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:14,432
I don't want to hear it.

547
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:19,958
I hope after I leave,

548
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:21,878
you will treat Peilan better.

549
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:23,998
What do you mean?

550
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:28,438
I admit for the errands,

551
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,198
Peilan did indeed help me a lot.

552
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:32,037
But I also shared a lot for her.

553
00:25:32,357 --> 00:25:33,277
What did you share?

554
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,037
Mrs. Chun, may I ask you a question?

555
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:37,998
What have you done for Peilan?

556
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:39,797
Mr. Lu, don't put it that way.

557
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:42,478
She is my daughter.
What does it have to do with you?

558
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:43,478
Mind your own business.

559
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:45,757
As an outsider,
even I can't stand it anymore.

560
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,438
Is she a servant in your house?

561
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:51,638
I doubt if she is your biological child.

562
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:52,718
- You.
- Mother.

563
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:54,998
Mr. Lu, what are you saying?

564
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:57,198
Hit me. Just beat me to the death.

565
00:25:57,277 --> 00:25:58,718
After all, it's death for me to go out.

566
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,517
Death?

567
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,557
To starve to death.

568
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:04,438
Do you know what makes me the saddest?

569
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,757
It's that none of you in this family

570
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:08,117
really cared for Peilan.

571
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:11,557
Peilan, farewell.

572
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:14,797
Mrs. Chun, after I leave,

573
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:16,638
you must take good care of Peilan.

574
00:26:19,597 --> 00:26:20,678
Lu Buping, stop right there.

575
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:44,998
(Peilan, you're grown up.
You need to learn to be brave.)

576
00:26:45,198 --> 00:26:46,837
(You need to
take responsibility for Mr. Lu.)

577
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:51,117
(Now, muster up the courage
and face your mother.)

578
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:52,438
(You can do it.)

579
00:27:02,117 --> 00:27:04,192
Mother.

580
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:11,718
Can Mr. Lu stay?

581
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:13,568
What did you say?

582
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:15,936
I said...

583
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,718
Don't drive Mr. Lu away, please.

584
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:21,878
You heard what he just said.

585
00:27:21,918 --> 00:27:23,398
Can I still keep him in this house?

586
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:27,638
Mother, I actually lied to you before.

587
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:29,238
Lied to me?
What did you lie to me about?

588
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,117
My purse was robbed

589
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:32,757
and Mr. Lu saved me.

590
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:33,757
Saved you?

591
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:35,438
This isn't a bad thing.

592
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:36,398
But why doesn't he say it?

593
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:40,878
I'm scared that you'll scold me
because someone stole my purse.

594
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:42,678
What's there to scold?

595
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:47,158
No. He saved you.

596
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,797
He even came to our house
to be a servant,

597
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:50,117
asking for nothing.

598
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:52,557
All he wants is food.

599
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:54,037
Begging for food.

600
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,277
He has no money.

601
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:57,557
Then, why doesn't he want wages?

602
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,037
H-He has nowhere to go.

603
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,478
Wasn't he from Lu's Manor?

604
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:01,998
He escaped from Lu's Manor.

605
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:03,958
Escaped?

606
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,398
- From famine.
- From famine?

607
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:12,557
Begging for food.
With nowhere else to go.

608
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,958
Begging for food.
With nowhere else to go.

609
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:18,478
Chun Peilan. Chun Peilan.

610
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:19,638
You really dare

611
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:21,037
to lie to me here.

612
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:23,998
What servant? Isn't he just a beggar?

613
00:28:26,077 --> 00:28:29,998
Yes, he is indeed just a beggar.

614
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:33,678
He is a homeless man who saved my life.

615
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:38,158
Peilan, how should I put it?

616
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:40,958
When you were little,
you took stray dogs in, right?

617
00:28:41,037 --> 00:28:43,158
But now you're taking a homeless man in.

618
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:45,077
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

619
00:28:45,678 --> 00:28:47,037
I know I was wrong, Mother.

620
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,918
But he's really pitiful.
Just let him stay.

621
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:52,438
The first time he came, I thought
he was a beggar, but he denied it.

622
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:59,238
Mother, you're really amazing.

623
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:00,958
You saw through him at first sight.

624
00:29:03,317 --> 00:29:04,557
Since he has saved you,

625
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:06,918
I'll give him another chance.

626
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:09,557
I'm telling you,

627
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:10,557
there's nothing in this house

628
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:12,198
that can be hidden from me.

629
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:13,718
Try lying to me again.

630
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:19,238
I understand, Mother.
I'll go and prepare your foot bath.

631
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:24,878
Is it the right way?

632
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:37,438
Wash these clothes tomorrow.
Do it yourself.

633
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:42,398
So, I can stay?

634
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:45,718
Need I wash this too?

635
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:46,958
The covers for you.

636
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:49,998
Be diligent in the future.
Learn how to be a good servant.

637
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:55,488
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

638
00:30:05,158 --> 00:30:07,317
Where is he?

639
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,398
Aren't you a fortune teller?
It's been a day already.

640
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:10,678
Tell me.

641
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,998
Young Lord, killing me
won't do you any good.

642
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,958
I don't know.

643
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:17,117
Useless. Useless.

644
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,398
It's not the arrival of a helper.

645
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,958
It is the arrival of a disaster.

646
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:26,998
Where on earth are you?

647
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:29,158
Can you take me away?

648
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:33,198
Oh, my God.

649
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,478
Boss, your wound is almost healed.

650
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,696
Stop it.

651
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:44,238
I've been resting for so long.

652
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:46,718
It's time to earn back the money
spent on medicine.

653
00:30:47,238 --> 00:30:48,638
Where to earn it?

654
00:30:53,238 --> 00:30:56,958
Boss, look, there are
four unlucky guys over there.

655
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:00,096
Let's go.

656
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:12,238
Boss, let's retreat for now.

657
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:14,048
Go.

658
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:17,757
These three look a bit like the rats
mentioned by your sister.

659
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,438
Performers. Why are we
afraid of them? Go ahead.

660
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,478
Good, coming to us on your own.

661
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:27,398
Listen up, you guys.

662
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:30,438
If you want to live,
hand over the money.

663
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,438
If you want money, come and take it.

664
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,277
- Send it over here.
- Send it over here.

665
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:36,557
- Come here.
- Come here.

666
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:37,678
- Bring it over.
- Bring it over.

667
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:38,958
- Come here.
- Come here.

668
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:40,198
- Come here.
- Why don't you come?

669
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:42,718
- You come over.
- You send it over.

670
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:44,517
Stop, stop.

671
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:46,438
Let's go. Don't stoop to their level.

672
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:48,517
What do you mean go?
Why did we come out here?

673
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,398
Just take them down as we get there.

674
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:51,936
Take him down.

675
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:55,277
Stay here.

676
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:57,238
Go.

677
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:58,398
- No need.
- Can't you play fair?

678
00:31:58,398 --> 00:31:59,517
- No need.
- No need.

679
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:03,398
- Not fair.
- Put it down. It's not necessary.

680
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:04,638
- Don't fight.
- No need.

681
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,718
- Don't bring anything.
- Calm down.

682
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:10,357
Who asked you to move?

683
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:12,158
Kid, come over here.

684
00:32:13,037 --> 00:32:14,117
Don't touch him.

685
00:32:16,998 --> 00:32:18,718
Give me the money
if you know what's good for you.

686
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:22,238
Under the emperor's nose,
you dare to do this?

687
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:23,557
What a joke.

688
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:24,998
Should we do it on the emperor's head?

689
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:26,757
Hand over the money.

690
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,517
No.

691
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:29,638
No?

692
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:34,432
Let go.

693
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:36,718
Let go!

694
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:43,936
- I-I...
- Punch him.

695
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:51,797
I caught him. Hit him.

696
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,438
I'll hit you.

697
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:00,896
Come on.

698
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,352
I...

699
00:33:08,557 --> 00:33:10,478
Boss, save me.

700
00:33:10,517 --> 00:33:11,638
You dare touch my bro...

701
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:14,158
You started it first.

702
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,517
Boss, why do you have
a hammer on your head?

703
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:23,797
Boss, you're bleeding from the head.

704
00:33:24,317 --> 00:33:26,398
Mr. Wang said, if you bleed again,
you should go see him.

705
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,238
Yeah, I need to see the doctor.

706
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:29,317
Don't leave if you are a man.

707
00:33:29,478 --> 00:33:31,198
- Continue.
- Boss, don't be impulsive.

708
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:33,757
The mountains and
the water will not move.

709
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,037
But people move.

710
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:36,597
If people don't move, I'll move.

711
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:38,398
You move. You move.

712
00:33:39,357 --> 00:33:40,317
Go, go, go.

713
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:41,797
- A-Si.
- Are you alright?

714
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:43,757
A-Si, A-Si.

715
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:46,878
Don't leave!

716
00:33:57,438 --> 00:34:02,198
Master, there's something
I really don't understand.

717
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:03,438
What's that?

718
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:09,717
Did you really give
Mrs. Chun ninety percent?

719
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:15,237
Young man, are you really a beggar?

720
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:28,958
Your quilt.

721
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:30,838
Given by Mrs. Chun.
