What heroine?

37
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:23,690
Get over there.

38
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,209
What do you want?

39
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,530
Did they kidnap you?

Kidnap me?

41
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,690
There's no such thing.

42
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,489
Since you're not kidnapped,

43
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,290
let's go home.

Wait.

50
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,530
They're my friends, brother.

51
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:54,810
- Brother?
- Brother?

52
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:55,889
Your friends?

53
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:56,929
You know them?

54
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,049
I was injured.

55
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,609
They've been taking care of me.

56
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,370
You got injured again?

57
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:02,929
Where?

58
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,889
This guy is your big brother?

59
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,729
Yeah.

60
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,729
What about him?

61
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,288
He...

62
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,090
He's our servant. Why?

63
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,449
Birds of a feather.

64
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,530
Keling, you know each other?

65
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,489
We're kind of like friends.

66
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,889
Friends?

67
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,609
I'm not your friend.

68
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:22,929
Chun Keling, what are you doing?

69
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,010
What are you doing?

70
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,010
Don't block me. Put that away.

71
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:27,090
Sorry, Your Highness.

72
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,769
My little daughter has no manners.

73
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,850
Please forgive her.

74
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,889
It's okay.

75
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,250
We're friends, after all.

76
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:38,889
So you're friends.

77
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:39,929
And you are...

78
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,169
I didn't introduce myself.

79
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,970
I am the Young Lord
from Lord Ling's Mansion.

80
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,850
Young Lord.

81
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,769
- Young Lord?
- Young Lord?

82
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,449
We'd better go.

83
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:08,530
Leave your friends alone.

84
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,529
Young Lord.

85
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,449
Have some tea.

86
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,170
Take this hairpin.

87
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,889
Give it to the girl who makes you happy.

88
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,449
Then she will make you even more joyful.

89
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:51,449
Young Lord.

90
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,730
It turns out that the girl
who pleases the Fourth Prince is here.

91
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:02,810
When did you make up?

92
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,490
Young Lord.

93
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,610
We don't have fancy tea at home.

94
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,170
Please get by with it.

95
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,050
It smells great.

96
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,889
What is it?

97
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,889
I-It's tea.

98
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,769
So it's tea.

99
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,930
I thought it was...

100
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:34,010
So it's tea...

101
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:35,889
No wonder.

102
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,889
We'd better go.

103
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,289
Father is waiting for you at home.

104
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,050
Young Lord.

105
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,329
You're leaving?

106
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,610
Won't you stay longer?

107
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,209
Rain check.

108
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,529
Young Lord.

109
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:52,769
Sorry we didn't

110
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:53,969
treat you well enough.

111
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:55,889
You treated me very well.

112
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:59,449
Young Lord.

113
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,250
Come often.

114
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:01,889
Of course.

115
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:02,889
Let's go.

116
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,769
Look at you.

117
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,130
Can't you be discreet?

118
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:11,089
Mother.

119
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,570
I have to burn incense for Father.

120
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,490
I bet it's Father manifesting this omen.

121
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:19,449
Young Lord?

122
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,490
Could it be that A-Si
is also His Highness's son?

123
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,529
Chun Jinrong, why are you up so early?

124
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,329
I'm not up early.

125
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,730
I stayed up all night.

126
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,089
Perfect.

127
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:48,209
Have breakfast and come with me
to the Marriage Bridge

128
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,449
to look for dates.

129
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,529
We have the Young Lord coming.

130
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,329
Why would we go to the Marriage Bridge?

131
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,969
Are you daydreaming?

132
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:56,329
Mother.

133
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,329
I have this strong feeling.

134
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,329
The Young Lord will be back.

135
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,649
I can't be away when he's here.

136
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,610
Wake up.

137
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,969
Don't ruin my hairstyle.

138
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,769
Chun Jinrong, be practical, okay?

139
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,649
You're 30 and still single.

140
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,649
Why is that?

141
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:14,969
Isn't it because you're so picky?

142
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,529
Mother, he's the Young Lord.

143
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,089
He may have seen His Majesty.

144
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,449
Listen.

145
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,449
Why did the Young Lord come to visit us?

146
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,409
Because I have a chance.

147
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:32,810
You have a chance?

148
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,329
Take a look in the mirror.

149
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,969
You think he may like you?

150
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:37,570
I don't care.

151
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm going to wait here.

152
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,089
Fine, do as you wish.

153
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:43,649
A thirty-year-old

154
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,969
can be so immature.

155
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,370
And A-Si.

156
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,730
That kid

157
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,449
got me so mistaken.

158
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,730
I thought his father was in jail.

159
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,089
When did he ever say that?

160
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,649
Didn't he say it himself?

161
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,849
His father stays
somewhere with many guards.

162
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:00,889
The Lord's Mansion

163
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,449
has many guards, of course.

164
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,010
You got it wrong all along.

165
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,649
Fine.

166
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,370
It's all my fault.

167
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:10,969
You did nothing wrong.

168
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,730
A-Are you coming with me later?

169
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,329
No.

170
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,329
Whatever.

171
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,570
I'm not going.

172
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,649
I'll wait for Young Lord here.

173
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:18,570
Forever.

174
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,849
Mother, isn't Jinrong going to eat?

175
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:25,649
Let her be.

176
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,490
Pancake with preserved vegetables again?

177
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,529
I saw some preserved vegetables left.

178
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,769
They may go bad.

179
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,289
When...

180
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,370
did you cook the lotus root?

181
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,649
Two days ago?

182
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,970
It's too hot. It must have gone sour.

183
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,689
Don't eat it. Throw it away.

184
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,889
No, Mother.

185
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,450
I smelled it. It's just fine.

186
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,529
Fine, I'm done.

187
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,169
I'm going to the Marriage Bridge.

188
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,130
This is bad. Throw it away.

189
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:58,889
Okay, Mother.

190
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,090
I'll throw it away.

191
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:07,130
Peilan.

192
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,169
Morning, Master.

193
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,169
Morning.

194
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,330
Have breakfast, Master.

195
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,010
Okay.

196
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,169
Thank you.

197
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,090
Here.

198
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,409
Morning, Peilan.

199
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,929
Banxia.

200
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,889
Morning, Banxia.

201
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,610
Preserved vegetable pancake.

202
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,929
Where did you find
the preserved vegetables?

203
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:27,130
Didn't I throw them away?

204
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,409
So it was you.

205
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,689
I took them back.

206
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,889
Why would you do that?

207
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:32,809
I found molds in there
while drying herbs yesterday.

208
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,049
Don't eat it. It's moldy.

209
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,130
It's fine.

210
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:40,689
Preserved vegetables are fine.

211
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:41,929
I've washed them well.

212
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,250
These vegetables are preserved,

213
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,330
not to be served when moldy.

214
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,010
Peilan, it's common sense.

215
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,130
Peilan, I don't mean to criticize you.

216
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:50,130
You're a good girl.

217
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,010
You're just too frugal.

218
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,490
What's wrong with that?

219
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,610
But you can't be frugal
when it comes to food.

220
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,689
There shall be a limit.

221
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:57,889
As the saying goes,

222
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:59,529
"Illness finds its way in by the mouth."

223
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,049
And another saying goes,

224
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,169
"Run a thrifty household."

225
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,529
Everything costs us money.

226
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,850
We must spend money wisely.

227
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,289
Do as you wish.

228
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,610
Let's eat out, Master.

229
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,689
Let's go.

230
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,210
Coming.

231
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:26,809
I finished my food.

232
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,330
Don't eat this.

233
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,850
Wait for me.

234
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:33,498
(Joyful and Carefree)

235
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,210
That's why
Fourth Prince keeps disappearing.

236
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,210
So he's been fooling around out there.

237
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,889
Young Lord.

238
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,730
Why do I feel

239
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:54,130
that she is much older
than the Fourth Prince?

240
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,889
Yeah, and she's not so pretty.

241
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,889
She is also tall and strong.

242
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,250
So freaky.

243
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,450
But she's really polite.

244
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:03,529
Indeed.

245
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,529
Young Lord, what do we do next?

246
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:09,490
You're asking me?

247
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,169
Who's the adviser here, you or me?

248
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,049
Right.

249
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,370
At least, we know that

250
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,610
the Fourth Prince is into that lady.

251
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,850
Well, the Fourth Prince is in love

252
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,569
with that girl's sister.

253
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:23,649
My goodness.

254
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,409
Which girl?

255
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,689
Are you referring to the "Heroine"?

256
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,569
How do you know?

257
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,210
Young Lord, you also
hold grudges against her?

258
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,289
Not exactly.

259
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,130
Why did you say "also"?

260
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,169
Did I say that?

261
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,210
Not important.

262
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,210
Young Lord.

263
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,090
I think we should teach her a lesson.

264
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:45,569
That girl offended you.

265
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,970
She has no manners.

266
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:47,850
Think about it.

267
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,929
She keeps showing up
in front of the Fourth Prince.

268
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,049
It's so dangerous, right?

269
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,970
Shouldn't we eliminate the risk

270
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,529
for the Fourth Prince?

271
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,529
Yeah, we should.

272
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:04,289
But that lady
is the sister of that girl.

273
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,929
But...

274
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:07,409
But we should
give her a warning at least.

275
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:09,970
She shouldn't act willfully just because

276
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,529
the Fourth Prince likes her sister.

277
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,529
She'd better behave

278
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,169
when she's dealing with us.

279
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,210
It makes sense.

280
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,809
Let's do this.

281
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,730
Mr. Li, convey my message now.

282
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,850
Me?

283
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:27,289
I...

284
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,809
You brought your daughter here?

285
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,450
Hello, Mrs. Chun.

286
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,289
Look how pretty she is.

287
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,049
And she's from a nice family.

288
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,569
- She looks nice.
- Yeah.

289
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,450
You look new.

290
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,010
First time here?

291
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,730
Yeah.

292
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,929
Are you here
for your son or your daughter?

293
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,689
My daughter. She's 20.

294
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,370
Take a look.

295
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,049
No need.

296
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,409
Hello.

297
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,210
Are you here
for your son or your daughter?

298
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,049
My son.

299
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,169
Your son?

300
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:13,169
How old is he?

301
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,889
Twenty-eight.

302
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,049
Twenty-eight.

303
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:17,769
He's not so young.
It's time to get married.

304
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:18,689
Exactly.

305
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,730
Look.

306
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,610
This is my daughter.

307
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,250
Looking sweet, right?

308
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,809
How old is she?

309
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,730
Tw...

310
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:33,529
Twenty-nine.

311
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,330
I'll look around.

312
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:38,049
D-Don't go.

313
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,409
Sorry, I...

314
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,169
I-I'll be right back.

315
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,610
(Xishi Fresh Vegetables)
Spinach.

316
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,130
Chinese cabbage.

317
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:50,370
Pak choi.

318
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,049
Madam, how much is the bamboo shoot?

319
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:57,889
Four wen per catty.

320
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,529
It's not fresh, and it's so pricy?

321
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,169
Four wen is pricy?

322
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:04,250
You're so poor.

323
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:07,250
How much is the mushroom per catty?

324
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:08,450
Three wen.

325
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,970
Three wen? So pricy.

326
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,569
I picked them up in the West Mountain
early in the morning.

327
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,090
Three wen is nothing.

328
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,250
Go pick them yourself.

329
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,289
Where on the West Mountain?

330
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,130
I picked everything there.

331
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,409
Try the Western Paradise.

332
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,370
Thank you, Madam.

333
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,370
I'll look around.

334
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,409
My goodness.

335
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:37,010
What's your problem?

336
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,529
Chinese cabbage.

337
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,250
Pak choi.

338
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,049
Spring onion.

339
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,649
It's much better

340
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:52,889
without that guy.

341
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,610
Mr. Lu.

342
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:55,730
You're back, Peilan.

343
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,689
Did you go for an adventure?

344
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,889
Mr. Lu, I'll cook
something nice for you.

345
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:02,529
Look.

346
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,569
You bought mushrooms?

347
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,169
No, the price was too high.

348
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,809
I picked them on West Mountain.

349
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,529
What are you holding?

350
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,130
Peilan picked some mushrooms.

351
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:14,809
The little mushroom picker.

352
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:16,929
It's big.

353
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,529
It doesn't look right.

354
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,769
It doesn't smell right.

355
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,689
Be careful with mushrooms.

356
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:25,769
You may get poisoned.

357
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:26,529
Master.

358
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,169
Throw them away.

359
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,370
Do not eat them.

360
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:35,130
Remember?

361
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:38,529
Poisonous?

362
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,929
No way.

363
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:51,370
Peilan.

364
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,090
I'll bring the dishes to Master.

365
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,169
What's smelling so nice?

366
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,769
Mushrooms?

367
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,769
Didn't Master tell you
to throw them away because

368
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:04,769
they're poisonous?

369
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,689
That would be a pity.

370
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,529
They look just like the ones
sold in the market.

371
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,090
Master is overly careful.

372
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,250
Once bitten, twice shy.

373
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,649
I have this kind of mushroom
in Qing City very often.

374
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,130
Is it good?

375
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,850
Would you like to try it?

376
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,289
No, thanks.

377
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,250
It's fine.

378
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,929
I have had so much and I'm fine.

379
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,169
Then I'll take a bite.

380
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,809
Tasty?

381
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,049
Yeah.

382
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,889
Right?

383
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,130
I'll get you more rice.

384
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,610
They taste better with rice.

385
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,210
Thank you.

386
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,929
Mr. Lu.

387
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:51,529
It's so good.

388
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,049
I've never had such nice mushrooms.

389
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,689
You finally fed me well today.

390
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,769
Mr. Lu, I'm so sorry.

391
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,289
Think of it as a compensation.

392
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:04,930
Don't say that.

393
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,769
I'm always a bit reckless.

394
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,650
I shouldn't have
said that about your mother.

395
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,890
It's fine, Mr. Lu.

396
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,410
Let me cook some more mushrooms.

397
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,650
Okay.

398
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,049
Let me help.

399
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,609
Mr. Lu, what are you doing?

400
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,809
Why do I feel a bit dizzy?

401
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:34,490
Dizzy?

402
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,450
You didn't sleep well?

403
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,250
No, it feels like being

404
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,569
p-poisoned.

405
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:45,450
Mr. Lu.

406
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,450
Inhale.

407
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,210
Exhale.

408
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,890
It's okay.

409
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,450
Master, I think he's poisoned.

410
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,369
Right.

411
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,609
He is poisoned.

412
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:12,730
See?

413
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,210
Illness found its way in by the mouth.

414
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,600
Peilan, you fed him those moldy
preserved vegetables?

415
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,650
No, I fed him the mushrooms.

416
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,650
Didn't I tell you to throw them away

417
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,210
because they are poisonous?

418
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:24,930
Stop asking.

419
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,250
She didn't want to waste them.

420
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,569
But you can't feed them to him.

421
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,450
I had some too.

422
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:30,650
But I'm fine.

423
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,410
Peilan.

424
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,450
I don't even know what to say now.

425
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,210
You eat moldy things.

426
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,849
You eat fishy mushrooms.

427
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,210
You eat everything just like our father.

428
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:39,890
Enough.

429
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,089
Peilan.

430
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:43,410
Why do we have so many guests?

431
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:46,609
They're waving at me.

432
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,690
Hello.

433
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,930
Mr. Lu, you're scaring me.

434
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,410
He's having hallucinations.

435
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,010
He may die.

436
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,289
But I had a lot as well.

437
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:00,569
Why am I fine?

438
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,329
You've been eating everything.

439
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,809
You're immune to poison.

440
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,369
He...

441
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,930
Wait.

442
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,849
He used to be a beggar.

443
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,609
He should be tougher than you.

444
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,170
He...

445
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,690
He maybe had more mushrooms.

446
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,450
I'm a fish.

447
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,809
Master, is he okay?

448
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:28,049
Banxia, boil some persimmon tip.

449
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,650
I'll make some salted water.

450
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,769
If possible,

451
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,849
and if he doesn't bite your fingers off,

452
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,210
stick your fingers in
and help him throw up.

453
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,529
Master...

454
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,650
Master, this is too hard.

455
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:43,809
I'm a fish.

456
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,329
I'm sorry.

457
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,930
Young Lord, l-let me tell you the truth.

458
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,890
I had some misunderstanding
with that girl.

459
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,890
I can't go there.

460
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,650
She's going to kill me.

461
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:02,410
What misunderstanding?

462
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,010
I simply analyzed her facial features

463
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,769
while I was
doing fortunetelling on the street.

464
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,129
Why did you hit me?

465
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,690
She beat me up brutally.

466
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,049
How did I deserve it?

467
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,650
Why don't you

468
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,410
do it in person?

469
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,329
I... Well...

470
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,809
We have some misunderstandings too.

471
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,089
What happened?

472
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,529
Well, I was on the street,

473
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,369
playing games with girls
in the Spring River Restaurant.

474
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,769
(Spring River Restaurant)
Today's weather...

475
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,650
She's gone.
What's the point of apologizing?

476
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,930
She called me a lecher.

477
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,970
I feel wronged, right?

478
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,450
Yeah.

479
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,690
That girl is outrageous.

480
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,930
But Young Lord,

481
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,289
she's around the Fourth Prince all day.

482
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:55,849
We'd be very passive
if she complained about us.

483
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,809
We have to take the initiative.

484
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:00,529
Right, right.

485
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:01,849
You've got a point.

486
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,809
Right?

487
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,170
You've got a point.

488
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:06,289
Young Lord.

489
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:09,410
We have to take the chance
to teach her a lesson.

490
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,890
What lesson?

491
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:13,250
Don't make a fuss about it, you know?

492
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,809
If she gets mad

493
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,049
and complains about me

494
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:16,970
to the Fourth Prince,

495
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,650
what do I do?

496
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,450
What do I do?

497
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,569
Right.

498
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,609
A little impatience spoils great plans.

499
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:22,809
Understand?

500
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:23,089
Yeah.

501
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,569
And you call yourself

502
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:25,609
an adviser?

503
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,369
I...

504
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,129
So should we...

505
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,849
Okay.

506
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:34,890
That will work.

507
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,490
Let's go.

508
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,690
(Zuiyue Tavern)

509
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,250
- Get lost.
- Step aside.

510
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:43,930
Get lost.

511
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,410
Step aside.

512
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,210
- Move.
- Get lost.

513
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:45,849
Go.

514
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:46,569
Here.

515
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:57,930
Drink. Sit down.

516
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,569
Bottoms up.

517
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:04,609
Still drinking?

518
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,410
You brought people to arrest me?

519
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,089
Listen to me.

520
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:14,369
You'd better show some respect.

521
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,609
Otherwise, we're going to...

522
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,650
Young Lord, look at her.

523
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,450
Alright. It's fine.

524
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:23,170
We're friends.

525
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,890
Friends fight all the time, right?

526
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,849
- I...
- It's okay.

527
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:31,569
Well, Heroine in Jianglin.

528
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,210
We're here with sincerity.

529
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,049
Sincerity?

530
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:38,129
So much "sincerity"?

531
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:40,890
Okay.

532
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:42,369
Leave us alone.

533
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,490
Yes.

534
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,730
Wait.

535
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:47,329
Stay close.

536
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:48,490
Yes.

537
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,490
Where are you going?

538
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,049
You told us to leave.

539
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:54,210
Stay here.

540
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,890
You know who I am.

541
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,129
But for the sake of my brother,

542
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:05,049
let's forget about the past, okay?

543
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:07,490
Why should I listen to you?

544
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:08,129
How can you...

545
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,609
How dare you slap Young Lord?

546
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,129
Right, and you.

547
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:11,970
- I...
- Young Lord.

548
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,450
Hit her!

549
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,650
Shut up.

550
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:17,730
Shut up.

551
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,809
Fine.

552
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,329
You've vented your anger.

553
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,690
Let the past be in the past.

554
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,210
After this slap, we're even now.

555
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,250
I get to decide if we're even.

556
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,369
Fine, that's it.

557
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,089
That's it.

558
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:32,970
That's it.

559
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:40,250
Why did I get slapped again?

560
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,569
I need to test your sincerity.

561
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:43,650
Will you arrest me?

562
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,569
Boss.

563
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:45,970
Young Lord looks sincere.

564
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:47,609
Calm down.

565
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,010
- Bear with it.
- Fine. Bring me the wine.

566
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,010
Young Lord, bear with it.

567
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,049
Take it.

568
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:00,970
Get lost.

569
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,490
Pay the bill. Let's go.

570
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:19,170
Sorry about that.

571
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:24,690
I-I swear I'll...

572
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,890
Waiter, bring me the bill.

573
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,089
How many dishes did they have?

574
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,210
- What is he doing?
- He's drunk.

575
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,329
Check out this good-looking young man.

576
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:42,569
Step aside.

577
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,450
He's so weird.

578
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,369
Maybe he's ill.

579
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,569
Lu Buping, what are you doing?

580
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:48,809
Father, why are you here?

581
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:49,410
Look.

582
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,410
So many fish.

583
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:52,369
Are you drunk?

584
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,730
No, I'm practicing martial arts.

585
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,210
Monkey stealing peach.

586
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,849
- S-Stop it.
- Earthshaking Palm.

587
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,849
Mother, are you okay?

588
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:06,129
Mr. Lu didn't mean it.

589
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,849
He's poisoned by the mushrooms.

590
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,129
Dear, I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

591
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,129
It's been 500 years.

592
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,569
Mr. Lu, what are you talking about?

593
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:16,049
You said in your previous life

594
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:18,170
that you wanted to
stay with me in this life.

595
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:20,609
You wanted to have

596
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:22,730
eleven fishes with me.

597
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:24,049
No. Mother, I didn't say that.

598
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:24,849
Take him inside now.

599
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,129
Don't make a fool here.

600
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,089
Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu.

601
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:27,730
Let's go in.

602
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:28,690
Take your medicine.

603
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,089
Where are you going?

604
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,650
I'll take you there.

605
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,730
Let her off!

606
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:36,650
I didn't say that.

607
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,930
Go away. What are you looking at?

608
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,490
What a pity to throw away

609
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:51,730
these nice mushrooms.

610
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,129
I worked hard to pick them.

611
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,849
I had some and I was fine.

612
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:01,369
I think Mr. Lu is too weak.

613
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:04,210
Do I smell like alcohol?

614
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,410
It's quite obvious.

615
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,410
It's fine.

616
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,210
Keling.

617
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,569
Why are you here?

618
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,410
I've recovered.

619
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:14,410
I want to visit you and Mrs. Chun

620
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,329
to thank you for taking care of me.

621
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:17,170
No need.

622
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,089
Go back.

623
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,129
Boss.

624
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:19,849
Why?

625
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,569
Why what?

626
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,089
We have different aspirations.

627
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:24,809
I don't want anything to do

628
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:25,849
with you officials.

629
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,690
What's wrong with officials?

630
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,849
Everything's wrong with officials.

631
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,809
You are just like
your despicable brother.

632
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,210
Boss, what are you doing?

633
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:35,890
- Come on.
- Seriously.

634
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,490
Anyway, don't come again.

635
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:40,129
Boss.

636
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,250
Boss.

637
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,490
A-Si.

638
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,369
You're still waiting here?

639
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,049
Mr. Right is a no-show?

640
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,890
You can't find me a date

641
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,730
at the Marriage Bridge, either.

642
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,210
Actually,

643
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:02,490
I did find someone suitable for you.

644
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,210
But I had diarrhea.

645
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,609
The guy's mother was gone
once I went back.

646
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:09,410
I don't know why,

647
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,490
but I've been having diarrhea all day.

648
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:14,529
I don't know when
preserved vegetables were made.

649
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:21,289
Peilan.

650
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:23,210
Mother, I think I'm poisoned.

651
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:24,730
Mother.

652
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,329
Sit down.

653
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:28,849
Mother.

654
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,210
Why didn't you tell me that Father came?

655
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:34,129
Father.

656
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:36,049
Why are you here?

657
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,769
Father.

658
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:39,690
When did you come?

659
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,529
Father.

660
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,730
Jinrong, don't move.

661
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,890
Someone's sitting on your head.

662
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:47,890
Wake up.

663
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,650
Don't move, Jinrong.

664
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,890
- Wake up.
- Don't move.

665
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,170
Peilan, wake up.

666
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,049
Peilan.

667
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,450
Jinrong.

668
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,490
Help!

669
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,170
Does it still hurt?

670
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:07,250
Mother.

671
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,690
What if the Young Lord comes

672
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,930
right now?

673
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:13,369
Ruyu.

674
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,730
How's Peilan?

675
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,129
She's also poisoned by the mushrooms.

676
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,170
Thankfully, it's only in the intestines

677
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,490
and not in the blood.

678
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,250
Neither has it hurt the organs.

679
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:27,049
To put it simply, she's fine.

680
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:27,769
Don't worry.

681
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,250
I told Peilan
to throw away those mushrooms,

682
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:33,450
but she just wouldn't.

683
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,970
Master told her the same thing.

684
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,809
Would she listen?

685
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:38,569
Peilan is quite something.

686
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,610
When will she ever

687
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,809
change the habit
of keeping all the trash?

688
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:43,890
Remember the day
she fed us leftover food

689
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,250
from five days ago back in Qing City?

690
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:47,450
We got food poisoning

691
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,890
and almost reunited with Father.

692
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,089
She almost died

693
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,609
because of some mushrooms.

694
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:53,650
We must teach her a lesson this time.

695
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:55,089
You can't beat her up.

696
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,410
She's still in a coma.

697
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,450
Beat her up?

698
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,730
She'd be lucky.

699
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:12,369
Peilan.

700
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,369
Peilan, you finally wake up.

701
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,369
Mother.

702
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,329
Lie down.

703
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,170
Lie down.

704
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:23,970
You...

705
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:27,650
You want something to eat?

706
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,849
Mother, I can't eat right now.

707
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,490
Peilan, tell us what you want to eat.

708
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,410
I'll get it for you even if I have to
climb a mountain of swords,

709
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,849
or descend to the sea of fire.

710
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,730
Yeah.

711
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,809
Have whatever

712
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,849
you'd like to have.

713
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:56,849
Peilan, that mushroom
is highly poisonous.

714
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,930
You'd be dizzy in the beginning.

715
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,930
Then you'll start twitching

716
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:03,210
and have hallucinations.

717
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,369
Then you'll bleed
from all your orifices.

718
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,650
Even Hua Tuo couldn't save you.

719
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,250
I'm too incapable.

720
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:19,369
Mother, am I dying?

721
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,089
What about Mr. Lu?

722
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:24,970
He...

723
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,210
He's gone.

724
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,609
He's gone?

725
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,049
Mother, did we overdo it?

726
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:46,650
Check on her.

727
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,329
Is she fine?

728
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,490
She's fine. Just weak.

729
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,089
She'd better be fine, or you'll pay.

730
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,450
It's your idea.

731
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,250
What does it have to do with him?

732
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,049
Unbelievable.

733
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:09,609
This is unbelievable.

734
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,690
When have I ever been treated like this?

735
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:15,089
Young Lord, I've told you.

736
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:17,210
We should teach that girl a lesson.

737
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:17,809
I...

738
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:22,529
You think I don't know?

739
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,329
If it hadn't been for the Fourth Prince,

740
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:25,569
I would have killed her.

741
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:26,809
Right.

742
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:27,930
Please simmer down.

743
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:30,369
We can't do anything about her

744
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:33,650
because the Fourth Prince
likes her sister.

745
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,329
Stop saying the obvious.

746
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:38,730
But Young Lord,

747
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,049
I think that lady with the hairpin

748
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,170
wants to approach you.

749
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:47,329
Approach me?

750
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,450
Really?

751
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,730
Think about it.

752
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,970
She's just an ordinary girl

753
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,170
who's bound to enter the palace one day.

754
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,129
If she doesn't have anyone to count on,

755
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,970
she will be bullied
once she enters the palace.

756
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:03,569
I bet she wants to
make friends with you.

757
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,210
If you seize the opportunity

758
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,849
and become the patron
of the future concubine of His Majesty,

759
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,690
with a little sweet talk of hers,

760
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,010
you'll become the second most

761
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:16,730
respected person.

762
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:18,569
You...

763
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,609
I...

764
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,890
I am enlightened, Mr. Li.

765
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,609
You're so brave,
intelligent, and talented.

766
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,049
I truly admire you.

767
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:28,849
Okay.

768
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,129
Let's do this.

769
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:33,369
So enlightened.

770
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:43,250
Jinrong.

771
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,490
Once I'm gone,

772
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:48,490
take good care of Mother.

773
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:51,329
The whole family will count on you.

774
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:54,250
Rest assured, Peilan.

775
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:56,569
Jinrong.

776
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,329
I could tell at first sight

777
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:01,089
that the purse on the beam was yours.

778
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,369
But I still gave it to Mother.

779
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:04,970
Jinrong, I'm sorry.

780
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,089
Cherish the last moment.

781
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:11,049
Forget about it.

782
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,569
Jinrong.

783
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,970
I made this purse for you

784
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,650
and haven't given it to you.

785
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:22,849
My dear sister,

786
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:24,369
please forgive me.

787
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:30,329
Banxia.

788
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,730
Once I'm gone,

789
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,930
take good care of Mother.

790
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:37,609
The whole family will count on you.

791
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,410
Rest assured, Peilan.

792
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:40,450
I won't feed them

793
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:41,690
random things like you.

794
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,049
I'm so sorry.

795
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,369
I won't eat random things
if I have a next life.

796
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,210
It's too late to regret it.

797
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,089
You shouldn't have done so.

798
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:56,329
Give me a break.

799
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,129
I know I was wrong.

800
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:03,609
Keling.

801
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,250
Once I'm gone, take good care of Mother.

802
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,089
The whole family will count on you.

803
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:11,689
Got it.

804
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:12,890
Keling.

805
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:15,930
Peilan, let's talk tomorrow.

806
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,249
There's tomorrow for you,

807
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:19,129
but not for me.

808
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,129
Can't you keep me company?

809
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,569
Don't worry, Peilan.

810
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:25,410
You'll reincarnate and come back.

811
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,209
See you.

812
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,529
Keling.

813
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,890
Be careful when you climb over the wall.

814
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:34,609
Who's going to
patch your clothes once I'm gone?

815
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:37,490
Master.

816
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,049
Would you like to
say something to my father?

817
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,890
I can be your messenger.

818
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,209
Senior.

819
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,490
Never mind, Master.

820
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,370
Tell him yourself

821
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,810
when you eventually see him.

822
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,169
I'm running out of time.

823
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,450
Peilan.

824
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:56,930
Mother.

825
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,810
Trust me.

826
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:00,169
Once I'm there,

827
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:02,490
I'll take care of Father.

828
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,209
Like father, like daughter.

829
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:10,209
You both died from poison.

830
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,490
Mother.

831
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:15,890
Once I'm gone,

832
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,609
take good care of yourself.

833
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,890
Don't get mad all the time.

834
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,450
Father and I will protect you.

835
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,770
I know. I will.

836
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,569
Rest assured.

837
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,529
Mother.

838
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,330
I have some money hidden up.

839
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,529
It's under the rice jar in the kitchen.

840
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,049
In the blue bag.

841
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,010
I don't get to spend it.

842
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,410
Take the money.

843
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:46,410
What a sweet, sweet girl.

844
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,490
Thank you, Mother.

845
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,290
Mr. Lu.

846
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,490
It's all my fault.

847
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,890
I didn't know you'd die

848
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:16,850
at such a young age.

849
00:36:20,129 --> 00:36:22,169
It's okay, Mr. Lu.

850
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,209
I'm going to keep you company soon.

851
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:28,049
No rush.

852
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,410
In the next life,

853
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:33,209
you can be Chun Peilan

854
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,290
and I'll be Lu Buping.

855
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,569
Then I can protect you.

856
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:44,089
I won't feed you random things again.

857
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:49,970
It's all my fault.

858
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:58,290
My dearest kitchen.

859
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,290
I'm here to say goodbye.

860
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,330
I can't spend more time with you.

861
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,290
My dining table.

862
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:06,249
My pickle jar.

863
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:09,569
My steamer. My...

864
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,970
Peilan, I'm so thirsty.

865
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:17,330
Why did you tie me up?

866
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,089
My hands are about to break.

867
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,410
Mr. Lu,

868
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:22,810
why did you come already?

869
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,249
Didn't I say "next life"?

870
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,089
"Next life"?

871
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:30,410
Since you're here,

872
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:32,729
let me speak my mind.

873
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,450
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

874
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:38,370
I didn't know the mushrooms
would be so poisonous.

875
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,370
You'd better be sorry.

876
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,970
I have amnesia.

877
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,850
Do you have food? I'm starving.

878
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:50,169
Mr. Lu.

879
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,729
I burned some money and candles for you.

880
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,249
Get whatever you want to eat.

881
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:57,770
I'll cook for you once
I'm there with you.

882
00:37:58,249 --> 00:37:59,970
"M-Money and candles"?

883
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:03,209
You just died.

884
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:04,810
Maybe it's new to you.

885
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,689
It's okay. You'll get used to it.

886
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:09,209
I'm dead?

887
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:11,410
No, I-I...

888
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,290
I'm still warm.

889
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,890
Come on, hold my hand.

890
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,850
No, thanks.

891
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,729
No.

892
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,689
I'm worried about you.

893
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:21,970
Mr. Lu.

894
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,370
I'll come and find you now.

895
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,490
Peilan.

896
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,770
Peilan.

897
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:04,450
It hurts.

898
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,890
I'm not dead.

899
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,049
What are you waiting for?

900
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:14,729
Come and have food.

901
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:19,169
Mother, I dreamed
about Mr. Lu last night.

902
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:20,850
Mr. Lu and I...

903
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,089
Mother, I see him again.

904
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:25,490
Look.

905
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,490
Do you see him?

906
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,850
Peilan, are you better?

907
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,049
Mother, he's talking to me.

908
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:31,609
Do you hear him?

909
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,490
Peilan, we lied to you.

910
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:35,850
You're not going to die.

911
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:37,850
I'm not?

912
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,410
You will eventually.

913
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,370
But it's going to be many years later.

914
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,970
Let's see if you remember it.

915
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:46,890
I'm not going to die?

916
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:48,649
We were bluffing.

917
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:50,770
Bluffing?

918
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,049
Mother, I'm not dying?

919
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:52,930
Great!

920
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,729
We can be together again.

921
00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:00,729
Mr. Lu, you're alive.

922
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,330
You almost
scared me to death last night.

923
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,169
I'm taking your savings.

924
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,490
Okay, Mother.

925
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:08,609
Don't forget that you owe me four taels.

926
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:09,890
I'll pay you back, Jinrong.

927
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,410
Can I throw away the bad food?

928
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,410
I'll do it, Banxia.

929
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,169
Peilan, there's a hole in my pants.

930
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:15,249
Can you fix it for me?

931
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:15,729
Okay.
