Mrs. Chun, in my opinion,

36
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:03,033
you don't look your age at all.

37
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:04,914
Well...

38
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:07,793
Stop flattering me.

39
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:08,833
I'm not.

40
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:09,953
You really don't.

41
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:10,993
Really?

42
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:12,713
By the way, Mrs. Chun,

43
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:14,673
someone wants to take me as a tutor.

44
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,034
So, you are leaving?

45
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:19,194
We agreed long ago

46
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:20,953
that I'd leave after a few days.

47
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:22,513
Okay.

You'll never get married
if you continue like this.

57
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:54,474
Give your mother some peace of mind.

58
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,713
It's none of your business.

It's time for a meal.

60

I don't need you to do that.

61
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,273
As an educated person,

62
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,553
how can you be so coarse?

00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:11,233

64
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,128

00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:18,513
you are really something.

69
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:27,354
please have a salted duck egg.

00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,288
Thank you, Madam.

Miss Banxia.

72
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:34,560
Please.

73
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:40,793
Who allowed you to eat with my bowl?

74
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,314
What's all the fuss about?

75
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:46,393
What's the problem if he uses it?
Hurry up and eat.

76
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,474
I'm not hungry. I'll go to the pharmacy.

77
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:50,754
It's still early. Why are you rushing

78
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:51,874
to the pharmacy?

79
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:52,793
You went the wrong way.

80
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:54,208
Yes.

81
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:56,273
Miss Banxia, just eat first.

82
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:01,474
You wouldn't be cautious

83
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,634
and unwilling to dine with me,
would you?

84
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:06,673
Shut up.

85
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,113
Mother, I'm going to the pharmacy

86
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:14,393
to tidy up the herbs.

87
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,256
Well...

88
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:17,874
Don't save food. I'm not hungry.

89
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,913
What herbs need to be sorted
at the pharmacy?

90
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:24,960
Are you asking me?

91
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:26,953
Banxia has left. Why are you still here?

92
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:29,353
I haven't even picked up the bowl yet.

93
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:30,674
So what are you waiting for?

94
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:37,874
Where are Jinrong and Keling?

95
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:39,776
Still sleeping.

96
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:42,473
It's so late,
and they're still sleeping?

97
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:44,114
Don't leave food for them.

98
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:44,960
Really?

99
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,234
Then I'll eat it, okay?

100
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:48,033
Mr. Lu, can you finish it?

101
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,184
I can finish it.

102
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:50,434
Can you eat this much?

103
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:52,512
Take out some for them.

104
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:53,568
It's all saved, Mother.

105
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:56,800
Just eat.

106
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,504
Jinrong,

107
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,074
no one saw you as you came, right?

108
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,033
Was it necessary to make me

109
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,473
enter from the back door?

110
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:32,994
No, it's not.

111
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,033
I really can't stand this kind of

112
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:38,794
sneaky life.

113
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,393
Yes, I know, Jinrong.

114
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:43,833
I know we've been together
for a long time.

115
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:45,376
But isn't it quite good

116
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:47,434
for us to drink tea

117
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:49,353
and chat together?

118
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:50,593
What's so good about it?

119
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:52,513
We've been together

120
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:53,593
for a long time.

121
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,634
And we always hide
in the Spring River Restaurant,

122
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,513
drinking tea.

123
00:05:57,953 --> 00:05:58,994
Don't be mad.

124
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,634
Here. Drink some tea and calm down.

125
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:03,393
Now, I'm sick at the sight of tea.

126
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:04,320
Then we're not drinking it.

127
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:05,600
Have some snacks.

128
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:11,234
My mother is arranging blind dates
for me now.

129
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,114
Do you think I should go or not?

130
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,593
Y-You definitely can't go.

131
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:17,273
You are already with me.

132
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:18,593
And you are seeing other men?

133
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:19,674
Do you think it's appropriate?

134
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,393
No, it's not appropriate.

135
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:22,336
It's certainly not.

136
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,833
But how should I tell my mother?

137
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,114
You can just say you don't want to go.

138
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:31,593
But you know

139
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:32,593
my mother's temperament.

140
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:34,048
I wouldn't dare say that.

141
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:36,416
Why don't you go tell her?

142
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:38,528
Me?

143
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:42,754
Will it be appropriate
for me to talk to her?

144
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:43,994
You should talk to her.

145
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,008
Then how about

146
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,674
I go talk to my mother,

147
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:49,874
and you go talk to your father?

148
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:51,616
My father?

149
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,104
Jinrong,

150
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:56,953
c-can we not bring this up?

151
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,153
Aren't we quite good the way we are now?

152
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,114
Don't be angry.

153
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:04,224
Here.

154
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:05,593
Look at this. Look at it.

155
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:07,074
Do you like it?

156
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:10,033
Young Lord, I don't want these.

157
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:12,473
These are not the reasons I am with you.

158
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:13,953
Tell me what you want.

159
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:15,153
I can have someone buy it.

160
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:16,114
I want you to tell others

161
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:17,234
about our relationship.

162
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:20,160
Well...

163
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:23,314
Jinrong,

164
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:25,033
isn't it enough for the two of us
to be together?

165
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,674
Why do we have to let others know?

166
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:28,114
Besides, are you with me

167
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:29,513
just to let others know?

168
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:30,554
Can't we let others know

169
00:07:30,554 --> 00:07:31,680
that I am with you?

170
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,736
Yes.

171
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,754
Our relationship was unstable
when we were first together.

172
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,554
I understand that you
didn't want to make it public.

173
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:38,153
But it has been a long time.

174
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,473
Is it going to be like this forever?

175
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,234
Yes, tell me

176
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,153
what you want me to do now.

177
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:43,314
It's not about what I want now.

178
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:44,473
It's about what you want.

179
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:45,504
I...

180
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:47,874
Okay, l-let's not talk about this.

181
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:48,896
Let's drop the topic, okay?

182
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:50,674
Then I have nothing else to say.

183
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:05,913
Neither do I.

184
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:07,434
I should go back now.

00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:28,128
Master,

187
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,632
do you have a minute?

188
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:30,720
Yes. What's the matter?

189
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:32,554
Master,

190
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,113
I think I've contracted
some kind of disease.

191
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:35,794
I'm itching all over.

192
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,434
(Ancestral medicine)
It's only natural that a man who lingers

193
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:40,434
in brothels gets sick.

194
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,136
Well, that's true.

195
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,914
Master, what do you think?

196
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,104
Is my condition severe?

197
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,473
Why are there so many bites?

198
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:52,434
They are all over your arm.

199
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:53,914
These are flea bites.

200
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:54,880
Don't worry.

201
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,096
Fleas?

202
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:58,074
How can there be fleas?

203
00:08:58,593 --> 00:08:59,794
I'm usually very clean.

204
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:00,794
I take several baths a day.

205
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:03,113
Master, can you take another look?

206
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,434
I think there might be more on my back.

207
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,034
People can see us.

208
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:10,314
Follow me, Mr. Shen.

209
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:11,456
Please come in.

210
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:15,904
Be careful.

211
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:20,993
You look slim when you're dressed.

212
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,194
But you're actually quite muscular.

213
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:24,674
You have a good figure.

214
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,633
Where have you been?

215
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:29,873
Why are there so many bites?

216
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:31,360
Tidy yourself up.

217
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:32,593
Don't worry.

218
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:33,554
I'll prescribe you.

219
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:35,314
One dose is for a bath,

220
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:37,473
and the other is to be taken orally.

221
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:40,353
Thank you, Master.

222
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:41,554
No problem.

223
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:42,633
How much does this cost?

224
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:43,808
Two taels.

225
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:45,920
Two taels?

226
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,833
Banxia, it doesn't cost that much.

227
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:51,680
Wait.

228
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:53,314
Two taels are fine.

229
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:58,674
Master,

230
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:00,034
I didn't bring money.

231
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:01,633
Can you put it on my account?

232
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,752
You!

233
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:05,753
It's okay.
Mr. Shen is a guest of our family.

234
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,794
After the medicine is ready,

235
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:09,833
I'll let...

236
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,752
I won't go.

237
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:13,353
I'll send it over to you.

238
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:15,873
Scald your intimate clothing

239
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,154
with boiling water.

240
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:18,794
Thank you so much, Master.

241
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:24,352
Take care.

242
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,304
Don't mind him.

243
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:37,056
It's okay.

244
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:41,713
Annoying.

245
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,154
Another tub of water
so early in the morning!

246
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:00,353
I-I'm sorry.

247
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:09,873
Are you still angry?

248
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,074
I'm not even angry.

249
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:15,314
What do you have to be angry about?

250
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:16,993
Don't be angry.

251
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,233
You can be angry for a while longer.

252
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,408
Feeling better now?

253
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:22,528
Here.

254
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:31,154
Is it sweeter than usual?

255
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,776
And you spit the seed.

256
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:39,072
So you've

257
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:40,873
prepared all these.

258
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:43,456
And these.

259
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:45,794
Are you satisfied?

260
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,256
They are okay.

261
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,914
Just "okay"?

262
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:53,794
Don't be angry anymore.

263
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,200
How about this?

264
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:56,832
Yes.

265
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:58,434
I might be a little grumpy

266
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,394
this morning.

267
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:00,953
It's because I was anxious,
and those words

268
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:01,794
jumped out of my mouth.

269
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:04,074
No, actually,

270
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,194
I also had my faults this morning.

271
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:07,914
If you realize

272
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:08,833
you have your faults,

273
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,314
it's something we can talk about.

274
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:11,776
Pour a glass of wine.

275
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:12,704
Okay.

276
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,034
Let's finish this glass

277
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:18,592
and let bygones be bygones.

278
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:20,192
Okay.

279
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,096
Young Lord,

280
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,674
frankly speaking,

281
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:35,514
I envy you.

282
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:37,312
You do?

283
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:38,713
What do you envy me for?

284
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:40,353
I envy you for not considering

285
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:41,833
anyone's feelings

286
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,194
or anything.

287
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:44,993
You haven't seen it

288
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:46,194
when I'm feeling troubled.

289
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:48,713
Born in Lord Ling's Mansion,

290
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,514
what could possibly trouble you?

291
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:52,544
You wouldn't understand.

292
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,314
Hardship in royal family.

293
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,154
How tough could it be?

294
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:00,640
Forget it.

295
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,233
What do you mean by "forget it?"

296
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,194
I'm afraid it will take me three days

297
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:05,753
and three nights
to tell you the whole story.

298
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:07,456
Really?

299
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,314
It's not my fault.

300
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:23,473
I didn't mean it.

301
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:25,314
The door was unlocked.

302
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,240
What could I do?

303
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,113
It was just a glimpse.

304
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:30,993
I didn't get hurt.

305
00:13:40,993 --> 00:13:41,888
Miss Banxia.

306
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:43,936
Are you done with your bath?

307
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:45,873
No. You're here.

308
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,473
Miss Banxia, what can I do

309
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:51,808
for you?

310
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:00,224
My apologies.

311
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:02,914
It's not your fault.

312
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:04,320
If we must blame anyone,

313
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:05,953
it's probably the loose door lock.

314
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,554
So, you're not going to tell anyone

315
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:10,154
about this, right?

316
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:11,456
Of course.

317
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:13,434
I also care about my reputation.

318
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:16,233
After all, I'm the one
who suffered, right?

319
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:21,344
As long as you promise.

320
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:24,434
You can rest assured of my part.

321
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:27,194
I just hope
you won't tell anyone either.

322
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:28,448
Me?

323
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:30,914
Of course I won't.

324
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:32,032
That's good.

325
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,488
That's good.

326
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:39,136
What are you laughing at?

327
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:43,914
Who's laughing?

328
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:44,514
You laughed.

329
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:45,408
I didn't laugh.

330
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:47,232
I didn't expect that

331
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,034
while you seem calm
and composed on the outside,

332
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,394
you've got
this overwhelming desire inside.

333
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:53,953
Are you out of...

334
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:04,608
Jinrong,

335
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,034
don't you think

336
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,993
my life is bitter?

337
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:08,896
Bitter.

338
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:10,674
It's too bitter.

339
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:13,713
If my mother were still alive,
I would...

340
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:14,833
Young Lord, I understand.

341
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,353
I totally get it.

342
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:17,633
I understand you completely.

343
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,873
I understand you so well.

344
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:20,353
You miss your mother.

345
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:21,674
I miss my father too.

346
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:24,314
Actually,

347
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:26,794
when my father was alive,

348
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:27,953
our family was also considered

349
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:29,514
a big family.

350
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:32,674
My mother would not
have had to sell tofu.

351
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:33,753
I wouldn't have to stay at home,

352
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:35,034
looking after my younger sisters.

353
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,473
Don't you think
that my life is even more bitter?

354
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:40,394
I resented fate.

355
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:43,394
But since the moment I met you,

356
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:45,914
I've felt like

357
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:46,993
the luckiest person.

358
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:48,928
Young Lord,

359
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,552
thank you.

360
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:54,034
Jinrong, rest assured.

361
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:55,914
I will definitely be good to you.

362
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,034
I believe you.

363
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:00,320
I believe you.

364
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:01,600
Do you think

365
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,233
we will be together forever?

366
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:04,544
Of course.

367
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:05,753
Then let's get married.

368
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,256
Getting married? Well...

369
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:09,233
Young Lord,

370
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,194
how about we first

371
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:11,993
make our relationship public?

372
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:13,554
D-Didn't we agree

373
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:14,873
not to talk about this?

374
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,154
What's wrong with you, Young Lord?

375
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:19,633
I'm a girl.
I don't want to push you like this.

376
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:20,713
But I'm already 29 years

377
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,674
and 18 months old.

378
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:22,993
I can't wait like this anymore.

379
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:24,154
Do you understand?

380
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:25,473
Jinrong,

381
00:16:25,473 --> 00:16:26,953
I have to be honest with you.

382
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,194
You don't look like you're

383
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:29,593
29 years and 18 months old at all.

384
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:30,633
Believe me. Here.

385
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:31,840
I toast you.

386
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:33,024
I'll drink first.

387
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,434
Jinrong,

388
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:38,674
this wine is really strong.

389
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:41,154
Again?

390
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:44,353
Can't you change your approach?

391
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:46,154
I don't understand.

392
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:47,554
Why are you always avoiding this matter?

393
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:48,593
Can't you man up and face it?

394
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:51,514
Get up and talk to me.

395
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:52,384
Let's have another drink.

396
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,272
Fine.

397
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,434
You're pretending with me, huh?

398
00:16:58,074 --> 00:16:58,993
Listen to me closely.

399
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,394
Starting tomorrow,

400
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,514
I will agree with my mother

401
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:03,633
to go from house to house
for blind dates.

402
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,376
You!

403
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:07,633
No, I feel even more dizzy

404
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:08,633
when I get up.

405
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,833
Dizzy?

406
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:11,633
How about now?

407
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:13,554
- I feel like vomiting.
- Vomit it out.

408
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,296
Vomit it out.

409
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:15,714
Vomit.

410
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:16,640
Dizzy?

411
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:18,994
I want to vomit.

412
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:24,672
Mr. Lu,

413
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:26,794
why are there fleas in this house?

414
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:28,544
Fleas?

415
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:30,496
There can't be.

416
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,512
Aren't you itching?

417
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:34,176
No.

418
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:37,913
But now that you mention it,
it does seem like a bit.

419
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:40,113
What will you do if so?

420
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:41,754
Take a bath. What else could it be?

421
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:43,873
I've taken a bath.

422
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:45,314
It doesn't work.

423
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,234
What are you talking about?

424
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,393
T-T-Taking a bath? What bath?

425
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,393
What else could it be?

426
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:54,528
That's right.

427
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:57,632
What do you mean?

428
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:00,192
I'm discussing

429
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:02,554
the insights of bathing with Mr. Lu.

430
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:05,673
What insights can you share
when it comes to bathing?

431
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:06,784
Lu Buping, my mom wants you.

432
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:08,633
Go ahead.

433
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:08,873
Where?

434
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:09,514
Anywhere.

435
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:17,728
Shen Wangyan,

436
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:20,673
a man should keep his word.

437
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:22,754
Don't try to play tricks

438
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:23,873
behind my back.

439
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:25,833
That was a misunderstanding.

440
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,554
We made it very clear at the time.

441
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,736
Yeah.

442
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:30,353
I didn't say anything.

443
00:18:30,954 --> 00:18:31,840
You are overthinking.

444
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:36,794
You better have said nothing.

445
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,768
Peilan,

446
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:46,554
I wrote a poem for you.

447
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:51,232
I will read it to you.

448
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:53,393
Don't read it, Mr. Lu.

449
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,234
Stop. It's too embarrassing.

450
00:18:56,794 --> 00:18:57,728
What is embarrassing?

451
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:00,234
What do you mean?

452
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:01,184
N-Nothing.

453
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:03,034
- What is embarrassing?
- I'm getting the food.

454
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:05,673
What did you mean, "embarrassing"?

455
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:06,873
What are we having for dinner today?

456
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:07,234
What...

457
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:07,873
What was that?

458
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:08,714
What...

459
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,113
What were you guys saying?

460
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,554
What did you mean by "embarrassing"?

461
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,913
Master,

462
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,274
look at my arm.

463
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:17,393
These look like fresh bites.

464
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:19,913
Yes, they are.

465
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:23,433
Do you have bites anywhere else?

466
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:25,184
Well...

467
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:28,320
There too.

468
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:33,633
What were you saying?

469
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,913
It's nothing.

470
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:37,554
Master, I'm leaving now.

471
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:40,074
Don't tell anyone else.

472
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:44,416
Naughty.

473
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:52,193
What were you saying just now?

474
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,274
It's nothing.

475
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:54,954
Tell me.

476
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:55,554
It's nothing.

477
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:56,593
What did you say?

478
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:57,433
It's a bit vulgar.

479
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,754
Tell me.

480
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:01,536
Jinrong,

481
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:03,200
I've thought it through.

482
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:05,593
I want to make it public now.

483
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:07,712
Do you think

484
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,514
either one of them doesn't know about

485
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:10,554
the relationship between us?

486
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:18,994
Is this making it public?

487
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:20,314
This reveals my attitude, doesn't it?

488
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:22,208
I see.

489
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:23,954
So in your heart,

490
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,034
I can be casually dismissed like this?

491
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,673
Alright, you guys go ahead.

492
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:30,873
I'm leaving now.

493
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:32,193
Jinrong,

494
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:33,433
listen to me.

495
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,314
Whether to make it public or not

496
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:36,673
really doesn't matter to me.

497
00:20:40,193 --> 00:20:41,593
I want to make it public too.

498
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:46,464
I'm just afraid

499
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:48,633
if my father finds out,

500
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:49,474
he won't agree.

501
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:50,514
If he doesn't agree,

502
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:51,954
we won't be able
to see each other again.

503
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:54,393
You are unwilling to make it public

504
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,153
because of your father?

505
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:58,193
Well, he... my father...

506
00:20:58,514 --> 00:20:59,873
He... Well...

507
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,593
You should have told me earlier.

508
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,954
I thought it was something else.

509
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:05,994
Young Lord, you have to trust me.

510
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,633
As long as I meet with him,

511
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,833
I will definitely win him over.

512
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:12,433
Think about it. I'm proficient in music,
chess, calligraphy, and painting.

513
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:14,673
What I mean is that

514
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,554
I've always been well-liked
by my elders since young.

515
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,016
Young Lord, don't worry.

516
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,113
As soon as he meets us,

517
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,272
he will definitely agree.

518
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:25,794
T-This won't work.

519
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,714
Young Lord,

520
00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:28,913
how will you know if you don't try?

521
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:31,994
Jinrong, you can do it.

522
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,720
Young Lord?

523
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,192
Okay.

524
00:21:40,754 --> 00:21:42,514
Jinrong, from now on,

525
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:44,353
let's face it together.

526
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,656
Really?

527
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,113
(I've taken a bath.)

528
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:13,994
(Stop. It's too embarrassing.)

529
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:21,554
(I'm leaving now. Don't tell anyone else.)

530
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:27,296
(It's a bit vulgar.)

531
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:30,176
Enough!

532
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:35,393
Are you out of your mind?

533
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:38,153
Yes,

534
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,833
I saw you taking a bath.

535
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:40,913
But you didn't lock the door.

536
00:22:40,913 --> 00:22:41,833
How is that my fault?

537
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,714
Y-You're not the one at a loss.

538
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:44,673
Since I was young,

539
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:46,074
I've never seen a man taking a bath.

540
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,514
And I've never seen a man naked.

541
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:48,794
I'm the one at a loss, okay?

542
00:22:58,234 --> 00:22:59,113
What are you saying?

543
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:00,673
She said she saw him naked.

544
00:23:05,673 --> 00:23:06,754
Miss Banxia,

545
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,153
didn't we agree

546
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:10,554
not to talk about that incident?

547
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:13,034
Yet you brought it up
at the dinner table.

548
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:14,754
I thought you could keep it a secret.

549
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:17,152
I didn't expect you...

550
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:27,552
Banxia,

551
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,714
why did you watch him bathe?

552
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,794
If I said I was joking,

553
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:37,664
would you believe me?

554
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:39,904
No.

555
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:03,904
Look at you.

556
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:05,536
You didn't believe me.

557
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:07,520
Are you happy now?

558
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:08,913
Now everyone knows.

559
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:15,193
I don't want to talk to you right now.

560
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:16,064
Stay away from me.

561
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:18,913
Actually, I don't really care.

562
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:20,608
But I suggest you

563
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:21,913
not to take it to heart.

564
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:24,074
Stay away from me.

565
00:24:27,954 --> 00:24:28,873
You were who saw it,

566
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:30,433
and who spoke about it.

567
00:24:30,714 --> 00:24:31,593
Now you're yelling at me?

568
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,314
Aren't you a bit irresponsible?

569
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,833
Plus, we are living
under the same roof now.

570
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:38,353
We see each other every day.

571
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:40,514
How about we let bygones be bygones?

572
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,080
Shen Wangyan,

573
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,393
ever since you came to my house,

574
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:48,593
I've had an uneasy mind.

575
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:50,353
An uneasy mind has brought me bad luck.

576
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,353
I will kick you out of my house.

577
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:56,954
Look at that cheap look of yours.
Go away.

578
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:02,688
What did I say?

579
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:06,272
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

580
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:09,554
Jinrong.

581
00:25:09,554 --> 00:25:10,496
Young Lord.

582
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:12,153
You're finally here. Today, my father

583
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:13,514
is having a banquet at home.

584
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:14,720
Are you confident?

585
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:16,714
Like holding the handle.

586
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:18,336
What does that mean?

587
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:19,616
Okay. Let's go.

588
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:20,608
Come on.

589
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:33,024
Your Highness, please.

590
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:35,552
Good.

591
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:38,673
Let's have a drink together, then.

592
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:43,648
Jinrong.

593
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,393
With so many people here,
can you handle it?

594
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:47,714
- Trust me.
- Good. Good.

595
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,640
I'm sure.

596
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:55,034
You're quite lucky with ladies, huh?

597
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,024
Father.

598
00:25:58,633 --> 00:25:59,552
Why are you here?

599
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:01,153
I can see...

600
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:02,034
So rascal.

601
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,184
This is...

602
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:08,113
This is the eldest daughter
of the Chuns, Chun Jinrong.

603
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:09,794
She just dropped by.

604
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,040
The Chuns?

605
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,234
The Chuns related to the Fourth Prince.

606
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:18,873
Greetings, Your Highness.
I'm Chun Jinrong.

607
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:19,913
No need for formalities.

608
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:21,873
We should have known each other
a long time ago.

609
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,456
Yes.

610
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:25,393
I heard about you
from the Young Lord before.

611
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:26,633
Now that I've seen you,

612
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:29,474
I've found that
you really have an impressive demeanor.

613
00:26:29,593 --> 00:26:31,514
You're like a star
descended from heaven.

614
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,873
Your Highness, I'll toast you.

615
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:36,433
Your Highness, I will also toast to you.

616
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,504
No rush.

617
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:38,913
Today, I am in a good mood.

618
00:26:39,153 --> 00:26:41,034
Let's take turns.

619
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,994
Chun...

620
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:44,864
Jinrong.

621
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:46,592
Make yourself at home.

622
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,074
Make sure to keep her company.

623
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:49,504
Yes.

624
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:03,232
How is it?

625
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,474
A good start is half the success.

626
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:07,648
Like holding the handle.

627
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:08,832
Great.

628
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:13,873
Your Highness,

629
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:15,754
thank you for your generous hospitality.

630
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:17,754
I have no way to repay you.
I'm willing to dedicate a dance

631
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:18,873
to express my gratitude.

632
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:20,754
Good.

633
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:23,072
Good.

634
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:24,096
Good.

635
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:31,554
Let's have another drink.

636
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,696
Good.

637
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:38,848
Leave.

638
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:44,448
Father?

639
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,384
You're awake.

640
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:52,704
Has everyone left?

641
00:28:52,913 --> 00:28:53,760
Yes.

642
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,353
Father, have a cup of tea to sober up.

643
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:00,234
You rascal.

644
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:05,728
Father,

645
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:06,913
actually,

646
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:09,074
I have something to talk to you.

647
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:10,656
Go ahead.

648
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:12,288
I kind of

649
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:14,714
want to get married.

650
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:17,696
You've thought it through?

651
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:19,360
Well,

652
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,633
you're not getting any younger.

653
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,954
Let me help you arrange this afterward.

654
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:26,514
What kind of girl

655
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,754
do you hope I marry?

656
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:32,113
I don't have high expectations for you.

657
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:34,113
You should find

658
00:29:34,393 --> 00:29:36,393
a gentle, kind,

659
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:38,554
and filial girl, and that's good enough.

660
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,353
That's what I've been thinking.

661
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:41,728
Father, rest assured.

662
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:43,552
My future wife and I
will both love and respect you.

663
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,393
Actually, I don't have high expectations
for myself either.

664
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:50,153
Marrying a commoner's daughter
is enough for me.

665
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:51,968
That's okay.

666
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:55,954
A daughter
from a mid-ranking official's family

667
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:57,034
can also match you.

668
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:00,224
Father,

669
00:30:00,554 --> 00:30:03,234
what if her family has no official rank?

670
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:05,514
What do you mean?

671
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:06,464
For example,

672
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:08,192
a commoner's family.

673
00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:10,954
Who are you talking about?

674
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:12,320
No one in particular.

675
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:13,824
Just, for example,

676
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:16,833
Chun Jinrong, who just danced.

677
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:20,034
You want to marry a dancing girl?

678
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:21,474
No, she's not a dancing girl.

679
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:23,433
She is Chun Keling's elder sister.

680
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,754
Well, Chun Keling
is the Fourth Prince's woman.

681
00:30:25,754 --> 00:30:27,593
She is kind of connected
to the imperial family, right?

682
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:29,633
The Fourth Prince is different.

683
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:30,913
He can do whatever he wants.

684
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,034
Who do you think you are?

685
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:33,248
Are you a match?

686
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:35,153
No, is she a match?

687
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:36,433
She is.

688
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,376
Pah!

689
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:39,936
Tell you what,

690
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:41,714
if you dare bring this up again with me,

691
00:30:42,193 --> 00:30:43,074
I'll break your leg.

692
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,352
Father!

693
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,113
Father, please listen to me! Father!

694
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:01,856
Coming.

695
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:10,433
Miss Banxia, long time no see.

696
00:31:11,274 --> 00:31:12,256
Mr. Xin.

697
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:15,104
Please.

698
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:21,274
Mrs. Chun, thank you
for taking care of this matter.

699
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:23,353
Don't mention it.

700
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:25,633
Mrs. Chun, please stay.

701
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:28,234
We'll meet again.

702
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,633
Mr. Xin, take care.

703
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:38,304
Mother,

704
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,440
what is he here for?

705
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,514
He is here for Mr. Shen.

706
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,153
He said their master

707
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,593
wants to hire Mr. Shen as a tutor

708
00:31:46,994 --> 00:31:47,994
for 20 taels a day.

709
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:49,248
They want Shen Wangyan?

710
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:52,034
It seems that Mr. Shen

711
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,353
is really someone.

712
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:54,193
Puff!

713
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:57,593
Banxia,

714
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,153
aren't you an educated person?

715
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,113
When did you become so crude?

716
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,314
Mother, let me tell you

717
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:04,633
what kind of person Shen Wangyan is.

718
00:32:04,913 --> 00:32:06,153
He is just cunning and crafty.

719
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:07,794
It might be him who invited Mr. Xin.

720
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:12,160
Chun Banxia,

721
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:15,113
I noticed that you have been
very critical of Mr. Shen recently.

722
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,274
Well, you saw him...

723
00:32:18,994 --> 00:32:20,314
He hasn't blamed you.

724
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:21,913
But you are still relentless.

725
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:24,234
You might let Shen Wangyan go with him

726
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,393
and not stay in our house anymore.

727
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:26,304
I don't plan to tell him.

728
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:27,392
You shouldn't, either.

729
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:37,184
Go.

730
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:39,274
Go create your own world.

731
00:32:40,474 --> 00:32:41,593
Do you really want me to go?

732
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,873
Mr. Xin said
they would pay you 20 taels a day.

733
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:48,514
It's 20 taels.

734
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:50,554
Do you know what that means?

735
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:52,994
Master couldn't earn that much
in a month.

736
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:56,153
And Mr. Xin is no ordinary person.

737
00:32:56,514 --> 00:32:58,913
The one he serves must be very powerful.

738
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:01,153
Don't you need to meet such people?

739
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,034
Aren't you going to file an appeal?

740
00:33:03,954 --> 00:33:05,113
You must have someone support you.

741
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,754
That's right.

742
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:07,744
Right?

743
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:09,274
No time to lose.

744
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:10,913
I'll pack luggage for you.

745
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:12,640
But

746
00:33:13,714 --> 00:33:14,754
I can't bear to leave you.

747
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:16,913
Don't push it.

748
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,232
Banxia,

749
00:33:19,994 --> 00:33:21,234
seeing you so reluctant to let me go,

750
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:23,113
I've decided not to go.

751
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:24,593
Are you out of your mind?

752
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:26,794
It's very late now.

753
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:29,113
Do you plan to stay here for the night?

754
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:34,794
Leave tomorrow morning.

755
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,353
You've been here since you came back.

756
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:02,913
You didn't respond when I called you.

757
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:04,448
What's wrong?

758
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:07,113
Let me stay alone for a while.

759
00:34:13,113 --> 00:34:14,593
Tell me what's happening.

760
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,312
Mother,

761
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:25,354
I want to go back to Qing City.

762
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:33,792
Why?

763
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,593
Mother, can I not get married?

764
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:41,034
What nonsense are you talking about?

765
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:44,434
Mother, you're right.

766
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:48,153
I shouldn't have eyes on my head.

767
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:51,874
I couldn't see myself clearly.

768
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:55,434
I'm arrogant and ambitious.

769
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:56,914
I'm worthless.

770
00:34:57,593 --> 00:34:58,434
I'm old.

771
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:00,448
What nonsense

772
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:02,474
are you saying?

773
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:03,914
What indeed happened to you?

774
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,792
Mother,

775
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:09,673
His Highness won't let me
be with the Young Lord.

776
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,633
You and the Young Lord?

777
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,593
Sorry, Mother,
I should not have hidden this from you.

778
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:25,673
We moved to Jianglin

779
00:35:26,313 --> 00:35:27,193
so that you could

780
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:28,514
marry into good families.

781
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:30,514
If he's not your Mr. Right,

782
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:32,273
there are other families.

783
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:35,313
I used to think

784
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:37,354
I wanted that kind of life.

785
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:39,193
But then I realized

786
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:42,113
the person I've fallen in love with
matters the most.

787
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:45,313
But we can't be together

788
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:47,793
just because of
our unequal social status.

789
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,633
You have always been the best.

790
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:54,554
I even feel the Young Lord
does not deserve you.

791
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:58,474
Unequal social status

792
00:35:58,474 --> 00:35:59,514
is not your fault,

793
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:01,313
but theirs.

794
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,313
They missed out
on a good daughter-in-law.

795
00:36:05,354 --> 00:36:06,753
Given your conditions,

796
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:09,313
you'll definitely
marry into a good family.

797
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,313
Alright, don't cry.

798
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,976
(Jianglin)

799
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:30,688
(Keep simplicity and nourish the heart)

800
00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:32,224
Mrs. Chun,

801
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:34,016
farewell.

802
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:37,034
Didn't you say you weren't leaving?

803
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,954
Your words yesterday

804
00:36:39,954 --> 00:36:41,394
made a lot of sense to me.

805
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:42,954
I need an appeal to Emperor.

806
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:44,394
This place is very good.

807
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,394
But I have more important things to do.

808
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:49,034
You clearly have your eye
on the 20 taels a day.

809
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,848
Chun Banxia,

810
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:52,313
did you tell Mr. Shen about that?

811
00:36:52,954 --> 00:36:54,554
Mrs. Chun, don't blame Miss Banxia.

812
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:56,673
She did it for my sake.

813
00:36:57,273 --> 00:36:58,176
After all this time,

814
00:36:58,434 --> 00:36:59,914
I haven't helped you much.

815
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:01,514
I feel ashamed.

816
00:37:01,514 --> 00:37:02,874
Don't say that.

817
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:04,994
I'm not stopping you from leaving.

818
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:06,994
You have your own important matters.

819
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:09,554
I'm just a little worried about you.

820
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:12,074
Don't be too aggressive
when you are out there.

821
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:14,193
Wait a moment.

822
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:15,753
I'm going to get you some travel money.

823
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:18,144
- Mother...
- Shut up.

824
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:20,673
Mrs. Chun, there is no need.

825
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:22,752
No need for too much.

826
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:26,793
Shen Wangyan, how can you be so brazen?

827
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:27,936
You will take the money?

828
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,193
You've seen it.

829
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:30,633
It's madam
who insisted on giving it to me.

830
00:37:31,593 --> 00:37:33,593
They may not know
what kind of person you are,

831
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:34,874
but I do.

832
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:37,994
Miss Banxia,

833
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:39,328
you know me that well?

834
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:42,753
Shut up.

835
00:37:45,193 --> 00:37:46,793
Well, I won't tease you anymore.

836
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,474
I owe you an apology.

837
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:54,673
Miss Banxia,

838
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,153
I've met many educated people,

839
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:58,113
but not many are as stubborn

840
00:37:58,874 --> 00:37:59,753
as you.

841
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:00,954
I knew you would say that.

842
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:03,793
People who pride themselves
on being high lack passion.

843
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,914
Those who are tactical lack backbone.

844
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,394
You are just perfect.

845
00:38:09,273 --> 00:38:10,514
You have principles for the world

846
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:11,874
and a passion for life.

847
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:13,088
You are quite adorable.

848
00:38:16,514 --> 00:38:18,034
What tricks are you trying to play now?

849
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:19,434
What tricks can I play?

850
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,354
It has always been you
taking advantage of me, hasn't it?

851
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:24,288
Shen Wangyan...

852
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:25,633
Mr. Shen.

853
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:26,954
Mr. Shen,

854
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:29,514
take this money.

855
00:38:29,753 --> 00:38:30,624
Take it.

856
00:38:30,994 --> 00:38:33,554
I hope you get what you want.

857
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:37,153
Mrs. Chun, I don't need the money.

858
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,113
Just take it.

859
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,008
I really don't need it.

860
00:38:39,673 --> 00:38:41,793
He's right, Mother.
He will get 20 taels a day later.

861
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:44,034
Mrs. Chun,

862
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:45,514
I have taken a lot of money
from you before.

863
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:47,232
I want you

864
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:50,176
to have this book.

865
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:52,834
Thank you.

866
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:55,673
I have been a bother for a long time.

867
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:57,354
As we part today,

868
00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:58,474
I don't know when we meet again.

869
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:01,394
Mrs. Chun, take care.

870
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,474
You take care too.

871
00:39:04,193 --> 00:39:06,593
Come and see us when you have time.

872
00:39:06,874 --> 00:39:08,474
The Chuns always welcome you.

873
00:39:08,753 --> 00:39:09,728
Not me.

874
00:39:10,273 --> 00:39:11,200
I welcome you.

875
00:39:13,874 --> 00:39:14,720
Miss Banxia,

876
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:18,464
take care of yourself too.

877
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:31,313
I hope to see you again in the future.

878
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,680
Banxia,

879
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:46,874
what is this about?

(Music Collection)

881
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:53,728
Vulgar.

882
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:57,834
You don't need it anyway.
