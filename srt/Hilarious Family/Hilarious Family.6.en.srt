Keling, it's time to get up!

38

Keling, time to eat! Mother is here!

39

- Mother is here!
- Mother is here?

- Get up!
- Mother is here!

Mother, wait a bit longer.

- I'll get her up.

48

Just a few days ago.

49
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:52,909
Why didn't you tell me?

50
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,990
We were just about
to pay respects to you.

51
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,709
By jumping through the windows?

52
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,230
No, that's to get some fresh air.

53
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,912
Come here! Not you.

54
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,749
I didn't restrain you
when we were in Qing City.

55
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,550
Now that we are here,
you bring men home every day.

56
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,350
Don't you want to get married?

57
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,110
Ouch, it hurts. Mother, I know.

58
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,350
Are you done? Hurry up and go.

59
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:24,990
Seeing your vigorous health,

60
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,429
- we are very glad.
- We're leaving now.

61
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,350
Yao Wen, Yao Wu.

62
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:30,189
The door is over here.
Let me take you out.

63
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,029
There's one more here?

64
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,270
- Who is this?
- My friend, A-Si.

65
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,350
Hasn't he woken up yet?

66
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,749
He has. He's leaving now. Hurry.

67
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,790
Wait a second.

68
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,909
I-I'm feeling a bit dizzy now.

69
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,990
Has it to be now?

70
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,629
Maybe you should eat before you go.

71
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,830
No need, Mother. He has an emergency
at home. Right? Let's go.

72
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,830
How did he get injured?

73
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:09,909
Maybe he fell.

74
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:12,749
That looks like a knife wound.

75
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,589
He fell onto a knife.

76
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,909
Stop talking nonsense.

77
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,629
Why can't you just behave yourself?

78
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,189
Mother, don't talk to me emotionally.

79
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,032
Is he the same young man
who got a dislocated shoulder last time?

80
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:25,110
Master, why...

81
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,150
You don't listen
to my words at all, do you?

82
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,509
Tell me. What happened, exactly?

83
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:32,710
Mother, you might not believe
what I'm about to tell you.

84
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,470
Someone threw a knife at him.

85
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,949
I'll say it. I'll say it.

86
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,189
I'll say it.

87
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,230
Mother, we ran into robbers
on the street yesterday.

88
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,230
He saved me, and a robber hurt him.

89
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,269
You also ran into the robbers?

90
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,470
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

91
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,269
Why is public security
in Jianglin so bad?

92
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,990
Starting today, you should stay at home.

93
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:51,990
Mother.

94
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,550
Stop.

95
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,030
How can we explain this to his parents?

96
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,230
They won't extort us, will they?

97
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,189
- That's impossible.
- What do you know?

98
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,920
Young man.

99
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,230
You are awake. Are you feeling better?

100
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,910
What happened to me?

101
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,550
After being injured,
you didn't get timely treatment.

102
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:15,389
You bled a lot
and passed out for a while.

103
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:17,670
But we checked on you in time

104
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,069
and treated your wound.

105
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,309
Look, it's all bandaged up.

106
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,829
It should be fine now. Right?

107
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:23,790
Yes.

108
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,429
Later, I will give you
some potentilla kleiniana paste.

109
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,069
You can take it back and eat it.

110
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,710
Apply it externally twice a day.

111
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,990
You're Keling's friend.

112
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:33,550
So we won't charge you.

113
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,790
Thank you.

114
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,670
Rest more and make yourself at home.

115
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,670
You can go back after you feel better.

116
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:44,269
You were so seriously injured,
and you didn't say a word to me.

117
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,470
Watch your attitude.

118
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,189
Rest well.

119
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,790
Getting enough rest matters the most.

120
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,990
- If something...
- Take good care of him.

121
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,910
Call me anytime if you need anything.

122
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:00,350
Just rest.

123
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,910
How bad is his injury?

124
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:10,869
It's a minor injury.

125
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,230
I didn't stitch the wound.
It won't leave a scar.

126
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:20,990
It's all your fault.

127
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,550
I'm sorry, Keling.

128
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,350
Thanks to you,
I can't go out for a few days.

129
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,949
- I'm going to decoct the paste.
- Why?

130
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,269
Because my mother saw your wound.

131
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,910
She thinks that
I will also get injured if I go out.

132
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,110
She's worried about you.

133
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,150
Just wait and see.
Because of your wound,

134
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,470
my mother can nag

135
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:42,110
and nag me for a whole year.

136
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,110
Keling, I think
you should treat your mother

137
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:47,670
with a little more respect.

138
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:49,869
Why is that?

139
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,429
Because she's your elder.

140
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,710
So what?

141
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,110
Being an elder deserves some respect.

142
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,150
Are you done yet?

143
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,470
I just think
your mother's actually quite nice.

144
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,710
I don't need you to say that.

145
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,550
Parents are only worried
about children's health.

146
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,990
Your mother worries about you,
and that's normal.

147
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,670
"Parents are only"... what?

148
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,230
Confucius said, "Parents are only
worried about children's health."

149
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,110
You know Confucius, right?

150
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,150
You better stop talking.

151
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,189
You're even more naggy than my mother.

152
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,350
This young man is pretty sensible.

153
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:55,710
Do you think
he would come back suddenly?

154
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,104
Perhaps.

155
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,670
Do the divination again.

156
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:04,790
For what?

157
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:15,230
Young Lord, do you think
he might have died outside?

158
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:25,949
If he's dead, that's fine.

159
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,350
Then, I can finally be at ease.

160
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,990
His Highness has arrived.

161
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:40,549
His Highness... His Highness is here!

162
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,549
Who?

163
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,990
It's your father.

164
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:49,110
My father... My father?

165
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,430
Hurry up. Get dressed quickly.

166
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,389
Father, what brings you here?

167
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,470
Why did you turn into such a state?

168
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,789
I'm trying to look
a bit more serious this way.

169
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,310
Father, do you need something
from the Fourth Prince?

170
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,149
I thought about it after I went back.

171
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,430
I think the Fourth Prince

172
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,549
probably misunderstood me.

173
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,110
I want to clarify with him face-to-face.

174
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:15,149
No, no, no, father.

175
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,549
The Fourth Prince is not feeling well.

176
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,629
I am very upset too.

177
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:20,669
Father! Father!

178
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:23,869
Father!

179
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:24,869
Your Highness, I...

180
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:29,389
(Kneel down)

181
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,720
"Kneel down."

182
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:33,152
He wrote those.

183
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,310
Your Highness, I think

184
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,950
you might have

185
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,549
misunderstood me.

186
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,110
If there's anything
you're unsatisfied with,

187
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,950
you can speak up so that...

188
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,029
Father, don't be disrespectful!

189
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,629
Go away! I...

190
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:02,528
(Leave me alone, please.)

191
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,149
"Leave me alone, please."

192
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,830
Father, let's just leave him alone.

193
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,032
Come.

194
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,909
In that case, Your Highness,
please rest well.

195
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,070
By the way, Your Highness,

196
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,190
in a few days,
it's your mother's birthday.

197
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,629
I wonder if we should prepare
a birthday present in advance for you.

198
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,945
(No need. I've already prepared it.)

199
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,190
Father, I understand.

200
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:45,190
How dare you! His Highness's mother
has already passed away.

201
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,430
Why did you impersonate him?

202
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,789
How dare you!

203
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,269
Don't hurt his mouth.
I still have questions to ask him.

204
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,789
Peilan, why did you tell your mother
that I'm a beggar?

205
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,629
Mr. Lu, I wanted you to stay.

206
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:07,789
So I just said that.

207
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,269
I never thought
you'd be so good at lying.

208
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,549
Mr. Lu, this is not lying.

209
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,710
Jinrong said
this is called communication skills.

210
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,029
See? Not only did
my mother let you stay,

211
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,389
she also gave you a quilt.

212
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,749
Actually, I think your mother
is a pretty good person.

213
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,389
She's just got
a bit of a temper sometimes.

214
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:29,669
What is it? It smells so good.

215
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,789
What are you cooking? It smells amazing.

216
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:34,990
I'm making meatballs.

217
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,310
What are these meatballs made of?

218
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,310
Tofu.

219
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:38,789
Can tofu be made into meatballs?

220
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,389
Meat is expensive.

221
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,710
Don't worry.
I've marinated all this tofu.

222
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:45,029
It's as good as meat
and really tasty. Just try one.

223
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,789
- Okay.
- Here.

224
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,869
It's hot. Just eat it like this.

225
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:50,149
Don't move.

226
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,520
Hey!

227
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,430
You just won't change, will you?

228
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,909
I just wanted to taste it.

229
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:00,470
That's right, mother. I asked Mr. Lu
to see if it was properly cooked.

230
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,149
You have no shame.

231
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:04,149
Have you finished your work? Go work.

232
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:12,990
If he has work in the future,
let him do it. Don't help him.

233
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,070
I understand, mother.

234
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:16,669
Is there anything
other than fried meatballs for lunch?

235
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,190
There is also fried fish.

236
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,509
Is there anything lighter?

237
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,789
I'd like to cook
with all the oil in this pot.

238
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,950
Keling's friend got hurt.

239
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,029
Make something light.
No need to fry the fish.

240
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,968
Okay, mother.

241
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,789
Mr. Lu,

242
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,269
I'm sorry.
I can't make you fish for lunch.

243
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,549
Why?

244
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,909
Keling's friend is injured.
He needs to eat something light.

245
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,310
Well, just make the fish for me.

246
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,710
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.
I'll make it for you at night.

247
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,149
Here, have a meatball.
Careful. It's hot.

248
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,749
Hot.

249
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,549
No worries. I'll take it back to eat.

250
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,848
Does it hurt?

251
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,869
If you're determined to help the weak
against the strong with us,

252
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,310
you should be prepared for this.

253
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,710
A-Si.

254
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,616
Mrs. Chun.

255
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:34,269
Sit down.

256
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,070
Are you feeling better?

257
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:38,110
Much better.

258
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:41,789
I'll leave in a moment.

259
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:44,070
Just stay here and have lunch with us.

260
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,230
There is no need.

261
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,190
What are you talking about?

262
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:52,190
Keling is like a boy.

263
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,310
It's my fault for not disciplining her.

264
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,710
She always gets into trouble.

265
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:59,070
Keling is actually quite nice.

266
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,389
You guys are the only ones
who don't mind her.

267
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,710
By the way, let Keling
send a letter to your parents,

268
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:04,789
so they don't have to worry.

269
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:06,190
- I...
- No need to bother.

270
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,669
That's okay. It won't bother us at all.

271
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:11,549
No, my father...

272
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,629
You can't get in
the place where my father lives.

273
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:22,029
There are a lot of guards there.

274
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,789
Guards?

275
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,830
He's in jail.

276
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:31,909
And what about your mother?

277
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:36,669
My mother was gone when I was little.

278
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:43,549
A-Si, don't think too much for now.

279
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:45,430
Just get some rest here.

280
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,190
I will definitely take good care of you.

281
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,789
What would you like to eat tonight?

282
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,950
Mother, how about a chicken?

283
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,990
Okay.

284
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,310
Alright.

285
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,430
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

286
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,509
Mother, if you have something to say,
just say it.

287
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,789
There are so many

288
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:29,789
unfortunate people in the world.

289
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,629
You mean me?

290
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:32,789
What's the matter with you?

291
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,149
I'm talking about A-Si.

292
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,430
His mother is long gone.

293
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:42,310
His father is still in jail.

294
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:44,269
Can you imagine
how hard it must be for him?

295
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,389
Is it true or not?

296
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:48,990
What do you mean?

297
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,149
Who would joke
about such serious matters?

298
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,710
I mean,

299
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,710
one should always be on guard.

300
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:56,430
A-Si is a good young man.

301
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,310
He's not like you guys.

302
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,710
Not one of you is easy to deal with.

303
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,909
Chun Keling in particular.

304
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,629
She is like a boy.

305
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:05,110
Who would marry her in the future?

306
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,350
You should worry more about me instead.

307
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,629
If Keling could find someone like A-Si,
that would be great.

308
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:14,149
He's prudent and filial.

309
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,310
Sometimes, he can even discipline her.

310
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,629
A-Si... This name sounds like

311
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,430
he's from a poor family.

312
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,430
So what?

313
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,549
Although he is poor now,

314
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:27,029
he is educated and sensible.

315
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,310
He is stable and trustworthy.
He will make it in the future.

316
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,710
Mother, your judgment
needs to be improved.

317
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,310
Tell you what, Chun Jinrong,

318
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,789
the most important thing
in finding a partner is character.

319
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,629
The richer a bad person is,
the worse they can be.

320
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,269
You haven't seen a few rich people.

321
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,950
Mrs. Chun, have some tea.

322
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,190
Wait, tell Peilan
to buy a chicken in a while.

323
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,310
We'll have chicken soup

324
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,389
to give A-Si a boost.

325
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,509
Is he staying here for dinner?

326
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,590
Do you have any objections?

327
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,590
I mean, Miss Peilan is pretty busy.

328
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,269
If she's busy, why don't you go?

329
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:05,630
Buy a fatter one.

330
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:07,509
I am also very busy.

331
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,190
Can't you put your work aside
for a while?

332
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,829
Why are you so obstinate?

333
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,150
Mrs. Chun, he is already awake.
Is it really necessary?

334
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,430
Besides, I've been here for so long,

335
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,630
but I haven't seen a chicken foot.

336
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,829
Just do as I say.

337
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,269
Why are you talking so much?

338
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,430
I'm just making a suggestion.

339
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,630
Go away.

340
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,336
Then I'll leave.

341
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,824
Mr. Lu.

342
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,710
What's wrong, Mr. Lu?

343
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,029
Your mother scolded me.

344
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:51,509
It's okay. My mother sometimes
says the same to me.

345
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:52,430
Your mother wants you

346
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,509
to make chicken soup for A-Si.

347
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,670
He must be injured badly then.
I need to buy the chicken quickly.

348
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,069
No, sit down.
You didn't get it, did you?

349
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,950
Your mother wants you

350
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,269
to specially buy a chicken for A-Si.

351
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,870
Who is he for your mother
to treat him so well?

352
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,470
A-Si saved Keling.

353
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:10,509
But I also saved you.

354
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:12,069
How did I end up being your servant?

355
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:13,589
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

356
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:15,509
You were wronged because of me.

357
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,190
It's not about being wronged.

358
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,990
Your mother never calls me by my name.

359
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:22,589
Don't I have a name?

360
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,190
Then I'll apologize to you
on behalf of my mother.

361
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,870
That's not what I mean.

362
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:31,069
I'm a servant,
but I also need basic respect.

363
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,269
He, an outsider, can have chicken soup.

364
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,749
I can't even eat a meatball or a fish.

365
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,269
I see, Mr. Lu.

366
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,749
I'll go buy the chicken now.

367
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,069
Tell me what you want,
and I'll bring it back for you.

368
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:44,230
You don't have to.

369
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,150
Okay, I'm leaving now.

370
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,349
Buy two steamed buns.
I want meat-stuffed ones.

371
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:49,509
Okay, Mr. Lu.

372
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,280
Thanks.

373
00:18:57,021 --> 00:19:00,218
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

374
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:02,829
You couldn't even
keep an eye on a live person.

375
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,349
Useless! Useless!

376
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,470
How can I explain this to the palace?

377
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,109
Father, I've thought about it.
If the palace finds out,

378
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,470
we can say he didn't watch carefully,

379
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:19,589
so the Fourth Prince got lost.

380
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,150
Young Lord, isn't this a bad idea?

381
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,069
What do you say?

382
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,390
Are you stupid?

383
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,630
Do you think that by saying that,

384
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,109
we can be exonerated?

385
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,630
When did the Fourth Prince go missing?

386
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,230
Which time are you talking about?

387
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,109
Which time? You tell me!

388
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,190
It just happened once.

389
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,589
No, Young Lord.

390
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,390
You lost him once when you took him

391
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,749
- to the Spring River Restaurant.
- You!

392
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:47,470
You even took him
to the Spring River Restaurant?

393
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:49,190
Spring River Restaurant!

394
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,309
Father, I think
the Fourth Prince didn't get lost.

395
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:53,829
He came back by himself last time.

396
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,390
I think he will come back later too.

397
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,109
Shut up. You tell me.

398
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,910
When did the Fourth Prince get lost?

399
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,230
Yesterday morning.

400
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,190
Yesterday morning?

401
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:04,670
Your Highness.

402
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,230
Lord Ling.

403
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,230
Nonsense. I saw him at noon yesterday.

404
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,749
Greetings, Your Highness.

405
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,910
Your Highness,
the one you saw that day was me.

406
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,749
Do you think I'm blind?

407
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:22,670
Do you think I'm blind?

408
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,910
I am telling you. If something happens
to the Fourth Prince,

409
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,430
you, and you too, will have to die.

410
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,589
Why are you standing here?
Go look for him!

411
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,029
Yes!

412
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,400
Come back.

413
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:44,749
Keep secrecy.

414
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,528
- Yes.
- Yes.

415
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,990
- Go! Are you waiting for me?
- Let's go.

416
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:56,829
You want me to go with you?

417
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,109
What two idiots!

418
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,910
A-Si, huh?

419
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:09,870
He loves chicken soup, huh?

420
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,230
They have me work all day.

421
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:17,509
Mr. Lu, are you okay?

422
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:19,069
I am fine. I won't die.

423
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,069
You might want to stop.

424
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:21,230
I'll chop the rest.

425
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:22,349
No need. I'm fine.

426
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:23,589
You can go back to your stuff.

427
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:24,990
It's okay. It will be quick.

428
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:25,990
You must be starving.

429
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:27,349
Drink the chicken soup first.

430
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:31,990
I won't drink it.
It wasn't meant for me.

431
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,069
Where are my steamed buns?

432
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:40,190
What happened?

433
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,430
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

434
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:43,349
I was late,
and the steamed buns were sold out.

435
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,029
- Wait...
- Even the vegetarian ones were too.

436
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,670
What kind of life is this?
I am working so hard,

437
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:50,910
but I can't even eat the buns.

438
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,430
If it was the past...

439
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,430
Alright, forget about that.

440
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,230
Don't be angry, Mr. Lu.

441
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,870
Once A-Si leaves,

442
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,269
I will cook whatever you want to eat.

443
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:02,309
A-Si, A-Si.

444
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,069
He is an outsider,

445
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:05,390
and everyone is all about him.

446
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,509
He can even drink chicken soup.

447
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:07,710
Yet I chop wood since the early

448
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:08,870
and no one has ever thanked me.

449
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,670
Mr. Lu, thank you.

450
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,990
You've worked hard.
Just drink the chicken soup.

451
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:18,910
I'm not drinking it.

452
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,710
There are your favorite dates inside.

453
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,430
Thanks, Peilan.

454
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,990
I was not mad at you.

455
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,430
I know, Mr. Lu.

456
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,749
Drink it while it's hot.

457
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,749
- You!
- Mother! Mother! Mr. Lu!

458
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,430
- Who allowed you to drink it?
- It's spilt.

459
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,470
I brought it for him.
Mr. Lu worked very hard today.

460
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,910
- That's right.
- Who gives you the right to drink it?

461
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,430
It's for A-Si.

462
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,150
Mrs. Chun, I've worked the whole day.

463
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,390
And I can't drink a bowl of soup?

464
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,349
What makes me inferior to that A-Si?

465
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,349
Everything!

466
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:09,120
A-Si is educated and filial.

467
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,710
And you? You are just lazy.

468
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,670
If you worked a bit harder,
you wouldn't beg for food.

469
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,230
I... I won't mind
your misunderstanding of me for now.

470
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:17,670
But A-Si is an outsider.

471
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,630
You can't possibly treat him

472
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,990
better than your own, right?

473
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,829
A-Si has lost his mother.

474
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,069
So have...I.

475
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,390
Mr. Lu, now is not the time
to let your anger get ahead of you.

476
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,390
I've really lost my mother.

477
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,950
Don't imitate me.

478
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:30,190
I didn't expect you, a grown man,

479
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:31,829
to be so petty.

480
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,870
If you have a problem, just leave.
No one will stop you.

481
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:37,990
I'm petty?

482
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:39,390
Your mother said I'm petty?

483
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,430
She even pulled my ears!

484
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,509
I'm getting you another bowl.

485
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:42,528
I firmly refuse to drink it.

486
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,710
Let me think about it.

487
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:46,950
Alright.

488
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,870
Save some for me tonight.

489
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,528
Okay.

490
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,749
This is the wooden dummy
that the head of the martial arts used.

491
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:58,710
Just feel this touch.

492
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,230
Impressive, right? Look.

493
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,349
A-Si, it's mealtime.

494
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,670
Mother.

495
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,589
A-Si, come. I've specially
made chicken soup for you.

496
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,870
You should replenish your strength.

497
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:17,568
Chicken soup!

498
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,630
I also made some vegetables for you.

499
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,109
Sit down and eat.

500
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:23,630
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

501
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:26,269
Keling, could you feed A-Si?

502
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,230
Can't he eat by himself?

503
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,190
He injured his arm.

504
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,069
How do you expect him to use it?

505
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,190
I can do it myself.

506
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,880
It's okay.

507
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:37,230
Hurry up.

508
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,069
Mother, when I was sick,

509
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,710
you never fed me like this.

510
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:46,870
Seriously?

511
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:49,190
You brought it upon yourself
every time you got sick.

512
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:54,016
Open your mouth.

513
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,230
You! Don't hurt him.

514
00:24:58,309 --> 00:24:59,589
Look at you! Get up.

515
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,109
Can't you take care of people?

516
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:03,990
It's okay.

517
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,990
So rude.

518
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,589
Learn a bit.

519
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,470
No, I can do it myself.

520
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:13,509
Let me do it.

521
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,150
Is it hot?

522
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,456
No, it's not.

523
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:24,829
How does it taste?

524
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,950
It's very good.

525
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,829
Save the pretending.

526
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,589
I'm not pretending.

527
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,150
Here.

528
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,950
Hurry up and eat.
You've never had this before?

529
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:38,870
I really haven't had
this kind of chicken soup often.

530
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,749
Poor kid.

531
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,990
Seriously?

532
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,990
No...

533
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,430
Here, drink more.

534
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,509
There's more in the pot.

535
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:52,150
Here, have a piece of chicken.

536
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,349
Where is my sleeve? This is
my only decent piece of clothing.

537
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,190
So it's you. Come here.

538
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,230
Sorry, but look at
what you did to my clothes!

539
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,990
Come here. I finally caught you.

540
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,829
You're in for a world of trouble,
I'm telling you.

541
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,390
No, you're done for.

542
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,349
What are you doing?

543
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:54,390
Mrs. Chun, this person isn't honest.

544
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:56,349
He's a clothes thief.
He even stole my sleeve.

545
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,430
What are you yelling about?

546
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,390
- A-Si, are you feeling better?
- Yes, I am.

547
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,390
- Wait, Mrs. Chun?
- What?

548
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,509
- He stole my sleeve.
- No.

549
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,109
- So it's your sleeve.
- Right.

550
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,670
- You really are...
- And then?

551
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,749
And then... Look!

552
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,829
Does it affect your work?

553
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:25,710
Well, it doesn't.

554
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:28,589
Mrs. Chun, how about
I give it back to him?

555
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,269
No need. Just wear it.

556
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:34,912
I don't want it anymore.

557
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,109
Why are you so narrow-minded?

558
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,749
I will get another one for you.

559
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,990
Lord Si, where are you?

560
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:47,950
Have you seen Lord Si?

561
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,990
Who is that?

562
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,190
You don't have to know.

563
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,670
Have you seen him or not?

564
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,990
I didn't.

565
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,630
Get lost.

566
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,190
What kind of accent is this?

567
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,990
- Lord Si?
- Lord Si?

568
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:00,630
Where are you, Lord Si?

569
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:10,749
Quite a unique outfit.

570
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,069
Going hunting?

571
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,950
Who are you humming at?

572
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,829
No, I'm just humming a song.

573
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,710
- A-Si.
- Miss Jinrong.

574
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:26,390
It's a splice style. Quite unique, huh?

575
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:37,190
Mr. Lu,

576
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,670
I really didn't know
this sleeve was yours.

577
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,670
You know it now, right?

578
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:45,029
How about I exchange it with you?

579
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:45,950
You wish.

580
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,990
I know now.

581
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,630
You want Mrs. Chun to know about this

582
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,749
and scold me again, right?

583
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:53,069
You're very cunning.

584
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,870
No, I didn't mean that.

585
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:58,150
Can I help you with something?

586
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:01,990
Where is Mrs. Chun?

587
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:04,190
She went to buy groceries.

588
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:16,109
Wait a minute.

589
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,589
You want to do something, right?

590
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,109
Hang the clothes out.

591
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,864
Okay.

592
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,710
Don't you know how to do it?

593
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,950
Are you doing this on purpose?

594
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,630
Now I have to wash this all over again.

595
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,269
I've never hung clothes out myself.

596
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,910
Shake it like this.

597
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,190
Then flap it upward

598
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,349
and stretch it out.

599
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,870
They are very picky, you know.

600
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,256
You're so incompetent.

601
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:07,520
There are more clothes over there.

602
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:19,589
What's wrong with you?

603
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:20,789
- Lu Buping.
- I...

604
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,032
Mrs. Chun.

605
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:25,749
Didn't you go out?

606
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,069
I'm picky?

607
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,190
What did you say?

608
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,528
You forget your place.

609
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,710
She's outrageous.

610
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:38,990
Alright, Mr. Lu.

611
00:30:39,069 --> 00:30:40,069
Didn't A-Si

612
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,470
explain everything to my mother?

613
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:44,710
Who cares about his explanation?

614
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,390
Mr. Lu, your nose is bleeding.

615
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,630
Here. Did my mother hit you too hard?

616
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:02,109
I've had nosebleeds whenever I get mad
since childhood.

617
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:06,509
Mr. Lu, you should stop getting mad.

618
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,069
Well, no matter what,

619
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:10,710
you shouldn't have asked A-Si
to hang the clothes out for you.

620
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:12,269
He's injured his arm.

621
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,069
I didn't ask him to do that.

622
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:16,190
It was he who insisted on
doing something for me.

623
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,150
Mr. Lu,

624
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:22,829
why don't you like A-Si?

625
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:24,549
Did he do something to upset you?

626
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:26,029
Today at noon,

627
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,430
your mother yelled at me
because of him and told me to leave.

628
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:30,670
This evening, your mother said

629
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,870
that I didn't have the right

630
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,910
to drink the soup for A-Si.

631
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,430
I don't even like the soup.

632
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,269
Mr. Lu, why do you care about all these?

633
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:38,470
My mother just said those
without meaning them.

634
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:39,630
No, she did mean them.

635
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,749
Your mother just favors him.

636
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:43,349
No matter what, you shouldn't
talk about my mother like that.

637
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,069
You should rest first.

638
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,990
Peilan, what's so good about him?

639
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,349
He just came here yesterday.

640
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:50,470
And now everyone is around him.

641
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:51,549
I work so hard every day,

642
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:53,230
with no name, credit, good reviews,

643
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:54,670
steamed buns, or chicken soup!

644
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,230
Anything edible
has nothing to do with me.

645
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:57,670
Why is he better than me?

646
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,950
At least he doesn't complain
as much as you.

647
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,630
I think I should turn myself in.

648
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:10,029
I think you should calm down first.

649
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,190
Peilan, you didn't even
try to talk me out of this?

650
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:28,670
L-Lord Si... L-Lord Si...

651
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:33,069
Where are you?

652
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,829
Young Lord, don't do this. Get up.

653
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:40,470
Get lost. It's all your fault.

654
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:42,910
I don't want to die young.

655
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:46,349
Why are you blaming me?

656
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,430
I was just running my stall
and doing just fine.

657
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:50,309
What did I do to end up like this?

658
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:52,470
I don't want to die either.

659
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,190
You don't want to die? Neither do I!

660
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,430
I am the Young Lord.

661
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:58,069
So what?

662
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:00,670
What did you say? I will fight with you.

663
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,749
I've been annoyed with you.

664
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:03,950
You hit me!

665
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,190
I will fight with you.

666
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,990
Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu.

667
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,630
Peilan, I once thought

668
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,990
you were the one
who knew me the most in this world.

669
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,296
Mr. Lu...

670
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:37,990
But now even you treat me like this.

671
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,430
If I knew this would happen,

672
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,589
I should have left early.

673
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,269
- Mr. Lu, actually, I...
- Alright.

674
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:46,910
You don't have to persuade me.

675
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:50,710
I've made up my mind.

676
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:52,470
I'll see you again.

677
00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:00,589
(Leaning on the railings in the pattering rain,
I am drunk without knowing which year it is.)

678
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:08,681
(Though shrouded by longing and yearning,
I have no shame about it and don't care who does.)

679
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,350
Mr. Lu, I'm not here
to persuade you, actually.

680
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,669
I just want to tell you
that A-Si is going to leave.

681
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:17,509
Really? When is he leaving?

682
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,136
Now.

683
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:22,830
Mrs. Chun, thank you for your care.

684
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,470
Is your arm better?

685
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,270
Why not rest for a couple more days
before leaving?

686
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,069
It's fine. I'm all healed up.

687
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,390
I have a small request.

688
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,549
Just say it.

689
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,390
Can I come to your house for meals
in the future?

690
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:37,870
No problem.
You can come whenever you want.

691
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,870
It's mainly because
the food you make is so tasty.

692
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,870
You are such a great kid.

693
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,509
- What a flatterer!
- Mrs. Chun, I didn't have much else.

694
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:45,549
I'm giving this to you.

695
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:46,950
No.

696
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,390
Mother, I'll keep this for you.
Thanks, A-Si.

697
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,350
Peilan, look how cunning he is.

698
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,870
He's starting to bribe people.

699
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,270
Look at you.

700
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,990
Where did you get this? Is this yours?

701
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,229
Alright, you should leave now.

702
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:03,149
- Hurry up and go.
- Don't push A-Si.

703
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,870
Remember to come here
for meals often, A-Si.

704
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:07,470
Just go.

705
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:15,109
Lord Si?

706
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,990
Young Lord.

707
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,509
Who are these two?
