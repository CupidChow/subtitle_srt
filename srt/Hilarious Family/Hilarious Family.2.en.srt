(First and Fourth Daughter, Jinrong and Keling)
That's all? I'm starving.

38
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,251
Be grateful. Stop complaining.

39
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:16,371
Yeah, you are full.

40
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:18,211
Don't push it.

41
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:25,012
What's that smell? It's new.
Do you smell it?

42
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:29,771
I do smell something.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,531
What's that sound?

44
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:33,651
Mother, I'll check on it.

45
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:46,172
Mr. Lu, what are you doing?

46
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:47,691
You finally came.

47
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:49,452
I wanted water so much.

48
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:52,012
But I broke the bowl
because my hands were hurting.

49
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:53,612
Mr. Lu, please hide.

50
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,412
My mother would find out.

51
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:58,811
Sit tight. Hide.

52
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,971
Mr. Lu, I'm so sorry.

53
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:02,771
Keep hiding here.

54
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:04,771
I'll get you some food.

55
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:09,892
By the way, how's it going out there?

56
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:11,651
I checked around. That guy is gone.

57
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,371
But the officials are laying low.

58
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:14,531
Hide here for the night.

59
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:17,052
I'll go take a look tomorrow. Hide.

60
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:22,531
Banxia, how's it going with that
rental notice I told you to write?

61
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,811
To rent the two rooms by the street?

62
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:26,971
I've been busy. Are you in a rush?

63
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,931
Good. Forget it.
I'm planning to start a tofu shop.

64
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,251
Mother, it's not nice.

65
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:36,732
We sold everything to buy this mansion.

66
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:39,371
The tofu shop will ruin it all.

67
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:40,691
What can I do?

68
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:42,651
I'm worried sick and can't sleep.

69
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:43,612
You know?

70
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:44,931
Chun Jinrong, listen.

71
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:47,612
We won't provide for you
starting next year.

72
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:49,332
Go sustain yourself.

73
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:54,491
Mother, come on.
It was just a suggestion.

74
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:56,412
Why did you get mad?

75
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:58,811
I'm not joking.

76
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:01,091
Mother, a tofu shop sounds good.

77
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:02,491
Let's make money by ourselves.

78
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:05,172
That's the way to go. I can make tofu.

79
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,251
Peilan can grind tofu.
Keling can sell tofu.

80
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:09,612
Chun Jinrong can go on
pretending to be a stranger.

81
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,052
Chun Banxia, that's enough.

82
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:13,651
What happened?

83
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:17,172
Nothing.
A bowl in the kitchen broke a mouse.

84
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:19,371
Peilan, are you fine?

85
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:20,652
Did you catch the mouse?

86
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:22,080
No.

87
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,811
Let me do it.
Old mansions may house demons.

88
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:26,092
You're no match for them.

89
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:31,652
Peilan, just catch the mouse.

90
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,931
It's so gross. Just...

91
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,011
Why don't you do it?

92
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,972
I'm scared.

93
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,011
Isn't Peilan scared?

94
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:40,412
I-I'm okay.

95
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:43,212
Alright, the most capable one
should go catch it.

96
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,412
You're the best tofu maker. Go ahead.

97
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,011
You're the most unwanted. Go ahead.

98
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,972
You're good at arguing. Go ahead.

99
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:52,172
You're the best adviser. Go ahead.

100
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:54,011
A-Alright. That's enough.

101
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,251
I'll go.

102
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,732
You just can't shut your mouth.

103
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,052
Old women have so much to say.

104
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,092
Mother, she's roasting you all the time.

105
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:06,972
I meant you.

106
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:09,852
Chun Banxia.

107
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,772
You're as educated as a pig.

108
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,732
Just like you.

109
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:13,972
- You're a pig.
- You're a pig.

110
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,612
- You're a pig.
- You're a pig.

111
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:25,872

112
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:27,691
Thatch for sale.

113
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,292
Mother, you're going somewhere?

114
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:52,852
We've basically offended

115
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:54,451
all the matchmakers in Jianglin.

116
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:58,292
I heard that
there's a Marriage Bridge nearby.

117
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:00,331
Many single people go there.

118
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:01,371
I'll go take a look.

119
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,931
Okay, Mother. See you.

120
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:07,612
What's that sound?

121
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,052
There was a sound?

122
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,972
It sounds like a guy crying.

123
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:14,891
A guy? Well... Let me take a look.

124
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:17,172
There's a guy? I don't see one.

125
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:19,691
That's weird.

126
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:24,544
Mr. Lu.

127
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:35,292
Mr. Lu, hurry up. Go.

128
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,412
W-What's wrong?

129
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:40,811
Mr. Lu, what are you doing?

130
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:42,972
I was just thirsty.
I wasn't committing suicide.

131
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:44,972
I mean, why did you go out?

132
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:46,732
What if my family finds out?

133
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:51,251
And Mr. Lu, keep it down when you cry.

134
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,652
My mother heard you.

135
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:53,532
I didn't cry.

136
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,811
You're free to cry. Just keep it down.

137
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:57,172
My mother has sharp ears.

138
00:06:57,212 --> 00:06:59,131
But I didn't cry.

139
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:00,532
Fine, alright.

140
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,772
Stay in the kitchen. Don't go out.

141
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:03,652
I'll take a look.

142
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:06,571
Also, I'll get you some buns.
Stay in here.

143
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:08,160
Okay.

144
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,328
Don't go out.

145
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,609
(Marriage Bridge)

146
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,532
My son is a Jianglin local.

147
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,732
My son is six feet tall.

148
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:31,412
My son works in the palace.
Well-paid and steady.

149
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,131
He's a eunuch?

150
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,972
Come on, he's a guard.

151
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,052
So he's just a guard.

152
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,131
My son has three mansions in Jianglin,

153
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:39,732
and one in Suzhou Prefecture.

154
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,852
That's good. Really good.

155
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:45,732
What about you?

156
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,852
We're... We're still looking.

157
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:56,412
You have no idea.
My son is getting a promotion soon.

158
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:59,732
He will become an imperial guard.
That's quite something.

159
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:01,172
I don't know her. So pretty.

160
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,172
Your son is a scholar?

161
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:04,532
N-Not yet.

162
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:07,811
You look new. First time here?

163
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:10,331
Are you here
for your son or your daughter?

164
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,852
My daughter.

165
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,092
I see. How old is she?

166
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:16,931
The eldest one is 30 years old.

167
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,732
Do not say that.

168
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:25,451
Here, you have to say 29 instead of 30.

169
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:27,972
It's only one year apart.

170
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,251
But it sounds totally different.

171
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:33,691
Where's the portrait?

172
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,731
Portrait? What do you mean?

173
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:38,731
You came without her portrait?
Looking for a date yourself?

174
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:43,971
Sister, wait. Let's have some tea.

175
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:52,864
No way.

176
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,892
Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

177
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,012
Too harsh?

178
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:22,372
- Okay.
- It's okay.

179
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:28,851
- Boss, we miss you so much!
- Boss, we miss you so much!

180
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,252
When did you come?

181
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:31,331
Why didn't you tell us?

182
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,211
(Yao Wu, 19)
We came straight here for you.

183
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,772
Come on, Boss.
We want to visit Jianglin.

184
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,211
(Yao Wen, 20)
You abandoned us in Qing City.

185
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,132
We were so bored.

186
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,132
We were itching for fun.

187
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:44,132
Great. The Keling Gang has united again.

188
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,892
Boss, we've been traveling.

189
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:48,571
And Jianglin is so lively.

190
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,611
Boss, show us around.

191
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:52,012
Alright, let's go.

192
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:53,691
Have you seen him?

193
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:55,532
His name is Lu Buping.

194
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:58,851
No.

195
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,492
Hello, come on in.

196
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:04,691
Here, have you seen him?

197
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:19,372
Miss, this is not a teahouse.

198
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:20,931
Master.

199
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:22,611
You've been here five times.

200
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:24,372
Do you need a fortunetelling or not?

201
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:25,571
Sorry, Master.

202
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:28,772
Judging from your frightened look,

203
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,652
I'm afraid you're already in trouble.

204
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:38,652
Master, well, is it too late
to repel the misfortune?

205
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:43,052
Of course not. Twenty guan.

206
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:44,052
Twenty guan?

207
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,691
You kept delaying it.

208
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,611
So the signs have been changing.

209
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:50,772
If you keep hesitating,

210
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,372
I may ask for 30 guan.

211
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:59,331
Thirty-five guan. Forty guan.

212
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:00,691
Forty-five guan.

213
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:02,571
Wait. Let me think.

214
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,652
Peilan, what are you doing?

215
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,132
Keling, why are you dressed like that?

216
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:08,492
- Peilan.
- Peilan.

217
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:11,211
Yao Wen, Yao Wu, so good to see you.

218
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:12,731
Peilan, what was he saying?

219
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,451
N-Nothing.

220
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:16,132
I just wanted to repel a misfortune.

221
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:17,211
Are you doing it or not?

222
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:19,971
It will be 50 guan
if you keep hesitating.

223
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,091
Repel a misfortune?

224
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:24,492
Oh right, Mother was looking for you
for something urgent.

225
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:25,492
What was it about?

226
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:26,971
I don't know. Just go home.

227
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:28,331
I have to go now.

228
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:29,451
- Be careful, Peilan.
- Careful.

229
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,331
Why do you keep doing this?

230
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:33,492
Listen. It will be 60 guan next time.

231
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:43,091
Hello, my friend. You look quite noble.

232
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,892
But your look shows a bad omen.

233
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:49,772
I'm afraid
you'll be in serious trouble soon.

234
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,132
You think you can bully us?

235
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,892
Why did you hit me?

236
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:57,372
Under the broad daylight...

237
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:01,012
I'm reporting you to the officials.

238
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,731
You hooligans. Don't mess with me.

239
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,252
Please spare my life.

240
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,772
Tell me. What misfortune do we have?

241
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:14,691
Nothing.

242
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:17,451
I made it up. It's how I make a living.

243
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:19,331
This is the first day

244
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,772
I bring my buddies

245
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,691
to do justice in Jianglin.

246
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:24,252
You're really unlucky.

247
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,372
Yeah.

248
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,372
Remember my face.

249
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,892
- I'm the Heroine in Jianglin.
- Respect.

250
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:33,252
- He's the Knight of Qing City.
- Enough.

251
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:34,331
He's the Knight of West Lake.

252
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,081
- Enough.
- Got it?

253
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:35,611
Right.

254
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:36,731
- I'm sure he will.
- Respect.

255
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,372
What's your problem?

256
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:47,811
I thought you'd marry well

257
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,012
once we moved to Jianglin.

258
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,492
But I underestimated the situation.

259
00:12:55,652 --> 00:13:00,331
Mother, have you heard
a guy crying these days?

260
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,931
You heard it too?

261
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,971
I thought
our next-door neighbor was sad.

262
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,611
But the sound is not from there.

263
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:10,611
Banxia, do you think
there's something evil

264
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:11,892
in this mansion?

265
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,772
Confucious doesn't believe in
superstition. You're too sensitive.

266
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,451
Don't eat those. They're not edible.

267
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:23,172
Mother, I'm back.
You were looking for me?

268
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:24,811
No, I wasn't.

269
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,012
But Keling said you were.

270
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:27,691
Oh right, Peilan, listen.

271
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:29,132
Don't eat buns here

272
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:31,012
and in the kitchen. They're poisoned.

273
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,372
I'll get you some buns. Stay in here.

274
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,336
Okay.

275
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:36,971
Are you serious?

276
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:40,091
You may get us killed.

277
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:50,091
Mr. Lu, keep it down.

278
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:52,412
W-What's happening to me?

279
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:56,571
The bun is poisoned.

280
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:02,331
Mr. Lu!

281
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,691
Mr. Lu.

282
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:16,772
Mr. Lu, you finally woke up.
How are you feeling?

283
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:23,331
Why would the bun be poisoned?

284
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:28,252
Well, you broke a bowl earlier.

285
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:30,091
I told them there was a mouse.

286
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:31,451
I didn't know they'd poison

287
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,731
the buns and you'd eat those.

288
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:41,252
I shouldn't have left the mountain.
This is karma.

289
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:43,772
Mr. Lu, don't say that.

290
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:45,132
It's all my fault.

291
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:49,691
Never mind. How's it going out there?

292
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:52,451
Not so good. Someone is looking for you.

293
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:57,691
For real? I'd better leave.

294
00:14:58,052 --> 00:14:59,571
Mr. Lu, you...

295
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:02,012
Where are you going? Easy.

296
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:06,851
I-I want to hide somewhere else.

297
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:09,811
I don't get along with you people.

298
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:11,931
Mr. Lu.

299
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:13,772
Don't be superstitious.

300
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:15,292
It's really dangerous out there.

301
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,892
You shouldn't take any risks.

302
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:24,331
I made bean soup for detoxification.

303
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:25,372
And I added sugar.

304
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,492
No need. Thanks.

305
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,091
I tried it. It's sugar for sure.

306
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:31,012
I'm not thirsty. Thanks.

307
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:36,731
Then let me cool you down.

308
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:41,172
Enough. It's a bit chilly.

309
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,331
Chilly? I see.

310
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,372
Then I'll get you a gown.

311
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,851
Okay, go ahead.

312
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:53,132
Come on in, Mr. Lu.

313
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,132
Why are we back in the kitchen?

314
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,331
Mr. Lu, I think you should stay with me.

315
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:00,611
It's too risky to be alone. Come here.

316
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:04,851
Sit here. Be careful.

317
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:07,451
Who's in there?

318
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:09,571
It's me.

319
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:10,892
What are you doing?

320
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:12,451
Just a second, Mother.

321
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,971
Mother.

322
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:16,892
Why are you so flustered?

323
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:18,772
Why did you close the door?

324
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,412
I wanted to keep the mice out.

325
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,451
Mice? In here?

326
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:26,772
What's that sound?

327
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:28,492
What? I didn't hear anything.

328
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:29,492
No.

329
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:31,492
I heard something around the wood.

330
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:35,012
The wood? The mouse may have
gotten in between the wood.

331
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,571
Annoying mouse!

332
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:44,772
What are you doing?

333
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:45,892
Step aside.

334
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,451
Mother, don't get hurt.

335
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:49,892
- I'm okay.
- Someone's at the door.

336
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:53,012
- I didn't hear anything.
- But I did.

337
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,211
It's urgent. Go and take a look.

338
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:59,611
Where is everyone? I knew it.
I can't count on anyone.

339
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,371
I'll come back for this.

340
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:18,292
Mr. Lu, your shoulder.

341
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:30,052
Mr. Lu.

342
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:31,252
Give me another chance.

343
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,252
I swear I'll find you

344
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,571
a safe place to hide.

345
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:34,692
You won't get hurt again.

346
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:36,052
Mr. Lu...

347
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:38,452
Calm down. Where are you going?

348
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:40,692
I'm turning myself in. I want to live.

349
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,492
Mr. Lu, calm down.

350
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:44,331
You'd be dead if you go out.

351
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,292
I'm calmer than ever.

352
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,212
Please let me go.

353
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,012
I can't stay any longer.

354
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:54,492
My fingers are broken and I'm stabbed.

355
00:17:54,851 --> 00:17:57,052
I'm dizzy and having diarrhea.

356
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,052
Let me go.

357
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:01,611
Mr. Lu, I'll take good care of you.

358
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,571
No, please don't say that again.

359
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:06,891
I get hurt whenever you say that.

360
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,252
Thank you for everything.

361
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:15,292
Who are you?

362
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,851
Mother.

363
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:20,252
How did a beggar get in?

364
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,532
You opened up for him?

365
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:23,611
I'm not a beggar.

366
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:25,171
Right, he's not a beggar.

367
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:26,972
Not a beggar? So who is he?

368
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:31,932
He's applying to be our servant.

369
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:35,411
A servant? How can we afford him?

370
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:36,331
He doesn't want money.

371
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:37,891
So what does he want?

372
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:39,212
Just a place to stay.

373
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,732
We don't have a place for him.

374
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:41,732
The woodshed.

375
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:43,371
The woodshed?

376
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:44,932
It's not livable.

377
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:47,972
What's your expertise?

378
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:50,811
- I...
- He knows martial arts.

379
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,212
How's that useful? Get him out.

380
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,252
Mother.

381
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,532
Alright, Miss.

382
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:59,932
Let me go.

383
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,252
Mr. Lu.

384
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:21,411
Madam, I can play chess.

385
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,131
Get out now.

386
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,012
I'm quite good at it.

387
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:25,891
Banxia, get the officials.

388
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:27,891
Mother, don't.

389
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,292
Show him mercy.

390
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,292
Look at him.

391
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:34,091
He's not going to survive out there.

392
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,371
Banxia.

393
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:37,056
Mother.

394
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,692
Then show me some mercy.

395
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:43,052
What do you mean?

396
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:47,012
It's a big mansion with many residents.

397
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:49,492
I can't manage all the work.

398
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:50,972
I need a helper.

399
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:54,452
Madam.

400
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:57,171
Let me help her.

401
00:20:05,452 --> 00:20:08,692
I've never asked you for anything.

402
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:11,972
But I haven't been myself these days.

403
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:15,331
I feel weak and I'm forgetting things.

404
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,452
I may fall sick if I go on like this.

405
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:20,571
Really?

406
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:26,411
- W-Why didn't you tell me earlier?
- Mother.

407
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,131
You're from Lu's Manor?

408
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,091
You've been a servant, right?

409
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:41,088
Yes.

410
00:20:42,212 --> 00:20:44,171
What happened to your hands?

411
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,571
T-They got hurt from the door.

412
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,772
Why are your clothes so ragged?

413
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,532
I cut them while peeling fruits.

414
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,012
So clumsy.

415
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,772
You sure you don't want money?

416
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,891
Yeah, I only need a place to stay.

417
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:14,772
Mother, where do we get
a servant like him?

418
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:20,851
Let's start with a three-day trial.

419
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:22,452
Say thank you to my mother.

420
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:25,052
Thank you, Mother.

421
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,171
Thank you, Madam.

422
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,692
Mother.

423
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,611
Come here.

424
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:05,411
Do you hear someone crying?

425
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,212
Listen.

426
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,932
Well, let me check.

427
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,532
Why would you go?

428
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:17,292
Where is that martial artist?
Let him check.

429
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,732
I...

430
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:20,416
Go.

431
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:29,012
Peilan, is that guy here for revenge?

432
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:30,331
Don't be paranoid, Mr. Lu.

433
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:31,851
Go ahead.

434
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,532
You know martial arts, right?

435
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:37,371
Well, I'll go.

436
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:39,052
Why would you go?

437
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,571
Isn't he the servant here?

438
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:41,972
Why should I hire someone

439
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:45,024
who can't answer the door? Go ahead.

440
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:58,331
I stabbed a ghost!

441
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,052
- It's you!
- It's you!

442
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,352
Who is it?

443
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:10,692
Yeah, it's me.

444
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:14,012
(Guo Zhensheng, 50, Doctor
Gentle and timid)

445
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:16,012
Master, why didn't you

446
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:17,532
give us a heads-up?

447
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:20,772
I just wanted to visit you

448
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:23,611
and didn't want to bother you.

449
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:27,091
Thankfully, you only got scratched.

450
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:30,492
Just come in next time.

451
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:32,012
Don't be so sneaky.

452
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,411
Sir.

453
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:37,411
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

454
00:23:37,452 --> 00:23:39,492
I get it even if you did it on purpose.

455
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:41,052
It's okay.

456
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,131
Who are you?

457
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,732
Our new servant.

458
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:50,692
How nice. You have a servant now.

459
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:53,532
Sir, have a cup of tea.

460
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:55,131
- Thanks.
- Here.

461
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:58,532
I'm sorry.

462
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,131
- Let go.
- Sorry, Master.

463
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:01,091
- I'll get another.
- Sorry.

464
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:03,571
Let's go, Mr. Lu.

465
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:04,891
Sorry.

466
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:05,732
It's fine, Mr. Lu.

467
00:24:05,732 --> 00:24:06,732
He's your Master?

468
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,532
Mr. Lu, don't offend
my mother these days.

469
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:11,571
She won't be in a good mood. Let's go.

470
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:15,732
Why did he come here?

471
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:16,772
What does he want?

472
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,891
Please calm down, okay?

473
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:22,811
You borrowed money from him after all.

474
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:24,851
I knew we shouldn't have done so.

475
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:27,371
See? We just moved here.

476
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,371
And the debt collector followed us here.

477
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:31,532
We did what we did.

478
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,012
What's the point of saying that?

479
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:35,292
Besides, he may not
be here to collect the debt.

480
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:36,811
I don't care why he's here.

481
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,411
I'm sure he's up to something.

482
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,972
Master, how have you been in Qing City?

483
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:45,131
Everything's good.

484
00:24:45,131 --> 00:24:47,212
Jianglin is so boring.

485
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:48,932
Maybe I can follow you back,

486
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:50,932
and keep working in your pharmacy.

487
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:53,972
The pharmacy is gone.

488
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:55,651
What does that mean?

489
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:57,131
I sold it.

490
00:24:57,811 --> 00:24:58,651
You sold it?

491
00:24:58,651 --> 00:24:59,651
Guo Zhensheng.

492
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,171
Why are you telling Banxia all this?

493
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:03,772
You thought you lent us money

494
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:05,891
and that made us even?

495
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:07,811
I didn't say...

496
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:09,532
Master, you lent us money?

497
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:14,252
Is that why you sold the pharmacy?

498
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:20,212
He lent us the money for this mansion?

499
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,532
Are you happy now, Guo Zhensheng?

500
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:23,811
I didn't say anything.

501
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,252
Master, did you
sell the pharmacy for my mother

502
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:27,571
to buy this mansion?

503
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:32,492
I wanted a new life.

504
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,532
I knew it.

505
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,012
We didn't have the money
for such a mansion.

506
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:37,532
So Master paid for this.

507
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:41,331
Not really. It's only 100 taels.

508
00:25:41,651 --> 00:25:43,171
Your pharmacy was worth 100 taels?

509
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:46,732
I sold my mansion as well.

510
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,052
- Guo Zhensheng.
- Banxia.

511
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,692
I was willing to do that.

512
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:51,212
Why are you defending my mother?

513
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:52,411
Let's speak honestly.

514
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:54,131
I borrowed money. I will pay you back.

515
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:55,851
But I want you to leave right now!

516
00:25:55,932 --> 00:25:57,252
Mother, let's speak honestly.

517
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:59,171
We couldn't have
bought this mansion without him.

518
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:00,811
In the end, he has a share.

519
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,571
This is not how facts work. Right?

520
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:05,171
I don't know.

521
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:10,171
- I...
- Shut up.

522
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,492
Fine, we're not getting anywhere.

523
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:14,571
See you at the Yamen.

524
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:16,331
Chun Banxia, whose daughter are you?

525
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,492
Change your surname to Guo.

526
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,411
Why are we taking our family to Yamen?

527
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,331
Banxia, we're family. Calm down.

528
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:23,331
Yeah, don't wash
your dirty laundry in public.

529
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:34,972
Mother, why were you hiding the fact

530
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:36,131
that we asked Master for money?

531
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:36,972
You felt guilty?

532
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:38,212
Why would I be guilty?

533
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:39,252
Don't you know

534
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:40,212
what he did to us?

535
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:42,452
Maybe I should leave.

536
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:44,651
No way. Why should you? You're staying.

537
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:45,811
Why should he stay?

538
00:26:45,891 --> 00:26:47,492
Chun Banxia,
are you trying to piss me off?

539
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:48,651
Banxia, that's enough.

540
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:51,611
Ruyu, I'm leaving.

541
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,932
Fine, I'll join you.

542
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:54,331
Go with him if you want to

543
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:55,452
sever your ties with us.

544
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:58,131
Okay, let's calm down.
We can talk things through.

545
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:00,131
It's late. Where can Master stay?

546
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:01,252
Mother, don't be mad.

547
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,171
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

548
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:05,052
Yeah, Mother. Please go to bed.

549
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:06,252
Let's go.

550
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,732
Are you sleepy?

551
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:08,932
Jinrong, give me a hand.

552
00:27:09,532 --> 00:27:11,012
Go get some rest.

553
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:12,212
Go to bed.

554
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,452
Is Ruyu fine?

555
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:22,131
- Master, don't be so distant.
- No, no.

556
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:23,411
- It's nice here.
- Why?

557
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:24,932
- Stay in my room.
- It's nice here.

558
00:27:24,932 --> 00:27:26,131
- It's nice here.
- Go to my room.

559
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:27,012
I'll share Peilan's room.

560
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:28,891
- That's my wound. It's hurting.
- Don't...

561
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:30,292
Excuse me.

562
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,732
Miss Peilan told me to stay here.

563
00:27:32,772 --> 00:27:35,052
Perfect.
I'll share the room with your servant.

564
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:36,692
- Yeah.
- Just go to my room.

565
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:38,772
- I'll share Peilan's room.
- No need. It's okay.

566
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,131
Banxia, don't worry.

567
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:41,732
I got Master a thick quilt.

568
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:43,532
- Thank you.
- Master, I'll lay the bed for you.

569
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,292
The bed is quite tough.

570
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,091
I'll make the quilt fluffy.

571
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:48,571
For you, too.

572
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:55,331
What did I do wrong?

573
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,252
Are we supposed
to be associated with this guy forever?

574
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,932
You're all taking his side.

575
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:03,252
I shouldn't have raised you.

576
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,772
I didn't take his side. I just didn't
want Banxia to report to officials.

577
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,252
I don't care.
It's not like I won't pay him back.

578
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:10,772
Do you even have the money now?

579
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:12,411
So we should let him stay?

580
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,972
I finally bought a mansion.

581
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:17,012
And he came here to stay and enjoy it?

582
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,891
Listen, Chun Jinrong.

583
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:21,692
He's ruined our life once.

584
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:24,212
I won't let him ruin it again.

585
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:28,772
I have an idea.

586
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:31,252
Alright, get some rest.

587
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,692
Tomorrow, I'll ask Master why he's here

588
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:35,571
and whether he wants his money back.

589
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:36,851
Okay? I'll ask him tomorrow.

590
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:38,891
Then we'll see what to do.

591
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:41,212
Kick him out first thing in the morning.

592
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:57,692
Mr. Guo.

593
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:00,932
Why did you give me your quilt?

594
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:04,492
You were fighting for it so much.

595
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:06,732
So I just gave it to you.

596
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:07,732
Sorry.

597
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:09,312
It's alright.

598
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:13,452
Are you fully dressed?

599
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:17,600
Come on in.

600
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:20,252
- Jinrong.
- Master.

601
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:23,052
Did you sleep well?

602
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:24,331
Yeah.

603
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:26,252
- It wasn't cold?
- No...

604
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:29,692
No, no.

605
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:32,292
Lu Buping.

606
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,732
Why aren't you working?

607
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:39,052
I bet he didn't sleep well
with me snoring and grinding my teeth.

608
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,492
She woke me up so early.

609
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:45,811
Wash your face with cold water.
It's good for your health.

610
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:47,772
Don't make that sound.

611
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:55,171
Master, I'm sorry you have to stay here.

612
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:56,252
No problem.

613
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,171
My mother was so...

614
00:29:58,212 --> 00:29:59,811
You know her.

615
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,052
She sounds mean but she's kind.

616
00:30:02,212 --> 00:30:04,292
I totally understand.

617
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:08,772
But Master,

618
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,452
we don't have money to pay you back.

619
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:12,772
That was why my mother

620
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,411
was so anxious last night.

621
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:16,571
I'm not here for money.

622
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,012
I swear.

623
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:21,131
I'm just here to see you.

624
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:23,292
I'm relieved to see you alright.

625
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:26,571
Really? Then you can rest assured.

626
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:27,972
Everything's fine.

627
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:29,052
Okay.

628
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:34,571
You're also fine, right?

629
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:36,212
Yeah.

630
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:38,131
So...

631
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:38,972
What are you doing?

632
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:43,732
I'm checking on Master. Can't you tell?

633
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:48,171
So what's your plan, Master?

634
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:52,452
Master, you don't need a plan.
You're staying with us.

635
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,452
Why are you staring at me?

636
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:57,331
Chun Jinrong, do you think that nobody

637
00:30:57,411 --> 00:30:58,732
can tell what you're plotting?

638
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:00,972
What am I plotting here?

639
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:04,532
What can I plot? Right, Master?

640
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,732
Yeah, she's just here to check on me.

641
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:09,811
Exactly. I did my part. Master...

642
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:11,651
Rest well.

643
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:12,972
Okay.

644
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,292
Mind your own business.

645
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:20,171
Did she ask you for money?

646
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,452
- No.
- You didn't give her any?

647
00:31:21,532 --> 00:31:22,891
She didn't ask me for money.

648
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:24,692
Miss Peilan.

649
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:28,252
Banxia wanted
to report to officials yesterday.

650
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:31,131
Will she do it for real?

651
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:34,571
My mother made a mistake
and missed some taxes when we were kids.

652
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,651
She reported her to the Yamen.

653
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:38,532
She reported your mother?

654
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:40,331
She was just a kid back then.

655
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:41,932
W-What about now?

656
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:43,811
I can't tell for sure.

657
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:46,171
Oh no.

658
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:49,891
I'm curious.

659
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:53,932
Why is your mother
holding a grudge against your master?

660
00:31:56,972 --> 00:31:58,651
We were kids back then.

661
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:06,411
- Senior. Magical herb.
- Magical herb.

662
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:10,131
I've never seen something like this.

663
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:12,411
Of course.

664
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,131
Menglong.

665
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,571
Oh my goodness. How much did he eat?

666
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:23,411
It's your fault.
Why did you offer him magical herb?

667
00:32:23,492 --> 00:32:25,292
He took the herb. I didn't ask him to.

668
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:26,532
What's the point of arguing?

669
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:27,571
Save him first.

670
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:28,972
You...

671
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:29,932
Menglong.

672
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:31,411
Wake up.

673
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,331
Du Ruyu, your husband died.

674
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:35,292
When are you going to pay us back?

675
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:37,692
- When will you pay us back?
- We want our money.

676
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,532
Sister-in-law,
you need to sell the pharmacy

677
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:49,052
for paying the debt.
Drop the price and sell it to me.

678
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:53,131
I'll take care of you girls from now on.

679
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:55,331
You don't know his true nature.

680
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:56,532
What a schemer.

681
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,452
He got the shop
and wanted the widow and girls.

682
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:01,532
Stop gossiping.

683
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:04,212
- Go away.
- Get lost. All of you!

684
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,692
Sister-in-law,
you look so unique when you're angry.

685
00:33:07,692 --> 00:33:10,131
I'm leaving. Goodbye, Senior.

686
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:17,692
Your master was so evil?

687
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:19,891
Not really.

688
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:22,171
It was what Mother told us.

689
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:23,411
Was he really so evil?

690
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,772
Just stay out of it.

691
00:33:25,891 --> 00:33:28,171
Of course. I want nothing to do with it.

692
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:30,692
Just avoid my mother these days.

693
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:33,972
Mother.

694
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,532
Mother, I asked Master.

695
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:39,252
He's not here for money.

696
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:40,772
He just wants to visit us.

697
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,212
Who wants him to visit? Is he gone?

698
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:44,891
Not yet.

699
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:45,932
Why is he still here?

700
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:47,252
I told you to drive him away.

701
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,492
Mother, contain yourself, okay?

702
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:49,772
Am I not containing myself?

703
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:51,131
- Listen to me.
- I don't want to.

704
00:33:52,452 --> 00:33:53,292
Go ahead.

705
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,532
Chun Banxia is super alert.

706
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:57,052
We'd be looking for trouble

707
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:58,532
if we drove Master away now.

708
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:00,891
But if we can give it some time,

709
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,891
Master will leave by himself.

710
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:05,212
Chun Jinrong.

711
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:06,891
Have you guys forgotten

712
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:08,171
how your father died?

713
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:11,651
Would we be in such misery
if it hadn't been for him?

714
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,532
Contain yourself. Mother.

715
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:16,412
Contain yourself.

716
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:19,332
Drive him away!

717
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:20,932
- Mother.
- No, drive him away.

718
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:21,892
Tell him I said so.

719
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:23,171
How do I tell him that?

720
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,412
What's the problem?

721
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,211
- I can't.
- So you won't?

722
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:27,412
Fine, you won't?

723
00:34:27,452 --> 00:34:28,532
Mother.

724
00:34:29,731 --> 00:34:31,040
You do it.

725
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,372
Me?

726
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:33,372
You want to stay?

727
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:35,171
Kick him out and you can stay.

728
00:34:37,372 --> 00:34:39,611
Am I the person for this job?

729
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,016
You got this.

730
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:45,920
Master, I need a place to stay.
There's nothing I can do.

731
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,932
I understand.

732
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:48,131
Look at my fingers.

733
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,372
Don't give me a hard time.

734
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:51,452
Should I examine your hands first?

735
00:34:51,691 --> 00:34:53,131
No need. Let's not waste time.

736
00:34:53,812 --> 00:34:55,812
You ruined her family.

737
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,492
I ruined her family?

738
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,812
Ruyu told you that?

739
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,492
That's not true. Back then...

740
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,412
Senior.

741
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:11,372
- Magical herb.
- Magical herb.

742
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:14,611
I've never seen something like this.

743
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:19,852
Yeah, Senior.
It's an unknown herb. Be very careful.

744
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:25,052
Menglong.

745
00:35:26,052 --> 00:35:27,532
Senior.

746
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,731
It's your fault.
Why did you offer him magical herb?

747
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,892
Menglong, wake up.

748
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:38,291
Wake up, Menglong.

749
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:40,412
Du Ruyu, your husband died.

750
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:41,932
When are you going to pay us back?

751
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,452
- Pay us back.
- We need money.

752
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:45,131
I'll pay you back.

753
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,611
What a nice guy.

754
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:49,291
He took on his senior's debt.

755
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:52,532
Does he also intend to
take in his sister-in-law?

756
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,131
You... You'd better watch your mouth.

757
00:35:58,251 --> 00:36:01,291
Sister-in-law, you need to
sell the pharmacy for paying the debt.

758
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,571
Sell it to me.

759
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:05,052
I'll pay you more.

760
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,852
Pay the debt and you'll have

761
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:08,852
enough money for a good life.

762
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:19,532
Why did you bring him poisonous herbs?

763
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:20,932
You don't get it.

764
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,372
The "Formulas from Benevolent Sages"

765
00:36:23,412 --> 00:36:26,091
consists of 100 volumes, 1670 sections,

766
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:29,611
and 16834 remedies.

767
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:31,611
Our ancestor has tried all of them.

768
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:33,651
He tasted so much cattle manure

769
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,012
and finally discovered bezoar.

770
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:36,492
Senior carried on such a spirit.

771
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:39,492
He took a step forward
in the critical moment and ended up...

772
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:46,852
I wish I was the one who tasted it.

773
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,812
Master, when are you leaving?

774
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:52,532
There's the gate.

775
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,691
Almost there. We're almost there.

776
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:55,812
- What's going on?
- Master...

777
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:05,852
Master, this way. Let me walk you out.

778
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:08,492
How dare you push him?

779
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:10,731
No, Mrs. Chun...

780
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,052
Go tell Mrs. Chun.

781
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:13,492
Master is not going anywhere.

782
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,731
- Banxia.
- W-Why don't you talk to Mrs. Chun...

783
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:23,872
F-Fine.

784
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:25,452
Did he bully you?

785
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:27,012
No, no.
