Young Lord.

36
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,482
You drank too much yesterday.

37
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:25,841
I had the kitchen
make some congee for you.

38
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:28,681
Tengyun, I remember

39
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,121
we went to my mansion yesterday.

40
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:35,328
And we met Jinrong's mother.

41
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:38,801
I also overdrank last night.

42
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:42,121
But I think the guards carried us back

43
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:43,680
from Young Lord's Mansion.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,968
What's wrong, Young Lord?

45
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:50,176
Nothing.

46
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:51,681
How are Jinrong and the others?

47
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:54,202
What could happen to them?

48
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:55,801
Okay.

49
00:02:57,082 --> 00:03:00,202
Tengyun, thank you
for celebrating my birthday.

50
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:03,922
Why thank me all of a sudden?

51
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:06,322
It's nothing. That is what I should do.

52
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,362
Well, Young Lord, have some congee.

53
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:09,216
Fine.

00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,082
Xiaoxiao,

58
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:53,841
do I look a little underdressed today?

59
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:55,602
I'll go back and change my clothes.

60
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,832
I'll be right back.

61
00:03:57,642 --> 00:03:59,488
You look noble and beautiful.

62
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:00,512
Let's go.

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,362
Why is it a Product Appraisal again?

64
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:08,721
Just accompany me. It's fun.

65
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,721
No, I won't go. I won't.

66
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:12,992
What's wrong? What happened?

67
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:14,304
My stomach...

68
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:16,161
No.

69
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:18,322
It's just that you asked me out

70
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:20,361
in such a hurry today.

71
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:23,642
I didn't bring any money.

72
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:25,082
I have money. I'll pay.

73
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:26,752
That's not appropriate.

74
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,864
Why are they all looking at me?

75
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:36,161
You are now a celebrity.

76
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:37,961
Everyone knows you are
Young Lord's girlfriend.

77
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,104
Young Lord's girlfriend?

78
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:41,376
- Who said that?
- I did.

79
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:44,802
No.

80
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,242
The main thing is

81
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,601
that we aren't official yet.

82
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,672
Is this appropriate?

83
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:49,888
Didn't you already kiss?

84
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,360
Who said so?

85
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,002
Miss Jinrong, nice to meet you.

86
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:57,802
Mrs. Li.

87
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,082
Nice to meet you.

88
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:00,122
Miss Jinrong,

89
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,601
please sit next to Madam Wu.

90
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,002
Who is Madam Wu?

91
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,161
The wealthiest man's wife in Jianglin.

92
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:06,882
She's popular.

93
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,642
She is the core figure in our circle.

94
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:10,202
Top buyer at all major
Product Appraisals.

95
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,721
Only the super stars

96
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:13,041
can sit with her.

97
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,721
Me? Is it appropriate?

98
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:16,562
Of course.

99
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:17,721
You are Young Lord's woman.

100
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,008
If you don't sit there, who will? Go.

101
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:20,401
Miss Jinrong, please.

102
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:25,728
(Treasure)

103
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,361
Madam Wu, nice to meet you.

104
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:34,361
Likewise.

105
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:39,401
Who will ring the bell today?

106
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:40,640
Ring the bell?

107
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:41,984
The rule.

108
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:44,281
Before the Product Appraisals begin,

109
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:46,322
the person with the highest status
rings the bell.

110
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:48,882
Then,

111
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,721
let Jinrong do it.

112
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,642
At least pretend to refuse it.

113
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,122
She asked.

114
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:00,882
Just a bell. What's the big deal?

115
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,882
Ladies,

116
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,281
hello.

117
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:08,322
My dearest Madam Wu.

118
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:11,041
Friends,

119
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,281
let's welcome our new friend,

120
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,122
dear Miss Jinrong from Chun's Mansion.

121
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:20,512
Thank you.

122
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,112
(Young Lord's Mansion)

123
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:24,608
Have you heard?

124
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,202
This family embarrassed
themselves last night.

125
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,562
A bunch of people got drunk

126
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,082
and started dancing in the street.

127
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:33,961
The widow and her daughters

128
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:36,122
must be something

129
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,082
- to live in Young Lord's Mansion.
- Right.

130
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:38,921
And that steward.

131
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,041
This family is really interesting.

132
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:44,802
This old man

133
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:47,041
and that widow
seem to have something going on.

134
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:48,521
Yes, him.

135
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,601
You two.

136
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:53,921
What's wrong?

137
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:55,682
Nothing.

138
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:56,601
Sedan chair?

139
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:58,002
No.

140
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,041
You two are spreading rumors.

141
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:06,762
If this happens again,

142
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,401
I can report you.

143
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,721
Next, it is

144
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:16,281
our Treasure time.

145
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:17,882
In search of treasures,

146
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:21,841
I have traveled all over the world

147
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:25,481
and finally found
this unparalleled delicacy.

148
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:35,161
Blue cheese from the Abbasid Caliphate.

149
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:37,921
The jade-like pattern

150
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:40,721
is embedded in this soft cheese,

151
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:45,202
which exudes a lingering
and mysterious fragrance.

152
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:47,361
One bite. Just one bite.

153
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,802
Only one bite gets you.

154
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:55,041
It smells so good.

155
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:58,242
Isn't there a spoon?

156
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,682
If you lack a spoon,

157
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,082
I can send you a few golden spoons.

158
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:06,682
Why is she so arrogant?

159
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,401
Madam Wu, you may not know

160
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:10,841
that this kind of delicacy

161
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:14,082
must be tasted like this
with your fingers.

162
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,841
The temperature of our fingers

163
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:19,481
can make its texture even softer.

164
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:20,882
This is the key.

165
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:30,161
It's indeed a delicacy
from the Abbasid Caliphate.

166
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,041
Ten portions.

167
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:34,442
Madam Wu,

168
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:36,402
I haven't quoted the price yet.

169
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,202
I'm sorry. I forgot again.

170
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:41,361
Everyone, look.

171
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,601
To bring convenience for traveling

172
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:44,322
or to gift friends,

173
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,562
we packed the cheese

174
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,442
into individual portions.

175
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,761
Each portion

176
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:50,402
is twenty taels.

177
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,322
Then I want twenty portions.

178
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,721
Madam Wu, it is a treasure.

179
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:59,601
I only have thirty portions in total.

180
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,442
I also want one.

181
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:02,481
- Okay.
- I want one too.

182
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:02,881
Okay.

183
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:03,601
One for me too.

184
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,721
Hurry up and pack them.

185
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,001
What are they thinking?

186
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:08,721
Doesn't it stink?

187
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:09,568
I think so too.

188
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:11,360
Miss Jinrong.

189
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,121
Don't you want one?

190
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:15,961
I'll pass.

191
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:18,961
I'm not quite used to it.

192
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:23,162
I didn't expect that
at the Product Appraisal,

193
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:26,082
there would be people
who can't appreciate your selection.

194
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,562
It is a delicacy treasure.

195
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,761
It takes a while
to get used to the taste.

196
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:32,721
It's alright.

197
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,042
It's understandable.

198
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:34,721
Understandable.

199
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,202
However, Miss Jinrong,

200
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,202
sitting next to me,

201
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:41,601
you have to learn to
accept some new things.

202
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,104
Yes.

203
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,721
I mainly don't want to
make my hands smell so bad.

204
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,481
Madam Wu, it doesn't smell.

205
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:50,481
It is delicious.

206
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:51,481
This...

207
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:53,082
Look. Smells good.

208
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:57,152
Smells good, right?

209
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,402
These two men

210
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:05,481
gossiped like country women.

211
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:06,688
Embarrassing.

212
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:08,241
My temperament.

213
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:10,481
My temperament is gone.

214
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:13,601
I have failed my master.

215
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,912
Buping.

216
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,442
Earlier at the gate,

217
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,682
I saw a few people gossiping.

218
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:24,082
It's my fault.

219
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:26,082
I brought shame to the Chuns.

220
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,241
Maybe, uh, those gossipy men

221
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:33,202
got the wrong ones, right?

222
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:33,961
Just forget it.

223
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:35,082
Be magnanimous as a man.

224
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,442
Master, yesterday's incident
was really embarrassing.

225
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:41,841
Just go check it.

226
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,961
Everyone is off today.

227
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:51,881
How embarrassing could it be?

228
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,728
(In Memory of Mr. Chun)

229
00:10:57,881 --> 00:10:58,241
Father,

230
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:01,322
are you doing well over there?

231
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:05,682
I miss you so much.

232
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:18,841
Peilan, it's me.

233
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:21,280
Master.

234
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,202
(Master, yesterday's incident
was really embarrassing.)

235
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:35,121
(Just go check it.)

236
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,121
(Everyone is off today.)

237
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:44,601
Peilan.

238
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:47,562
You've grown up.

239
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,922
For some things,
you have to let them go.

240
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:52,922
I don't think you should

241
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:55,282
overthink it.

242
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:57,641
It's not important at all.

243
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,282
What are you talking about, Master?

244
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:04,481
Time will heal.

245
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,761
But I really miss my father.

246
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,361
Missing your father is natural.

247
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:14,162
Your father would also
want you to be stronger, right?

248
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,241
It's completely nothing.

249
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:25,802
Master,

250
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:28,442
you weren't like this before.

251
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,361
When people go through a lot of things,

252
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:33,641
they naturally change.

253
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:40,922
It's getting late.

254
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:41,761
Time to cook.

255
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,082
Today, I will cook.

256
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,608
I'll call you when I'm done.

257
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:49,121
Stay with your father for a while.

258
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,202
Rose ancient soap from Persia.

259
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,241
Isn't that just a soap?

260
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:02,961
This kind of rose ancient soap

261
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:06,241
must be stored for more than ten years.

262
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:07,841
Bathing with it,

263
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:11,241
it can leave a lasting scent,
and repel mosquitoes and roaches.

264
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,322
Most importantly,

265
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,082
it can lighten the skin.

266
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,601
I've only used it once. Look.

267
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,552
Thirty pieces.

268
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,322
Can she use them all?

269
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:25,601
Don't you want it?

270
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,688
- I want it.
- I want a piece.

271
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:27,641
- I want a piece.
- Me too.

272
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,320
Okay.

273
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,408
I want two pieces.

274
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:31,961
Okay.

275
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,376
Why does she always
ask others to purchase?

276
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:36,608
Is she getting commission from Qi Jiali?

277
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,912
In such a situation, if few people buy,

278
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:40,448
the host will feel embarrassed.

279
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:42,481
Today's gathering was organized by her?

280
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:44,042
No, but she is Madam Wu.

281
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:45,802
Miss Jinrong,

282
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:47,001
won't you take one?

283
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,402
For someone sitting in this position,

284
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:54,961
even if they don't like it,

285
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,641
they should set an example, right?

286
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,784
Miss Jinrong,

287
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,481
today,

288
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:03,042
you have eaten and drunk.

289
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,082
Are you out of money?

290
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,601
How could that be?

291
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:11,322
Well,

292
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:12,841
for that

293
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:14,802
smelly cheese from before,

294
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:15,721
I-I'll have a piece too.

295
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,202
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:18,400
That's already sold out.

297
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:21,481
Such a pity.

298
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,162
Next time, then.

299
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:26,562
Rumor has it that you and Young Lord...

300
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,481
Seems like it's just a hoax.

301
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:32,322
What do you mean?

302
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:34,442
I hope

303
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,121
the threshold of our circle

304
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:37,282
could be higher.

305
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:39,481
Otherwise, it doesn't mean much

306
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:40,961
if anyone can join.

307
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:43,682
Madam Wu,

308
00:14:44,202 --> 00:14:45,442
it's Jinrong's first time here.

309
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:47,682
She's not used to it yet.

310
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,841
She doesn't mean anything else.

311
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,121
Xiaoxiao,

312
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,442
maybe I should go home now.

313
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,042
Jinrong, don't.

314
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:57,202
Seems like I'm the ignorant one.

315
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,241
No one ever left

316
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:01,162
the Product Appraisal empty-handed.

317
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,721
If you're really
Young Lord's girlfriend,

318
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,481
it's quite embarrassing then.

319
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:11,552
Don't be angry.

320
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,322
I would spend money

321
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:16,601
if there were anything I like.

322
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,322
By the way, Madam Wu,

323
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:19,841
go wash your hands.

324
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:21,442
You stink.

325
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,961
Who do you think you are?

326
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,481
Don't think becoming Young Lord's girl

327
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,202
makes you special.

328
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,042
That's right.

329
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:32,481
I am Young Lord's girlfriend.

330
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,082
I am indeed special.

331
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:36,322
Even if I'm not Young Lord's girlfriend,

332
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:37,922
I'm still special.

333
00:15:39,082 --> 00:15:39,442
Ladies,

334
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:42,001
I have something important to do,

335
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:42,922
so I'll excuse myself.

336
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:44,202
Nice meeting you.

337
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:45,721
( Treasure)
Wait, Jinrong.

338
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,872
Madam Wu.

339
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:48,721
Jinrong...

340
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:50,841
She doesn't know anything, Madam Wu.

341
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:52,601
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

342
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:53,682
Jinrong.

343
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:55,961
Is she disrespecting me?

344
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:57,682
- No.
- No.

345
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,442
The Product Appraisal is not a big deal.

346
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,442
Isn't it just about some weird stuff

347
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:03,001
and some odd people?

348
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:04,361
After your talk with Madam Wu,

349
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:05,922
how am I supposed to hang out with them?

350
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,162
What's so great about this circle?

351
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:08,641
Sure. You have Young Lord.

352
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:09,682
You have to look out for me

353
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:10,442
if I can't fit in.

354
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,202
Miss Jinrong.

355
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:13,922
Mr. Li.

356
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:15,802
Young Lord asks for you.

357
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:17,056
Me?

358
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,202
I didn't expect
even the energetic Keling to be...

359
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:28,961
It seems that yesterday's incident

360
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,202
hurt them quite a bit.

361
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:38,080
Keling.

362
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:39,682
Didn't you go out today?

363
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,442
Master, I'm not going out today.

364
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,721
Do you want to compete with me?

365
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:46,881
Compete?

366
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:54,082
Come on.

367
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:55,202
Let's play it.

368
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,402
Master, must you play today?

369
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,442
I just want to play it today.

370
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:01,601
Come on. A couple of rounds. Hurry up.

371
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,042
I don't want to play with you today.

372
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:04,322
Plus, you can't play it.

373
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:05,962
Can't I?

374
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:07,322
I have skills.

375
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,401
Look at me.

376
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:09,641
You say I can't.

377
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:10,082
Hurry up.

378
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:11,082
Stop it, Master.

379
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,441
Mother will scold you again.

380
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:20,681
I didn't expect this matter

381
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:22,641
to hit you all so hard.

382
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:26,304
Actually,

383
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:28,064
those things

384
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,072
are not a big deal, right?

385
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,824
Don't be discouraged because of it.

386
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,168
It's not necessary.

387
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,002
Master, actually I'm fine.

388
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:40,841
Anyway, I'm still young

389
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:42,161
and I don't remember those things.

390
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,082
It's just my mother and my sisters.
They're a little...

391
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:47,648
Anyway, you don't need to
worry too much about me.

392
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:52,512
You've grown up

393
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:53,984
and become sensible.

394
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:56,161
Don't worry. No matter what happens,

395
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,161
I will always be your strong backup.

396
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:01,401
Master, you go do your thing.

397
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,121
I'm really fine.

398
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,002
At times like this,

399
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:06,121
you should learn more from Banxia.

400
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:07,641
Look at her.

401
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,161
She still acts

402
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,361
calm.

403
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:15,322
Master, why don't you go
check on her first?

404
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,954
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

405
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:34,208
Serve.

406
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:43,136
Retreat.

407
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,440
Miss Jinrong,

408
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,601
I heard

409
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:54,002
you're telling people
that you're my girlfriend.

410
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,002
I didn't say that.

411
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:02,762
Others spread it that way.

412
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,361
I also heard

413
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:08,042
you told others that we had done it.

414
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:09,881
Done what?

415
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:14,592
Step down.

416
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:16,768
- Yes.
- Yes.

417
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:21,322
Well.

418
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,504
What do you mean?

419
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:33,082
Did you call me here to question me?

420
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:35,482
Miss Jinrong, please.

421
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,962
Next time something like this happens,

422
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:38,482
can you discuss it with me?

423
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:39,601
What are you thinking?

424
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:41,121
I-I...

425
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,601
Wait. What are you really thinking?

426
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:46,802
I find you quite strange.

427
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:48,841
That day, it was clearly you
who initiated it.

428
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,841
Why are you always
nice for a while and then bad?

429
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:54,121
Can't you be a little more stable?

430
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,361
W-Who initiated it?

431
00:19:57,921 --> 00:20:00,042
I just wanted to
get a jug of wine that day.

432
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,121
Who knew you would come up

433
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:01,681
and peck me?

434
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:02,601
I was also stunned.

435
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,082
Then you went out and spread rumors.

436
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:06,401
Yeah, I pecked you.

437
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:09,121
But you didn't stop me.

438
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,121
Are you refusing to admit it

439
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:14,841
after you took advantage?

440
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,841
Fine.

441
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,201
But you know what,

442
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:21,042
when the word got out,

443
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:24,121
it's bad for me.

444
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:26,322
I haven't even married yet.

445
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:27,762
It's not good for me either.

446
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,121
You really have...

447
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:33,161
Are you blaming me?

448
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,120
No.

449
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,401
I'm talking about the seriousness of it.

450
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:41,082
- It...
- You know it's serious now?

451
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,482
What were you doing earlier?

452
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,681
The one who wanted to
be friends with me was you.

453
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,082
The one who drank with me was also you.

454
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,002
The one who chased me home was you.

455
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:51,201
- No
- Fine.

456
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:53,242
The rumors outside
were all said by me. Is that okay?

457
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:55,161
I take responsibility
for the words I have said.

458
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:55,722
What about you?

459
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,401
Can you take responsibility
for what you did?

460
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:00,121
You mean what I did to you?

461
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,408
There's no need.

462
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,802
Today, I finally see clearly

463
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,361
what kind of man you really are.

464
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:06,282
With you?

465
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:07,482
It's not worth it.

466
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:08,601
No, it isn't right.

467
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:09,641
No.

468
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:10,681
It doesn't feel right.

469
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:12,361
Why are you angry?

470
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:13,962
This makes me very passive.

471
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:14,762
Don't worry.

472
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:16,121
No matter who asks me,

473
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:18,361
I'll say there's nothing between us.

474
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:19,921
We have drawn a clear line.

475
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:21,042
No.

476
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,841
We don't know each other at all. Oh, my.

477
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:24,881
No, no.

478
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,361
What did I say? I-I...

479
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:28,042
Jinrong, what I mean is...

480
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,042
Never meet again.

481
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,712
Jinrong, come back.

482
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:32,681
I haven't finished yet.

483
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,082
I didn't mean that.

484
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:36,962
What?

485
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:53,152
Banxia.

486
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,921
Melancholic, I see.

487
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,641
Is it necessary?

488
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,024
Master, why are you here?

489
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,641
Is this a big deal?

490
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:11,641
Isn't it a bit too much
for you to laugh like this?

491
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:17,002
I know you're upset.

492
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:18,322
I can understand.

493
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:20,042
How should I put it? Well.

494
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:22,002
You're taking it too seriously.

495
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:27,121
I mainly feel sorry for my mother.

496
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:33,161
A single woman raising four children.

497
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:38,322
Banxia is right.

498
00:22:41,802 --> 00:22:42,802
I know.

499
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:43,601
Banxia,

500
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:46,762
you're a child
with a strong sense of self-esteem, no?

501
00:22:47,121 --> 00:22:48,641
You take some things very seriously,

502
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,601
but in the eyes of others,

503
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:53,088
they're as light as a feather.

504
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:55,601
It's nothing.

505
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:58,042
Let bygones be bygones.

506
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:00,802
What do you really want from me?

507
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:02,042
If you have nothing else,

508
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:02,880
please hurry...

509
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:04,864
I know.

510
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,680
It's all my fault.

511
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,601
If I were there,

512
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,232
I would never let it happen.

513
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:13,562
What are you talking about?

514
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:16,641
- I just want to...
- Alright, Master.

515
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:17,722
I know you've been kind to us

516
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:19,264
since we were little.

517
00:23:19,872 --> 00:23:21,120
Nobody wants it to happen.

518
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,208
I understand.

519
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:23,616
If you can think like this,

520
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,632
I am relieved.

521
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:29,002
Where is Jinrong?

522
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,680
She's out.

523
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,522
So, she is the most open-minded one.

524
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:38,272
Very good.

525
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:39,601
On this matter,

526
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:42,042
you can learn from Jinrong.

527
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:48,562
Being alone sometimes
is a good cure for troubling matters.

528
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:49,722
I'll go for a walk. You stay.

529
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:51,328
Call me if you need me.

530
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,161
This old man.

531
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,681
It's clearly her fault,

532
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:05,881
yet she still seems reasonable.

533
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:09,121
Young Lord, don't be angry.

534
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:11,601
She's wrong and I can't criticize her?

535
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:13,562
Anyway, both of you

536
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:14,881
have already drawn clear lines.

537
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,401
Why are you so angry?

538
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:18,401
Draw a clear line?

539
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:19,601
It's not that easy.

540
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,361
You go and bring her back.

541
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:23,282
Look.

542
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:24,361
I didn't perform well just now.

543
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:25,641
This time I'll teach her a lesson.

544
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:27,002
No.

545
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,161
She has said everything to that extent.

546
00:24:29,441 --> 00:24:30,921
If you find her now,

547
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:33,121
it would be too embarrassing.
It's not appropriate.

548
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:35,802
She really meant
she wants to cut all ties?

549
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:39,802
Was she sure about that?

550
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:42,048
Yes, and she also said it very loudly.

551
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,520
I heard it from outside.

552
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,121
Wait. Could she be

553
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:47,562
speaking out of anger?

554
00:24:48,841 --> 00:24:50,161
I think she must've been very serious.

555
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,562
Good for you, Chun Jinrong.

556
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,368
Young Lord,

557
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,082
may I take the liberty
to ask you a question?

558
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:06,304
Do you fall for her?

559
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,641
Me? How could I possibly...

560
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,282
She's so... Right?

561
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:13,082
Then, do you blame Miss Jinrong

562
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:14,322
for pecking you?

563
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:17,952
Yes, I admit

564
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:20,201
we did have a great time that night.

565
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:21,161
I didn't overthink it.

566
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:22,242
I just thought

567
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:24,121
it's nice to be friends.

568
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:25,082
But look at her.

569
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:25,841
How ruthless.

570
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:26,841
She's so cruel.

571
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:27,762
Right. Yes.

572
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:32,384
Well,

573
00:25:33,802 --> 00:25:35,201
should I go
and clear things up with her?

574
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:39,681
I'm definitely not afraid
to draw a clear line with her.

575
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:40,762
You know me well.

576
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,841
- Yes.
- I'm doing it for my family.

577
00:25:45,802 --> 00:25:47,040
How about this, Young Lord?

578
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:48,841
Take this opportunity

579
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,752
to test Miss Jinrong's intention.

580
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,768
What intention?

581
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,762
To see if she likes you,

582
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,601
or your status and position.

583
00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:57,802
How?

584
00:25:58,121 --> 00:25:59,322
I've thought about it.

585
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:01,841
I'll take some money to find her.

586
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,881
I'll tell her, "Miss Jinrong,"

587
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:05,762
"if you accept this money,"

588
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:07,441
"then Young Lord will have nothing"

589
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,121
"to do with you anymore."

590
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,401
If she accepts it,

591
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:12,441
you don't need to be troubled anymore.

592
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:14,962
But if she doesn't accept it,

593
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:17,322
it means she likes you.

594
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,722
Then, you can talk to her later.

595
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:25,184
Okay, let's do it this way.

596
00:26:25,674 --> 00:26:27,115
Take a hundred taels

597
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:28,155
and test her.

598
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:29,472
If she doesn't accept it,

599
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:34,315
I may consider

600
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:36,096
giving her a way out.

601
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:38,194
Even Banxia cried.

602
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:41,075
This matter is more serious
than I thought.

603
00:26:42,674 --> 00:26:44,274
Master!

604
00:26:44,595 --> 00:26:45,434
It's bad!

605
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:46,595
M-Mrs. Chun...

606
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:47,434
What happened to her?

607
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:48,954
Mrs. Chun took a knife

608
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:50,194
and stood by the pond.

609
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:51,595
Is she going to...

610
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:53,635
Master, wait for me!

611
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:04,064
Mrs. Chun.

612
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:08,000
Ruyu! Don't move!

613
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:09,152
Don't act rashly!

614
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:10,496
Mrs. Chun, calm down!

615
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:12,064
It's not a big deal.

616
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:14,158
What are you doing?

617
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:15,179
What are you doing?

618
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:16,238
What are you doing?

619
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:17,058
What are you doing?

620
00:27:17,578 --> 00:27:18,592
I'm fishing.

621
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,538
Why do you need a knife for fishing?

622
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Right.

623
00:27:23,578 --> 00:27:24,219
I will fish it up

624
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:25,920
and clean it here.

625
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:27,939
Why are you two shouting?

626
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,400
It's really scary.

627
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:36,618
Master, why don't you help Mrs. Chun?

628
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:41,280
I'll help you.

629
00:27:42,112 --> 00:27:43,008
Don't bother.

630
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:56,259
Miss Jinrong, this is hush money.

631
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,699
Young Lord hopes
that after you accept this money,

632
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:03,818
you won't talk nonsense about

633
00:28:03,858 --> 00:28:05,056
your relationship with him.

634
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:08,576
What do you mean?

635
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:11,264
What does he take me for?

636
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:14,419
I am a woman of her word.

637
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,259
Tell him.

638
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:16,578
He can put his mind at ease.

639
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:18,138
I don't have much,

640
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:19,618
but I have my pride.

641
00:28:23,138 --> 00:28:24,058
I'll take my leave now.

642
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,320
A-Are you sure?

643
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:31,699
What does she mean?

644
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,112
She accepted it?

645
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:37,459
Did you not make it clear to her?

646
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:39,058
I made it clear.

647
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:42,538
Didn't she hesitate at all?

648
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:46,138
Young Lord, perhaps we should let it go.

649
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:48,298
Fine. Chun Jinrong.

650
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:49,824
I know what kind of woman she is.

651
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:52,459
I-I'll consider it
the price I pay for peace.

652
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,939
I know what kind of person she is.

653
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:56,544
Young Lord,

654
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,880
please calm down.

655
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:02,578
I've thought about it.

656
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:04,219
This time, take two hundred taels.

657
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:05,818
And you tell her,

658
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:06,739
"This is for real."

659
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,939
If she accepts it again,

660
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:09,058
we'll never meet again for real.

661
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:09,939
There is no room left.

662
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,808
No relationship at all.

663
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:13,632
Two hundred taels?

664
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:15,072
Go.

665
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:16,224
Okay.

666
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:22,298
Young Lord, is this necessary?

667
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:23,392
How did you...

668
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,778
Hurry up and go!

669
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:27,104
Okay.

670
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,376
You scared me.

671
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:38,778
(Young Lord's Mansion)

672
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:45,856
- Miss...
- Why are you here?

673
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,618
Miss Jinrong, I was looking for you.

674
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:51,259
You're not here
to take back the money, are you?

675
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:52,608
No.

676
00:29:57,138 --> 00:29:58,624
This is two hundred taels.

677
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:00,512
Young Lord wanted me to tell you

678
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:02,432
that if you accept this money,

679
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:04,480
you'll have nothing to do
with him anymore.

680
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:06,304
You can't see each other again.

681
00:30:06,578 --> 00:30:07,808
Never meet again.

682
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:10,784
Then why did he ask you to deliver it?

683
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:13,858
He probably just...

684
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:16,896
You really accepted it?

685
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:18,144
Yes.

686
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:20,032
Are you sure?

687
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:21,699
If you accept this money,

688
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:23,538
you will become strangers to Young Lord.

689
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,536
Don't you have
the slightest missing for him?

690
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,400
No.

691
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,032
Why would I miss him?

692
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:30,098
Do I miss that he's a man,

693
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:31,424
who dares to act but not to admit?

694
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,259
You go back and tell him.

695
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:33,538
I not only don't miss him,

696
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:35,520
but I will also forget him soon.

697
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:38,464
(Young Lord's Mansion)
By the way, Li Tengyun,

698
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:39,680
is there anything else?

699
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,008
Then don't bother me today.

700
00:30:43,538 --> 00:30:43,778
I...

701
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:47,499
Well, rest well.

702
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:49,760
You are really cooking fish.

703
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,360
You scared me.

704
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:55,968
Alright, stop messing around here.

705
00:30:58,912 --> 00:30:59,872
Ruyu,

706
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,888
you don't have to

707
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,200
take those rumors to heart.

708
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:04,960
Those people

709
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:06,912
are just idly gossiping
because they are bored.

710
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:09,939
Rumors?

711
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:11,328
What rumors?

712
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:14,592
To be honest,

713
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:17,056
sometimes I feel

714
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,000
that I am far from doing enough.

715
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:28,419
It's all my fault for being incapable,

716
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:31,538
causing you all to suffer.

717
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,912
What are you doing here?

718
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,040
I know that all these years,

719
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:42,720
you haven't forgiven me.

720
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:47,019
Enough, stop crying here.

721
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:48,818
Don't keep bringing up the past.

722
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:50,912
Sounds like I can't let go.

723
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:58,659
If you can think this way,

724
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,640
I'm really relieved.

725
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,818
Is the fish ready, Mother?

726
00:32:02,818 --> 00:32:03,818
Yes. Serve it.

727
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:04,704
I'll do it.

728
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,520
Wash your hands. It's time to eat.

729
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:12,608
What's wrong?

730
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:15,712
(In Memory of Mr. Chun)

731
00:32:15,818 --> 00:32:16,800
Chun.

732
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:19,616
Today is your death anniversary.

733
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,048
I made your favorite fish.

734
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,800
Your daughters miss you a lot.

735
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:36,659
I don't think you should overthink it.

736
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:37,979
It's not important at all.

737
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:39,939
I just want to play it today.

738
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:45,298
Is this a big deal?

739
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:48,298
Senior Chun,

740
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:49,818
I owe you an apology.

741
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:51,219
How could I forget

742
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:52,818
your important death anniversary?

743
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:56,058
I-I'm an idiot.

744
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,538
I thought it was
because of yesterday, you...

745
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:02,618
I wondered why
you were speaking so strangely today.

746
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:03,939
Ruyu,

747
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,338
this is a misunderstanding.

748
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,219
This is a misunderstanding.

749
00:33:07,858 --> 00:33:09,578
I'm really stupid.

750
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:11,298
I'm a blockhead.

751
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:13,578
My brain is filled with medicine dregs.

752
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:14,818
I'm so stupid.

753
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:16,538
Enough, stop crying.

754
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:17,778
I've long stopped hating you.

755
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,208
This is probably the fate of our family.

756
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:24,739
I was not strong enough before

757
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,818
and unfairly blamed you.

758
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:28,459
You've carried it for so many years.

759
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:30,112
It's time to let it go.

760
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:32,448
To be honest,

761
00:33:33,939 --> 00:33:36,019
you've been quite good
to my four daughters.

762
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:38,578
Though I don't say it,

763
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,608
I see everything.

764
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:43,392
And I believe Chun also sees it.

765
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:47,019
Senior Chun.

766
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:49,184
I...

767
00:33:49,298 --> 00:33:50,240
Master.

768
00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:52,160
Time will heal everything.

769
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,058
Master, it's not worth it.

770
00:33:57,056 --> 00:33:57,856
I...

771
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,538
Don't be discouraged because of it.

772
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:03,168
Enough is enough.

773
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,616
Alright, let's eat.

774
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,216
Let's eat.

775
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,859
Senior Chun,

776
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:17,738
I'll treat them with all my heart.

777
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:22,779
I will never forget this.

778
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:26,058
I'm going to eat now.

779
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:52,224
Young Lord.

780
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,520
What's wrong, Young Lord?

781
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:58,816
Tengyun,

782
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:01,024
I thought about it all night.

783
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:05,098
Right. You should...

784
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:06,080
Five hundred taels.

785
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:07,776
This time, you take five hundred taels.

786
00:35:08,352 --> 00:35:09,280
Young Lord,

787
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:10,848
she will definitely accept it.

788
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:12,658
What's the difference
between this and throwing money?

789
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:15,200
She must be playing hard to get.

790
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:20,480
Young Lord.

791
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:22,939
Young Lord, in your current state,

792
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:24,416
it's very dangerous.

793
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:26,058
If she is playing hard to get,

794
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:27,499
then you are just surrendering yourself.

795
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:28,859
Listen, Tengyun.

796
00:35:29,098 --> 00:35:30,578
You know nothing about women at all.

797
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:32,499
She definitely has me in her heart.

798
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:33,419
She admitted it herself.

799
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:36,064
She just needs an out.

800
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:38,592
Young Lord.

801
00:35:39,698 --> 00:35:41,178
Miss Jinrong sent an invitation.

802
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:43,258
See? She can't stand it.

803
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:46,752
Young Lord, this is for Mr. Li.

804
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:49,120
For me?

805
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:53,939
(Spring River Restaurant)
Jinrong, this is the one.

806
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:56,384
(Treasure)
Mr. Ren, Ministry of Revenue's grandson.

807
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:58,080
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ren.

808
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:00,128
Miss Jinrong, nice to meet you.

809
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,779
You are really an extraordinary

810
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:03,936
and handsome talent.

811
00:36:04,618 --> 00:36:06,098
You are also...

812
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:08,768
Quite tall.

813
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:12,608
Please sit.

814
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:13,696
Okay.

815
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:21,056
Who are you waiting for?

816
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,258
No, I'm just looking around.

817
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:25,459
Are we all set?

818
00:36:26,258 --> 00:36:27,258
You think I can't tell?

819
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:31,019
It's okay. It's normal
in the honeymoon period.

820
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:32,459
But speaking of which,

821
00:36:32,499 --> 00:36:34,138
Young Lord really values you.

822
00:36:34,178 --> 00:36:36,416
This Product Appraisal is quite formal.

823
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:37,216
Him?

824
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:38,258
Come on.

825
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:39,264
Madam Wu.

826
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:43,840
Madam Wu.

827
00:36:44,658 --> 00:36:45,504
Xiaoxiao,

828
00:36:45,738 --> 00:36:47,218
if I remember correctly,

829
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,339
we didn't send
an invitation to Madam Wu.

830
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:51,379
I must have missed it.

831
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:55,218
Why, without an invitation,
I'm not welcome here?

832
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:58,379
I came here specifically to support you.

833
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,138
To see how our stingy Miss Chun

834
00:37:01,578 --> 00:37:03,339
is hosting the Product Appraisal.

835
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:06,339
So you don't embarrass yourself.

836
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,496
Then Madam Wu should
open your eyes wide and watch.

837
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:13,280
Quick, find a corner and sit down.

838
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:16,058
Don't be angry.

839
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:17,760
Harmony brings wealth.

840
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:31,642
(Spring River Restaurant)

841
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:34,682
(Treasure)

842
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:39,072
Miss Jinrong,

843
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:41,248
when do we start?

844
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:42,880
We'll start soon.

845
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:47,552
Jinrong.

846
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:50,784
Young Lord is here.

847
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,288
Really?

848
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:55,840
Young Lord isn't really here
to support her, is he?

849
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:58,080
He's probably just passing by.

850
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:00,379
Sorry everyone,

851
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:02,538
before the Product Appraisal starts,

852
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:05,098
I prepared a little show for you.

853
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:06,578
Please enjoy.

854
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:08,640
What's going on?

855
00:38:34,698 --> 00:38:36,419
Miss Jinrong's dancing skills

856
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:38,496
are truly impressive.

857
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:40,578
Stop dancing.

858
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,098
Stop. Stop dancing.

859
00:38:42,258 --> 00:38:43,424
Stop it.

860
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:45,024
What on earth is going on?

861
00:38:46,464 --> 00:38:48,864
Chun Jinrong, what are you doing?

862
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:51,168
What are you doing here?

863
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:54,538
I-I'm just watching, alright?

864
00:38:54,848 --> 00:38:55,936
Are you done watching?

865
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,856
If you're done, please leave.

866
00:38:58,538 --> 00:39:00,800
Could you help me with this, Mr. Ren?

867
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:01,760
Alright.

868
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,658
Thank you.

869
00:39:02,658 --> 00:39:03,616
Don't take it.

870
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:04,672
Come here.

871
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:08,058
As a miss,

872
00:39:08,058 --> 00:39:09,779
dancing in front of so many men,

873
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:10,819
what are you thinking?

874
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:13,440
You still love to criticize.

875
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,296
If I'm not mistaken,

876
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:17,152
I have made clear boundaries with you.

877
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:19,648
I haven't made it clear yet.

878
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,056
What else isn't clear?

879
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:23,819
You are of noble status.

880
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:25,440
Please leave.

881
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:27,456
I won't. No.

882
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:28,899
So you're entertaining pretty boys

883
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:30,339
with the money I gave you.

884
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:31,488
What do you mean?

885
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:33,138
Who are you calling a pretty boy?

886
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:34,784
Here.

887
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,384
He's not pretty enough.

888
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:38,272
A pretty boy.

889
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:39,232
Look.

890
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:43,058
He's a man of dignity,

891
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:44,419
who dares to admit what he has done.

892
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:45,632
He is also

893
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:47,424
the legitimate grandson of someone.

894
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,120
No.

895
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:52,224
At least, he's not like you.

896
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:55,200
Chun Jinrong,

897
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:57,419
you really want to
leave no room for it, right?

898
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,904
Yes.

899
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:01,920
Fine.

900
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,352
Okay. Great.

901
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:06,336
I understand.

902
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:11,019
Xiaoxiao,

903
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:14,578
are they going to fall out?

904
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,640
They're quarreling.
It will be alright soon.

905
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:20,899
Xiaoxiao, I am quite straightforward

906
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:22,939
and I don't think too much
before I speak.

907
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:26,499
You should please leave, Young Lord.

908
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:29,664
If any rumors spread,

909
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:31,360
it won't be good for you.

910
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:34,178
That's not what I meant that day.

911
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:35,419
If you won't leave,

912
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:36,512
then I will.

913
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:38,208
Chun Jinrong. Chun Jinrong.

914
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:39,538
I've already said to this extent.

915
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:40,939
What else do you want me to do?

916
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:42,400
You're hurting me.

917
00:40:45,218 --> 00:40:46,499
I just want you to be a man,

918
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,192
who dares to admit what he has done.

919
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:50,208
How I...

920
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:51,680
Stand there.

921
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,408
Come back to me.

922
00:40:56,032 --> 00:40:56,939
That's right.

923
00:40:57,058 --> 00:40:58,538
Let's talk it out properly, Jinrong.

924
00:40:58,538 --> 00:40:59,296
Well...

925
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,738
Wait. What's going on?

926
00:41:01,738 --> 00:41:02,656
Chun Jinrong!

927
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:04,299
Will this Product Appraisal continue?

928
00:41:04,538 --> 00:41:05,578
Continue my foot.

929
00:41:05,578 --> 00:41:07,136
Can't you read the room?

930
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:08,899
Get out of here. All of you.

931
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:09,859
I tell you guys.

932
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:10,578
I will kill you

933
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:11,776
if any of you dares to chase her.

934
00:41:11,899 --> 00:41:12,864
Especially you.

935
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:15,904
You're indeed quite pretty.

936
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,024
Better pay attention.

937
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:18,304
Jinrong.

938
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:21,504
Chun Jinrong is really something.

939
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:23,680
Xiaoxiao,

940
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:27,104
do you want to
come to my house for blue cheese?

941
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:28,768
Invite Jinrong too.

942
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:30,819
Blue cheese?

943
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:33,088
I'll ask her.

944
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:45,338
(Splendid Architecture)

945
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:50,080
Why did my orchid

946
00:41:51,658 --> 00:41:52,960
become like this?

947
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,339
Doesn't anyone water this?

948
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,672
Doesn't anyone care about it?

949
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:02,528
What are you writing?

950
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:04,064
Registration.

951
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,464
All visitors to
Young Lord's Mansion need to register.

952
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:08,138
I am Young Lord.

953
00:42:08,178 --> 00:42:09,098
Why should we register?

954
00:42:11,058 --> 00:42:11,939
What are you here for?

955
00:42:12,928 --> 00:42:13,920
Hurry.

956
00:42:17,472 --> 00:42:18,400
Mrs. Chun.

957
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:20,800
Well, is Jinrong here?

958
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:21,792
She's not.

959
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:25,184
Do you know where she is?

960
00:42:25,578 --> 00:42:26,432
I don't know.

961
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:27,616
What do you need her for?

962
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:29,419
It's not specifically for her.

963
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:30,138
It's just...

964
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:32,419
Isn't the Dragon Boat Festival
in a month?

965
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,098
I was thinking of
bringing some gifts for everyone.

966
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:37,618
Mrs. Chun, these are all good things.

967
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:38,019
Mrs. Chun.

968
00:42:38,538 --> 00:42:39,178
Sit.

969
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:40,618
Sorry,

970
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:41,658
we just had a meal.

971
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:43,419
It's alright.

972
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:48,658
Or we can cook you another meal.

973
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:50,019
- No, thanks.
- It's alright.

974
00:42:50,058 --> 00:42:51,058
We have a bowl of soup left.

975
00:42:51,058 --> 00:42:52,058
I'll go get it for you.

976
00:42:52,058 --> 00:42:52,819
You're welcome.

977
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:54,178
That's too kind.

978
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,992
Young Lord, you came just in time.

979
00:42:57,379 --> 00:42:58,432
Here's the thing.

980
00:42:58,538 --> 00:43:01,138
I have already discussed it with Ruyu.

981
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,058
Our house is almost repaired,

982
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:04,178
so we should move back.

983
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,058
It's a good time to hand over

984
00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:07,098
your mansion.

985
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:07,618
Move back?

986
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:09,698
It's repaired so quickly.

987
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:11,698
Stay for a few more days.

988
00:43:12,058 --> 00:43:13,819
Regardless of our past grudges,

989
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:16,738
we are grateful for your care.

990
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:17,939
Don't say that.

991
00:43:18,058 --> 00:43:19,218
Actually, there are many things

992
00:43:19,258 --> 00:43:20,459
I didn't do well enough.

993
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:21,738
Please don't take it personally.

994
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:23,339
Especially to you, Mrs. Chun.

995
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:25,379
Once we move back,

996
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:27,058
let's move on.

997
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:28,819
Try to have less contact in the future.

998
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:30,138
Don't be like this, Mrs. Chun.

999
00:43:30,178 --> 00:43:30,698
I...

1000
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,019
The fish soup is here, Young Lord.

1001
00:43:32,578 --> 00:43:33,299
Young Lord, try it.

1002
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:34,058
Thank you.

1003
00:43:38,656 --> 00:43:39,499
Delicious.

1004
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:41,859
I must say, the fish in your mansion

1005
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:43,379
is very fresh.

1006
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:44,058
Yeah.

1007
00:43:44,178 --> 00:43:46,138
That's why you should stay longer.

1008
00:43:46,178 --> 00:43:47,419
The fish in our Young Lord's Mansion

1009
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,859
is indeed particularly delicious.

1010
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:54,698
Where is the fish in the mansion?

1011
00:43:56,832 --> 00:43:57,859
Where did you get this fish?

1012
00:43:57,899 --> 00:44:00,738
Fish! My foreign fish.

1013
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:01,568
Young Lord.

1014
00:44:03,618 --> 00:44:05,459
How much did you eat?

1015
00:44:05,658 --> 00:44:06,658
What? Is it poisonous?

1016
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:08,339
I bought this at a high price.

1017
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:09,939
Not for you to eat.

1018
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:12,738
They ate...

1019
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:14,058
One, two...

1020
00:44:15,328 --> 00:44:16,058
Four fish.

1021
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:18,432
- They ate four of my foreign fish. I...
- Yes.

1022
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:20,499
Mrs. Chun.

1023
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:22,618
How could you eat his fish, Mrs. Chun?

1024
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,578
No one told us

1025
00:44:23,618 --> 00:44:24,499
that we couldn't eat it.

1026
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:25,899
You should have posted a notice.

1027
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:26,859
Do not eat.

1028
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:28,019
Right, then we would know.

1029
00:44:28,058 --> 00:44:29,248
Exactly.

1030
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:33,120
Where are my orchids?

1031
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:35,379
I planted two orchids here.

1032
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:37,738
No. They withered,

1033
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:39,019
so we pulled them out.

1034
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:40,058
Right, I was thinking

1035
00:44:40,098 --> 00:44:41,819
of planting some other herbs.

1036
00:44:41,899 --> 00:44:44,819
Right. That's none of our business.

1037
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,138
They've withered like this.

1038
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:49,178
Didn't you know to water it?

1039
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,400
You...

1040
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:52,558
Young Lord.

1041
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,939
Leave. All of you, leave.

1042
00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:54,912
Calm down, Young Lord.

1043
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:56,512
My fish.

1044
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:00,384
My foreign fish.

1045
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,224
My foreign fish.
