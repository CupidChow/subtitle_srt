(The Fourth Prince confesses his love)

Thatch for sale.

35
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,149
What's going on with you and Zhao,
the tailor?

36
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:00,229
Don't even mention it.

37
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:03,188
I've heard it, though.

38
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,308
He even came to your house to find you.

39
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,828
But some old man said you guys moved.

40
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:09,588
What's all this about?

41
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:11,309
Old man? What old man?

42
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:12,708
I've finally moved to Jianglin.

43
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,229
Why would I move again?

44
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:17,309
Anyway, that's the rumor
flying around the Marriage Bridge.

45
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:20,309
Banxia.

46
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,388
Ms. Xu, you're here.

47
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:27,828
I think Banxia is quite good.

48
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:31,349
She is good-looking
and has medical skills.

49
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:34,108
I think your daughter is better.

50
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:38,189
She knows how to do business.
Banxia only knows medicine.

51
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,868
She is stubborn, just like her father.

52
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:44,708
Mother, can't you carry on a conversation
without talking about me?

53
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:50,189
Can't I say a few words about you?

54
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:51,909
You better go keep yourself busy.

55
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,428
Banxia, your mother
is just chatting with me.

56
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:55,868
She's not really speaking ill of you.

57
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,828
So being a mother gives you
the right to judge.

58
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:01,588
Ms. Xu, is that what you mean?

59
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:03,469
Do you have any manners at all?

60
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:04,909
Can't you see we are talking here?

61
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:05,988
Mind your own business.

62
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:07,349
I'm not stopping you from talking.

63
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:08,469
Can't you just avoid

64
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:09,949
talking about us while you're at it?

65
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,789
Are you done yet?

66
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,588
I suddenly remember
I need to go back home to cook.

67
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,029
Well, I'm leaving now.

68
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,029
Banxia, don't argue with your mother.

69
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:25,909
Sis, don't get too mad.

70
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:28,708
Are you leaving? Don't leave.

71
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:30,268
Stay here for dinner.

72
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,189
I'll come another day.

73
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,548
Take it slow. I won't see you off.

74
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,472
What were you doing?

75
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,828
Mother, what were you doing?

76
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:41,909
Chun Banxia.

77
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,588
You talked to me like that
in front of others?

78
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:45,629
Don't you know
it's very disrespectful to me?

79
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:48,029
Mother, it's you disrespecting us.

80
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,548
To be honest, every time you guys chat,

81
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:51,868
you intentionally belittle us.

82
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:53,588
It's not the first time I've heard this.

83
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:55,909
I really don't know
what the purpose of your doing this is.

84
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,349
What purpose could I have?

85
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:58,349
Aren't you just like that?

86
00:03:58,388 --> 00:03:59,749
What did I say wrong?

87
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:01,988
If you really think
there is a problem with us,

88
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:04,029
you should help us correct it
with a positive attitude

89
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,469
instead of recklessly swearing

90
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:06,909
and exaggerating slander.

91
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,349
Chun Banxia, are you saying

92
00:04:08,388 --> 00:04:10,668
that I'm not competent as a mother?

93
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:13,749
If you think it that way, I can't help.

94
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:15,629
Listen to what you're saying.

95
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,069
Can you control your emotions?

96
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,549
I'm trying to reason with you.

97
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,629
As the head of the household,
it is necessary for you

98
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,268
to understand
the feelings of each one of us.

99
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:26,749
Feelings? Do you think I willingly
became the head of this family?

100
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,028
If you have the ability, you do it!

101
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,669
If you insist on saying that,

102
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:31,828
I'll do it.

103
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,669
You better get yourself straight first.

104
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,768
Come on. Let's eat.

105
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,869
Lu Buping,

106
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:49,989
who allowed you to sit there?

107
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,669
- Well...
- I did.

108
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,309
What do you mean?

109
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,509
Mother, now I'm the one in charge.

110
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,908
I think that as a member of our family,

111
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:01,629
Lu Buping has the right
to sit at the table.

112
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:04,228
And he's sitting at the low table,
which is quite reasonable.

113
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,549
You're in charge?

114
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,749
Lu Buping, get up.

115
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:10,669
Sit down first.

116
00:05:11,148 --> 00:05:13,509
Mother, you promised me

117
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,189
to let me be in charge. We made a deal.

118
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:16,989
Who made a deal with you?

119
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:22,028
Chun Keling, where are you going?

120
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:25,708
Mother, I'm not going anywhere.
Let's eat.

121
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,908
Being frivolous all day.

122
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:30,549
Mother, don't change the topic.

123
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:31,588
Are you reneging on it?

124
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:34,109
What am I reneging on?
I've never promised you anything.

125
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:36,549
You promised me. You definitely did.

126
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:44,509
It seems that
now you want to suppress us

127
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:45,669
with your emotions and status,

128
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:46,989
and you're going back on your words.

129
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,549
It's because you always
handle problems this way.

130
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:51,828
That's why our family
has become like this.

131
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:53,708
What's wrong with this family?

132
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:56,028
Aren't you all doing well?

133
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:58,708
Look at your emotional state now.

134
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,148
Do you think you are an example
we should learn from?

135
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,828
What kind of mischief is Banxia up to?

136
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:06,348
I don't know.

137
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,629
Looks like everyone's angry
but dares not speak up, right?

138
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:10,989
Do you think it's okay?

139
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:14,949
I-It's okay.

140
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:16,028
I-It's okay.

141
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:17,629
- No problem.
- We're happy.

142
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:19,749
- Totally okay.
- Yes, that's right.

143
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:21,309
- No problem.
- We're so happy.

144
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,749
Have you heard?

145
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,148
Mother, who dares to tell the truth
with your temper?

146
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,788
Even if they did, would you listen?

147
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,228
After all, as the head of this family,

148
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:30,228
you've broken your promises

149
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:31,749
multiple times.

150
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:36,588
- So you really want to be in charge?
- Yes.

151
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:37,869
Are you capable of that?

152
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:39,348
Of course, I am confident.

153
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:42,908
Fine, if you want to be in charge,
I have no problem.

154
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:45,069
But why not ask them
if they agree first?

155
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,109
Everyone, if I were
to be in charge of this household,

156
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,908
to ensure it operates efficiently,

157
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,348
I have decided to uphold

158
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:01,788
the principle of absolute fairness

159
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:04,148
to solve all its current problems.

160
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:06,348
For example, the chores at home

161
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:08,189
should not all be done
by Peilan and Lu Buping.

162
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:12,148
Furthermore,
everyone in the household should have

163
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,869
equal rights and freedom.

164
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:18,788
You talk as if it's simple. How can you
manage the household without money?

165
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:21,348
Master can give me
the monthly share of profits directly.

166
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,788
After deducting
the daily household expenses,

167
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:24,788
I will distribute

168
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,749
the rest equally and on time

169
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,348
to everyone as pocket money.

170
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:29,549
Really?

171
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,828
That's ridiculous.

172
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:34,109
I think the food
seems to be getting cold.

173
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:35,388
Let's eat first, shall we?

174
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,309
You better tell her now.

175
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:37,908
Do you agree with her in charge?

176
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:39,549
I think it's okay.

177
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:40,468
Did you hear that?

178
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,920
I did.

179
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:44,109
What did you say?

180
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:45,989
Mother, what I mean is,

181
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:48,468
if Banxia wants to be in charge,
just let her.

182
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:49,828
You can get some rest.

183
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,788
Mother, I think Banxia

184
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:53,069
made more sense than you did.

185
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,908
Mother, isn't it nice
to have some rest as well?

186
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:59,549
The kids meant well.
Just let her exercise.

187
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:01,248
That's right.

188
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:05,388
Mother, don't get mad.

189
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:07,669
You're not afraid of hard work.

190
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,869
Your work is highly respected.

191
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,028
High-above.

192
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:11,348
High-above and bossy.

193
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:14,549
Bossy... bossy?

194
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:15,989
Who are you referring to as bossy?

195
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:19,429
I-I mean, b-b-b...

196
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:20,429
- B...
- Benevolent.

197
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:21,509
Right, benevolent.

198
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,669
Alright, look at all of you.

199
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:27,309
A bunch of fence-sitters!

200
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:30,588
Let's just wait and see.

201
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:32,628
Mother? Aren't you going to eat?

202
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,669
Mother won't eat.

203
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:44,108
Come on. Straighten up to the left.

204
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:47,909
Straighten up to the right.

205
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:51,389
Good.

206
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:53,949
If nobody has any objection

207
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,189
to my absolutely fair plan,

208
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:57,149
we'll start implementing it immediately.

209
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,269
Let's see what we need to do today.

210
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,669
Today's tasks
are sweeping and mopping the floor,

211
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,748
washing clothes, hanging clothes,
chopping wood, and cooking.

212
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,669
Sounds like a lot, right?

213
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,549
But as long as we work together,

214
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:12,828
they'll be done quickly.

215
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:15,708
Please speak.

216
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,949
When is the money distributed?

217
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:19,949
Hard work brings rewards, Jinrong.

218
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:22,389
Next, let me make arrangements.

219
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:24,708
Chun Keling, you'll sweep the floor.

220
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,389
Okay, I'll go right now.

221
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:30,988
Look at her.

222
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,029
Everyone must learn

223
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:34,708
Chun Keling's proactive spirit.

224
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,069
After Keling sweeps the floor,
Chun Jinrong will mop it.

225
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,949
Then Master will wash the clothes.

226
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:42,149
After that,
Lu Buping will hang the clothes.

227
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:44,069
Then, Lu Buping will go chop wood.

228
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,189
Then Peilan will cook.

229
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:46,429
Peilan, you only need to cook today.

230
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:47,588
Nothing more.

231
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,909
By the way, if anyone works more,

232
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:53,069
they will be punished,
especially you, Peilan.

233
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:56,708
This is a great plan.

234
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,149
After you finish your own tasks,

235
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:02,069
you can arrange your own things.

236
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:03,828
I won't be as irritable as my mother,

237
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,909
interfering with your lives.

238
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,669
Chun Banxia, can't you talk

239
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:11,108
without mentioning me?

240
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:15,909
Mother, I'm sorry.
I won't do that again.

241
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,508
I want to see what you can achieve
when you take charge.

242
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:27,949
Then let us execute
according to the plan.

243
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,108
Let's move.

244
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,269
Let's move.

245
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,909
Banxia, you haven't said anything
about the money.

246
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,549
Are you working out?

247
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:40,029
3,000.

248
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,228
- Only you two are here?
- 3,001.

249
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:42,789
Where is A-Si?

250
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,389
It seems that A-Si went
to buy something for you to eat.

251
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,069
My guess is mille-feuille cake.

252
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:51,029
Boss, I've found out

253
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,949
that A-Si is really nice to you.

254
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,149
Boss, I've also found out

255
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:59,628
that A-Si always calls you by your name.

256
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:00,828
He has never called you boss.

257
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,949
He has never called me boss?

258
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:05,189
Really?

259
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:06,669
And there's another strange thing.

260
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:08,949
He calls you by your name,
but you don't get angry.

261
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,189
Why should I get angry?
I didn't even notice that.

262
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:13,508
Normally,

263
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:15,069
you should easily notice such things.

264
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:16,549
Right, Keling?

265
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,628
What did you just call me?

266
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:19,389
Boss, I said you would notice!

267
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:20,949
And she noticed it pretty quickly.

268
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:21,828
Yeah.

269
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:27,069
Boss, does A-Si like you?

270
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,389
Are you asking for a beating?

271
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,029
Do you like A-Si too?

272
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,708
- I will beat you up!
- This is...

273
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:33,189
- A-Si is here!
- Is Si-A here too!

274
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:34,628
Not Si-A. It's A-Si.

275
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,628
- I...
- Keling.

276
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:40,468
What delicious food

277
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:41,988
did you buy for our boss?

278
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:44,549
Your favorite mille-feuille cake.

279
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:48,029
Boss, you're really prescient.

280
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,149
Keling, are you free tonight?

281
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:55,149
What for?

282
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,628
Go to Spring River Restaurant with me.

283
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,429
What are we going there for?

284
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,708
You'll know once you get there.

285
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:05,389
I'll wait for you there tonight.
See you.

286
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:07,069
I...

287
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:15,189
"I'll wait for you there tonight.
See you."

288
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,189
And your favorite mille-feuille cake.

289
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:32,069
Chun Jinrong, what's the time now?

290
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:33,029
I don't know.

291
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:36,348
Why haven't you mopped the floor yet?

292
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:38,708
Chun Keling hasn't swept it yet.

293
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,909
Where is Chun Keling?
Why didn't she sweep the floor?

294
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:44,429
I don't know. Why don't you
go look for her on the roof?

295
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,029
Can't you just sweep the floor first?

296
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,389
I dare not. Didn't you say that
the one who works more

297
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:53,549
will be punished?

298
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,628
Go sweep the floor first.

299
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,429
Let Chun Keling mop the floor
when she gets back.

300
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:04,588
You didn't tell me earlier.

301
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:07,200
Banxia,

302
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:09,868
when can we have the money?

303
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:13,269
It's getting late.
Why aren't you cooking yet?

304
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,549
When can we have the money?

305
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:30,389
Why haven't you started cooking yet?

306
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:31,429
Mother is urging.

307
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:32,828
Banxia, I wanted to cook.

308
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:35,588
Mr. Lu hasn't chopped the wood yet.
I don't have any firewood.

309
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,789
Firewood? Where is Lu Buping?

310
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:39,549
Mr. Lu is in the woodshed.

311
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:47,669
- Where is the firewood? Firewood!
- Well.

312
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:49,588
I haven't hung the clothes.

313
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,069
What does it have to do
with chopping wood?

314
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:54,309
But you said to hang the clothes first
before chopping the wood.

315
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,389
I'm just following your orders strictly.

316
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:57,669
Why haven't you hung the clothes yet?

317
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,909
Master hasn't washed them yet.

318
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,149
After breakfast and dinner.

319
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,309
Master!

320
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,508
Why haven't these clothes
been washed yet?

321
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,909
There are only two tubs of clothes.
Why haven't they been washed yet?

322
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,189
Many customers came this morning.

323
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,669
As you haven't washed the clothes,

324
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,468
all the arrangements are messed up now.

325
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,389
Bro, could you please
wrap up the medicine yourself?

326
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,708
I'll wash them now.

327
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,468
Where is Chun Keling?

328
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:36,429
It's not the first day
that she hasn't returned home.

329
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,389
I will talk to her alone

330
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:41,149
about her matter when she gets back.

331
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,309
Let's discuss today's issue now.

332
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,149
I admit that there were some oversights

333
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:47,189
in today's plan.

334
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,429
Of course, it's my fault.

335
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:50,269
Banxia, that's not your fault.

336
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:51,389
It's my fault.

337
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:54,149
It's okay.
We can adjust the order tomorrow.

338
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,149
Master, after you go to the pharmacy,

339
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:57,189
come back to hang clothes.

340
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,549
Lu Buping, chop the firewood,
and then wash the clothes.

341
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:02,189
Banxia, how do we hang clothes at night?

342
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:06,309
If you ask me,
you should just manage the money.

343
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,149
Forget about the plan.

344
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,949
You are all here.

345
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:16,269
Peilan, what time is it?

346
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:17,628
Why aren't you eating yet?

347
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:22,508
As for the delay of tonight's dinner,

348
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,949
I also want to apologize to you.
I'm sorry, guys.

349
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:28,508
Can an apology make you full?

350
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,309
The food for you is here.

351
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:35,808
Don't go.

352
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:38,389
So I used my own money

353
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:39,628
to order food for everyone.

354
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,309
Where did you get the money?

355
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:42,909
I earned it
by writing letters for people.

356
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:44,309
I didn't take the money from home.

357
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,708
The festive set meal
from Spring River Restaurant.

358
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,904
Hurry.

359
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:01,868
You must be hungry, Mother.
You can eat first.

360
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:04,669
I'm past my hunger. I don't want to eat.

361
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:08,992
Take the food out quickly.

362
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,149
No one can manage a household

363
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:12,269
on their first day.

364
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,108
I hope everyone
will still trust me tomorrow.

365
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,508
I will do better tomorrow.

366
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:17,628
It smells so good.

367
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,389
Why did he suddenly ask me out?

368
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,389
What does "you'll know
once you get there" mean?

369
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:33,108
What was he trying to say?

370
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,389
Keling, you're here.

371
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:38,628
I like you.

372
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:42,189
I'm not going.
I never promised him I'd go.

373
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:45,269
What can he do to me if I don't go?

374
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:47,840
Anyway, I'm not going.

375
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:52,708
He won't wait there forever, will he?

376
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:04,256
It serves him right.
I'm not going anyway.

377
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:10,629
Keling, you're here.

378
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:13,189
Let's go in.

379
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,912
Wait.

380
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,028
What are we going in for?

381
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,028
To eat.

382
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:22,189
I've eaten at home.

383
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:24,389
We can have tea too.

384
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,468
Do you have something to say?

385
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,708
I do have something to tell you.

386
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:37,748
Just say it here.

387
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:44,189
Saying this might lead to
us being unable to remain friends.

388
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:48,268
Then don't say it.

389
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:49,268
Wait a moment.

390
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:55,389
I just don't want to lie to you,
so I'll tell you.

391
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:56,869
- Don't...
- Well, I am the Fourth Prince.

392
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:07,708
I thought it was a big deal.
You're the Fourth... Prince?

393
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:11,268
You are the Emperor's son?

394
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:16,869
That day, I ran into you
at Yuanyang Temple with my grandmother.

395
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,429
After I left the palace,
I had been at Lord Ling's mansion.

396
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,589
The Young Lord lied to you

397
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:22,988
all to conceal my identity.

398
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:25,589
I've been looking for an opportunity
to be honest with you all.

399
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,589
But then you said that you do not like
people from noble families.

400
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:32,028
I feared that you might ignore me
after discovering my true identity.

401
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,268
How could I?

402
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,228
You don't blame me?

403
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:36,708
Of course not.

404
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,589
Even though you are from a noble family,

405
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:40,949
you're different from them.

406
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,189
Whether you are the Lord's son

407
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:43,468
or the son of the Emperor,

408
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:44,949
to me, it's all the same.

409
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:49,949
You scared me earlier.
I've been nervous all day.

410
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:52,708
Can you keep this a secret for me?

411
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,189
If my identity is exposed,
my grandmother

412
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:55,468
will not let me leave the palace.

413
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,909
As martial-world people,
we are tight-lipped. Just rest assured.

414
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,708
Then there's one more thing.

415
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:02,268
- Say it.
- I like you.

416
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:37,988
I haven't finished yet.

417
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:40,548
M-My mother is calling me home
for dinner.

418
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:42,829
I can tell you along the way.

419
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,949
There's no need. Look over there.

420
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,708
Keling, the first time I saw you,

421
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:49,909
I fell in love with you.

422
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,708
I left the palace just to look for you.

423
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:56,189
I consider myself lucky
to have found you so quickly.

424
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:58,949
We soon became friends.

425
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:02,149
I learned how to drink,
climb over walls, and fight.

426
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,149
Although I kept getting hurt,

427
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:07,869
as long as I'm with you, I'm happy.

428
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:12,389
Are you crazy?

429
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:30,508
Look.

430
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:37,189
To ensure our absolutely fair plan

431
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,909
can proceed smoothly,

432
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:41,068
I declare that from today onwards,

433
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:43,468
we will start taking turns doing chores.

434
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:46,748
Where is Chun Keling?

435
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,228
She sneaked out
over the wall this morning.

436
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:50,869
That's fine. Leave her task to her.

437
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:53,068
Moreover, to avoid you saying

438
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,228
that I only give orders.

439
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,988
Starting today,
I will take turns working with you.

440
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:59,869
It's fair.

441
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,708
Now, let me arrange the work.

442
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,268
Master and Peilan are in charge
of the pharmacy affairs.

443
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:07,028
The rest of us
take care of the chores at home.

444
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,508
Yes?

445
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,829
What can I do at the pharmacy, Banxia?

446
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:14,708
Master will check the patients,
and you will prepare the medicines.

447
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:18,149
Peilan, the pharmacy is our livelihood,
so it is important to manage it well.

448
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:20,109
But I don't know medicine.

449
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:22,909
Peilan, you can't do cooking only
in your entire life, right?

450
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,988
Moreover, the work at the pharmacy
is relatively light.

451
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:27,068
The work at the pharmacy is not light.

452
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:30,228
You've been interested in herbs
since you were a child, so you...

453
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:35,389
Peilan, if I can do it,
you definitely can as well.

454
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,068
You have to believe in yourself
and make some changes.

455
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:41,708
Next up are Chun Jinrong and Lu Buping.

456
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:43,228
You will chop firewood
and prepare dinner.

457
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,748
And I will be responsible
for making lunch and cleaning.

458
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:47,829
These are today's work tasks.
Any objections?

459
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:51,708
Wait a moment, Chun Banxia.
I can't cook.

460
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:53,068
Me neither.

461
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,829
If you can't cook...

462
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:58,508
Mother, look at her.
She's making me cook.

463
00:21:58,548 --> 00:21:59,949
This family is not under my charge.

464
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:01,189
What I say doesn't count.

465
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:04,829
Besides, shouldn't you
cook a meal for everyone?

466
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:13,669
Mother, are you really not planning
to be in charge anymore?

467
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:15,748
These are our tasks for today.

468
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:17,349
- Everyone, let's get moving.
- Let's move.

469
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:20,068
- Master, I will go learn with you now.
- Okay.

470
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,589
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

471
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,548
Familiarize yourself
with the environment.

472
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:24,468
I will chop the firewood.

473
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:25,788
Get familiar first.

474
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:28,708
Alright, but where do I start to learn?

475
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,949
Actually, a pharmacy and a kitchen
are quite similar.

476
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:34,389
Chun Jinrong, get moving!

477
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:43,228
Master, could you please look at this?
What herb is this?

478
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,429
Astragalus. It's good for the spleen
and helps with energy.

479
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,068
Astragalus. It's good for the spleen
and helps with energy.

480
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:53,508
Have you felt dizzy recently?

481
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:56,349
Good for the spleen, and what again?

482
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,189
Good for the spleen
and helps with energy.

483
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:01,268
- Good for the spleen. That's all.
- Okay.

484
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:02,268
Good for the spleen.

485
00:23:02,268 --> 00:23:03,508
- Just remember this.
- Okay.

486
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,589
Good for the spleen. Asparagus...

487
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:07,629
What is asparagus used for, Master?

488
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:11,468
It's astragalus!

489
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:14,068
Astragalus. Astragalus.

490
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:19,109
Is the firewood lit?

491
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:20,708
It smokes but doesn't catch fire.

492
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:22,629
How does Peilan usually deal with it?

493
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:23,909
She usually lights the fire,

494
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:25,429
and I just need to throw firewood in.

495
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:26,869
Haven't you observed?

496
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:28,149
Can you do it or not?

497
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:29,389
How about we switch roles?

498
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,589
Just blow it hard. Come on.

499
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:39,349
Is my medicine ready?

500
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:41,909
Wait a minute. I'll check right now.

501
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:44,829
Master, come and look.

502
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:46,109
It's time to prepare the medicine.

503
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:47,748
- Peilan, calm down.
- It's still not ready?

504
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:49,349
It will be ready soon.

505
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:50,508
- Okay.
- It's not done yet?

506
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:51,829
Cnidium monnieri...

507
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:53,988
Doctor, you haven't finished
checking on me yet.

508
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,389
Wait a second. We're coming.

509
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:56,949
- It will be done soon.
- How much longer?

510
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:58,228
Can you hurry up?

511
00:23:58,308 --> 00:23:59,189
Hurry up, doctor.

512
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,149
It will be soon.

513
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,629
Doctor, maybe I should
go to another place.

514
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:02,669
Does she need asparagus?

515
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,748
She doesn't need asparagus!
No one needs that.

516
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,068
- Stay still.
- Okay.

517
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,708
- Stay here and don't move.
- I won't move.

518
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:08,589
- Just don't move.
- Okay.

519
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:12,669
Can I put the ingredients in now?

520
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,268
The oil temperature
should be okay now, right?

521
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:16,508
Then I will put them in.

522
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,468
W-W-Wait.

523
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,829
Go on.

524
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:22,429
Three, two, one.

525
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,429
Today, I did the work
of two people alone.

526
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,109
And I finished it all.

527
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:49,869
And you? You either
got the wrong medicine at the pharmacy

528
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:53,629
or at home... What is this?

529
00:24:58,028 --> 00:25:02,708
The dinner. I've cooked it.
Whether it can be eaten is up to you.

530
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:06,508
We cooked this meal
at the risk of our lives.

531
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:10,429
Not knowing it
is never an excuse for not doing well.

532
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,988
You really need
to reflect on yourselves.

533
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:15,268
Chun Banxia, you need to stop now.

534
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,589
I've told you long ago

535
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:18,829
that I can't cook.

536
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,708
Right. I also tried my best.

537
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:23,829
Banxia, please don't make me
go to the pharmacy anymore.

538
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,068
I really can't do that.

539
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:26,389
Peilan, actually, I think

540
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:27,508
you did pretty well.

541
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:30,629
Master, stop saying that.
I'm really scared.

542
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,829
What if I gave the wrong medicine
to someone? It could kill people.

543
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:37,268
Also, don't make me cook anymore.
It could kill people too.

544
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,988
- I...
- Let's have dinner.

545
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:46,268
W-W-What is this?

546
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:48,589
It's all burned. Is it even edible?

547
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:51,068
Mother, please talk to Chun Banxia

548
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,468
and let her stop tormenting all of us.

549
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:56,800
Mrs. Chun, please do something about it.

550
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:00,869
You have caused enough trouble.
It's about time to stop.

551
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:02,429
I won't.

552
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:05,189
In my life as Chun Banxia,

553
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:06,949
I've never given up.

554
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:10,949
Tomorrow, I will definitely
give all of you a satisfactory solution

555
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:12,988
and a thorough plan.

556
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:16,149
I won't let any one of you
make fun of me.

557
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:21,669
No one is making fun of you.

558
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:44,068
After trying and failing
these past two days,

559
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:47,189
I've deeply reflected on myself.

560
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,748
I think I've been too lenient on you.

561
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:56,028
So, starting today,

562
00:26:56,429 --> 00:26:59,189
I'm going to personally supervise
each one of you working.

563
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:02,068
Those who do well will be rewarded.

564
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:04,429
Those who don't will be punished.

565
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:08,068
The rules will be strictly carried out.
And I have the final say in the house.

566
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:12,068
Banxia, stop. This isn't good.

567
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:13,949
Mother!

568
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:16,068
No, I'm not emotional right now.

569
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,949
I'm seriously talking to you right now.

570
00:27:18,189 --> 00:27:21,508
I think your arrangements
are somewhat unreasonable.

571
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:22,949
I-I mean...

572
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:25,468
Well, can I give you some advice?

573
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:31,629
During your time in charge,
you didn't listen to anyone's advice.

574
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:34,068
So, I don't need your advice.

575
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:44,669
Lu Buping, you haven't finished
chopping the firewood yet?

576
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,508
- Half of it is chopped.
- No dinner for you.

577
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:49,909
You sound just like your mother now.

578
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:51,149
Say that again?

579
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:55,949
Banxia, be nice and don't get mad.

580
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,548
It's none of your business, Master.

581
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:59,308
Just do your own work well.

582
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:03,149
I've dried all these herbs.

583
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,028
Then go to the pharmacy.

584
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:08,109
It's getting late.
Are we making money or not?

585
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:12,669
You sound exactly like your mother now.

586
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,149
Did your mother send you
to say that to me?

587
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:16,708
She doesn't need to do that.

588
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:19,149
You are not young anymore, Master.

589
00:28:19,189 --> 00:28:21,669
You should know yourself
if we don't say it.

590
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:25,109
You've already taken 20% of the profits
of the pharmacy. Isn't it enough?

591
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:36,748
Oh God, can you see my grievance?

592
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:42,669
Look what you did to Master.

593
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,589
Shut up or leave.

594
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:59,109
Chun Jinrong,
how can you mop the floor like this?

595
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:00,589
I'm doing it the right way.

596
00:29:02,468 --> 00:29:03,468
Who are you yelling at?

597
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,389
You.

598
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:08,109
If you're so capable, you do it.

599
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:10,189
Chun Jinrong, tell you what,

600
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:11,589
don't talk to me with a temper.

601
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:14,949
Chun Banxia,
don't talk to me in our mother's tone.

602
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:16,389
Stop arguing.

603
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:18,189
Well, I'll mop it later.
Jinrong, go rest first.

604
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:20,189
Peilan, how many times have I told you?

605
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:22,109
You're not allowed to do the work
that you shouldn't do.

606
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:23,429
Peilan, don't interfere.

607
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:29,909
Chun Banxia, listen to me. I quit.

608
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:31,068
Jinrong.

609
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:34,589
Chun Jinrong, tell you what,
I have the final say in this house.

610
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:36,109
I'll mop the floor.

611
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:37,629
Leave it to her.

612
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:41,988
It's okay, B-Banxia.

613
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:52,949
You always talk about fairness.
Have you achieved it?

614
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:55,429
Which one have you done

615
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:57,508
the tasks I gave you well?
How dare you accuse me?

616
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:02,869
Peilan, do you think
her ridiculous plan will work?

617
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:06,949
I don't know.

618
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:09,429
I just think it's not quite reasonable.

619
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:12,508
Reasonable?

620
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:16,429
Do you know that I stay so late
to make the plan every day

621
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:18,068
that I can't get enough sleep?

622
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,988
Every day, I have to do
the work of two people.

623
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,429
I also have to worry about
whether your tasks have been done well

624
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:24,068
and whether the monthly pocket money
is ready.

625
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:26,109
Every day,
my mind is full of these things.

626
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:27,748
I don't have time to read books anymore.

627
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:29,748
My throat hurts
because I argue with you.

628
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,589
Now you talk about being reasonable?

629
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:39,829
Banxia, I really don't know
how to prepare medicine.

630
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,349
And the recognition of herbs
is too difficult for me.

631
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:43,708
As for the tasks you talked about,

632
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:45,349
I can finish them by myself
in half a day.

633
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:46,869
We don't need so many people for them.

634
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:50,589
Miss Banxia, you always let us do work
we're not good at.

635
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:52,109
You either deliberately
want us to mess up

636
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:53,268
or your plans are flawed.

637
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:56,068
What's it to you? Either do it or leave.

638
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,389
Banxia, before I came here,

639
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,109
I meditated calmly for a while.

640
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:02,669
I think when a person really wants

641
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:04,349
to do well at something,

642
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:05,869
they often end up doing it poorly.

643
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:08,268
Just lower your burden
and look at the whole picture,

644
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:09,949
and perhaps you could do better.

645
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:11,708
Am I not doing well enough?

646
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:14,629
What should I do to improve?

647
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,949
Are you guys doing well?
Would I be this upset

648
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:18,909
if you were?

649
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:24,268
God, she wasn't like this
before she took charge.

650
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:29,508
What's going on?
What are you arguing about?

651
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:30,708
We have different opinions.

652
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:32,109
Mrs. Chun, please come and sit down.

653
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:33,149
What's it to you?

654
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:35,189
Either do it or leave.

655
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:38,109
Mother, Chun Banxia has lost her mind.

656
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,829
Alright, is it all Banxia's fault?

657
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:43,149
Each of you can't even do a bit of work.

658
00:31:46,468 --> 00:31:48,829
And you, Banxia,
weren't you the most reasonable one?

659
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:50,869
Why have you also
started to scold them now?

660
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:55,629
Alright, it's getting late.

661
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:58,109
Lu Buping, go sweep the courtyard.

662
00:31:58,109 --> 00:31:59,629
Chun Jinrong, go out and buy some food.

663
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:01,829
Peilan, tidy up the kitchen.

664
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:05,708
See? I think this arrangement

665
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:07,949
is very reasonable.

666
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:10,669
- You're everywhere.
- You're everywhere.

667
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:15,589
Alright, tidy up and prepare for dinner.

668
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:31,872
Here.

669
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:34,349
Eat first.

670
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:37,268
Still feeling wronged?

671
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:41,109
I did nothing wrong.

672
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:44,228
Nobody said you did anything wrong.

673
00:32:44,748 --> 00:32:46,389
But others
didn't do anything wrong either.

674
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,669
How did they not?
If they had followed my plan,

675
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:53,068
this chaos wouldn't have happened.

676
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:56,189
When I was in charge,
I thought the same way.

677
00:32:56,228 --> 00:32:58,349
I also hoped
that you all could listen to me.

678
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:01,589
But did you all listen? Did you listen?

679
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:04,669
It's all Chun Jinrong's fault.

680
00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:09,228
Even if you think so,
she is still your sister.

681
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:12,468
Today you quarrel, and tomorrow
you still have to eat at the same table.

682
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:17,429
Home is a place
for affection, not reason.

683
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:20,748
Everyone has their own role
and contribution in a family.

684
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,268
What did she contribute?

685
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,468
She contributed nothing to this family.

686
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:26,988
Tell me,

687
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:30,228
who combed your hair into braids
for the first time?

688
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,748
When you were little,
to provide for you,

689
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:42,349
I sold tofu outside,

690
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:44,468
and Peilan did housework at home.

691
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,669
I didn't have the time
for you and Keling.

692
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:48,468
It was Jinrong who helped
take care of you two.

693
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:51,988
You think she didn't contribute anything
to this family, but the truth is,

694
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:54,349
she has been held back due to the family

695
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:56,669
and hasn't gotten married till now.

696
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:00,748
That's not true. It's because
she wants to marry a wealthy man.

697
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,268
She wants to marry into a rich family.

698
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,429
With the three of you
as burdens at home,

699
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,189
who wouldn't shake their heads
at the sight of her?

700
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:12,869
Jinrong said

701
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,389
if she could marry into a rich family,

702
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,949
the dowry she gets
would be enough for all three of you.

703
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:29,468
Mother!

704
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:31,188
Keep it down.

705
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:39,749
But I just had a fight with her.

706
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:58,468
Keling! Keling, don't cry.

707
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:02,108
Keling, don't cry.

708
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:03,068
Stop crying.

709
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:05,988
Sister, a mouse has bitten my book.

710
00:35:06,508 --> 00:35:09,028
A mouse? Then I will catch it.

711
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,309
Look after her.

712
00:35:16,668 --> 00:35:19,749
Banxia. Banxia.

713
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:22,068
Peilan.

714
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,108
Are you okay?

715
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,429
I'm fine.

716
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:29,028
I spoke a little harshly yesterday.

717
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:30,588
Don't take it to heart.

718
00:35:32,188 --> 00:35:33,468
I'm really fine, Peilan.

719
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:36,028
Banxia? Banxia?

720
00:35:37,548 --> 00:35:40,628
Jinrong said Chang'an Lane
has a new silk shop.

721
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:41,789
Let's go and take a look.

722
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:43,988
You guys go. I'm not going.

723
00:35:44,188 --> 00:35:46,668
Let's go and buy some new clothes.

724
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:49,988
Just go, Banxia.

725
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:51,508
Go shopping with Mother and Jinrong,

726
00:35:51,508 --> 00:35:53,349
and change your mood.

727
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,588
I'll pay today.

728
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:57,628
If you miss it,
you will miss it forever.

729
00:35:58,508 --> 00:36:00,349
If she is paying, I'll go.

730
00:36:00,668 --> 00:36:01,548
Go. Give it to me.

731
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:02,548
Let's go.

732
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:33,429
I dare not kill people.

733
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,869
I can only set fire.

734
00:36:51,188 --> 00:36:52,588
Li Tengyun,

735
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:54,988
how could you do such outrageous things?

736
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,468
Maybe I should just admit
that I started the fire.

737
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,588
If the fire didn't ignite,
it's not my business anymore.

738
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:42,829
Aren't you tired from shopping?

739
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:45,869
Shopping makes me happy.
Aren't you happy?

740
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,068
Jinrong bought you
so many clothes today.

741
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:50,588
She spent a lot of money.

742
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:54,644
(Jianglin)

743
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:58,309
You've loved the color blue
since childhood.

744
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:00,548
You can pair them
with a pair of blue shoes.

745
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,068
I'm sorry, Jinrong.

746
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:04,896
It's okay.

747
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,628
Mother, did you hear that?
Banxia apologized to me.

748
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:12,108
Look, whose house is on fire?

749
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:14,789
Such thick smoke.

750
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,349
I guess the house would be wasted.

751
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:17,829
Who is so unlucky?

752
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,108
What a pity.

753
00:38:21,028 --> 00:38:23,389
Mother, it seems to be our area.

754
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:27,628
Make way!

755
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:32,349
Fire! Fire!
