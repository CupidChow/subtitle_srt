(Mr. Lu.)

35

In the next life,

36
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,521
you can be Chun Peilan

37
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:20,521
and I'll be Lu Buping.

38
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,882
Then I can protect you.

39
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:40,041
Morning, Master.

40
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:40,882
Morning, Buping.

41
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,201
Master, have you seen Peilan?

42
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,641
Ruyu took her on a blind date.

43
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:46,962
A blind date?

44
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,801
Shouldn't it be Chun Jinrong?

45
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:50,682
Why is Peilan going?

46
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:53,282
Maybe she's more popular.

47
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:54,682
Peilan is a nice girl,

48
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,002
virtuous and sweet.

49
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,641
Of course, she can be popular.

50
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,361
Thank you.

51
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,641
Eat regularly and avoid greasy food.

53

Okay.

54
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:15,041
See you.

55
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:18,521
Hello.

56
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:22,601
Are you here for a doctor or medicine?

57
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,521
You must be Dr. Guo.

58
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,041
You are...

59
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:28,122
I am Shopkeeper Wu

60
00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:29,562
from Baohe Clinic.

61
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,882
I've heard so much about you.

62
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,521
Me too.

63
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,081
Please sit.

64
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:35,242
No need.

65
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:36,842
You...

66
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:37,562
Dr. Guo.

67
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,282
Have you recently cured a patient

68
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,041
with sensitivity to light in the eyes?

69
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:43,801
Sensitivity to light?

70
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:46,041
And with tongue ulcer.

71
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:46,921
Yeah.

72
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,122
Yeah.

73
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,402
Dr. Guo.

74
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:50,962
To be honest,

75
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:51,962
that patient

76
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,801
has come to our Baohe Clinic.

77
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:54,682
But our doctors

78
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:56,122
couldn't cure him at all.

79
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:59,122
Later, I ran into him on the street.

80
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,962
He showed me your remedy.

81
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:04,562
That was impressive.

82
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,321
That patient was lucky.

83
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,682
You're flattering me.

84
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:11,722
Dr. Guo.

85
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:13,962
I guess I'll just get to the point.

86
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,041
I'm here

87
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:16,961
to invite you

88
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:18,922
to our Baohe Clinic.

89
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,042
I will pay you
ten taels of silver per month.

90
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:26,201
Annual bonus. Meals and dorm provided.

91
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,482
What do you think?

92
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:34,922
I aspire

93
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:36,482
to cure patients.

94
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,242
I don't do this for the money.

95
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:40,201
Well...

96
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,841
I'm here to tend to my family.

97
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:44,721
You see? So...

98
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:46,201
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,442
Well...

100
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:52,002
Dr. Guo.

101
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,042
Please think about it twice.

102
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,882
I'll wait for the good news.

103
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,641
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

104
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:04,201
Banxia, you're back.

105
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:06,721
Master.

106
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:07,922
Who's that?

107
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:12,401
Shopkeeper Wu from Baohe Clinic.

108
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:13,521
Baohe Clinic?

109
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,761
The biggest clinic in Jianglin?

110
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:17,482
What does he want?

111
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:20,442
He invited me to join them

112
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,281
as a doctor.

113
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:24,281
Really?

114
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,761
You're so famous.

115
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:28,641
Don't tell the others.

116
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,841
They may get worried.

117
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,042
Why would they?

118
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,401
They'd be so happy.

119
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:33,802
Just do as I say.

120
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,482
You inspected Zhang's calf?

121
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,281
I inspected Zhang's son Carl,

122
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:42,161
not their calf.

123
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:43,161
I'm a doctor,

124
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,442
not a vet.

125
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:45,521
Seriously?

126
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:47,401
I thought you'd inspect anything.

127
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:48,602
I learned it from you.

128
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,329
Well, my heart is racing.

129

(Spring River Restaurant)

130
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:11,034
Young Lord, why did you

131
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:12,594
invite me over?

132
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:17,115
Miss Jinrong, you're a clever girl.

133
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,115
I bet you know

134
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,995
why I invited you here.

135
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:27,755
To be honest,

136
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:30,794
I felt close to you

137
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:32,755
the first time we met.

138
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,714
I had a feeling that

139
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:37,675
we'd meet again.

140
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:39,115
Do you believe that?

141
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:43,755
Miss Jinrong, you're being modest.

142
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,115
Didn't you

143
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,755
see it coming?

144
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:51,274
That's not true.

145
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:54,234
In that case,

146
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,594
I'll be honest with you.

147
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:00,995
I want to be your friend.

148
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:04,794
Young Lord,
you're getting straight to the point.

149
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,354
We're both smart.

150
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:09,115
Let's stop

151
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,794
beating around the bush.

152
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:13,714
Just tell me what you want.

153
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,474
(The Young Lord)

154
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:18,914
(is truly different
from ordinary young men.)

155
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:20,995
What can I possibly want?

156
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:22,594
At my age,

157
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,515
all I want is someone

158
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:26,755
who loves me wholeheartedly.

159
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:36,594
Didn't you already find that person?

160
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:41,195
I didn't expect you
to be so straightforward.

161
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:42,474
In that case,

162
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,354
I'll make a statement.

163
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:46,794
I'll say yes.

164
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,755
Alright, so straightforward.

165
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:55,435
In that case,

166
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:57,075
Miss Jinrong,

167
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,435
let's drink.

168
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,354
From now on,

169
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,594
we will be in the same boat.

170
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:12,714
It takes a hundred years
to cross on the same boat.

171
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:14,394
A hundred years?

172
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:18,675
It seems that we're bound by fate.

173
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:20,435
Come on.

174
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:30,474
Aren't you drinking?

175
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:34,874
It's the trend, huh?

176
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:36,275
Okay.

177
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:42,555
Young Lord.

178
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:45,114
I'm very straightforward.

179
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,955
Will you find me frivolous?

180
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,114
Of course not.

181
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,555
That's what I want.

182
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:51,795
That's what you...

183
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,675
In that case,

184
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,195
I can rest assured.

185
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:03,754
(What was that?)

186
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:05,795
(Is she trying to seduce me?)

187
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,795
Young Lord, it's such a happy day.

188
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,275
Why don't we drink more?

189
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:13,555
No, thanks.

190
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,594
We've talked business.

191
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:15,675
I can rest assured.

192
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:16,634
I'm going back.

193
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:17,675
See you around.

194
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:20,114
Enjoy the food.

195
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,514
Adorable.

196
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,915
Why hasn't she come back yet?

197
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,435
Peilan, come here.

198
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:35,634
Mr. Lu.

199
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:36,994
So good to see you.

200
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:40,714
You went on a blind date?

201
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:41,514
Yeah.

202
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:44,714
How... did it go?

203
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:46,075
It was fine.

204
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,035
It was fine?

205
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:51,555
He likes you?

206
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:53,795
Or do you like him?

207
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:56,435
Neither.

208
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:58,915
You're back, Peilan.

209
00:09:59,114 --> 00:09:59,834
Master.

210
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:01,315
Where's your mother?

211
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:02,955
She went to get candles for my father.

212
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,315
How was the blind date?

213
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,395
He's a handsome young man, huh?

214
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:08,195
Mr. Zhao didn't come.

215
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,795
Uncle Zhao came alone.

216
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:12,315
What kind of blind date was that?

217
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:14,234
Uncle Zhao is into my mother.

218
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,555
But my mother got it wrong.

219
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:19,395
What?

220
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:21,234
It's so random.

221
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:22,555
What did Ruyu say?

222
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:23,155
Yeah.

223
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:24,675
She didn't say anything.

224
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,315
Master, I'll go cook.

225
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:28,714
Go ahead.

226
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:32,795
That was unexpected.

227
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:34,354
But it makes sense.

228
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,435
Mrs. Chun is hardworking and kind.

229
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:37,634
She can be popular.

230
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:42,675
That old man.

231
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:44,634
How dare he go for Ruyu?

232
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:54,234
You're all here.

233
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,155
Why are you so happy?

234
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:00,834
It's that obvious?

235
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:05,514
Mother.

236
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:07,834
Once it's settled,

237
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,955
I'll surprise you.

238
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:11,915
Mrs. Chun.

239
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:13,075
So you've been visiting

240
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:14,075
the Marriage Bridge

241
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:15,754
every day for yourself.

242
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:17,315
Shut up and eat.

243
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:18,195
Or get out.

244
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:19,435
Food is ready.

245
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,234
All made by Peilan.

246
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:23,354
Try her dishes.

247
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,035
Peilan, the rice cake will be ready.

248
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:26,514
Sit and eat. I'll bring it here.

249
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:28,435
And why are you so happy?

250
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:30,834
Am I?

251
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:32,795
I don't think so.

252
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:38,035
Mother, Peilan told me everything.

253
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,395
Why are you embarrassed?

254
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,315
What does that old man do?

255
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:44,195
Stop asking.

256
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,714
He owns a tailor shop.

257
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:46,555
Stop answering.

258
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,315
Just eat.

259
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:49,395
Shut up.

260
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,275
Mother, why are you mad?

261
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,915
Everyone is free to pursue happiness.

262
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:56,075
If you find that tailor fine,

263
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:57,075
you can be with him.

264
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:57,915
I support you.

265
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,634
It's not so bad to run a tailor shop.

266
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,714
You can't stop your destiny

267
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:04,675
once it comes for you.

268
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:08,955
Mother, Uncle Zhao looks kind to me.

269
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:10,915
And he has a dozen shops in the towns

270
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:12,435
around Jianglin.

271
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,075
Uncle Zhao is so capable?

272
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,834
Now he's "Uncle Zhao",

273
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,234
not "old man"?

274
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:19,555
It's all about money, huh?

275
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:20,555
Of course.

276
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:22,234
"Uncle" is the title for the capable.

277
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,795
The others are just "old men".

278
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:34,955
Today,

279
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,075
Shopkeeper Wu from Baohe Clinic

280
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:39,915
visited me.

281
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:41,315
Master, didn't you tell me

282
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:42,714
to keep it a secret?

283
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:44,474
What did he want?

284
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:50,155
Well, why would you ask...

285
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,675
Let's eat.

286
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:54,955
Master, why did Mr. Wu visit you?

287
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:59,155
I cured a patient earlier.

288
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,555
He saw my remedy

289
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,955
and truly admired me.

290
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:05,075
He wants me to be a doctor there.

291
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,315
Ten taels of silver per month.

292
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:08,395
I politely turned him down.

293
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:10,714
Dr. Guo.

294
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,834
We're holding you back here.

295
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:14,114
No.

296
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:15,474
Great, Master.

297
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,634
I knew your talent would be recognized.

298
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:18,714
Yeah.

299
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:22,075
Ten taels of silver per month.
Good for you, Master.

300
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,155
It's just fine.

301
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,874
Master, I think you should go.

302
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:25,915
Seize the opportunity.

303
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,275
People always strive upward.

304
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,514
Not really.

305
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:30,075
You're still learning.

306
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:32,634
Jiren Pharmacy needs me.

307
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:35,075
This is our only source of income.

308
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,594
It's the most important thing.

309
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:39,075
Please, just go.

310
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:40,275
Would you decline

311
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:41,155
such a great offer?

312
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,675
Ruyu, I swear.

313
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:46,035
Nothing matters more

314
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,195
to me than you guys.

315
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:50,955
Uncle Zhao said that as well.

316
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:51,714
Really?

317
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,035
What else did he say?

318
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:53,795
He also said

319
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,075
that he wouldn't mind anything

320
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:55,955
about our family.

321
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,675
I bet he doesn't know about us.

322
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:01,915
Quiet.

323
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:11,898
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

324
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:17,315
What was Miss Jinrong trying to do?

325
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:18,915
What's wrong, Young Lord?

326
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:20,234
Come on, sit.

327
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:21,435
Let's talk.

328
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:26,114
In the beginning,

329
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,035
we were getting along.

330
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:29,514
But then,

331
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:30,915
I felt that she was

332
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:32,555
kind of seducing me.

333
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:34,955
Seducing you?

334
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:38,195
Maybe she was just friendly.

335
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:46,634
See? You call that "friendly"?

336
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:48,435
It doesn't look like it.

337
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:51,675
It doesn't make sense.

338
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,634
Miss Jinrong has already

339
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,195
attracted the Fourth Prince.

340
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,915
Why would she seduce you?

341
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,634
I see, Young Lord.

342
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,675
The Fourth Prince is testing you.

343
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:08,555
Testing me?

344
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:09,435
Yeah.

345
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:10,795
He's testing your loyalty

346
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,395
with the girl he loves.

347
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,714
He wants to see if you'll betray him.

348
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,075
Oh no.

349
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:17,955
I'm doomed.

350
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:18,994
What's wrong, Young Lord?

351
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:19,514
I...

352
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:21,275
I had cross-cupped wine with her.

353
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:21,915
Is that fine?

354
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,435
How could you do that?

355
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:26,155
She suddenly reached over.

356
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,714
I thought it was the trend.

357
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,275
Why didn't you avoid it?

358
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:31,435
Young Lord, you lack self-respect.

359
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:32,435
Honestly, you...

360
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,435
Oh no.

361
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:36,994
I ruined everything in the end.

362
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:37,994
Young Lord.

363
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:39,395
Calm down.

364
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:40,634
Maybe, Miss Jinrong

365
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:42,354
hasn't told the Fourth Prince.

366
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:44,114
Let's see what he thinks first.

367
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:45,874
Good point.

368
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:47,714
Let's go now.

369
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,155
Your Highness.

370
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:54,114
Your...

371
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:57,514
What's going on?

372
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:01,275
His Highness
is going back to the palace.

373
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:02,075
Going back?

374
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,075
Wait. Stop.

375
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:05,514
Get out.

376
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:06,155
Now.

377
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:07,555
Hurry.

378
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:11,114
Your Highness.

379
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:12,634
Why are you suddenly

380
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:13,795
going back to the palace?

381
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:17,114
Is there some kind of
misunderstanding between us?

382
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:20,514
It's making me so sad.

383
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,075
Please forgive me.

384
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:22,955
I-I...

385
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:26,075
Your Highness,
Young Lord didn't do it on purpose.

386
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:28,275
What does it have to do with you?

387
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,195
Get up.

388
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:34,155
Brother.

389
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:37,634
Do you believe that
all officials are bad?

390
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:40,915
Are their families

391
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:42,315
really so unacceptable?

392
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:45,035
Your Highness, what do you mean?

393
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:47,594
I came

394
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,514
all the way here from the palace.

395
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:50,435
But she...

396
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:51,555
What about her?

397
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:52,955
Never mind.

398
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,234
Well,

399
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:56,395
thank you
for taking care of me these days.

400
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,795
Say goodbye to Lord Ling for me.

401
00:16:57,955 --> 00:16:59,795
No, Your Highness, you can't leave.

402
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:02,915
Send those to the Chun family.

403
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:05,155
Your Highness.

404
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:06,635
Please talk to me.

405
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,034
What's going on?

406
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:09,675
I just think that

407
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,074
she may not be the one for me.

408
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,714
She will be once you get along.

409
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:13,754
Don't just give up.

410
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:15,955
Try to solve the problems, right?

411
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,395
Brother,

412
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:19,955
I'm a few months

413
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:21,435
older than you no matter what.

414
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:22,554
I'm not bragging.

415
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:24,514
But I'm experienced
with ladies. Seriously.

416
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:25,595
I know they sometimes

417
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:26,435
look sensual...

418
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:27,355
"Sensitive".

419
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:29,714
She may seem wavering,

420
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:30,955
but she loves you for sure.

421
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:31,474
Right?

422
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:32,355
Yeah.

423
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,595
Your Highness, don't get paranoid.

424
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:36,714
Maybe she didn't make herself clear.

425
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:38,115
But...

426
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:38,875
There's no "but".

427
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:39,714
I got your back.

428
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:41,034
Listen, wait for me.

429
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:41,835
I'll do it now.

430
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:42,355
I'll fix it.

431
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,074
Trust me.

432
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:44,195
D-Don't go.

433
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:45,875
Don't go, Your Highness.

434
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:52,474
(Jiren Pharmacy)
Master, trust me.

435
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,595
I can manage the pharmacy well.

436
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,514
Well, you still have

437
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,635
a lot to learn and memorize.

438
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:01,034
I don't want to

439
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,595
hold you back.

440
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,595
Besides, Baohe Clinic is close by.

441
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:05,435
I can consult you

442
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:06,435
and come back here

443
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:07,395
if I have questions.

444
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:09,115
You don't have to worry about me.

445
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:10,115
Ruyu.

446
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,554
I was confused.

447
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,474
I mean,

448
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,155
should I have kept Ruyu in the dark?

449
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:24,435
You should tell her.

450
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:26,395
Honestly, she treats you poorly.

451
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:27,915
You should have left a long time ago.

452
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,115
You didn't have a place

453
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:30,835
to settle down in Jianglin.

454
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:31,635
But now you do.

455
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:32,835
So spread your wings.

456
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:37,355
No, I think I'll tuck my wings in.

457
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:38,675
Master.

458
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,474
You know what your biggest problem is?

459
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:43,074
You're indecisive.

460
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:45,554
A man should have great ambitions.

461
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:46,955
How can you give up

462
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:48,395
this opportunity for a love affair?

463
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:49,155
Alright.

464
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,595
Banxia, enough. I won't go.

465
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:52,395
Master, just go.

466
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,514
Stop hesitating.

467
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:54,355
Honestly.

468
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:56,234
I've packed your things.

469
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:58,395
And I've thrown away
your quilt in the woodshed.

470
00:18:58,435 --> 00:18:59,395
You got carried away.

471
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:00,714
Listen to me.

472
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:01,514
Master.

473
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:05,195
Fly, fly. Spread your wings and fly.

474
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,754
Zhensheng, be brave.

475
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,595
I will follow your steps.

476
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:10,595
Zhensheng, be brave.

477
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:12,595
I will follow your steps.

478
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:14,835
Zhensheng, be brave.

479
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,835
I will follow your steps.

480
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,714
You got this.

481
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:21,355
How did it happen?

482
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:25,835
That wasn't my plan.

483
00:19:28,474 --> 00:19:29,435
Great.

484
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,234
Now I don't even have quilts.

485
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:35,274
Master.

486
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,274
I was looking for you.

487
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,435
Master.

488
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:42,074
You turned down
the offer of Baohe Clinic.

489
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:43,155
I think you did well.

490
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,355
You think so?

491
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:49,875
Ten taels? That's nothing.

492
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,955
He wants you there.

493
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:54,435
We should seize the chance
and ask for more.

494
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,595
It's not important.

495
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:58,675
Ask for 15 taels at least.

496
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:00,955
If you don't care about the money,

497
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,714
keep ten taels for yourself

498
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:05,635
and I'll keep the rest for you.

499
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:07,635
That's not what I care about.

500
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:10,155
Perfect. That's what I care about.

501
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,714
I've made a deal on your behalf.

502
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,635
You can go to Baohe Clinic tomorrow.

503
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,994
I swear it's not my plan.

504
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:19,074
Look how happy you are.

505
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:22,195
Dr. Guo from Baohe Clinic.

506
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:23,875
Five taels. Remember.

507
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:42,754
Are you okay?

508
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,474
Why are you so careless, Lu Buping?

509
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,195
What are you talking about, Mr. Lu?

510
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:53,034
This is what you said.

511
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:55,074
When I was poisoned,

512
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:56,875
you burned paper offerings and said

513
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:59,675
that I should be
Chun Peilan in the next life

514
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,074
and you should be Lu Buping.

515
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:02,474
I thought

516
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:04,835
I was hallucinating
because of the mushrooms.

517
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:07,234
I said that?

518
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:08,835
Yes, you did.

519
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:11,875
Mr. Lu.

520
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:13,675
I was also poisoned.

521
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:14,714
Whatever I said,

522
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:15,835
don't take it to heart.

523
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:16,835
No, no.

524
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:19,115
You said it and I heard you.

525
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:22,234
And I've taken it
to the bottom of my heart.

526
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:26,714
Don't be shy or deny it.

527
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:29,395
I swear I don't remember.

528
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:32,474
You're lying.

529
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:35,234
No, I'm not.

530
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:37,754
You also said that you were a fish.

531
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:38,635
Remember?

532
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:40,714
A fish?

533
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:44,234
I said that?

534
00:21:48,314 --> 00:21:48,994
Hello, Master.

535
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:51,395
Well...

536
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,074
Master.

537
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:52,714
Peilan.

538
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:53,835
Listen.

539
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:55,395
Find me a quilt.

540
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:58,435
Banxia put mine somewhere.

541
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,514
For Baohe Clinic, right?

542
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:02,274
Alright, I'll pack it for you

543
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:03,875
and send it over with your clothes.

544
00:22:07,474 --> 00:22:09,474
You also want me to leave?

545
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:12,395
Of course not, Master.

546
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:14,435
But you'll live a better life there.

547
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:16,435
You've always been taking care of us.

548
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:18,554
It's time to take care of yourself.

549
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:20,395
I'd be selfish to stop you.

550
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:22,714
Master, go pursue your happy life.

551
00:22:22,754 --> 00:22:23,514
I support you.

552
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:24,794
Master.

553
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,835
I think you should go.

554
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:28,835
Mrs. Chun doesn't believe you.

555
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:29,994
You should prove it.

556
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,595
What should I prove?

557
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:34,915
What do men care about the most?

558
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:35,955
Our dignity.

559
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,994
Didn't Mrs. Chun say that
Baohe Clinic wouldn't want you?

560
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:39,915
You should go.

561
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:41,274
Not only that,

562
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:43,074
you have to thrive there.

563
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:46,635
Speaking of which,

564
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,074
with all that being said,

565
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:49,355
if you don't go there,

566
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,875
even I would doubt
whether they've invited you.

567
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:58,155
Master, good luck.

568
00:22:59,034 --> 00:22:59,595
You got this.

569
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:18,234
Are they seriously

570
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:19,754
fighting because of me?

571
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:22,195
It doesn't look like it.

572
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,635
Young Lord.

573
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:25,514
What are you going to do?

574
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:26,395
What do you mean?

575
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:28,435
You should fix it for me.

576
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:29,195
Yeah.

577
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:32,074
Young Lord, I have an idea.

578
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:35,155
Shall we get Miss Jinrong to stay here?

579
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:36,675
What?

580
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:37,595
Are you trying to

581
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:38,274
get me killed?

582
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:39,635
Young Lord, listen.

583
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:41,355
It's not for you.

584
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,395
We can invite Miss Jinrong here

585
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,675
so that the Fourth Prince

586
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,074
can enjoy her company here.

587
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:50,274
We can keep him here

588
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:52,355
and make the two sisters grow distant.

589
00:23:52,554 --> 00:23:54,794
We can kill two birds with one stone.

590
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:01,474
You're saying that

591
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,355
since we can't eliminate the trouble,

592
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,675
we should change a tactic

593
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:11,074
and try to gild the lily.

594
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,435
You're truly wise.

595
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:17,115
Mr. Li, I knew I was right about you.

596
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,355
I knew it.

597
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:19,835
Ouch.

598
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,955
I knew it.

599
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:48,754
Ruyu.

600
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,195
Get out.

601
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:54,994
Fine, I'll talk here.

602
00:24:57,074 --> 00:25:00,714
I lied to you.

603
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,234
Baohe Clinic didn't visit me.

604
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:05,274
The kids were talking.

605
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:06,835
I got a bit worked up

606
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:08,474
and wanted to show off.

607
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:09,915
So I made a joke.

608
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:11,714
But the kids bought into it.

609
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:13,474
I'm sorry.

610
00:25:14,274 --> 00:25:15,115
That's enough.

611
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:16,955
They told me the truth.

612
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:18,714
Honestly.

613
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:20,955
I used to hate you.

614
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:24,675
But you've been
living here for a long time.

615
00:25:25,395 --> 00:25:26,675
You may not

616
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:28,994
be such a decent man,

617
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:30,754
but you're a good doctor.

618
00:25:31,635 --> 00:25:32,115
Listen, I...

619
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:32,754
Get out.

620
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:35,435
You hate me. I totally get it.

621
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:36,675
I totally get it.

622
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,675
Don't feel guilty.

623
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,955
W-Why would I feel guilty?

624
00:25:41,395 --> 00:25:42,395
I know.

625
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:45,115
You keep hesitating and won't leave

626
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:48,675
because there's something
you can't let go.

627
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,234
Ruyu.

628
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:52,675
You know me.

629
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:56,635
It's because of this, huh?

630
00:25:58,115 --> 00:26:00,355
Rest assured.
I'm not that kind of person.

631
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:02,635
If you ever thrive there,

632
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:04,435
I won't use it against you.

633
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:05,714
That's not what I want.

634
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:07,234
That's not what I want.

635
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:10,435
That's not what I want.

636
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:11,635
Enough, Guo Zhensheng.

637
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:16,875
I really despise people like you.

638
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:18,115
You want it badly,

639
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:19,474
but you don't admit it.

640
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:21,115
Why are you so hypocritical?

641
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:22,395
Aren't you going to believe

642
00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:23,234
anything I say?

643
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:24,514
What do you want me to believe?

644
00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:25,435
You want me gone

645
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:26,514
no matter what?

646
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:28,074
Of course.

647
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:29,514
The further, the better.

648
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:34,355
Okay.

649
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:37,835
I'll go.

650
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:39,155
I may be gone,

651
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:41,234
but I'll always care about you guys.

652
00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:42,915
No matter

653
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:46,635
what difficulties you may encounter...

654
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:49,514
Guo Zhensheng,
can you please not jinx us?

655
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:54,074
I'm not trying to jinx you!

656
00:27:03,675 --> 00:27:04,395
Mother.

657
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:07,514
You really returned
the property deed to Master?

658
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,195
I don't really need it, anyway.

659
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:13,395
And it's like I'm mingling with him.

660
00:27:13,595 --> 00:27:14,595
Come on.

661
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:17,754
What if Master
gets kicked out and comes back?

662
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:19,274
You have to sign it again.

663
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:20,875
You want him to come back?

664
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:25,195
Guo Zhensheng is going to Baohe Clinic.

665
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:26,474
Banxia won't make as much

666
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:28,034
as before in the pharmacy.

667
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:29,714
I've decided to install the mill

668
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:30,754
and start selling tofu.

669
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:33,435
Mother, why did you bring it up again?

670
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:34,355
Well.

671
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,875
Mother, listen to me.

672
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:38,155
My life is going to change.

673
00:27:38,234 --> 00:27:40,115
Don't pull me back when it happens.

674
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:43,115
Mother, Mr. Li is here.

675
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:46,835
Greetings, Mrs. Chun.

676
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:51,714
You're the Young Lord's...

677
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,474
I'm the Young Lord's adviser.

678
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:55,875
Adviser?

679
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:58,635
Just like Zhuge Liang.

680
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:01,994
Is the Young Lord here?

681
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,435
No, he didn't come.

682
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:08,034
Is your youngest daughter home?

683
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:09,474
Keling?

684
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:10,754
She's not home.

685
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:12,794
No, no.

686
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,474
I'm here for Miss Jinrong.

687
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:15,955
Jinrong?

688
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:20,595
Young Lord would like to
invite Miss Jinrong over

689
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:21,675
to dine with him.

690
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:22,675
To dine with him?

691
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:24,714
I'm ready.

692
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:26,234
You...

693
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,435
W-When did you make up?

694
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:29,754
Can we go now?

695
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:31,074
Please.

696
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,435
- That sedan chair?
- Jinrong.

697
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,234
Yeah.

698
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:39,234
Jinrong, be careful. Come home early.

699
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:02,274
Dr. Guo.

700
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:03,635
Mr. Wu.

701
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:05,514
I have everything ready.

702
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:06,595
Please get in.

703
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:24,514
Dr. Guo.

704
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:26,915
Let's go.

705
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:29,274
Thank you.

706
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:30,074
Go ahead.

707
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,395
G-Gentlemen.

708
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:39,754
Is this the Chun family?

709
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:41,395
Yeah.

710
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:42,675
Who are you looking for?

711
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:45,234
Miss Ruyu.

712
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:51,474
Miss...

713
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:54,395
Ruyu?

714
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:57,355
Yeah, Miss Ruyu.

715
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,595
W-Who are you?

716
00:29:59,234 --> 00:29:59,994
My surname is Zhao.

717
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:03,835
I met Miss Ruyu a few days ago.

718
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:04,955
Zhao...

719
00:30:04,994 --> 00:30:06,274
Are you a tailor?

720
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:07,155
Yeah.

721
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:10,115
How do you know?

722
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,195
Ruyu mentioned you

723
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:14,474
when she sold me

724
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,115
this mansion.

725
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,595
S-She sold the mansion?

726
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:21,435
Yeah, they're back in Qing City now.

727
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:22,355
Why?

728
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:24,554
Why did she suddenly sell...

729
00:30:24,794 --> 00:30:25,915
She said she wanted

730
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:27,115
to live her life

731
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:28,635
in peace and tranquility

732
00:30:28,675 --> 00:30:31,514
without being bothered
by people like you.

733
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:35,835
Then why did she
go to the Marriage Bridge?

734
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:36,955
We often make decisions

735
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:38,074
on a whim.

736
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:39,595
I'm the perfect example right now.

737
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:42,274
Mr. Wu, I'm sorry.

738
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:44,714
I've decided to stay here.

739
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:46,635
Sorry.

740
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:47,915
Wait, Dr. Guo.

741
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:49,435
W-What do you mean?

742
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:50,794
I'd like to renovate

743
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:52,195
the mansion these days.

744
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:54,595
Please leave me alone.

745
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:56,115
Wait, Dr. Guo.

746
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:58,474
Especially you, don't show up around.

747
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:00,395
Otherwise, I'll jab you with needles.

748
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:03,915
Young Lord.

749
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:05,875
We have Miss Jinrong here now.

750
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:06,875
According to the plan,

751
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,074
we should...

752
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:09,514
Good, you achieved a merit.

753
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:10,395
Thank you, Young Lord.

754
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,435
Your Highness.

755
00:31:14,474 --> 00:31:15,274
Aren't you...

756
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:17,514
W-What's wrong?

757
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:19,514
Brother, where are you going?

758
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:20,155
I'm going out.

759
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:21,675
Wait, I brought her here.

760
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,195
Brother, you're right.

761
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:24,474
I should solve the problems.

762
00:31:24,554 --> 00:31:25,554
I'll settle everything

763
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:26,234
with Keling.

764
00:31:26,274 --> 00:31:26,875
Keling?

765
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:28,635
Wait, Chun Keling?

766
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,514
What did he say?

767
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:32,155
He said,

768
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:33,355
"I'll settle everything

769
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:34,474
- with Keling."
- Wait.

770
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:37,234
What does he
have to settle with Chun Keling?

771
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:38,395
Exactly.

772
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:41,595
Young Lord.

773
00:31:42,195 --> 00:31:43,355
Is there a chance

774
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,234
he's actually into Chun Keling?

775
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:54,514
Brother. A-Si. You're finally here.

776
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,994
Keling, are you okay?

777
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:04,314
Remember me?

778
00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:05,994
You brought the money?

779
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:08,355
Didn't I tell you to get help?

780
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,875
Why did you get him?

781
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:10,635
Boss.

782
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:13,675
The only rich guy I know is A-Si.

783
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:14,714
Drive him away.

784
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:15,474
Keling.

785
00:32:15,754 --> 00:32:17,355
Why do you hate me so much?

786
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:20,635
Hey, what's with the drama?

787
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:22,195
She's kidnapped.

788
00:32:22,514 --> 00:32:23,234
Where's the money?

789
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:27,474
You think you'd make it

790
00:32:27,474 --> 00:32:28,675
if you didn't play dirty?

791
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:29,675
Come on, one on one.

792
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:31,754
Untie her.

793
00:32:31,794 --> 00:32:32,355
One on one.

794
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:32,955
Leave her alone.

795
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:33,875
Bro.

796
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:36,714
Name your price.

797
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:39,474
That's what I want to hear.

798
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:41,635
We just want money.

799
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:43,675
- I want...
- I said I don't need your help.

800
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:45,514
We want...

801
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:46,875
What did I do wrong?

802
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:48,754
We want...

803
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:50,234
How can you be wrong?

804
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:52,635
We want...

805
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:53,875
Let them talk.

806
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:54,592
Go ahead.

807
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:55,955
I have nothing to say.

808
00:32:58,355 --> 00:32:59,635
And now you won't talk.

809
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:01,274
Fine, listen to me now.

810
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:02,435
We want money.

811
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,514
How much?

812
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:04,274
I...

813
00:33:06,274 --> 00:33:07,355
Maybe sixty taels.

814
00:33:07,395 --> 00:33:08,195
It's too much.

815
00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:09,754
It's too much.

816
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,355
We want

817
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:14,115
50 taels.

818
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,155
Take it.

819
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:18,155
Hurry up.

820
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:18,994
I forbid you!

821
00:33:19,754 --> 00:33:20,635
On what ground?

822
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:25,714
Wait.

823
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:27,355
It's too little.

824
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:29,595
Didn't I say 60?

825
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:30,514
Tell you what.

826
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:32,234
Anybody can save me.

827
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,875
But it can't be him.

828
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:34,754
Why not?

829
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:36,754
Keling, stop being pouty.

830
00:33:36,835 --> 00:33:38,155
I know I've made you upset.

831
00:33:38,234 --> 00:33:39,994
But I mean to apologize to you.

832
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:41,395
Apologize?

833
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:43,155
How dare I ask you to apologize?

834
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:44,754
I bet you don't know.

835
00:33:45,595 --> 00:33:47,675
He's the Lord's son.

836
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:50,595
We should have asked for more.

837
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,595
I said 60.

838
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:54,395
Boss, A-Si has shown great sincerity.

839
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:55,635
Yeah.

840
00:33:55,794 --> 00:33:57,595
A-Si, apologize again.

841
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,994
I-I'm sorry.

842
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:05,635
I was impulsive

843
00:34:05,675 --> 00:34:06,915
outside your house that day.

844
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:09,315
Impulsive? You call it "impulsive"?

845
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,235
We were brothers,

846
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,235
but you just took off.

847
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:12,395
Because you...

848
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:17,594
Keling.

849
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:19,435
Believe me or not.

850
00:34:20,355 --> 00:34:22,594
I've never been injured before.

851
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:29,994
(Once I got to know you,)

852
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,355
(I've been hurt many times.)

853
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:33,114
(But I've put up with it.)

854
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:36,795
(I really want your approval.)

855
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:40,554
You think I'm from a noble family

856
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:42,474
and that makes me bad.

857
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:44,355
Isn't that a bit subjective?

858
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:48,275
It's a bit subjective indeed.

859
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,355
Mind your own business.

860
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:52,835
I didn't say that all officials are bad.

861
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:53,955
Back in Yuanyang Temple,

862
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:55,435
I knew you were not a commoner.

863
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,275
But you left without hesitation.

864
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:58,474
Am I your boss or not?

865
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,235
Exactly, let's be fair.

866
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:01,315
- Shut up.
- Exactly.

867
00:35:02,594 --> 00:35:03,554
Excuse me for a second.

868
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:05,554
I think this buddy is really loyal.

869
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:05,875
Yeah.

870
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:06,634
I appreciate you.

871
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:07,955
Why don't you join us?

872
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:10,034
I've informed the authorities.

873
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:11,114
Okay.

874
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:12,474
I don't appreciate you anymore.

875
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:13,034
Let's go.

876
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:14,875
Don't go.

877
00:35:15,554 --> 00:35:16,474
One on one.

878
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:18,355
I don't need you to untie me.

879
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:21,514
Boss, A-Si came to rescue you.

880
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:23,755
Just make peace with him.

881
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:29,835
Well, you gave away 50 taels to save me.

882
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:31,634
I'll forgive you for lying to me.

883
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:33,474
You're even.

884
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:34,474
That's good.

885
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,755
Shake hands.

886
00:35:35,955 --> 00:35:36,594
Make peace.

887
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,034
Hurry, shake hands.

888
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,795
Let's go have a drink.

889
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:51,795
Ruyu.

890
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:54,114
Ruyu.

891
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,355
I know you're still awake.

892
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,235
Open up, Ruyu.

893
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:04,395
Open...

894
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:06,634
I...

895
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:08,315
Were you drinking?

896
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,514
I-I...

897
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:16,554
I'd like to open my heart to you.

898
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:18,395
Yeah.

899
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,435
I don't want to leave.

900
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:22,634
I don't want to leave you guys.

901
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:25,554
I haven't thought things through

902
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:27,074
and made a wrong decision.

903
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:29,755
So you have to give me another chance.

904
00:36:30,194 --> 00:36:31,194
Don't make me leave.

905
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:33,955
I made you leave?

906
00:36:33,994 --> 00:36:35,915
You wanted to leave.

907
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,755
Guo Zhensheng.

908
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,795
Who do you think you are?

909
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,875
You can come and go as you please?

910
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,235
No, no, I...

911
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,955
I said I'd go to Baohe Clinic

912
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:52,594
because I wanted to prove myself.

913
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:55,795
I was

914
00:36:58,114 --> 00:36:59,114
so childish.

915
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:01,235
No, no, you're not childish.

916
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:03,435
You're the one and only Dr. Guo.

917
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:06,074
Banxia is right.

918
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:06,715
My biggest problem

919
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:08,915
is that I'm always indecisive.

920
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,235
But there are things

921
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:13,074
I have to tell you today

922
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:14,034
no matter what.

923
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:20,795
I don't mean to justify myself.

924
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:22,514
No, that's not what I want.

925
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:24,034
I've been

926
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:25,795
running the pharmacy in Qing City.

927
00:37:25,835 --> 00:37:26,955
You know that, of course.

928
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:29,034
I'm not saying that I'm a noble person,

929
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:32,074
but I did sell the pharmacy,

930
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:33,194
the property,

931
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:35,194
and all my possessions.

932
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:37,194
I just hope you

933
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:40,194
and the kids

934
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:44,835
can live the life you want.

935
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,554
I have other choices.

936
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:50,474
Now that we've built the vibe,

937
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:51,435
there is something

938
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:52,674
I have to tell you.

939
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:55,955
Ruyu, I like...

940
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:56,875
Money.

941
00:37:58,074 --> 00:38:00,554
I get it. You like money.

942
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:02,114
Guo Zhensheng.

943
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:04,634
I don't have the time for this.

944
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:05,395
You made a fuss

945
00:38:05,474 --> 00:38:07,275
just to show your value.

946
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:09,594
It's fine if you want to stay.

947
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,554
Eighty percent. No more.

948
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:12,915
That's my bottom line.

949
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:13,715
Think about it.

950
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:15,034
No, wait...

951
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:16,994
I'm not really here for that.

952
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:17,715
Get lost.

953
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,034
Wait, that's not what I'm for.

954
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:19,955
Let me finish...

955
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:26,795
What was I about to say?

956
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:29,875
Not important.

957
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:32,474
As long as I get to stay.

958
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,661
(Joyful and Carefree)

959
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,355
Li Tengyun.

960
00:38:43,594 --> 00:38:46,074
You can see but you're blind.

961
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:48,514
You can't tell who he's in love with?

962
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:50,395
Young Lord.

963
00:38:50,435 --> 00:38:52,915
Weren't we both there?

964
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:54,355
Neither of us could tell.

965
00:38:54,395 --> 00:38:55,514
You're talking back, huh?

966
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,395
Listen, Li Tengyun.

967
00:38:58,994 --> 00:38:59,835
You've made me

968
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:02,755
like a fool these days.

969
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:03,955
And I told Chun Jinrong...

970
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:05,994
that we were both smart.

971
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:07,194
So awkward.

972
00:39:07,435 --> 00:39:09,594
I wish I could disappear.

973
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:10,355
And you.

974
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,114
What am I paying you for?

975
00:39:12,594 --> 00:39:13,795
You can't offer advice

976
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:15,074
or watch the Fourth Prince.

977
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:16,554
Look at you.

978
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:18,795
Go back to being a fortune teller.

979
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:19,994
Guards!

980
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:21,795
Young Lord.

981
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,795
Give me another chance, Young Lord.

982
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,795
Young Lord, give me another chance.

983
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:26,955
Tell you what.

984
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:29,114
I was hoping you could help me

985
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:30,514
handle the Fourth Prince.

986
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:31,435
Sorry, I was naive.

987
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:33,154
I was so naive.

988
00:39:33,795 --> 00:39:35,395
Young Lord.

989
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,915
I admit that I've been careless.

990
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:39,835
But from now on,

991
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,194
I'll do my best.

992
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:42,194
Young Lord.

993
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:44,715
You need someone to assist you.

994
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,835
You should leave.

995
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:49,235
Young Lord, we're just
starting to get along

996
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:51,514
as master and adviser.

997
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:54,474
Let this relationship end here.

998
00:39:54,674 --> 00:39:55,634
Take him away.

999
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:56,915
Young Lord.

1000
00:39:56,955 --> 00:39:58,435
Give me another chance.

1001
00:39:58,474 --> 00:40:01,074
Young Lord.

1002
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:02,514
Young Lord.

1003
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:05,194
- Take him away!
- Give me another chance.

1004
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:06,235
Young Lord.

1005
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:07,795
That filthy thing.

1006
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:12,074
Outrageous.

1007
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:24,235
What's taking him so long?

1008
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,114
I'm too proactive?

1009
00:40:30,474 --> 00:40:32,074
He's playing hard to get?

1010
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:54,682
