(Buttered up, Mrs. Chun is on thin ice)

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,236
(To be a steward, Lu Buping returns from his studies)

34
00:01:57,574 --> 00:02:00,934
How nice it would be to grow vegetables
in such a large land.

35
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:12,174
Mrs. Chun, are you reminiscing about
the days when we had servants?

36
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,694
Why such a hair decoration
early in the morning?

37
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:19,294
Isn't it beautiful?
I'll go out with Xiaoxiao.

38
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:20,854
You never do anything serious.

39
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:24,535
Yeah, you have serious business.
Didn't Mrs. Lin invite you for tea?

40
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:26,095
Why don't you hurry up and get dressed?

41
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:28,655
I'm not going.
What's so good about the tea?

42
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:31,414
Also, I have no kinship with Mrs. Lin.

43
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,535
Why does she always invite me for tea?

44
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:36,495
Jianglin City is such a small place.

45
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,294
She knows you're living in
the Young Lord's Mansion

46
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:39,614
and wants to curry favor with you.

47
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:42,255
Mother, you must always remember.

48
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:45,375
You are no longer Ruyu
who sells tofu in Qing City.

49
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,095
You are now Mrs. Chun
who lives in the Young Lord's Mansion.

50
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:52,614
The Young Lord's Mansion...
Every time I look at the Mansion,

51
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:53,734
I feel uncomfortable.

52
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,574
It's unreasonably big.

53
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,894
If you're in a bad mood, what does that
have to do with Young Lord's Mansion?

54
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,535
Mother, I think...

55
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:07,614
Since they desire to butter up you,

56
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,414
you should socialize more

57
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,215
and get to know more wealthy families.

58
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:12,694
It can only do us good but no harm.

59
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:15,014
It makes no sense at all.

60
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:17,215
Mother, you should change your mindset.

61
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:19,134
Your identity is different now.

62
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,414
You should learn
how to deal with the upper class.

63
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:25,215
I heard that Mrs. Lin's friends

64
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:26,894
are all famous matchmakers in Jianglin.

65
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:29,174
Are you sure
you don't want to know them?

66
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:31,014
I'm not going.
Whoever wants to go can go.

67
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,328
So stubborn.

68
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,894
Mr. Lu, are you
practicing swordsmanship?

69
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,734
Peilan, you look much better.

70
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:57,294
- Yeah? Because I have things to do now.
- Yes.

71
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,894
Why did you suddenly
practice swordsmanship?

72
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:03,454
I've figured it out.
I still want to be a hero.

73
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,734
It's just a pity that I have not learned
any moves from the servants.

74
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:08,614
Then you should make less noise.

75
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:09,815
Don't let my mother hear it.

76
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,655
After all this time,

77
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,015
they didn't issue a warrant
for my arrest. Is it now safe outside?

78
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:19,135
Speaking of which,
when I bought groceries,

79
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,294
I saw two men looking for you
with your portrait.

80
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:24,095
Were they official?

81
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:24,975
I'm not sure.

82
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:28,655
Then it's still not safe outside.

83
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:31,215
Mr. Lu, don't worry.

84
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,174
Anyway, leave the housework to me.

85
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:35,015
Just focus on your practice.
I'm going to cook.

86
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:42,895
Sometimes things just
don't work out as planned.

87
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:51,535
Jinrong.

88
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:54,335
Xiaoxiao, why are you late?

89
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,216
I'm sorry. Today, I...

90
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,614
The Furong pastry
from our Young Lord's Mansion.

91
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:03,095
Made by the former royal chef.

92
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,975
You haven't tasted it yet?
Take it home and try it.

93
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:07,934
You can't buy it outside
even if you have money.

94
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:13,854
"Our Young Lord's Mansion."
What's your relation with Young Lord?

95
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:20,655
How should I put it?
Let's just say we know each other.

96
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:22,215
Just know each other.

97
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:27,095
You don't know Young Lord insists
that we move into his mansion.

98
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,095
We couldn't turn him down, right?

99
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,254
After all, he's Young Lord.

100
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:33,054
We should always show him some respect.

101
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:37,975
It doesn't sound like
just being acquainted.

102
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,254
Is he pursuing you?

103
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,775
I didn't say that.

104
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:46,455
Don't spread it.

105
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:48,174
I won't.

106
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:51,934
Xiaoxiao, do you know?

107
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:55,455
From our Young Lord's Mansion,
you can see here,

108
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,895
the whole Spring River Restaurant.

109
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,814
So high?

110
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:04,294
No, it's just a much wider view.

111
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,975
When will you take me
to visit the Young Lord's Mansion?

112
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:14,054
Hold on. Weren't you supposed

113
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:15,215
to take me to the mansion today?

114
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:16,575
Why here instead?

115
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,414
There were minor adjustments at home.

116
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:22,895
Let's take a rain check.

117
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,414
What about Mr. Xin?

118
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:25,614
When would you let me meet him?

119
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:27,015
I heard he's quite impressive.

120
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,414
Yes. Rain check on it.

121
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:33,775
Why don't you take Young Lord out first?

122
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:35,934
Another time. Let's find another time.

123
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:38,614
Have some tea. Have some tea.

124
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:51,335
I've heard so much about you, Mrs. Chun.

125
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,854
I am fortunate to meet you today.

126
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:56,095
Heard so much about me?

127
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:58,614
Yes, Mrs. Chun. Don't you know

128
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:00,174
that your move into
the Young Lord's Mansion

129
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:02,215
is widely spread in Jianglin?

130
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:06,215
Right. I wonder what's the relationship
between you and His Highness, Mrs. Chun.

131
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:07,814
We have no relation.

132
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,414
Mrs. Chun is not familiar with us yet,

133
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:12,975
so she doesn't trust us.

134
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,335
No.

135
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,854
I've heard

136
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:18,895
the daughter of yours
and Young Lord from Lord Ling's Mansion

137
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:20,614
have a special relationship.

138
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,814
No. No, they have no relations at all.

139
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:24,374
I heard from Mrs. Lin

140
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:27,174
that you also have several daughters
waiting to be married off.

141
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:32,015
They've all reached marriageable age.
I am really worried about it.

142
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,294
Mrs. Chun, I'm not boasting,

143
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:38,254
but the marriages of
most of the wealthy families in Jianglin

144
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:40,614
were arranged by me.

145
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:43,614
Leave your daughters' marriages to me.

146
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,975
Yes, Mrs. Chun. The marriage of my son

147
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:49,054
was all prompted by her.

148
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:51,174
Then, thank you, Matchmaker Zhang.

149
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:53,054
You're welcome.

150
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:03,095
We were just passing by

151
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:05,414
and somehow we were pushed in.

152
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:07,455
What's wrong?

153
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,614
They seem to be freeloaders.

154
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:11,614
I know you.

155
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:16,135
Mrs. Chun, did he scare you?

156
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:18,374
What are you doing?
This is an esteemed guest.

157
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,455
I'm sorry, Mrs. Chun.

158
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,814
I-I shouldn't have called you
a freeloader. I-I'm sorry.

159
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:24,374
What are you saying?
Go receive 20 lashes from Steward Niu.

160
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:25,575
Yes.

161
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:27,895
No, no. He didn't scare me.

162
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,254
Don't punish him.

163
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:31,414
Since Mrs. Chun is pleading for you,

164
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:33,295
I'll let you go today. Leave.

165
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,254
Yes. Thank you, Madam.
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

166
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:38,415
Mrs. Chun, I am so sorry.

167
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:40,534
The servant at home
is ignorant and startled you.

168
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:42,415
No, he didn't mean it.

169
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,175
Mrs. Chun is really magnanimous.

170
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:51,215
Mrs. Chun, you really know
how to discipline the subordinates.

171
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:56,175
None of our servants are honest.

172
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,055
I heard that Mr. Xin
works in your mansion.

173
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:03,534
For our next gathering,
let's go to Mrs. Chun's house.

174
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:04,815
That's a great idea.

175
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:10,614
Finally, we can meet
the renowned Mr. Xin.

176
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,774
Well, I've dismissed him.

177
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:17,014
- Dismissed him?
- Dismissed him?

178
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:21,654
How so? Even Mr. Xin
couldn't satisfy you.

179
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:23,695
How capable must a steward be

180
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,215
to satisfy you, Mrs. Chun?

181
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:30,774
Compared with you, we are nothing.

182
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:33,975
Mrs. Chun, then let's settle on that.

183
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,614
We'll visit your mansion next time.

184
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:39,415
Also, we can broaden our horizons.

185
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,175
How should I
refuse them in a gentle way?

186
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:00,854
What do you mean? Just let them come.

187
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:02,295
Why are you anxious?

188
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:05,095
Look what you said.
Why didn't you invite Xiaoxiao then?

189
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,095
They're different matters, okay?

190
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,335
Why are they different?
You can say whatever you like.

191
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,455
Or else, I'll say that I got sick.

192
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,935
You just got back and you're sick?
Won't that be too coincidental?

193
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:24,654
I just said I wasn't going,
but you insisted that I should.

194
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:27,014
Now they're planning to come over.
What should we do?

195
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:30,695
See? I told you
we should have kept Mr. Xin.

196
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:32,695
How could we do so?

197
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:33,894
Why are you yelling at me?

198
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:36,815
Well then, I'm out of it. Happy now?

199
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:38,854
If you don't want to bother,
then I won't either.

200
00:10:39,134 --> 00:10:41,175
Just get married if you can,
and stay single if you can't.

201
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:44,894
Mother, why are you angry?

202
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:51,254
How about this? I'll tell them
that you're sick. Alright?

203
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:54,014
Won't that be too obvious?

204
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:56,175
No. It's just an illness.

205
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,415
People get sick, right?

206
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:03,815
Is there anyone here? Someone?

207
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,175
Can someone get us some water?

208
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,254
Young Lord is not well.

209
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:17,614
Your Highness, it's our faults. We know.

210
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:24,654
This cannot continue, or we will die.

211
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:28,575
Aren't you going to yell or something?

212
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:35,134
I didn't expect that I,
a lifelong wiseman,

213
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:39,455
would die by your hand.

214
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:44,335
It's all because you wanted to kill me.

215
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:47,614
Now see what happened.
His Highness wants to kill us both.

216
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:48,975
No one is getting away.

217
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:51,455
I've always been the victim, alright?

218
00:11:52,455 --> 00:12:01,614
Even if I die, I swear as a ghost,
I won't let you off.

219
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:09,975
Are you alright? Young Lord?

220
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:11,254
Young Lord, are you okay?

221
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:15,455
Young Lord is dying.

222
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:30,335
What are you doing?

223
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:32,494
Mother, come! Come here!

224
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:35,734
Look at this ginseng.

225
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,215
It's even larger
than the century-old one from Master.

226
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:41,215
W-Where did this all come from?

227
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:43,175
They're all gifts for you.

228
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:44,415
They knew you were sick,

229
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:46,494
so they sent
all the precious medicinal ingredients.

230
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,415
S-Since they've gifted so many gifts,

231
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,095
should we send gifts in return?

232
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:51,695
Of course.

233
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,215
Mother, wealthy families from Jianglin

234
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:59,415
value the etiquette of
giving and receiving.

235
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:03,014
What was I saying? Living in
the Young Lord's Mansion is quite good.

236
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:04,374
Who asked you to accept them?

237
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,654
We might even need to invite them here.

238
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:08,815
How do we go on otherwise?

239
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,774
They said they wanted
to broaden their horizons here.

240
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:13,494
What if they come and see
there isn't even a steward.

241
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,935
That would be a laughingstock.

242
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,014
It's just a steward.

243
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:19,455
They won't stay here regularly anyway.

244
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:22,254
Just let Lu Buping pretend it

245
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:23,815
and take them for a stroll
in the garden.

246
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,175
And then, just send them off.

247
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,055
Madam, Jinrong, have some melon.

248
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,935
I found it in the kitchen. Enjoy it.

249
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:35,295
Did you have it secretly?

250
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:36,935
No, I didn't.

251
00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:45,295
Mrs. Chun, I have to chop wood.

252
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:46,654
I'm leaving. Take your time enjoying.

253
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,815
Look at him. Do you think it's feasible?

254
00:13:54,854 --> 00:13:57,374
It feels somewhat lacking.

255
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:01,374
But don't overcomplicate things.

256
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,815
Alright, then. When they come,

257
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,175
you go and explain to them.

258
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:07,494
How do I... Mother,

259
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,095
I think people need practice.

260
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:13,134
Mr. Xin was not born knowing
how to be a steward, wasn't he?

261
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,695
Take Lu Buping

262
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,014
out for practice.

263
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:18,854
Perhaps everything will be fine.

264
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:32,416
Close the door.

265
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,295
Here's the thing.

266
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:46,455
In a few days, some madams

267
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:48,935
will be coming in a few days.
Make some preparations.

268
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:50,894
For what?

269
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:54,494
Lu Buping, do you plan
to be a servant all your life?

270
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:56,614
Don't you have your own dreams?

271
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:59,494
While you're young,
you should go and accomplish them.

272
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:03,254
Jinrong, it hits the spot.

273
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:04,975
I don't want to be a servant now.

274
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:05,894
I just want to be a hero.

275
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:06,854
A hero?

276
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:10,134
You can't even chop firewood properly.
Are you cut out for it?

277
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:13,055
Which hero is always
chopping wood and washing clothes?

278
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:15,055
You can't even figure out
wood chopping and laundry.

279
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,295
How can you become a hero?

280
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:20,215
Anyway, my mother
has bragged about your abilities.

281
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,455
She said we have a steward

282
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:23,935
who is even more competent than Mr. Xin.

283
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:26,975
- Who is it?
- You.

284
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:29,575
- Me?
- Yes. Based on your great performance,

285
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:32,335
our family has decided to prioritize
promoting you to be the steward.

286
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:37,575
Steward? To manage whom?

287
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:39,175
Keling has some friends, right?

288
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:40,295
I'll call them all over for you.

289
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,254
You don't have to be so excited.

290
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:44,415
The opportunity is given to you.

291
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:46,975
Whether you can seize it,
it depends on you.

292
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:48,654
So it's decided.

293
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:51,175
Steward Lu, fighting.

294
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:55,455
S-So, it's decided then.

295
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,894
Why could you decide my own life?

296
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,534
Isn't there a mechanism here?

297
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:13,734
I can't die.

298
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,854
Help!

299
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:22,254
Help! Help!

300
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:25,134
Help!

301
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,614
Water.

302
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:51,095
Hang in there.
Don't fall asleep. Hang on.

303
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:58,134
You all listen.

304
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:00,774
Today, I'll leave you to Lu Buping.

305
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:03,494
What he says is as if I said it.
Remember that?

306
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:04,655
- Yes!
- Yes!

307
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm leaving.

308
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:08,734
Don't you stay and help?

309
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:10,695
Who am I? Are you joking?

310
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,494
I've found the men for you. Keep it up.

311
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,264
It's hot.

312
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:29,175
Who can write Yan style?

313
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:31,455
W-What is that?

314
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:32,975
Who can write?

315
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:35,215
I-I-I can.

316
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,215
You can write?

317
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:37,632
My name.

318
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:42,455
Fine. Get a stool
and sit at the gate then.

319
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:44,094
When a guest comes,
write down their name.

320
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:45,574
If you really can't, just draw a circle.

321
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:49,455
You guys in the back, grab a broom.

322
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:50,975
Sweep the front hall.

323
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:52,455
Customers will come from there.

324
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,254
See if there are any
fallen leaves or dust on the ground.

325
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:56,494
Just sweep them by the way.

326
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,615
You. Lead them
and show them how to do it.

327
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,032
Take it.

328
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:09,534
What are you doing?
It's all going up to the sky.

329
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:10,814
Isn't it how we sweep the floor?

330
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:11,655
So much dust.

331
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,135
Nothing wrong with the dust.

332
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:14,935
The dust flies up

333
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,094
and falls back to the ground.

334
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:17,655
We are out here to make a living.

335
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:20,455
How could you if you don't
even know how to sweep.

336
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:21,655
What can you possibly achieve?

337
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:23,175
- How do you speak?
- What do you mean?

338
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:26,175
Alright. Stand there.
Making a living isn't easy.

339
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,054
Stand straight. Mr. Lu, you may go on.

340
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:34,175
Okay. You two at the back
take care of the kitchen.

341
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:35,615
You are strong, right?

342
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,695
You two grab those knives
and patrol the yard.

343
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:40,774
But we don't know how to use a knife.

344
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:43,294
Just hold it in your hand
and pretend that you know how to use it.

345
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:44,695
I need the vibe from you, you know?

346
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:49,695
That's enough. Here's the stuff. Hurry.

347
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:51,655
Get your things.

348
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:54,574
- Take it.
- Hurry up.

349
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:58,814
Move your bodies. Each one of you
will have one. There's no need to rush.

350
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:02,574
Stop arguing. It's so hot. Speak less.

351
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,895
Mr. Lu, where's
my brush and ink, paper and inkstone?

352
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:05,975
I'll give you later.

353
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:07,814
Leave now. Stop all these noises.

354
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,215
Then what shall I use to write, blood?

355
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:10,935
Leave now.

356
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:13,294
Look at them. They look lifeless.

357
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:17,494
They are at least
a group of people, right?

358
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:19,734
Do you think they're up to the task?

359
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:22,814
Mother, there's a sedan chair outside.

360
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,334
They said Mrs. Lin is needing you.

361
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:27,334
Just tell her I'm not here.

362
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,415
I've told them you're.

363
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,014
- You.
- Mother.

364
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:33,655
You can never escape
from what's destined. Let's have a look.

365
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:34,695
- Let's go.
- I'm not going.

366
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,895
Go. Peilan, do me a favor.

367
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:37,984
Okay.

368
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:45,375
Mrs. Chun. Mrs. Chun, you finally came.

369
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:46,895
What's the matter, Mrs. Lin?

370
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,375
I'm truly sorry.

371
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,534
Look, my friends are about to fight.

372
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,935
They don't stop no matter what.

373
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:55,135
So, I would like to ask you
to make a judgment.

374
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:56,615
Make a judgment? How could I?

375
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,215
Come on. Have a look and you'll know.

376
00:19:58,254 --> 00:19:59,895
You'd better come in. Please hurry.

377
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:00,814
This is mine.

378
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:03,135
Why should this be yours?
I've reserved it long ago.

379
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:05,094
How? You didn't even pay a deposit.

380
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:06,375
Pack it up and send it to my house.

381
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:07,814
Don't do what she said.

382
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,455
Alright. Stop quarreling.

383
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:10,895
Let Mrs. Chun be the judge for you.

384
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,135
- I...
- Mrs. Chun.

385
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:15,014
Look. I have reserved
it a long time ago.

386
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:16,415
She insisted on taking it away.

387
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:18,734
Mrs. Chun, I ran out of
white jade cream at home.

388
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:19,814
I am in a hurry to use it.

389
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,415
Besides, she did not pay a deposit.

390
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:22,935
- No need for deposit.
- The first mover won.

391
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:23,814
I reserved it long ago.

392
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,534
Even if you reserved it,
you did not pay a deposit.

393
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:28,254
That's enough.
Stop arguing. How terrible.

394
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:31,375
We are all sisters
and shall be harmonious.

395
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,014
Mrs. Chun, tell us
who could own this white jade cream.

396
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,855
Yes, Mrs. Chun. Make a fair decision.

397
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,855
W-What should I say?

398
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:41,494
Mrs. Chun, since we invited you here,

399
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,615
say what you think.
We will all listen to you.

400
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:45,655
- That's right.
- Right, we will all listen to you.

401
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:50,135
There must be other bird's
nest white jade cream available, right?

402
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,215
Yes, but not until half a month later.

403
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:54,375
Just wait a bit longer.

404
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:57,135
Mrs. Chun, I am not arguing
for this white jade cream.

405
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,455
It's about the face.

406
00:20:58,494 --> 00:20:59,975
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

407
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,215
Are you being reasonable?

408
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:02,415
You are.

409
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,135
We are all sisters. No need for that.

410
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,215
And the bird's nest white jade cream

411
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,294
may have no effect.

412
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:16,534
What I am trying to say
is that you can look at other products.

413
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:19,135
Look what I said.

414
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:21,215
Mrs. Chun is surely visionary.

415
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:23,615
How can you argue over
a bird's nest white jade cream?

416
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,734
Mrs. Chun, right. I am really sorry

417
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:29,494
that our bird's nest white jade cream
didn't meet your requirements.

418
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:32,415
Please take a look at this,
the treasure of our shop.

419
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:34,695
The blood swallow white jade cream.
Please have a look.

420
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:39,294
It is exclusively supplied to
the women of nobles and royal families.

421
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:42,455
I didn't know your identity before.
I am sorry for my rudeness.

422
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,175
Please bear with me.

423
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:46,215
It's all right.

424
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:48,215
Mrs. Chun, why don't you just buy one

425
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,054
for each of these ladies?

426
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:51,895
Then they won't fight anymore, right?

427
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,494
Y-You're quite good at mediating.

428
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:56,534
Thank you for your praise.

429
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:58,615
How much is it?

430
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:00,534
Not expensive. Ten taels per box.

431
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,215
Ten taels?

432
00:22:02,294 --> 00:22:06,455
It is so valuable. We can't accept it.

433
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,415
I am embarrassing you, right?

434
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:13,975
If Mrs. Chun gives it to you,
then just take it.

435
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:16,855
I'll pack four boxes for you.

436
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,455
You and your friends
can use these first.

437
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:20,375
N-No need. Who said we wanted it?

438
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:22,494
It's okay, Mrs. Chun.

439
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:24,175
Next time when we
visit the Young Lord's Mansion,

440
00:22:24,254 --> 00:22:26,494
we will bring more good gifts as return.

441
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:27,574
Yes, yes.

442
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,334
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Chun.
- Don't...

443
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:31,734
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

444
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:32,975
I'll pack it for you.

445
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:36,175
No, no. Three boxes.
Three boxes will be enough.

446
00:22:36,294 --> 00:22:37,215
I-I have some at home.

447
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:39,334
It's fine with three boxes.

448
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,814
Thanks to Mrs. Chun.
You are really generous.

449
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:43,215
Thank you.

450
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:58,895
30 taels. You just
gave it away like that?

451
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:00,574
I haven't even used that

452
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:01,734
blood swallow white jade cream.

453
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:05,054
Why are you yelling at me?

454
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,494
Haven't you given Xiaoxiao
the Furong pastry?

455
00:23:08,574 --> 00:23:11,455
Is it the same? Have I spent
a penny of our family's money?

456
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:13,814
Mother, I don't mean to criticize you.

457
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,054
But you are such a grown-up.

458
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,254
Can't you distinguish
between intentions and face?

459
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:19,054
I can't?

460
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:21,734
You know that I went out
for the sake of face.

461
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:23,375
Whose face was I contemplating?

462
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:25,774
Wasn't it you who insisted I go out

463
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:27,094
to have tea with them?

464
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:28,334
I asked you to have tea.

465
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:30,734
But I didn't ask you to give them
the blood swallow white jade cream.

466
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,734
No. They have been calling

467
00:23:34,774 --> 00:23:35,975
Mrs. Chun all the time.

468
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,215
So, I was confused.

469
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:40,455
Mother, do you care about
those elusive things?

470
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:41,975
What are you doing?

471
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:46,254
You were usually... I...
Think about it yourself. Oh, my.

472
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,814
Are you out of your mind?

473
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,054
Who do you think you are talking to?

474
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:57,014
Mrs. Chun, it's time for dinner.

475
00:23:57,175 --> 00:23:59,494
What are you doing? You scared me.

476
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,054
You asked me to be a steward.

477
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:03,534
Get out. Will you get out or not?

478
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:06,094
Unreasonable.

479
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:29,952
Have it.

480
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:39,534
Does my father know we've escaped?

481
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:45,175
As far as I know, not yet.

482
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:54,734
It seems that Father
is really disappointed in me.

483
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,415
He really wants to
starve me to death in the jail.

484
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:01,695
Why are you thinking so much?
Just focus on surviving first.

485
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:03,814
Hide at my place for a few days.

486
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:05,855
Go back after your father calms down.

487
00:25:09,895 --> 00:25:10,814
Any alcohol?

488
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:13,375
I even had to borrow

489
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:15,734
this half loaf of bread from a neighbor.
Where would I get any wine?

490
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:20,094
You'd better eat it quickly.
You've been without food for days.

491
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,655
This is the best I can offer
at my place.

492
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:25,415
Do you have any friends?

493
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,574
If you do,
you could take refuge with them.

494
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:35,895
Why did you save me?

495
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:44,975
Have it now.
I'll try to get another loaf.

496
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:31,975
(Scenery Spring)

497
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:34,615
Mrs. Chun, eat.

498
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:35,734
You should say, "Please dine."

499
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:38,855
Mrs. Chun, please dine.

500
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:41,855
Who are you rolling your eyes at?

501
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:42,935
No.

502
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:46,135
Mrs. Chun has quite a temper.

503
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:49,975
Lu Buping, the date has been set.

504
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:51,294
Those ladies will visit us

505
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:52,455
the day after tomorrow.

506
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:54,175
You need to inform Peilan.

507
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:55,855
And get the group ready.

508
00:26:56,935 --> 00:27:01,494
"The group." Lu Buping, look at
Mrs. Chun's choice of words.

509
00:27:02,094 --> 00:27:03,574
Haven't you finished yet?

510
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:04,455
Stop shouting.

511
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:06,774
It doesn't suit
your status as Mrs. Chun.

512
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:08,175
You want to piss me off.

513
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,415
Chun.

514
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:11,655
You should call me Mrs. Chun.

515
00:27:14,094 --> 00:27:15,814
Mrs. Chun, your pea and beef soup.

516
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:20,975
Yao Wu, what soup is it?

517
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:23,494
Pea and beef soup.

518
00:27:23,615 --> 00:27:26,294
Where's the beef? Is it lost?

519
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:28,415
Second Sister said...

520
00:27:28,494 --> 00:27:29,334
Second Miss.

521
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:32,375
Second Miss said to make a sample.
No need to add real beef.

522
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:35,014
What kind of people are in this family?

523
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:37,695
With both generous and stingy people.

524
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:41,175
Pretending to be from a wealthy family?

525
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:53,774
Mr. Xin.

526
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,455
In a few days, several important guests

527
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,895
will come to my house for a visit.

528
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:04,094
I also hired a steward.

529
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:06,975
He manages a few people,
but none of them are suitable.

530
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:11,534
So I want to ask for a favor.

531
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:15,494
Mrs. Chun, you flatter me.

532
00:28:15,814 --> 00:28:17,814
It'll be okay even if
you could help me for half a day.

533
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:22,294
I'll owe the money for now,
but I promise to pay it back.

534
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:26,094
As you can see,
I really can't leave here now.

535
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:29,975
Do you have anyone trustworthy
who could lend me a hand for half a day?

536
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:33,415
After all, we've been
master and servant for a while, huh?

537
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,895
They all can't get away either.

538
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:39,734
Well.

539
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:42,935
How about this?
You said you have a steward, right?

540
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,855
Send him to me and I'll teach him.

541
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:56,895
Mrs. Chun, where is it?

542
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,975
I managed to get this opportunity

543
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:01,415
through great hardships.

544
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:03,054
Work hard and keep it up.

545
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,494
Mr. Xin, I've brought him here.

546
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:08,094
Mr. Xin, why are you here?

547
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:11,814
So, it's Mr. Lu. Long time no see.

548
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:18,935
Mrs. Chun. Mrs. Chun, help! Mrs. Chun.

549
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:22,094
Lu Buping, I'm sorry
to have put you in this situation.

550
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,534
Mrs. Chun.

551
00:29:27,294 --> 00:29:29,494
What are you trying to do?
Stay away from me.

552
00:29:29,615 --> 00:29:31,054
I know martial arts.

553
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:35,215
Tell you what? My father is the leader
of the martial arts alliance.

554
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:37,175
If you come any closer,
my weapon may hurt you.

555
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:38,375
I-I'm telling you.

556
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:43,294
You know Yin Yang Finger?

557
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:46,734
When your force is useless,
respect is the way.

558
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,855
When your status is useless,
ability is the way.

559
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:55,415
When your life is useless,
ideals are the way.

560
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:58,574
Son of the leader of the alliance.
Do you deserve it?

561
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:00,855
If you want to be a useless person,

562
00:30:00,895 --> 00:30:02,574
of course, I can help you achieve that.

563
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:05,294
But you have to accept
that everyone will abandon you.

564
00:30:05,294 --> 00:30:06,734
Abandon me?

565
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,415
You don't have the goal
of being a human,

566
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:10,054
nor do you have the value
of being a human.

567
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:11,014
You're a burden to others,

568
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:11,895
a drag to others,

569
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,294
and even a parasite on others.

570
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,975
You can't stand hardship
nor hear harsh words.

571
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:18,375
Everyone would abandon
such a haughty person.

572
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:21,695
I have a goal of my own.
I want to be a hero.

573
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,494
The highest realm of martial arts
is not kung fu,

574
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:27,254
but to facing everything
every day without shaking

575
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:29,415
and saying thousands of words
every day without wavering.

576
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:33,814
But it is just
a basic skill for a steward.

577
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:40,935
So how can a hero
compare with a steward?

578
00:30:52,294 --> 00:30:53,376
Tengyun.

579
00:30:57,888 --> 00:31:01,494
Well, am I hallucinating?

580
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:02,774
What's wrong?

581
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:04,455
You're clearly roasting a bun,

582
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:09,774
but why did I smell
the scent of meat bun?

583
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:15,774
Really? That might just be an illusion.

584
00:31:15,935 --> 00:31:17,135
After all, you are Young Lord.

585
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:19,455
It's normal you will easily get hungry.
It's almost done.

586
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:23,774
Tengyun, I really admire you a bit now.

587
00:31:24,294 --> 00:31:27,014
You can bear
the bruises, hunger and scoldings.

588
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,695
You were able to escape from that cell.

589
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,534
These days, I've thought about it
and I really haven't been trying hard.

590
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:35,855
No wonder my father
always calls me a loser.

591
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,695
Young Lord, don't overthink.

592
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:43,455
I've grown up in such an environment
since I was little.

593
00:31:44,494 --> 00:31:47,175
Here. It's done. Have the bun first.

594
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,855
Tomorrow, I'll find a way
to get you a meat bun as well.

595
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:53,734
As well?

596
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:58,534
I mean, no matter what, I'll find a way

597
00:31:58,534 --> 00:31:59,695
to get you a meat bun.

598
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:01,054
Since you've been wanting a meat bun.

599
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:03,455
No, thanks. Tengyun.

600
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,774
I eat the meat bun
while leaving you to gnaw on a bun.

601
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:10,254
I am not such an ungrateful person.

602
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:12,975
It's not that bad.

603
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:19,054
Tengyun, I've made up my mind.
Send me back.

604
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,334
This isn't working.

605
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,094
Just assume you've caught me.

606
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:26,574
This way, my father won't blame you.

607
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:31,534
And I should go back
and face everything too.

608
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:35,494
No. If you go back now, wouldn't that
be like sending you to your death?

609
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:37,054
Although you can't eat enough here,

610
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:38,494
at least you won't die.

611
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,375
I belong to the Lord's Mansion.

612
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:45,294
My mother gave birth to me

613
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:48,455
not just to have me to be alive.

614
00:32:57,814 --> 00:33:00,014
- What's your name?
- Lu Buping.

615
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:01,774
You want more water?

616
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,695
I am Steward Lu.

617
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,895
Louder. I can't hear it.

618
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:07,232
Steward Lu.

619
00:33:07,935 --> 00:33:12,455
Is that all you get?
Do you want to be trash forever?

620
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,215
Steady with one level hand.

621
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:18,655
Stand straight like a pine tree.

622
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:20,975
Control the knife with your energy.
It sharpens without a blade.

623
00:33:30,415 --> 00:33:32,494
M-Madam, this way, please.

624
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:36,534
I am Steward Lu.

625
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:40,014
Steward Lu. Steward Lu.

626
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:42,054
Madam, this way.

627
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:44,935
This way. T-This way.

628
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:46,375
Mrs. Chun, please have some tea.

629
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:48,494
Mrs. Chun, please have some tea.

630
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:50,935
Mrs. Chun, please have some tea.

631
00:33:52,415 --> 00:33:53,695
Mrs. Chun, please have some tea.

632
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:56,615
Mrs. Chun...

633
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,014
What's the matter?
Do you want to give up?

634
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,574
No, Master. I can add two more.

635
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:07,615
Mrs. Chun, please have some tea.

636
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:09,895
Mrs. Chun, please have some tea.

637
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,054
Mrs. Chun, please have some tea.

638
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:14,255
Mrs. Chun, please have some tea.

639
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:16,320
(Young Lord's Mansion)

640
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:27,174
Mrs. Chun, make a decision quickly.

641
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:28,494
Several sedan chairs outside,

642
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:30,094
all waiting for you to make a judgment.

643
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:33,455
Why do they come to me for judgments?

644
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:36,455
I am not the magistrate.

645
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:37,975
It's all because you're generous.

646
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,614
As soon as you show up, it's 30 taels.

647
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:41,815
Don't bring up
what should not be brought up.

648
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,574
Do you think I want to?

649
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,255
I'm doing this all for you.

650
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:48,214
Mrs. Chun, you're really great.

651
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,654
How come I didn't get the implication?

652
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:55,975
Jinrong, what's wrong?

653
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,335
Nothing. We just lost 30 taels.

654
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:01,654
- You.
- Mother, what? Should we report it?

655
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,648
Don't bother with her.

656
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:07,455
Mother, how's Mr. Lu doing?

657
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:09,895
Oh, right. Is he done?

658
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:14,534
Peilan, why don't you go out
and tell those madams

659
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,214
to come a few days later?

660
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:17,694
Let's wait for Lu Buping.

661
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,975
Mother, you've got a nosebleed.

662
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:28,494
Perfect. Just tell them I'm sick.

663
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:01,654
Mr. Lu, you're back.

664
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:04,014
Do you need anything, Second Miss?

665
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:05,094
I made chicken soup for you.

666
00:36:05,134 --> 00:36:06,214
You must be exhausted.

667
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:08,694
How can I trouble you, Second Miss?

668
00:36:09,574 --> 00:36:10,935
Just call me Peilan.

669
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:12,455
Second Miss sounds weird.

670
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:14,094
Alright, Second Miss Peilan.

671
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:18,134
My mother said
you've been working really hard,

672
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,775
and asked me to make it for you.

673
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:23,534
My master's love for me is deep.

674
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:28,054
I will repay you wholeheartedly
even with trials and tribulations ahead.

675
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:32,735
Mr. Lu? Mr. Lu, are you okay?

676
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:36,775
Did my mother scare you again?
Let's go inside and talk.

677
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:40,054
No, Second Miss.
We are master and servant.

678
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:41,694
If Mrs. Chun knows and thinks

679
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:43,694
that her steward lives on her
while being ungrateful,

680
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:45,815
that will make me beneath my dignity.

681
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:47,975
Second Miss, you should rest early.

682
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:56,935
Mr. Lu.

683
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,134
Second Miss, when will
Mrs. Chun's banquet be postponed?

684
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:02,614
The day after tomorrow.

685
00:37:02,614 --> 00:37:04,214
Copy, Second Miss. Have some rest.
