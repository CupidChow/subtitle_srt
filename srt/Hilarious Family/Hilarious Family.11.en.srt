(The Chuns got "the Mansion" because of a fire)

(Chun Banxia bowed her head in apology)

34
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:58,784
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

35
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:01,382
Did you set the fire?

36
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:04,182
Yeah, Young Lord.

37
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:06,501
You hold grudges against
Chun Keling, don't you?

38
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:09,581
I helped you to avenge with the fire.

39
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:13,502
Now that the revenge has been taken,
can you let me go?

40
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:16,861
Y-You dare to set a fire?

41
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:18,102
Do you think I will believe you?

42
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:20,901
I indeed lit the fire.

43
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,782
But it's the rainy season recently.

44
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:27,021
It's quite damp,
so the fire might not catch on.

45
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:29,181
You could understand, right?

46
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,701
I knew it.

47
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:36,301
There's no fire, right?

48
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,301
Maybe.

49
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:40,461
Young Lord, the Chun's house is on fire.

50
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,181
You really set the fire?

51
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:47,822
Is it big?

52
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,741
Look, your house is on fire.

53
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,741
Excuse me, excuse me.

54
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:55,621
It is my house.

55
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,141
Oh, my God.

56
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,621

57
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:03,342
What's happening, Mother?

58
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:06,304
Hurry up, hurry up.

59
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:10,581
Why are you standing there, Chun Peilan?

60
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:14,942
Chun Jinrong, stop yelling.

61
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:30,382
Oh, my God.

62
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,782
My house.

63
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:54,861
Boss, what did A-Si tell you yesterday?

64
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,262
Did he confess his love to you?

65
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,782
Well, I saw you and A-Si
were setting off fireworks together last night.

66
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,342
Did you two, mua-mua-mua?

67
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:05,982
Disgusting. Dare you to say it again.

68
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:07,102
I won't say it.

69
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,461
Where's it? Why is it on fire?

70
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:13,861
Boss, it looks like your pharmacy.

71
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:21,501
Could it be A-Si? A-Si.

72
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,301
A-Si. Sit here.

73
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:24,902
- A-Si.
- A-Si.

74
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:26,902
- A-Si. Hurry.
- Be careful.

75
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:27,861
A-Si, are you all right?

76
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,542
What happened?

77
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,421
- A-Si.
- A-Si. A-Si. A-Si, wake up.

78
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:34,261
It really caught on fire.

79
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:38,181
Why did you set such a big fire?

80
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:40,582
It's not me. I don't know.

81
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:41,662
It's not my fault.

82
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:44,542
Let me tell you, if someone gets hurt,

83
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:46,261
even chopping off your head
won't be enough.

84
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:48,142
You two set the fire?

85
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:50,462
- A-Si.
- A-Si, wake up.

86
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:51,872
A-Si?

87
00:04:56,982 --> 00:05:00,902
Help me, help me.

(Justice)

90
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,304
Your Honor.

91
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,102
Speaking of this incident,

92
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,102
it has nothing to do with me.

93
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:24,662
It was my younger brother who misheard.

94
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,022
Your Honor, I plead for a witness.

95
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,462
Your Honor, indeed, I heard it.

96
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:39,582
The punishment for
burning government offices

97
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:42,741
and private houses, or property,
is three years of the prison sentence.

98
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,902
If one purposely sets fire
to someone else's dwelling,

99
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:48,662
or storage of silkworms and millets,
the instigator shall be put to death.

100
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,381
The followers should
be punished with 20 strokes.

101
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:54,741
Your Honor, law applies to everyone,
no matter their status.

102
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:57,342
I believe you will uphold justice fairly

103
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:58,982
and give an explanation to us,

104
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,662
fairness to Jianglin,

105
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:02,342
and justice to the people.

106
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:08,821
Your Honor, it's all a misunderstanding.

107
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,821
I didn't really set fire to their house.

108
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:11,662
I don't know how

109
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:12,902
it happened.

110
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:14,222
I don't know anything.

111
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:16,142
You dare to do it but not admit it.

112
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:19,342
Li Tengyun, did you set the fire or not?

113
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,342
Tell the truth.

114
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:24,902
Mr. Lu, are you feeling better?

115
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,582
Peilan, Peilan.

116
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,902
Did you see my jewelry box?

117
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:40,222
No, Jinrong.

118
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:43,342
Where did my jewelry box go?

119
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:46,181
Jinrong, don't worry. You will find it.

120
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,462
I just don't understand

121
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:50,782
why they burned our house. Why?

122
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,782
It is not arson.
It's clearly an accident.

123
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,102
Accident? Which eye of yours
saw that it was an accident?

124
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,902
The one that is wide open.

125
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,861
I saw that the stove in the pharmacy

126
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:06,462
was on fire.

127
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,861
Then, it ignited the nearby herbs.

128
00:07:08,982 --> 00:07:11,662
Suddenly, they all caught fire.

129
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:15,702
At that moment,
I thought I must put out this fire.

130
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:16,902
So I ran toward it.

131
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,582
B-But in the end,
before I could get there,

132
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:21,782
I tripped and fell down.

133
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,421
I nearly got burned myself.

134
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:29,621
Fortunately, I escaped death.
It was too close.

135
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:33,462
Banxia, your elder sister said,

136
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:36,662
a new silk shop opened in Chang'an Lane.
Let's go and take a look.

137
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:50,982
Your Honor, please spare me.

138
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:53,102
I didn't set the fire, Your Honor.

139
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:55,462
Young Lord, save me.

140
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:58,542
Save what? You get served
what you deserve.

141
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,061
You can't ignore me, Young Lord.

142
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,102
Brother, don't listen to his nonsense.

143
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,222
It has nothing to do with me.

144
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,782
Nothing at all.

145
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,702
Young Lord,
you can't treat me like this.

146
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:11,582
Li Tengyun, stop shouting.

147
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,702
You should just surrender
and plead guilty now.

148
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:17,542
Since you are heartless.
Your Honor, please stop hitting me.

149
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:18,902
I'll say. I'll say.

150
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:21,261
Speak up.

151
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:24,142
It was indeed me who set the fire,

152
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:26,902
but it was Young Lord
who ordered me to do it.

153
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,222
You can't beat me alone.
You should also hit him, Young Lord.

154
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:33,982
Li Tengyun, you. No. He was a swindler.

155
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:36,021
I swear this has nothing to do with me.

156
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:37,861
I never instructed him. I never.

157
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:39,021
It has nothing to do with me.

158
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:42,422
How dare you, Li Tengyun.
You dare to frame Young Lord?

159
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:44,462
- Come on, continue to beat him.
- Beat him.

160
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:46,141
Your Honor, I was wronged.

161
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,661
Your Honor, since Li Tengyun
has already implicated Young Lord,

162
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,261
why don't you investigate him?

163
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,141
There is a process to handle the case.

164
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:55,141
I have my own judgment
and don't need to explain it to you.

165
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,422
Your Honor.

166
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,664
Stop it.

167
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:02,261
Stop. The evidence is insufficient
and we need further investigation.

168
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,702
Detain Li Tengyun
and decide on another day.

169
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:06,942
Another day? What about him?

170
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,541
- I...
- Dismiss.

171
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:11,702
Your Honor. Your Honor.

172
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:13,702
Young Lord. Young Lord.

173
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:16,141
Young Lord, you must save me.

174
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:20,062
It's not me.

175
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,942
Mother, don't worry.
When I go back, I'll gather evidence.

176
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:24,541
I will sue that darn official together.

177
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:26,901
I support you this time.

178
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,141
We must take back justice
for our family.

179
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:32,021
Don't stare at me.

180
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:34,901
It has nothing to do with me
even if you stare at me.

181
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,062
Sir, have you found anything?

182
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:46,021
The initial judgment: it is the place
where the fire broke out. Right here.

183
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:50,381
Boss, we found a torch outside.

184
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:54,702
The torch is not from our house.

185
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:55,942
We don't have such a thing.

186
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,501
Yes. They must have used this
to start the fire.

187
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:00,702
This is evidence.

188
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:04,501
We will investigate carefully
when we get back. Don't worry. Let's go.

189
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:08,942
You've worked hard, Sir. Thank you.

190
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:14,781
Jinrong, could it really be
an accidental fire, not arson?

191
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:18,381
I'm also confused now.
I-I can't figure it out.

192
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,901
Why would Young Lord
want to start a fire?

193
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:22,541
If he was wronged,

194
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,062
why did Li Tengyun admit it?
It makes no sense.

195
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:30,062
Regardless, the fact that Banxia's stove
was not put out

196
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:31,422
must be kept in the dark for now.

197
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:35,901
If Young Lord takes the opportunity

198
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:37,302
to bite back at us,

199
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:39,741
then our family will have nothing left.

200
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:42,062
But I'm afraid...

201
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:44,661
Jinrong, why don't we
discuss it with Mother?

202
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:48,822
No. The fewer knows, the better.

203
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:53,501
Peilan, we are not young anymore.
We have to take responsibility.

204
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,102
Mother is already very troubled now.

205
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:57,702
We can't let this bother her too, right?

206
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:02,381
Yeah. If Banxia found out,
she wouldn't be able to stand it.

207
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,422
Of course.

208
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:05,621
I said it's Banxia.

209
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,141
That stove just wasn't put out, right?

210
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:10,621
- Shut up.
- Isn't that what you said?

211
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,222
- Mr. Lu.
- If you say it again.

212
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,822
Jinrong, don't get mad.

213
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,102
Don't worry. He won't say it.
And I won't say it either.

214
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:18,781
Rest assured. Simmer down.

215
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:25,422
Forget it, Mr. Lu.
Let's go back. Let's go back.

216
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,062
I told you to talk less.

217
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:31,501
I-I almost got burned to death.

218
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:33,422
I just woke up, Peilan.

219
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:35,141
I know, I know.

220
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:38,141
Tell me, your third sister had a fire,

221
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:40,222
but your eldest sister hit me.
Is that reasonable?

222
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,021
Yeah. Forget it.
Don't say it anymore, Mr. Lu.

223
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:44,381
Or my eldest sister will hear it.

224
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:46,381
So what? I just want her to hear it.

225
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:49,302
Chun Banxia didn't put out the fire.
That's a fact, right?

226
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,592
Mother?

227
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:01,261
Mrs. Chun, luckily you are here.

228
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:02,661
I need to tell you something.

229
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:04,288
Mr. Lu.

230
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:09,261
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,381
Lu Buping, what did you say?

232
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,781
Young Lord, I hope
you will tell the truth.

233
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:21,182
Your Highness, what I said is the truth.

234
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:25,702
It really has nothing to do with me.

235
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:26,781
I was just angry at that time.

236
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:28,302
I wanted to scare Li Tengyun.

237
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,222
But who knew
he would actually start a fire?

238
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:32,501
Anyway, it is quite complicated
to explain it.

239
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:33,661
Your Highness, believe me.

240
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:35,141
I am innocent.

241
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,501
The Chun family are the innocent ones.

242
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:41,696
Young Lord.

243
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:43,661
I will definitely find out the truth.

244
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:44,702
As for you...

245
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:49,408
Never mind.

246
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:50,880
Your Highness.

247
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,021
What's all the fuss?

248
00:12:58,021 --> 00:13:00,501
We mustn't let Banxia
know about the fire.

249
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:01,982
She always overthinks.

250
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,342
She won't be able to handle it.

251
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,942
Lu Buping, go clean up the stove area.

252
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:13,440
Don't remind her of anything. Hurry.

253
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:20,621
Mother is right.

254
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,661
If Banxia remembers something,

255
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:23,861
and this matter gets exposed,

256
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,942
Young Lord definitely
won't compensate us.

257
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,021
I also worry about Banxia.

258
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,381
She may be devastated.

259
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,182
Don't worry. I won't say a word.

260
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,582
Only the four of us
know about this matter.

261
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:35,261
If anyone leaks it,
don't blame me for being rude.

262
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:36,768
Mother.

263
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,840
Everyone's here.

264
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:44,501
Rest assured.
This is on me. I've got this.

265
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,942
As long as there's a crime committed,
there will be evidence left.

266
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,501
I go check there.

267
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:02,541
Isn't that Banxia?

268
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:03,942
Have you cleaned up yet?

269
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,496
It's all cleaned up.

270
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:08,822
You truly scared me off.

271
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:12,102
Mother! Has anyone
touched anything here?

272
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:17,728
Not me. Oh, not us.

273
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,062
Someone has cleaned up here.

274
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:24,062
Just as I expected.

275
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:26,342
They are of the same ilk.
All in cahoots.

276
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:29,342
No, Banxia. They've collected evidence.

277
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,222
Then why would they destroy the scene?

278
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,781
Isn't it because
they have something to hide?

279
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:35,141
They are totally
disregarding the regulations.

280
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,621
There's a rule about it
in the code of law.

281
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:40,861
Let me check it out.

282
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,368
Banxia.

283
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:58,021
Banxia is still checking on it.

284
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:04,501
Just let her be.
I doubt she will find anything.

285
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:06,541
Did she decide on the law?

286
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:08,702
She can find out whatever she wants?

287
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,008
- Leave her alone. I guess...
- Mother.

288
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,381
I've checked.

289
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:27,381
Concerning cleaning,
it indeed isn't mentioned in the laws.

290
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,661
See?

291
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,261
Li Tengyun reported Young Lord,

292
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:34,062
but the judge didn't question him.

293
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:35,901
Something fishy must be going on.

294
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,462
With an ambiguous attitude,
and in a hurry to clean.

295
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:43,062
It seems that the court
won't care about this issue anymore.

296
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,822
Exactly. I said the court
can't handle this.

297
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:50,422
Yes, if the court can't,
I will go to the Supreme Court.

298
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:54,021
I'll fight with Lord Ling's Mansion
and those corrupt officials.

299
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:58,422
Mother, trust me.
There must be justice in this world.

300
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:01,942
Banxia, I didn't mean that.

301
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,541
I mean, maybe we should let it go.

302
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:06,661
- Yeah. Let it go.
- Just forget it.

303
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:08,661
Why?

304
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:10,501
Because...

305
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,141
Banxia, just listen to Mother.

306
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:16,422
Mother, didn't you support me

307
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:18,062
to get justice for our family?

308
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:24,342
You all are scared of Young Lord, right?

309
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:27,942
I will bring him to justice
sooner or later.

310
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,904
You.

311
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,822
Do you think Chun Banxia will stop it?

312
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,582
Wake up, wake up.

313
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:54,182
I see Banxia is still writing.

314
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,661
She has already written
such a long complaint.

315
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:02,062
See? No matter what you say,
it doesn't work.

316
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,581
Banxia is going to
send herself in the prison.

317
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:08,101
Mother, do something.

318
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,182
What can I do? No one can persuade her.

319
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:14,182
"The evil can't suppress the good"?

320
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,422
You go watch her.

321
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,902
When she finishes writing, steal it.

322
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:23,702
Steal it?

323
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:25,581
Then throw it away. Tear it up.

324
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:27,622
Or eat it. Anyway, whatever you do,

325
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:28,862
just don't let her finish it.

326
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,501
Why is it me again?

327
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,662
Then who else?

328
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:37,341
Mother, why don't you
ask Master to persuade Banxia?

329
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,061
Banxia listens to him the most.

330
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:42,061
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Yes.

331
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:44,222
Where's Master?

332
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:53,501
Dr. Guo, you carried so much medicine.
The horse must be tired.

333
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,741
Why not find an inn to rest
for the night?

334
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:57,942
Let's just go back directly.

335
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,622
No rest. Thanks for your hard work.

336
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:03,741
My heart was pounding.

337
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:06,581
- Fine. Cluck.
- Thank you.

338
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,501
Diary of Li Tengyun.

339
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:15,101
What diary?

340
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:16,581
It records in detail

341
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:18,581
things that have happened
since I moved into the Mansion.

342
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:21,821
Wait, you can't
trust his words, Your Highness.

343
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,101
He would do anything

344
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:24,581
just to drag me down.

345
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:27,101
I can understand that you use me,

346
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:30,382
but you can't harm
the people of Chun family.

347
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,462
I didn't.

348
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,382
Li Tengyun has told me everything.

349
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:35,821
Your Highness, please calm down. I...

350
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,182
I know, the fire was not set by you,

351
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,501
but you did send Li Tengyun

352
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,662
to harm Chun Keling, right?

353
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,741
No. Not me. I was just joking with him.

354
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:46,622
I purposely said so

355
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:47,942
because I knew he would not dare.

356
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:48,982
Your joke

357
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:50,942
could lead to the ruin of a family.

358
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:53,301
Mrs. Chun has made a great effort

359
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,341
to move to Jianglin.

360
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:56,222
They just want to live a good life,

361
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:58,821
but you used them because of me

362
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:01,142
and even wanted to harm them.
I am so disappointed in you.

363
00:19:01,702 --> 00:19:03,862
No, Your Highness.
It is all a misunderstanding.

364
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:05,581
I can handle all this!

365
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,061
I'll bring everything
back to the beginning.

366
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:07,942
You and I... No.

367
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:10,902
You and Keling can start over.
Is that okay?

368
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:13,222
Your Highness, you have to believe me.

369
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:16,942
Brother, I still hope
you can be a good person.

370
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:21,581
I... Okay.

371
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:28,864
What are you doing?

372
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,462
How is Banxia doing?

373
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:54,422
She has been writing all night.

374
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:56,222
Well, Mrs. Chun,

375
00:19:56,382 --> 00:19:58,222
since I escaped death,

376
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,581
I have not had any sleep till now.

377
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:00,902
Let me sleep for a while.

378
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,061
How could you sleep?

379
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:03,662
Keep a close watch on her.

380
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:09,061
Banxia came.

381
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:10,182
Quiet down.

382
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:17,902
- It's mealtime.
- Y-Yeah.

383
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:21,101
What's wrong with Mother's voice?

384
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:24,462
A bit hoarse because I was worried.

385
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,462
Dusty.

386
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:33,261
Lu Buping, didn't you
get any sleep last night?

387
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,382
Your eyes can't even open.

388
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,061
Well, aren't they open now?

389
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:41,341
I have something to tell you.

390
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,462
But don't panic.

391
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:49,741
I suspect there are people
from Lord Ling's Mansion around us.

392
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:53,982
I wrote so many
lawsuit papers last night.

393
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:58,501
They disappeared.
Where could they have gone?

394
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,261
They must have been stolen.

395
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:05,382
Mother, I've decided
to block the imperial envoy.

396
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:07,341
I will upend their nest. So...

397
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:10,142
Well, I'm full. I'll leave you eating.

398
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,622
I'm off to sleep a bit. You could go on.

399
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:13,301
Mother, you...

400
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:16,501
I'm also full. No, I can't eat anymore.

401
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:19,501
Jinrong, chat with Banxia.

402
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:20,902
What should I chat about?

403
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:23,862
Jinrong.

404
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:27,341
Peilan, well, talk with Banxia.

405
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:29,142
You two always chatted
since you were little.

406
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:30,821
I have to go find my jewelry box.

407
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:33,581
Where have I misplaced it?

408
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,741
- Peilan.
- Let's eat.

409
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:46,688
Peilan, do you think...

410
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:58,821
I can't explain it well.
I could only spend money on it.

411
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:03,862
As the saying goes, money talks.

412
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:06,976
Young Lord.

413
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,341
Young Lord.

414
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:11,462
What's wrong?

415
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:14,501
Someone set fire here last night
and was captured by the guards.

416
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,101
She said he knows you.

417
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,142
Knows me?

418
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:20,821
She said she's here for revenge.
Her name is Chun Keling.

419
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:23,382
Chun Keling? They caught Chun Keling?

420
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:24,741
They didn't torture her, did they?

421
00:22:31,902 --> 00:22:33,142
Banxia, time to eat.

422
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:04,501
Tell me, are you from
Lord Ling's Mansion?

423
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:06,982
Banxia, Mr. Lu is not from
Lord Ling's Mansion.

424
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:08,862
He is not?

425
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:10,581
Then why steal my lawsuit papers?

426
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:14,942
He... Maybe he wanted to have a look.

427
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:16,501
Correct. I just wanted to take a look.

428
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:17,462
Take a look?

429
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,222
So many books on my desk.
You didn't read those.

430
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:21,382
But you read my papers.

431
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:24,061
I...

432
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:26,741
Mother, he's definitely
from the Lord Ling's Mansion.

433
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,182
Colluding with Li Tengyun, right?

434
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:30,581
What did I say? Domestic thieves
are hard to guard against.

435
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,982
Grab him. Get up.

436
00:23:33,382 --> 00:23:35,142
- Follow me.
- Banxia, Banxia.

437
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,382
- Come with me.
- Banxia.

438
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:38,336
Follow me.

439
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:41,061
At this point, aren't you
just curious about the answer?

440
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:42,142
Alright, I'll tell you now.

441
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:43,616
Speak up.

442
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,462
- Banxia.
- Peilan.

443
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:56,142
Why did you hit her? You shall hit him.

444
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,862
I-I was too anxious.

445
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:05,261
Where's she?

446
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:06,101
She's locked up.

447
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:08,982
Who allowed you to lock her?
Unlock the door. Go unlock it.

448
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:25,662
Miss Keling, I heard
that you set fire to our house.

449
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:27,622
Is there a misunderstanding between us?

450
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:30,741
You sent Li Tengyun
to set fire to my house.

451
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:32,702
According to the rules of the Jianghu,
an eye for an eye.

452
00:24:33,662 --> 00:24:36,222
So, I had to retaliate by setting fire.
What misunderstanding?

453
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:38,182
No, I can explain this.

454
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:41,741
Weren't you very manly
when you were flirting with girls?

455
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:43,902
What? Dare to act
but not take responsibility?

456
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,422
No, that too was a misunderstanding.

457
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:46,702
- That day was because...
- Stop it.

458
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,182
Any further explanation is useless.

459
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,942
Now that I'm in your hands,

460
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:52,261
it's up to you to kill or to flay me.

461
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:57,741
But there's one thing.
If you dare to harm my family again,

462
00:24:57,821 --> 00:24:59,182
- What will you...
- I will...

463
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,862
I will not spare you even in death.

464
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:07,541
Alright, alright.

465
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:08,862
I know you're angry right now.

466
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:10,862
And you're convinced that I
had Li Tengyun set the fire.

467
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,581
Isn't it? How about this?

468
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:15,821
Your family's mansion
is at most worth 400 taels.

469
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,821
Here're 500 taels. Keep it.

470
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:20,341
I'll leave it here. Keep it.

471
00:25:20,382 --> 00:25:22,382
Take it as an explanation from me.

472
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:24,382
I beg you to go on living a good life

473
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,422
in Jianglin City, okay?

474
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:29,422
What do you mean?
Trying to keep this private?

475
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,662
You've set fire to our house,

476
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:32,741
and now ask us to live well.

477
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,142
Are you mentally ill?

478
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:36,142
If you say so, then it is.

479
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,702
Anyway, remember to take the money.

480
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:39,741
My brother has nothing to do with this.

481
00:25:39,781 --> 00:25:40,942
Just blame me.

482
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:42,422
I swear to you here.

483
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:44,462
From now on, no one
in the Lord Ling's Mansion will give you

484
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,581
or any member of your family
a hard time.

485
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:48,581
If I break this oath,
Heaven will strike me with lightning.

486
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,902
If I can't do it,
you can kill me anytime, okay?

487
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:56,702
You two, walk Miss Keling home safely.

488
00:25:56,741 --> 00:25:57,902
If anything happens to her,

489
00:25:57,902 --> 00:25:59,382
I'll castrate both of you.

490
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:00,640
Yes.

491
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:04,501
You can untie her after I leave.

492
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:06,400
Yes.

493
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:12,382
There isn't much time.
Banxia should be waking up soon.

494
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:16,341
In my opinion,
we should tell her directly.

495
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:17,741
After all, she should grow up.

496
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:19,662
Yes, no matter what,

497
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:21,101
we owe Banxia an explanation.

498
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:23,462
Otherwise, when she wakes up,
she will take Mr. Lu to the court again.

499
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:25,662
Right. If all else fails,

500
00:26:25,662 --> 00:26:27,261
let's say that
we accidentally started the fire.

501
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:29,501
Definitely can't mention that it was me.

502
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,662
Otherwise, she would
certainly send me to the prison.

503
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:33,862
How about saying it was me?

504
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:35,781
That definitely wouldn't work.

505
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,942
She even reported me,
her mother, to the court.

506
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:39,622
We can't accuse Keling either, right?

507
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,101
Why don't we draw straws?

508
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:45,341
Nonsense!

509
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:51,887
(Guo Zhensheng)

510
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:54,821
It's fate.

511
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,222
Okay, let's calm Banxia first.

512
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,061
What's more, he's not here now, right?

513
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:03,101
What should we say then?

514
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,622
He forgot to turn off the oil lamp,
and you discovered it, Lu Buping.

515
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:08,942
But who lights the oil lamp
in broad daylight?

516
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:11,341
Anyway, he lit it. That's it.

517
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:12,821
Stick to one story, got it?

518
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:15,422
We must never let Banxia know
that she started the fire.

519
00:27:15,462 --> 00:27:17,408
What?

520
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:26,741
If that's the case,
then it's complicated.

521
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:30,182
There must be something fishy in it.

522
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:33,341
Young Lord has always denied
that the fire was started by Li Tengyun.

523
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,382
And he gave us so much money.

524
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:38,422
Where did he give you the money?

525
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:40,501
On the street.

526
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,662
Mother, why do you care
whether it was fishy or not?

527
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,182
If he gives it, then we take it.

528
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:46,622
Isn't that bad, Jinrong?

529
00:27:46,702 --> 00:27:49,781
Peilan, for sure he instructed
Li Tengyun to start that fire.

530
00:27:49,942 --> 00:27:51,341
He just wants to privately settle it now

531
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:52,662
and keeps us quiet with money.

532
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:54,982
Even if he settles it,
we need to wait for

533
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,261
the court's result.

534
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:57,581
What if we accept the money now

535
00:27:57,581 --> 00:27:58,982
and then they turn back on us?

536
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,142
Turn back on what?

537
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:01,382
Blackmail and extortion.

538
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:03,422
Just one is enough to make us lose much.

539
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:05,581
It's a fact
that Chun Banxia's fire was an accident.

540
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,662
Li Tengyun's arson
is also a fact, isn't it?

541
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:09,344
What?

542
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:15,136
(A Letter to Mr. Zhang
from the Ministry of Justice)

543
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:22,101
(Law applies to everyone,
no matter their status.)

544
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:24,741
I believe you will uphold justice fairly

545
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:26,382
and give an explanation to us.

546
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:29,622
Don't worry, Mother.

547
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:30,622
I will gather evidence later.

548
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:32,422
I will sue that darn official together.

549
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:36,862
The court will give us justice.

550
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:45,152
Banxia.

551
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:48,862
Something's wrong.

552
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:50,142
What's wrong? What's wrong?

553
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:51,142
Banxia is gone.

554
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,821
You can't even keep an eye on a person?

555
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,182
I went to prepare her food.

556
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:57,821
You... Hurry, call the others.

557
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,142
Hope nothing bad would happen to her.

558
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:00,142
Quick. Go now.

559
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:02,182
I'll call them. I'll call.

560
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,581
W-W-Who should I call?

561
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:06,781
(Justice)

562
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:08,501
Your Honor, I am Chun Banxia.

563
00:29:08,662 --> 00:29:10,821
The case of the Chun family fire
is because of me,

564
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:13,261
so, I hope you can judge me.

565
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:15,072
Wait.

566
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,581
What are you doing here?

567
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,182
Your Honor. Your Honor.

568
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:22,341
My sister is young and not sensible.
She came to the wrong place.

569
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:23,741
Yes, yes.

570
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,382
Mother, it was me
who forgot to put out the stove.

571
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:34,702
So I made a mistake. Please blame me.

572
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:36,902
Is it easy for me
to raise you to such an age?

573
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,662
I will be relieved when you are fine.

574
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,622
What on earth are you so anxious about?

575
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:44,061
They haven't figured out
what's going on yet.

576
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:45,741
Jinrong.

577
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,662
Banxia, as long as our family
are safe and sound,

578
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:50,702
we can get through

579
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:51,902
any difficulties.

580
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:53,581
Peilan.

581
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:56,142
There is no need
to say sorry in our family.

582
00:29:56,781 --> 00:30:00,662
Keling, but you
shouldn't have taken that money.

583
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:10,182
Mother, I was wrong.
I forgot to turn off the stove.

584
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,301
I ruined our family
and we have nothing left.

585
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:16,581
We have no house now. I'm sorry to you.

586
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:19,902
I'm also sorry to Father.
You can blame me.

587
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:22,341
We can rebuild the house if it burns.

588
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:25,061
We can find a way
if we run out of money.

589
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:28,101
We are a family.
We should shoulder burdens together.

590
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:29,261
Your father will forgive you.

591
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:30,942
We all forgave you as well.

592
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:31,942
Get up. Come on.

593
00:30:31,982 --> 00:30:34,862
No, I made a mistake.
I should pay for it.

594
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:36,581
Who doesn't make mistakes?

595
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,942
But when you've made mistakes before,

596
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:41,821
I always held onto your mistakes
and wouldn't let go.

597
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:46,821
I'm sorry. I owe you all.

598
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:50,622
I think when you
should persist, you have to.

599
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:52,662
Sometimes it's okay not to let go.

600
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:53,942
What I worry about the most is

601
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,182
that you keep holding onto
your own mistakes

602
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:57,862
and never forgive yourself
in your lifetime.

603
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:00,341
That's what I worry about the most.
Do you understand?

604
00:31:01,182 --> 00:31:02,422
Mother.

605
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,982
I raised you four by selling tofu.
Do you think it was easy?

606
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:07,702
What difficulties haven't I faced?

607
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:09,902
At worst, we go back to Qing City
and start over.

608
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,422
Go back to Qing City?

609
00:31:12,301 --> 00:31:15,662
Banxia, the fire was not
necessarily set by you, right?

610
00:31:15,662 --> 00:31:17,902
Didn't Li Tengyun already confess?

611
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,902
It doesn't matter who started it.

612
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:22,222
As long as you four are healthy,

613
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:25,261
and we are together, I'm satisfied.

614
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:27,136
Mother.

615
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:29,501
The money still has to be taken.

616
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:37,382
Your Honor, we won't sue. We withdraw.

617
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:41,261
Silence. It's not appropriate
to wail in court.

618
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:44,662
It's hard for judges
to handle family matters.

619
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:47,702
Just resolve them yourself. Dismissed.

620
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:52,222
Awesome.

621
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,602
(Propitious house for sale)
Mother,

622
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,182
it wasn't easy for you
to take us to Jianglin.

623
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:05,902
It's my fault. I ruined our house.

624
00:32:08,422 --> 00:32:09,662
Are we really going back like this?

625
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:11,501
Where we are doesn't matter.

626
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:13,462
What matters is that we are together.

627
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:15,648
Go back if you want,

628
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,622
(Propitious house for sale)
but I won't.

629
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:20,341
Great, then you stay and sell the house.

630
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:24,622
I'm not selling either.
Who would buy it in such a condition?

631
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:26,942
250 taels. Not one less.

632
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:31,776
Propitious house? Who would buy it?

633
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:33,856
Mr. Lu, please stop it.

634
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:41,622
Don't be upset. We'll start over
when we get back to Qing City.

635
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,662
Mother, I promise
to earn a lot of money when I go back.

636
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:50,862
I will buy a house
that's even bigger and better than it.

637
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:52,862
Having this intention is good enough.

638
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:56,341
Mrs. Chun! Mrs. Chun!

639
00:32:57,261 --> 00:33:02,422
Mrs. Chun. Mrs. Chun.

640
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:03,462
What are you here for?

641
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:07,061
Are you planning to move?

642
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:08,222
None of your business.

643
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,301
Okay.

644
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:11,261
The fire wasn't set by you all,

645
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,222
but Li Tengyun showed up
at our doorstep with a torch.

646
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:14,741
You folks are not up to any good.

647
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:16,662
Mrs. Chun, our misunderstandings

648
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:18,422
can't be cleared up
with just one or two words.

649
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:21,341
How about this?
As you didn't want the money,

650
00:33:21,622 --> 00:33:24,142
I'll use the money
to help you repair your house.

651
00:33:24,222 --> 00:33:26,821
I guarantee it will be
the same as before, okay?

652
00:33:27,662 --> 00:33:28,942
(Propitious house for sale)
Why are you doing this?

653
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,101
You've said it yourself.
Li Tengyun didn't start the fire,

654
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:34,862
but he came to your house with a torch.

655
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:37,101
I bear some responsibility for this,

656
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,462
so I should bear
the losses you suffered.

657
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:40,942
But I have just one condition.

658
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:41,902
What condition?

659
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:45,101
You absolutely must not
return to Qing City.

660
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:49,341
Stay here. You can do whatever you want.

661
00:33:49,382 --> 00:33:51,902
How about this?
You all stay at my place first.

662
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:00,942
You wanted to touch me, didn't you?

663
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:02,821
But was it necessary to burn my house?

664
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:10,581
Mrs. Chun, before your house
is repaired, please stay here.

665
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,462
This is my mansion.

666
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:15,021
It's also for the marriage.

667
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:16,902
(Young Lord's Mansion)
But I haven't used it.

668
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,181
Based on my current state,
I probably won't be using it soon.

669
00:34:20,462 --> 00:34:21,792
Please don't disdain it.

670
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:29,462
Jinrong, I think something is a bit off.

671
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,982
Why is he suddenly being so nice to us?

672
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:33,581
I know. He...

673
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,581
Just settle your mind down.

674
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,902
It's fine. It's fine.

675
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:54,942
(Steward Xin)
Welcome, new owners.

676
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:57,982
- Welcome, new owners.
- Welcome, new owners.

677
00:34:58,581 --> 00:34:59,581
Please go in and have a look.

678
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,181
Please go in and check.

679
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:03,462
- Let's go, Mother.
- Let's go.

680
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,302
Go in and take a look.

681
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:16,262
(Young Lord's Mansion)

682
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:26,262
Younger brother, come on.
Take a look. How is it?

683
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:28,742
Si, I've arranged everything here.

684
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:30,221
I guarantee there's no problem.

685
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:34,942
Logically, you don't have to pay
the money for repairing their house.

686
00:35:35,581 --> 00:35:37,581
I'll pay you back later.

687
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:39,581
No, no, what are you saying?

688
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:41,982
Weren't you here to find Miss Keling?
There you go.

689
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:45,101
Check out how I have arranged everything
by the way.

690
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:48,581
Is Keling doing great?

691
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:51,462
She's living here now.
What could possibly be wrong?

692
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,862
Furthermore, I've already told her

693
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,382
that all of this
has nothing to do with you.

694
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,862
She believed it. Please rest assured.

695
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,862
Someone, lead the way.

696
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:03,262
Your Highness!

697
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:07,262
Eunuch Wang.

698
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,768
Your Highness.

699
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:12,541
The Empress Dowager has fainted.
The Emperor summons you to return now.

700
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:15,061
No delay. We must go quickly.

701
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:19,982
An emergency has happened in the palace.
I have to go back now, brother.

702
00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:21,141
Hurry up.

703
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:23,462
Wait, younger brother.
