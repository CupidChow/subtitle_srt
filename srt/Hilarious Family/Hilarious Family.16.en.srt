34

Boss,

35
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:03,242
you just moved back like this?

36
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:07,081
My own home is the best.

37
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:08,321
Besides, my mother said

38
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,601
the Young Lord's mansion
has a feng shui problem.

39
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:11,761
No sane person lives there.

40
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,122
But I still think
that mansion is more elegant.

41
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,082
Right, we should have them

42
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:17,522
reconstruct this place
like that mansion.

43
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:18,841
Look at your room.

44
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:20,482
It's basically the same as before.

45
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,001
You can't say it's the same.

46
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,721
It's clearly identical.

47
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,321
Did they think we were nostalgic?

48
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:33,362
But it's fine.

49
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:38,402
Boss, you left your purse out of place.

50
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:48,841
Why are you following us?

51
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:53,082
Your purse was left at my room.

52
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:55,281
By the way, what's your name?

53
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:56,761
You can call me A-Si.

54
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:58,561
A-Si?

55
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,881
Miss, what's your name?

56
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,041
What's wrong? The money is missing?

57
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:06,841
No.

58
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:08,001
Isn't this the purse

59
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:08,881
A-Si gave you back then?

60
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:11,281
Don't you have something to do?

61
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:12,441
Go to work.

62
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:15,122
Boss, this thing
is called a token of love.

63
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,881
You can't just leave it anywhere.

64
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:18,482
You have to think carefully about it.

65
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:19,962
A token of love, huh?

66
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,402
It is.

67
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:34,721
I've never paid for meals.

68
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:35,922
- Let's go.
- Go.

69
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:39,802
He is not dead?

70
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:44,441
Well,

71
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:47,202
you have to have something sweet
after eating something salty, right?

72
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:48,448
It makes sense.

73
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:51,001
Do you like it salty or sweet?

74
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:52,881
I like a lighter taste.

75
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:55,362
Hello?

76
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:56,032
Then it's tasteless.

77
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,402
- It has no taste.
- Sir? Sir?

78
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:59,264
- I think...
- Sir? Sir?

79
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,161
It really is you! You're not dead.

80
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:04,561
You're the dead one.

81
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:05,761
How dare you talk to him like that?

82
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,482
No, it's great.

83
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:08,682
Why didn't you die then?

84
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,402
Boss, she's provoking you.

85
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,082
No.

86
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:12,041
Don't you remember me?

87
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:13,721
It's me. You robbed me last time.

88
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:23,482
What are you looking at?
This is robbery.

89
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:24,832
- Give it to me.
- No.

90
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:26,961
I remember now.

91
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,881
It's you.

92
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:30,242
Where's that kid?

93
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:31,561
- Who?
- What kid?

94
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:33,001
The one who hit me on the head.

95
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:34,201
He hit your head?

96
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:34,881
On guard!

97
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:37,162
I lost my sense of taste
because of that, you know?

98
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:39,802
Now you've brought yourself
to my doorstep.

99
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:40,521
Come with me.

100
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:41,722
- No, no. Help!
- Come.

101
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:42,362
Go.

102
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,296
- Stop!
- Help!

103
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:48,922
In broad daylight,

104
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:51,881
three grown men are bullying a girl.

105
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:52,096
(Lu Jiang)

106
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,081
(Lu Jiang)
It isn't right.

107
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,881
Boss, here comes another one.

108
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:57,482
It's okay.

109
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,961
Old man, I advise you
not to meddle in this.

110
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:09,056
Get lost now.

111
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:10,464
Watch this!

112
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:22,880
It fell.

113
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:50,201
Boss, you're bleeding
from the head again.

114
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:51,488
Boss.

115
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:53,961
It's the sword's aura!

116
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:54,602
Sword's aura?

117
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:55,641
Go.

118
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:58,682
- Sir, don't go, sir.
- Let me go.

119
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:00,881
Don't go. Stop.

120
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:01,984
Miss,

121
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,288
spare others when you can.

122
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:05,242
Be careful in the future.

123
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,592
I'll take my leave.

124
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:08,201
Thank you, hero.

125
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:13,282
Great, Mr. Lu didn't kill anyone.

126
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:19,401
Mr. Lu!

127
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,201
That thug didn't die.

128
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:22,761
What thug?

129
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,722
The one you knocked dead
with a bat last time.

130
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:26,001
No, we all thought he was dead,

131
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:26,602
but he wasn't.

132
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:27,922
I saw him on the street.

133
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:28,561
I remember now.

134
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:29,961
He's not dead?

135
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:31,602
Are you sure?

136
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:32,282
Absolutely.

137
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:33,561
But a hero drove him away.

138
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,922
Otherwise,
I would have brought him here.

139
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,482
So, he's not dead.

140
00:06:38,122 --> 00:06:38,842
I'm free now.

141
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,104
You are here.

142
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,722
A man was looking for someone
with a portrait.

143
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:55,561
As soon as I saw this,

144
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:56,922
a familiar feeling hit me.

145
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:57,802
80 percent familiar.

146
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:00,864
- An old friend from Qing City.
- Huh?

147
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,752
Who is this?

148
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,736
Isn't this you, Mr. Lu?

149
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,208
Me?

150
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,201
H-How is this possible?

151
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:12,602
No wonder it looks familiar.

152
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:13,600
It's me?

153
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:14,561
Is this me?

154
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:15,602
It's you, Mr. Lu.

155
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,682
You were quite skinny back then.

156
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:18,401
Those eyes don't look like mine.

157
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,042
Mr. Lu, this is the hero who saved me.

158
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,561
And then, those people saw...

159
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:51,360
Buping.

160
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:52,576
Buping?

161
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:53,568
Buping?

162
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:54,720
Buping?

163
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:56,064
Father.

164
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:57,120
Father?

165
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:58,048
Father?

166
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,040
Father?

167
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:00,441
Buping.

168
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:01,794
Father, father.

169
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:03,360
Father.

170
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:06,432
Buping,

171
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,482
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

172
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:11,441
I never expected

173
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:12,961
to meet you here, father.

174
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:18,081
Why are you here?

175
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,042
It's a long story.

176
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,482
The day after I left home,

177
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:24,162
I accidentally killed a thug.

178
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:26,561
It was Peilan

179
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:28,201
who took me in.

180
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,242
Brat!

181
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,242
So you just hid after killing someone?

182
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,144
No.

183
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,842
No, it's a misunderstanding.

184
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:37,401
Master Lu,

185
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,001
you saw

186
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,122
the very thug just now.

187
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:39,722
He didn't die.

188
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:40,401
He didn't?

189
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,242
You shouldn't hide,
even if he didn't die.

190
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:43,362
This is called evasion.

191
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:45,312
Father, I'm sorry.

192
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,761
I was too strict with you.

193
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:55,136
I asked too much.

194
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:57,362
It's okay.

195
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:59,401
Stop weeping!

196
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,442
You are a man,

197
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:03,482
and you should man up.

198
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,001
Alright.

199
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:09,152
Does it hurt?

200
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,881
You should have at least said goodbye
when you left.

201
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:15,562
I almost went crazy looking for you.

202
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:20,962
You've had a hard time, Buping.

203
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:21,962
It's okay.

204
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:24,362
No, I mean...

205
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,722
Well, I'm fine. Really.

206
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:26,962
If it hurts,

207
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:28,562
you should compress it with cold water.

208
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:30,962
I can see that
you're deeply concerned for your son.

209
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:31,921
But you

210
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:32,761
shouldn't

211
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,921
make such a scene in public.

212
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,842
No, Master,

213
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:38,528
this is the way my father loves me.

214
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,520
No one knows a father
better than his son.

215
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:45,568
Does it hurt?

216
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:48,992
Father, I've also
been through a lot recently.

217
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,296
You've grown up.

218
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:53,681
Peilan... How about

219
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:55,482
we take you home, and then you can talk?

220
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:56,576
No need.

221
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:59,242
Buping, pack up, and go home with me.

222
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:01,681
Wait, father.

223
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,442
I-I-I can't leave now.

224
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:04,544
Why is that?

225
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:06,272
Because...

226
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:07,552
I...

227
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,681
I-I still have work to do.

228
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:12,000
Work?

229
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:19,968
Mother.

230
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:22,521
Where is Lu Buping?

231
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:24,122
I haven't seen him since this morning.

232
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:25,041
Where did he go?

233
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:26,202
Lu Buping.

234
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:27,521
Mrs. Chun,

235
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:29,122
t-this is my father.

236
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:30,761
Father, this is Mrs. Chun.

237
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:33,161
He is your father?

238
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:34,921
I am Lu Jiang.

239
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:36,761
Thank you for taking care of my son

240
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:37,842
during this time.

241
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:43,962
Steward Lu, why didn't you say a word

242
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,562
that your father had come?

243
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:46,602
Steward Lu?

244
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:50,962
You are a steward here?

245
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,082
So this is the unfinished work
you mentioned?

246
00:10:57,881 --> 00:10:59,761
Instead of
being the patriarch of the Lus,

247
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,202
you came here to become a steward?

248
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:02,322
You are really something.

249
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,161
Who's that?

250
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:14,681
M-M-Master...

251
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:15,842
Master Lu!

252
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:18,202
You are?

253
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:19,681
I-I am Chun Keling.

254
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:21,242
I have seen your portrait.

255
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:23,122
Can I shake hands with you?

256
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:26,761
Mother, I have shaken hands
with the martial arts alliance leader!

257
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:29,801
W-W-What?

258
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,362
Martial arts alliance leader?

259
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:34,281
Master Lu,
why did you come to our house?

260
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:36,896
To find my son.

261
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:40,842
Lu Buping is your son?

262
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,281
Mother, how could you

263
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:46,482
let Master Lu's son be a steward?

264
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:48,281
What steward? Don't spout nonsense here.

265
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,521
You even made him sleep in the woodshed.

266
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,442
Do whatever you have to do. Go.

267
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:53,641
Master Lu, don't listen to her.

268
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:55,442
My daughter likes to joke.

269
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:56,082
Just leave.

270
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:58,362
Mrs. Chun, sorry for the disturbance.
We're leaving.

271
00:11:58,688 --> 00:11:59,424
Go.

272
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:00,881
Don't go just like that.

273
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,602
Father!

274
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:02,681
- Mr. Lu!
- I'm not leaving.

275
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,881
I-I'm not leaving.

276
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,152
You're not leaving?

277
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,528
Why?

278
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,776
Father,

279
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,521
I've been away from home for so long.

280
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:10,801
I think I've found

281
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:11,962
my purpose in life.

282
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:13,801
So... so I don't want to quit.

283
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:17,562
Are you trying to make me angry?

284
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,442
Is my son

285
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,641
only worthy of being a servant here?

286
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,122
Father, there's no shame in it.

287
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,128
Shut up!

288
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:36,801
Go back with me.

289
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,464
Go.

290
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,641
Father, father,
it's not that I don't want to go.

291
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:42,482
- Go!
- Father.

292
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:43,456
You're my only son.

293
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:44,122
I won't leave.

294
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,401
You have to take over as patriarch.

295
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,041
Father, I won't go.

296
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,168
- Come with me!
- No, I won't.

297
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:48,672
Go!

298
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:15,296
Peilan,

299
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:19,552
leave them there. I'll fold them myself.

300
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,001
It's okay, Mr. Lu.

301
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,161
You are about to leave.

302
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:31,552
Yes.

303
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:35,881
Didn't think the day'd come so soon.

304
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,562
It's good.

305
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,681
When you just came to our house,

306
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,562
you were scared every day.

307
00:13:48,122 --> 00:13:48,722
It's better now.

308
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,001
In retrospect,

309
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:57,962
everything seems like yesterday.

310
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:00,384
Yes.

311
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,842
I just started
to feel like this was home.

312
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:07,808
And now I have to leave.

313
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:16,881
I-I will make you some more food

314
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:17,681
that you love to eat.

315
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,072
Peilan.

316
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:24,608
I want to stay with you a bit longer.

317
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,161
If I don't do that now,

318
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,216
I may not have another chance.

319
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:30,816
Peilan,

320
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:36,082
I'm about to leave.

321
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:39,161
Don't you have anything to say to me?

322
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:49,041
Mr. Lu,

323
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:53,376
I wish you joy.

324
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:00,320
Is there nothing else?

325
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:07,488
Come back often.

326
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,304
I don't want to leave.

327
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:17,472
I can't bear to.

328
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:22,304
Mr. Lu,

329
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:24,362
your father is right.

330
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,722
You can't be a servant all your life.

331
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:28,641
You are the only son of the Lu family.

332
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:29,921
You will be a hero.

333
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:31,602
But I don't care
about being a hero at all.

334
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,281
The only thing I care about is...

335
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,082
I will beg Mrs. Chun.

336
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:45,001
I'll ask her to convince father
to let me stay.

337
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:46,761
Mr. Lu!

338
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:50,041
Mrs. Chun.

339
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:53,962
Buping?

340
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:56,681
Look at what you did.

341
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,602
Why didn't you tell me earlier

342
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:00,322
that your father's
the martial arts alliance leader?

343
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:02,602
You even pretended to be a beggar.

344
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:05,504
I'm sorry, Mrs. Chun.

345
00:16:05,952 --> 00:16:06,976
You are sorry?

346
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:08,202
The one who should say sorry

347
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,362
is me.

348
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:11,761
I made you do so much work earlier.

349
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,082
After you leave with him,

350
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,602
you have to take good care of yourself.

351
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:15,602
No, Mrs. Chun,

352
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,016
I don't want to leave.

353
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:19,680
You don't?

354
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:22,641
I've been with you people for so long.

355
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:25,952
I-I already have feelings for everyone.

356
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,616
Especially...

357
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:30,281
Especially you, Mrs. Chun.

358
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,281
Please let me stay.

359
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:35,122
Yeah, it's been so long.

360
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,001
How can we not have feelings?

361
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:39,401
Mrs. Chun, can you talk to my father

362
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:40,681
and ask him to let me stay?

363
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,442
To let you stay?

364
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,401
It's okay if I can't stay forever.

365
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:45,442
I just need a few more days.

366
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:48,122
I just want to stay with you
for a little longer.

367
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,001
Mrs. Chun, please help me.

368
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:56,608
I...

369
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:02,082
Do you really want to stay?

370
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:05,522
Then I'll talk to him.

371
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:22,816
- Mrs. Chun.
- Master Lu,

372
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,241
are you used to living in Keling's room?

373
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:28,842
It's a very nice place.
Thank you, Mrs. Chun.

374
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:30,802
You're welcome.

375
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,921
I have something to discuss with you.

376
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:36,762
What's it?

377
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:39,241
It's about Buping.

378
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:40,481
Please come in.

379
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:42,201
Okay, after you.

380
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,961
Buping.

381
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,056
Master.

382
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,042
I brewed a pot of good tea
for your father.

383
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,296
Where is he?

384
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,441
He's talking with Mrs. Chun in the room.

385
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:14,122
Why did your father close the door

386
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:16,512
for mere talking?

387
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:18,362
My father didn't close it,
but Mrs. Chun did.

388
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:20,802
Did she?

389
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:29,362
They don't seem to be talking.

390
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:31,802
Master, wait. Master.

391
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,296
Mrs. Chun,

392
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:37,280
about Buping,

393
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:39,296
I was about to ask for your advice.

394
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:42,322
Buping's mother was gone
since he was a child.

395
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,576
I didn't know how to raise him properly.

396
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:46,880
But this time,

397
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,696
I found that he has been deeply attached

398
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,802
to you people.

399
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:56,562
Could you tell me how you get along

400
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:59,401
with Buping normally in private?

401
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,024
And how do you communicate?

402
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:07,362
Uh, well...

403
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:12,441
I think the most important thing
is to respect

404
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:14,201
the thoughts of children.

405
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,122
And when you're with them,

406
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,401
be like a friend.

407
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:21,201
Respect?

408
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,464
Respect.

409
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:26,641
That's not right.

410
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:29,602
I asked him to go back
and take over as patriarch.

411
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:31,200
Don't I respect him?

412
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,401
Once he returns

413
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,241
as the patriarch,

414
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:35,002
everyone will respect him in every way.

415
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:37,881
I've been looking for him
for so long, Mrs. Chun.

416
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:39,362
I really didn't expect

417
00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:40,721
that he would actually be here

418
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:43,122
as a servant

419
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:45,562
and take this

420
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:48,602
as his life goal.

421
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:50,112
No.

422
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:53,481
Buping is a sensible child.

423
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:55,322
Master Lu, you are a blessed man.

424
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,002
Mrs. Chun,
you don't have to speak for him.

425
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,362
I know my own son.

426
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:00,082
Master Lu, listen to me.

427
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:02,082
I came here to ask

428
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,481
if you could

429
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,522
let Buping stay.

430
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:09,481
I-I am not asking you
to let him be a steward.

431
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,562
I just feel that

432
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,241
since he's been with my family
for a long time

433
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:13,522
and we're attached to each other,

434
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:15,401
we all hate to see him go.

435
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,842
Please let him stay a little longer.

436
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:27,562
Mrs. Chun,
all things must come to an end.

437
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:28,800
He...

438
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,641
Master Lu, what's wrong with you?

439
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,576
Nothing. It's an old illness
from when I was young.

440
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,536
I'm fine.

441
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:40,562
Y-You should lie down.

442
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:42,641
- Take some rest.
- I'm fine, really.

443
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:44,481
No, don't push yourself.

444
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:45,762
Just lie down.

445
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:47,296
- Mrs. Chun.
- Lie down quickly.

446
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,641
Did I just hear

447
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:56,362
"lie down"?

448
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,481
Did I mishear?

449
00:20:58,912 --> 00:20:59,872
I heard it too.

450
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:02,688
It can't be, right?

451
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,576
It can't be.

452
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:15,921
Young Lord, the Chuns

453
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,401
have already moved away.

454
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,200
They did?

455
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:22,042
Which idiot let them move away?

456
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,282
D-Didn't you let them move away?

457
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:26,921
I said that out of anger.

458
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:28,832
Your Highness?

459
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:32,042
Father, what brings you here?

460
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:33,681
I heard

461
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:35,968
you drove the Chuns away.

462
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,921
No, father, it's a misunderstanding.

463
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:39,602
Are you stupid?

464
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:40,681
What then

465
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:41,762
if Fourth Prince is back?

466
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,842
Actually, we can't
blame Young Lord for this.

467
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:49,002
The Chuns were planning to move anyway.

468
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:51,201
What's it to you?

469
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:52,921
I bet this was your bad idea.

470
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:55,040
- Father, I...
- And you.

471
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:58,401
I thought you had grown up.

472
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:01,921
But it seems that you're still hopeless.

473
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:09,362
Your Highness, it's not like that.

474
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:10,842
I am talking to my son.

475
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:12,241
You have no place to interrupt.

476
00:22:15,122 --> 00:22:17,122
I noticed that
since you've been with him,

477
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:18,641
he has become a good-for-nothing.

478
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,721
Listen.

479
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,842
If Fourth Prince gets angry
when he's back,

480
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:23,562
you go take the blame yourself.

481
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:24,161
Did you hear me?

482
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:25,920
Yes.

483
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:27,002
Please calm down.

484
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,122
I'm going right now
to apologize to Chuns.

485
00:22:29,322 --> 00:22:31,842
I certainly won't let Fourth Prince
blame you and Young Lord.

486
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:33,762
You'd better stick to your words.

487
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:41,504
What are you looking at?

488
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:42,752
Get lost!

489
00:22:57,282 --> 00:22:58,681
Mr. Lu loves eggs the most.

490
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:00,441
I should cook more

491
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,048
to let him eat them on the road.

492
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:10,082
Miss Peilan.

493
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:11,921
Mr. Li.

494
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,282
The house has been reconstructed.

495
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,842
It's exactly like before.

496
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:18,112
Yes.

497
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:21,522
Mr. Li, what brings you here so late?

498
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:23,921
I came to see Mrs. Chun.

499
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:25,401
A few days ago,

500
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:27,441
Young Lord and you
had a small misunderstanding.

501
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,696
I came to apologize.

502
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:33,082
Mr. Li, did you hurt your face?

503
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:36,288
I…

504
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:38,481
I accidentally fell.

505
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:40,608
I fell.

506
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,440
I don't want to eat it.

507
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:46,881
It's not that.

508
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:49,322
Remove the egg shell
and rub it on your face.

509
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:50,522
The swelling will go down soon.

510
00:23:58,432 --> 00:23:59,552
Mr. Li?

511
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,568
Thank you.

512
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,042
When you are away from home,

513
00:24:08,002 --> 00:24:09,362
you must take good care of yourself.

514
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,082
(It turns out that in this world,)

515
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:23,881
(there is still someone
who cares about me.)

516
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:43,802
(On the day of Guiyou, it is sunny.)

517
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:46,681
(Today, a girl)

518
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,842
(walked into my heart.)

519
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:14,241
Fancy, but useless.

520
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,002
- Master Lu, are you done practicing?
- Mrs. Chun.

521
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:29,241
You washed the clothes?

522
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,802
Let me help you.

523
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:33,241
I can do it myself. Thank you.

524
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,488
I saw it was sunny today,

525
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,152
so I thought I should wash the clothes.

526
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:38,505
I can do it myself.

527
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:39,785
I'll do it with you.

528
00:25:41,545 --> 00:25:43,146
You're just

529
00:25:43,186 --> 00:25:44,866
like a young lad in spirit.

530
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,305
Mrs. Chun, you are flattering me.

531
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,745
No, I'm being sincere.

532
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:50,705
Thank you.

533
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:54,346
Ruyu, don't be deceived by him.

534
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:55,505
I see it now.

535
00:25:55,705 --> 00:25:57,146
You practice swordsmanship
where Ruyu is.

536
00:25:57,186 --> 00:25:58,225
You're showing off to her.

537
00:25:58,505 --> 00:25:59,225
He's tricking you.

538
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:00,465
Stop flaunting yourself!

539
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:01,985
What are you doing?

540
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:03,065
Didn't you see?

541
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:04,386
He was clutching your clothes

542
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:05,146
with that smirk.

543
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:06,626
He's taking advantage of you.

544
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:07,808
What's your problem?

545
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:09,545
You have no shame.

546
00:26:09,586 --> 00:26:10,866
It's Ruyu's underwear.

547
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:12,186
And you were pinching them.

548
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:13,545
You shameless old man!

549
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,186
Are you out of your mind?

550
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,626
These are Master Lu's clothes.

551
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:19,866
Mr. Guo,

552
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:21,505
you got me wrong.

553
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:25,545
You washed his clothes,

554
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:27,225
and they are underwear.

555
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,305
Lu Zhensheng, listen.

556
00:26:30,346 --> 00:26:31,465
Lu Zhensheng? I'm Guo Zhensheng.

557
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:32,785
You even got my name wrong.

558
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,785
Master Lu is our precious guest.

559
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:37,146
Don't make a fuss here.

560
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:38,545
It's embarrassing.

561
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:40,346
Master Lu, give me a hand.

562
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:41,545
I... Mr. Guo.

563
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:42,624
Mr. Guo, here.

564
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:43,586
Don't mind him.

565
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:44,426
Mr. Guo.

566
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:47,346
You want me to help you
wring clothes? Disgusting!

567
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:50,305
He is really sick. Just ignore him.

568
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:52,386
Mrs. Chun, is it really okay?

569
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:53,666
What's not okay about it?

570
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:05,985
Miss Peilan.

571
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:08,386
Mr. Li.

572
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:10,465
Why are you here?

573
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,785
I was passing by.
What a coincidence to run into you!

574
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:14,666
Indeed.

575
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,065
Miss Peilan,

576
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:24,305
the egg you gave me last time

577
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:26,146
was very useful. Look.

578
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:29,106
Right? Master taught me about that.

579
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:30,545
Master?

580
00:27:31,265 --> 00:27:32,305
He is really awesome.

581
00:27:36,186 --> 00:27:37,265
Look, I...

582
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:40,946
It's alright.

583
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,465
What do you mean by "alright"?
It's worn.

584
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:46,305
It can still be worn if patched up.

585
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:48,545
I have to buy groceries.

586
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:49,866
I'll be off now, Mr. Li.

587
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:51,488
Uh...

588
00:27:56,586 --> 00:27:58,505
She's really a provident girl.

589
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,505
Make way, make way.

590
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:12,626
Martial arts alliance leader?

591
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:15,065
How much do you get paid a month?

592
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:18,826
It's just a title

593
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,666
with no money.

594
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:24,265
So what's the use of that?
It's just a name, right?

595
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,505
I have my share of profits every month.

596
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:29,626
Will you just shut up?

597
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,465
Master Lu,

598
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,985
what's with that chest pain of yours?

599
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:39,065
It's a lingering illness

600
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,826
from when I was young and reckless.

601
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:43,626
You have to be more careful
in the future.

602
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:46,305
Being reckless?

603
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:47,906
He is just feeble.

604
00:28:48,545 --> 00:28:50,705
The pickled cabbage fish soup is here.

605
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:51,785
The pickled cabbage fish soup!

606
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:52,985
Master Lu,

607
00:28:53,386 --> 00:28:55,705
this pickled cabbage fish soup
was personally made by me.

608
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:56,745
Come and try it.

609
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,186
There might be a lot of fishbones in it.

610
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:01,346
Be careful.

611
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:01,985
Okay.

612
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:06,866
It's okay.

613
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,265
Try some.

614
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:11,985
Be careful. It's hot.

615
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:18,946
It's amazing!

616
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,386
Mrs. Chun, did you ever learn to cook?

617
00:29:23,985 --> 00:29:25,025
What are you talking about?

618
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:27,305
I never learned it on purpose.

619
00:29:27,305 --> 00:29:28,146
I just...

620
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,545
I just love to cook.

621
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:33,465
My four daughters

622
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,826
are quite picky.

623
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:35,985
Right.

624
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,146
But ever since I hurt my back,

625
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,586
I haven't done much cooking.

626
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:42,065
Right. At our age,

627
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:43,545
we are scared of hurting our backs.

628
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:44,225
Yes.

629
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,426
What's there to be scared of?

630
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:46,785
You have a doctor here.

631
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:49,186
Mother,

632
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:50,785
I have something to tell you.

633
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:51,705
Can you let Keling

634
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:53,065
stay in Peilan's room?

635
00:29:53,146 --> 00:29:53,985
I study every night.

636
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:55,545
She's too noisy,
and I can't concentrate.

637
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:57,305
Why don't you just study less?

638
00:29:58,186 --> 00:29:59,225
This is?

639
00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:02,745
This is my third daughter, Chun Banxia.

640
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,546
Hello, Master Lu.

641
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:04,666
She loves reading.

642
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:06,186
It's good to read.

643
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,186
She's promising, Mrs. Chun.

644
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:09,826
- Right.
- Unlike my naughty son.

645
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:11,265
He won't study, no matter what.

646
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:12,826
She not only loves to read,

647
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,146
but she also has medical skills.

648
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:14,906
Really?

649
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:17,225
You've also learned medicine?

650
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:18,626
You're also interested?

651
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:21,505
I have roamed
the martial arts world for a long time.

652
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:24,785
I've never seen a female doctor.

653
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:27,465
Your daughter is really extraordinary.

654
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,465
I'm flattered.

655
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:32,025
When I was young,

656
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:34,065
I wanted
to learn medicine wholeheartedly.

657
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:35,346
But then I felt,

658
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:36,946
as a man,

659
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:39,626
I should practice martial arts.

660
00:30:41,785 --> 00:30:42,666
I thought

661
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:44,906
learning medicine was very difficult.

662
00:30:45,265 --> 00:30:46,666
I didn't expect it to be

663
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,065
not challenging at all.

664
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:49,586
So I simply gave up medicine

665
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:51,025
and practiced martial arts.

666
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:52,305
Why am I saying this?

667
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:53,186
Let's eat.

668
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:54,146
It's getting cold.

669
00:30:54,225 --> 00:30:55,586
I just don't understand.

670
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:57,426
We study medicine to save people.

671
00:30:57,465 --> 00:30:59,866
- How could that not be manly?
- Excuse me!

672
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:01,186
- It's hot!
- At many critical times...

673
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:01,946
Watch out.

674
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:02,985
Keling, be careful.

675
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:03,785
Be careful.

676
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:04,705
Are you okay, Keling?

677
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:06,065
I should have carried it.

678
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:08,505
It's my honor

679
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:09,626
to serve Master Lu.

680
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,186
You're too kind.

681
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:12,800
- Sit down.
- At...

682
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:17,065
At many critical times,

683
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:17,906
we step forward.

684
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:19,146
Father, let me get you some soup.

685
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:22,426
Buping, someone is speaking.

686
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:24,025
Let him finish his words.

687
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:26,265
Master, continue.

688
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,745
We step forward,

689
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:31,106
having no time to eat or drink.

690
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:32,505
- You can drink mine.
- Thank you.

691
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:33,826
Come on. Just try it.

692
00:31:34,465 --> 00:31:35,186
Keling,

693
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,346
can you let me finish my words?

694
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:39,186
This way, I'm likely to lose breath.

695
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:40,946
If you want to speak, just speak.

696
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:42,426
So talkative.

697
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:44,025
Come on. Let's eat.

698
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,705
At many critical times,

699
00:31:49,705 --> 00:31:51,866
we, the doctors, step forward

700
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:54,065
and save one life after another!

701
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:56,426
As a man of prowess,
you only know how to kill people.

702
00:31:56,545 --> 00:31:58,545
And we save people!

703
00:32:17,545 --> 00:32:19,545
My father didn't agree

704
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:20,745
to let me stay in the end.

705
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:23,360
Peilan,

706
00:32:25,386 --> 00:32:26,906
I'm giving this comb to you.

707
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,025
After I leave,

708
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:31,505
every time you use it,
you can think of me.

709
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:33,705
There is just one thing

710
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:34,985
I have never told you about.

711
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:37,106
I like you.

712
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,586
Is this a bit too abrupt?

713
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:49,088
Peilan!

714
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,426
Peilan.

715
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:52,224
Mr. Li.

716
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:53,666
Did you buy some buns?

717
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:55,426
I love buns the most.

718
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:58,265
Do you want to have one?

719
00:32:58,545 --> 00:32:59,225
Sure.

720
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:04,146
It's delicious.

721
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:06,826
Then I'll go home first.

722
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:07,505
Peilan.

723
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:08,985
You offered me a bun.

724
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,386
I also have something for you.

725
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:11,705
What is this?

726
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,225
Last time I went to the street
and saw a shoe shop.

727
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,985
I found these shoes
suited you very well.

728
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:17,785
Take them.

729
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:20,465
No, thank you. I have shoes.

730
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:22,426
I know. They're just
a token of my appreciation.

731
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,106
Take them.

732
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:24,465
I can't accept this gift.

733
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:25,505
Are you belittling me?

734
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,305
No.

735
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:27,586
Then you should take them.

736
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:28,505
I can't.

737
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:29,866
Mr. Li, please take them back.

738
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:31,586
- I...
- Try them on quickly.

739
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:32,826
You... I don't want them.

740
00:33:32,906 --> 00:33:33,586
Wait, you...

741
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:35,186
I'm not going then.

742
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:38,816
I...

743
00:33:45,826 --> 00:33:46,688
Does it fit well?

744
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:49,426
I-I guess so.

745
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:52,106
That's good. Then you must wear them.

746
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,186
I'll go ahead then.
Thank you for your buns.

747
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:55,465
Mr. Li!

748
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:56,785
No, Mr. Li!

749
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:16,065
Why did he give you shoes?

750
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:17,585
I don't know.

751
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:18,906
I've never given you shoes.

752
00:34:19,585 --> 00:34:20,266
He refused to leave

753
00:34:20,346 --> 00:34:21,025
if I didn't try...

754
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:21,906
It's your feet.

755
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:23,266
What could he do if you said no?

756
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:25,545
At that time, I was...

757
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:27,226
Do you really not understand?

758
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:28,426
What?

759
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:30,505
My heart.

760
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,625
What's this?

761
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:42,426
I like you.

762
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,585
(Do you really not understand?)

763
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:10,906
I like you.

764
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:16,832
Peilan.

765
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,465
Mr. Lu.

766
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:21,346
I heard you didn't have dinner.

767
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:22,866
I specifically made you some soup.

768
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,266
I'll leave it here for you.

769
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:25,866
Thanks, Mr. Lu.

770
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:28,505
Come here and try it.

771
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:29,585
I made it especially for you.

772
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,145
I-I'll eat it later.

773
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:38,585
Are you still mad?

774
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:41,746
Not at all. Why would I be mad?

775
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:42,426
So...

776
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:50,426
Uh...

777
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,826
What do you think
about the thing I mentioned earlier?

778
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:57,545
What to think about?

779
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:01,145
The thing I told you earlier.

780
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:07,065
Mr. Lu, I don't know.

781
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:09,665
Do you like me?

782
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:10,906
Or do you not?

783
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:12,786
Just tell me.

784
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:13,985
I am leaving soon anyway.

785
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:18,545
Mr. Lu,

786
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:26,826
I just feel really confused.

787
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:30,065
Can you give me some more time to think?

788
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:47,296
I see.

789
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:51,906
I'm not good enough for you.

790
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,505
I wish you happiness.

791
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,346
Mr. Lu!

792
00:36:59,808 --> 00:37:00,928
Do you know?

793
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:03,906
Master Lu,
the martial arts alliance leader,

794
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:07,266
now lives in our house.

795
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:08,786
To be precise, he lives in my room.

796
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:11,065
Don't you think it's awesome?

797
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,025
Pretty awesome.

798
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:13,585
Boss,

799
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:16,625
why hasn't A-Si contacted us
for a long time?

800
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,946
I-I don't know.

801
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,946
Maybe he went on a long trip.

802
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:28,866
Then when will he come back?

803
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:30,025
How am I supposed to know that?

804
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:31,625
Will he never come back?

805
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:34,465
Then let him be.

806
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:43,465
You drink first. I will buy some more.

807
00:37:44,585 --> 00:37:45,386
What to drink?

808
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:46,185
Nothing.

809
00:37:46,386 --> 00:37:47,105
What're you drinking?

810
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:48,065
I don't have anything.

811
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:48,985
I am not drinking.

812
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,706
What's wrong with her?

813
00:37:57,706 --> 00:38:00,946
It was just a punch.

814
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:04,105
And what are you doing,
running away without a word?

815
00:38:12,794 --> 00:38:15,226
(Yuanyang Temple)

816
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:18,145
Don't make a sound.

817
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:20,906
Or it'll cost your life.

818
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:26,545
You are driving me crazy.

819
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,346
I've been nervous all day because of it.

820
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:29,906
Then there's one more thing.

821
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:30,545
Say it.

822
00:38:30,746 --> 00:38:31,465
I like you.

823
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:34,866
The first time I saw you,

824
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:36,025
I fell in love with you.

825
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:38,866
(I left the palace just to find you.)

826
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:42,545
(Although I kept getting hurt,)

827
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:44,306
(as long as I'm with you,)

828
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:45,346
(I'm very happy.)

829
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:50,245
(Yuanyang Temple)

830
00:38:58,665 --> 00:39:01,266
The falling flower intends
to follow the flowing water.

831
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:06,625
Draw a knife to stop the water,
and the water flows even more.

832
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:09,746
The flowing water has no intention
of loving the falling flower.

833
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:12,145
How can I leave home with ease?

834
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:14,145
Why?

835
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:15,105
Why?

836
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:16,105
Why?

837
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:17,065
Why?

838
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:18,706
Why?

839
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:19,968
Why?

840
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:27,505
Why can't the sun
and the moon ever meet?

841
00:39:27,808 --> 00:39:28,736
No.

842
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:32,665
When the weather is clear,
the sun and the moon shine together.

843
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,866
Why are our hearts so far apart?

844
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:40,065
Is it the arrangement of heaven
or the jesting of fate?

845
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:42,266
I hate this arrangement of heaven.

846
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:44,985
I hate this jesting of fate even more.

847
00:39:44,985 --> 00:39:47,585
Go on and be as happy as you want.

848
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:50,505
Leave me alone to grieve.

849
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:52,706
Master!

850
00:39:53,985 --> 00:39:54,985
Buping!

851
00:39:57,585 --> 00:39:58,346
Master!

852
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,585
Buping!

853
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,426
- Buping!
- Master!

854
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:10,025
Master!
