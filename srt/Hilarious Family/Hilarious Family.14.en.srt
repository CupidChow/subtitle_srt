(Steward Lu showed off his skills)

(Young Lord vented on his birthday)

34
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:59,126
You dared to run away, huh?

35
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:03,525
You've really grown up, huh?
Say something.

36
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:06,686
I was wrong.

37
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:09,085
No, you're not wrong.
Don't you have a reason?

38
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,245
Keep finding excuses.

39
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,645
If it wasn't for Steward Chen
finding you today,

40
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:14,726
were you planning to never come back?

41
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:19,726
I was really wrong.
I have nothing to explain.

42
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:22,326
Killing or slaughtering me
depends on you, Father.

43
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,805
But Li Tengyun is innocent.
Please let him go.

44
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,525
Your Highness, actually I was the one
who took Young Lord away.

45
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:40,085
He was unconscious at that time,
so he knew nothing.

46
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,446
Enough. This is not your place to speak.

47
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:45,166
Don't you still have parents
to take care of? Leave now.

48
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:48,486
Alright. I didn't say
I was going to do anything to you.

49
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:52,245
Young Lord, His Highness
has been looking for you for days,

50
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,965
fearing something might happen to you.

51
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:59,405
Forget it. You guys leave now.

52
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:23,886
He is a bit strange today.

53
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,326
Your Highness.

54
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:26,206
What's with your attitude?

55
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:32,645
Yes. Your Highness,
it's the ninth day of the month.

56
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,766
The ninth?

57
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,006
It's Young Lord's birthday.

58
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:39,405
Should we prepare something for him?

59
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,685
Prepare what?

60
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:46,245
With his behavior, he doesn't deserve
to celebrate his birthday.

61
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,326
As long as he learns a lesson,

62
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:52,206
it would mean
he hasn't grown up in vain.

63
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:04,352
Mr. Lu.

64
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:14,926
Second Miss, are the snacks ready?

65
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:16,606
Not yet, Mr. Lu.

66
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:20,365
The guests will arrive at 1 p.m.
You need to hurry.

67
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,086
Okay, they'll be ready shortly.

68
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:24,406
I see you've been busy all morning
and eaten nothing.

69
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:25,926
I just boiled an egg for you.

70
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,606
An egg?

71
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:31,365
Each egg is accounted for.

72
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:36,365
How can I balance the accounts
if you cook it without permission?

73
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,245
How should I explain it to Mrs. Chun?

74
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:41,325
It's okay. It's just one egg.
Mother won't find out.

75
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:43,205
This is not about
whether she will find out or not.

76
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:45,526
It's about my duty as a steward.

77
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,685
Mr. Xin said a pro steward should be
clear about public and private matters.

78
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,926
How can I disappoint him?

79
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:57,445
Mr. Lu, or you can
charge this egg to me as if I ate it?

80
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:58,486
Have it, Mr. Lu.

81
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:01,526
During work hours,
please call me Steward Lu.

82
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:05,325
I'm sorry, Steward Lu.

83
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:08,565
Second Miss, I'm not blaming you,

84
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,245
but today is a big day
for Mrs. Chun to entertain guests.

85
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:13,445
We must adopt a professional attitude

86
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:15,046
and make sufficient preparations.

87
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:17,086
Put the egg back now.

88
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:24,205
Mr... Steward Lu, are you alright?

89
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:28,245
We must not disappoint our madam.

90
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,486
When you do as well as I do,

91
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:39,245
I'll promote you to be
the deputy steward. Are you confident?

92
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:42,205
I am asking if you are confident.

93
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,166
Yes.

94
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:46,005
- Louder.
- Yes.

95
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:49,646
- Good. Put your hands up. Fighting.
- Fighting.

96
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,765
- Fighting. Fighting.
- Fighting. Fighting.

97
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:53,286
Fighting. Fighting. Fighting. Fighting.

98
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,726
Fighting. Fighting. Fighting. Fighting.

99
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:55,646
- Fighting.
- Good job.

100
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:57,888
Mr...

101
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:14,286
Today's dim sum is really different.
It melts in your mouth.

102
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:17,646
I asked Second Miss
to add dried tangerine peel.

103
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,565
Well, Steward Lu,

104
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,325
when you came back this time,

105
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:29,765
you really surprised me.

106
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:33,526
It's kind of you. It's Mrs. Chun
who gave me a second life.

107
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,325
I will repay you wholeheartedly
even with trials and tribulations ahead.

108
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:39,325
How is your banquet preparation going?

109
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:42,005
Everything is ready,
just waiting for the ladies to come.

110
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,245
Everything is ready?

111
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:46,765
You don't have to prepare too much.

112
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,646
Just let them have some tea and snacks.

113
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:51,086
In case they want to stay for dinner.

114
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,926
We can't afford to entertain them.

115
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,086
Madam, rest assured. It's all on me.

116
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:58,784
Jinrong.

117
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:01,312
Good morning, Great Miss.

118
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:04,325
Isn't this Steward Lu?

119
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:07,926
Indeed, as the saying goes,
clothes make the man.

120
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,926
Where are you going?

121
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,926
Those ladies are coming over, right?

122
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:15,606
I'm going out to buy a suit.
Dress myself up as well.

123
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:19,046
Don't you have
many clothes in your room?

124
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,325
They don't fit me anymore. I'm leaving.

125
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:22,205
Come back earlier.

126
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,526
Steward Lu, well done.

127
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,125
Madam, what are you worrying about?

128
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:39,926
Matchmaker Zhang

129
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,685
said she was going to
arrange marriages for my daughters.

130
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:46,526
If she really comes,
will she like my daughters?

131
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:49,526
You mean, you hope Misses

132
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:51,365
can win the matchmaker's favor.

133
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:52,486
Of course.

134
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:55,445
She is a famous matchmaker in Jianglin.

135
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:58,445
Look at them, either too old

136
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,606
or too ignorant.

137
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:02,445
I hope the matchmaker
won't despise them later on.

138
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,966
Madam, don't worry. I guarantee
what you worry about will not happen.

139
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:08,526
What's the point of your guarantee?

140
00:08:08,606 --> 00:08:10,365
They need to make a stand themselves.

141
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,846
Please leave their matters all to me.

142
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:19,885
(No matter if it's possible, I can't
lose my demeanor. I can do it.)

143
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:27,685
Young Lord, it's quite a coincidence.

144
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:29,486
Today is your birthday.

145
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:31,125
We happened to be caught
and brought back today.

146
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:35,565
What's the difference
whether we come back or not?

147
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,126
Anyway, nobody cares.

148
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,965
Young Lord, since you've come home,

149
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,406
I'll take my leave.

150
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:51,485
Wish you a happy birthday,
enjoying fortune, happiness, and health.

151
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:57,805
Even you want to leave? That's fine.
Anyway, I'm used to being alone.

152
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:01,246
Young Lord, don't say that.

153
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:03,965
Home is always best, right?

154
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:07,445
I just think

155
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,805
I've been with you for quite some time

156
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,485
and I couldn't help much.

157
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:13,325
I should go back to my stall.

158
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:19,366
I thought we had become friends.

159
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,725
Friends?

160
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:26,006
There are many people
who dine and drink with me.

161
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:32,246
But only you are willing to
share half a bun with me.

162
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,552
Young Lord.

163
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:40,246
Tengyun, stay.

164
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:46,286
(Zhang's Silk)

165
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,445
Shopping for long but buying nothing.

166
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,126
Because there's nothing I like.

167
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,126
Why don't you invite Young Lord
to accompany you?

168
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:57,246
Men aren't interested in shopping.

169
00:09:57,725 --> 00:10:02,006
I'm tired. Why don't we
go to your place for a rest?

170
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:06,565
From the Spring River Restaurant,
you can also see my house. Let's go.

171
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,485
How're you and Young Lord
going exactly, Jinrong?

172
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:11,286
Do you know if I tell others

173
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:13,006
I have a friend
who is dating Young Lord,

174
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:14,965
they would go crazy and envy me?

175
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:16,526
I think you should ask Young Lord out.

176
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,205
- Have some tea, admire the moon...
- Rain check.

177
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:20,646
- Go for a boat ride.
- Rain check. Find a chance, alright?

178
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,965
- You don't seem normal.
- No.

179
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:24,605
- Did you have a quarrel?
- No.

180
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:26,965
- Did he get mad at you?
- No.

181
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,286
You can't ask him out, Chun Jinrong.

182
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:30,246
How come? I...

183
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,886
We are such good besties.
Just tell me the truth.

184
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,605
What's the relationship
between you and Young Lord?

185
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:39,286
We... We...

186
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,526
Miss Jinrong, is that really you?

187
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,366
Li Tengyun, what are you doing here?

188
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,006
To reserve a table at the restaurant.

189
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,166
This is...?

190
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:52,725
Young Lord's strategist.

191
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,685
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

192
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:59,085
Miss Jinrong, today is
Young Lord's birthday.

193
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,886
Tonight, I plan to
hold a birthday banquet

194
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,445
for Young Lord
at Spring River Restaurant.

195
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:04,886
I wonder if we can be graced
with Miss Jinrong's presence.

196
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:08,006
He told me about it.

197
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:12,526
Rest assured. I'll definitely be there.

198
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,816
That's good to know.

199
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,286
Friends of yours are also welcome.

200
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,485
Sure. I am free. See you tonight.

201
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:23,485
- See you tonight. I'll take my leave.
- Alright.

202
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:25,056
Okay.

203
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,286
Chun Jinrong, I'm sorry.

204
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,246
I misunderstood your relationship
with Young Lord earlier.

205
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:31,406
I really didn't expect it.

206
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:32,325
Don't be angry.

207
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:33,376
I've never seen grand events.

208
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:34,560
- Will I lose control?
- Stay calm.

209
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,965
Stay calm. Stay... Stop.

210
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,406
I need to dress up nicely.

211
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,445
Jinrong, wait for me.

212
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:52,485
From the beginning, you came to me,
saying you wanted to be friends with me.

213
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:54,805
But then you left me
in the Mansion all night,

214
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,126
just to use me.

215
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:59,646
Later, when you heard
I was leaving, you became anxious.

216
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:02,526
Immediately, you took me
to the Young Lord's Mansion.

217
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,965
And then you wouldn't
even pay the steward for me.

218
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,766
Now, for the birthday banquet,
you can't hold it without me.

219
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,126
You're playing hard to get, aren't you?

220
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:16,766
Young Lord.

221
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:24,366
Just wait and see.

222
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,085
Mother.

223
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,126
What are you up to?

224
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,565
I was just about to tell you.

225
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:36,166
I have something to do now.
I won't attend your banquet.

226
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,406
How can you not attend?
The guests are about to arrive.

227
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:41,605
I really have something important.
Don't bother about me.

228
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:45,006
What could be
more important than this? You...

229
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:46,526
I'm really leaving.

230
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:47,565
- You...
- See you.

231
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,485
What about the three of them
if you leave?

232
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:53,766
Mrs. Chun, it's the time.
You should head to the living room.

233
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:57,805
Jinrong has left.

234
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:22,683
(Young Lord's Mansion)

235
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,406
(With my temperament,
I will definitely bewitch you.)

236
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:30,605
Ladies, I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

237
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:32,526
You are...?

238
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:35,366
My surname is Lu,
the steward of Chun's Mansion.

239
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:40,366
So, you are Steward Lu
who replaced Steward Xin.

240
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:43,006
Right. Please come in, ladies.

241
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:53,845
Why aren't there
any servants around in the mansion?

242
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,646
Yeah, not a single one.

243
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,485
Ladies, Mrs. Chun prefers tranquility.

244
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:02,085
Once the servants complete their duties,

245
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:03,445
they must avoid their masters.

246
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,166
Avoid?

247
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:09,605
Is that a rule in Jianglin?

248
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:10,886
Ordinary wealthy families

249
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:13,006
like the crowd to show their dignity,

250
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:14,886
but for someone of Mrs. Chun's status,

251
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:16,406
it's no longer necessary.

252
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,366
That's really enlightening.

253
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:26,286
Ladies, please come in.

254
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:33,646
Mrs. Chun, the guests have arrived.

255
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,046
Mrs. Chun.

256
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:40,246
Ladies, I apologize for
not welcoming you earlier.

257
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,725
You are too polite, Mrs. Chun.

258
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:46,006
We've been talking about it for so long
and today we're finally here.

259
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:47,805
Yes. Right.

260
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:50,565
Place your gifts down and leave soon.

261
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:52,325
Don't disturb Mrs. Chun's solitude.

262
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:54,912
This way, please.

263
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:58,445
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't have had the chance

264
00:14:58,485 --> 00:14:59,926
to visit the Young Lord's Mansion.

265
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:04,725
Right. The Young Lord's Mansion
is such grandeur.

266
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,845
Are you feeling better, Mrs. Chun?

267
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:14,965
Thanks to Steward Lu's care.
I have recovered.

268
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:18,246
We can know it by your complexion.

269
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:19,445
Yes.

270
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,526
Mrs. Chun, please take
the ladies to take a seat.

271
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,325
Right. Let's sit down and talk.

272
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:29,845
Mrs. Chun, where are your daughters?

273
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,406
They...

274
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:36,205
Last time, I said I would handle

275
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:37,926
the marriages of your daughters.

276
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,766
And I decided

277
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,166
once I've married off

278
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:42,605
your daughters,

279
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:43,965
I will retire.

280
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:45,845
It would be

281
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:49,205
my perfect end
on the journey of match-making.

282
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:50,965
Yes, yes.

283
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,445
Could you introduce me

284
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,286
to your daughters today?

285
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,366
Sure thing.

286
00:15:59,565 --> 00:16:00,725
But my eldest daughter

287
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:02,485
went out for her own business today.

288
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:04,965
Great Miss went to learn embroidery.

289
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,725
Yes, learning embroidery.

290
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:14,406
Do you really want to meet
my other daughters?

291
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,766
Yeah. Is it inconvenient?

292
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:25,565
It's convenient. I will ask
the three daughters to come out now.

293
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,565
Finally, today, I can know

294
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:34,406
what the daughters
from a wealthy family look like.

295
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:35,965
Yes, indeed.

296
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:40,725
You flatter us.

297
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:44,646
Ladies, the three misses have arrived.

298
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:47,205
Have all three of them arrived?

299
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,344
Yes.

300
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:57,805
I'm the second daughter
of the Chun family, Peilan.

301
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:00,886
Second Miss is generous,
elegant and dignified.

302
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,445
I'm the third daughter
of the Chun family, Banxia.

303
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:11,525
Third Miss is gentle,
compliant, and calm.

304
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:17,086
I'm the fourth daughter
of the Chun family, Chun Keling.

305
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:21,846
Fourth Miss is pretty,
sweet and sensible.

306
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:25,205
- Greetings to the three ladies.
- Greetings to the three ladies.

307
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:34,926
Go or not? If not, I'll jump
into the river with your father.

308
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:36,886
Give my father back to me.

309
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:38,606
Do you want it?

310
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,725
A light breeze is blowing.

311
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:47,005
The sky is full of stars,
and the waning moon carries frost.

312
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:52,086
I didn't know you are quite poetic.

313
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,886
Did you write it?

314
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:55,445
From the poetry collection.

315
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:56,800
Let me see.

316
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,656
Do you want it?

317
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:01,886
I wonder if "South Ming Techniques"...

318
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,525
Fourth Miss is really not ordinary.

319
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:07,765
This Fish Intestine Knife
is passed down...

320
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:09,696
No interest.

321
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:15,725
I wonder if this can make you moved.

322
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:28,005
- Wish you peace and health, ladies.
- Wish you peace and health, ladies.

323
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:30,624
Great.

324
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:35,045
- Good.
- That's great.

325
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:39,406
The three misses have their own styles.

326
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:44,366
Yes, they are different from
other wealthy families' daughters.

327
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,406
Now that I have seen them,
I got a sense.

328
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,646
The conditions are really good.

329
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:54,005
Are they that good?

330
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:57,285
That's really great.

331
00:18:57,765 --> 00:18:58,965
Thank you, Misses.

332
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:03,005
Pretty good.

333
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,245
That's amazing, Mrs. Chun.

334
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:10,366
With the appearances and personalities
of your three daughters,

335
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,886
if I don't get them
the best marriage proposals,

336
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,926
I'll be too embarrassed to see you.

337
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:16,606
You flatter me.

338
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:19,366
Mrs. Chun, you are indeed fortunate.

339
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,445
If it weren't for my son
already being married,

340
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:24,926
I really want to
become in-laws with Mrs. Chun.

341
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:27,485
You are too courteous, my friend.

342
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:31,606
Mrs. Chun, I'm wondering
if your three daughters

343
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,406
have any talents.

344
00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:34,926
Talents?

345
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:39,445
Nowadays, the masters of
wealthy families value this.

346
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,366
If your three daughters have talents,

347
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:44,166
that would certainly be appreciated.

348
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:47,285
I presume it would be possible
for a legitimate son

349
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:48,646
from a sixth-grade official's family.

350
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:53,685
Really? But...

351
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:57,445
Of course, they have.
Madam, I will arrange it.

352
00:20:00,245 --> 00:20:01,366
Do they have talents?

353
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:07,126
This fan is our shop's treasure.

354
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:09,086
It's the best to give as a gift.

355
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:11,326
Look, the frame is from Jiuyi Mountain.

356
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,765
The surface is splashed with gold,
with jade as the pendant.

357
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:15,005
Let me tell you in detail.

358
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:17,406
Alright, enough.
Just tell me how much it is.

359
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,245
Four taels.

360
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:22,245
So expensive! It's just a fan.

361
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,606
Well, you get what you pay for.

362
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:30,525
How much is this?

363
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:31,445
Two taels.

364
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:35,086
But Miss, are you gifting it
to a young master or a lady?

365
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:37,205
Can't I use it myself?

366
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:40,005
That's great.
A beautiful fan matches a beauty.

367
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:41,806
Wonderful, wonderful!

368
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:44,326
Shopkeeper, you sure talk sweet.

369
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:48,445
I'll take both of them.
Five taels in total. How about this?

370
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:51,166
I'm sorry, Miss.
This is not the place you think it is.

371
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,445
And I'm not the person you think I am.

372
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:55,366
You are quite interesting.

373
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:58,045
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:59,285
Then I will leave.

375
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,566
- Take care.
- I mean it.

376
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:01,685
Welcome to visit again.

377
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,126
I won't come back once I leave.

378
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,832
Please.

379
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:07,086
- I want that one.
- Alright.

380
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:11,166
Jinrong, how is my makeup?

381
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:12,326
Your makeup doesn't matter.

382
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:13,806
My makeup is decent, right?

383
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:14,886
Very elegant.

384
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:17,445
Did you bring the gift?

385
00:21:17,606 --> 00:21:18,725
Here it is. What about yours?

386
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,992
Mine...

387
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,886
When we go in, we will be
surrounded by the nobility.

388
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,685
Speak with propriety and discretion.

389
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:29,606
Okay. Jinrong, thanks to you.

390
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:35,406
Xiaoxiao, decorum and dignity.

391
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,485
- What? Dance?
- What? Dance?

392
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,926
Didn't you say
that a greeting would suffice?

393
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:48,045
The current situation is special.

394
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:49,485
We need your help.

395
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:51,685
Mr. Lu, but we don't know how to dance.

396
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:54,245
It's okay. I will teach you.

397
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:55,685
Stop dreaming. I won't do it.

398
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:56,886
I'll give you your money back.

399
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,485
Please return my father's tablet to me.

400
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:04,485
Misses, you are making a fuss here.

401
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:05,725
But what about Mrs. Chun?

402
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,846
Mrs. Chun is facing three ladies alone.

403
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:10,846
Have you ever thought about it?

404
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:15,285
At this moment,
she must be incredibly anxious.

405
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,886
She must be extremely uncomfortable.

406
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,685
Your father passed away early.

407
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,926
Since he left, Mrs. Chun
has been selling tofu

408
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:32,445
to raise the four of you.

409
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,566
Every night she tosses and turns.

410
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:38,086
In her every dream, she hopes to
marry you off to a nice family.

411
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:38,965
But you?

412
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:41,846
Have any of you

413
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:43,566
ever considered her in her shoes?

414
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:45,566
Don't you think you are sorry to

415
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:47,205
Mrs. Chun with the decades of hard work

416
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,525
and the tremendous effort
she had made to bring you up?

417
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,566
Enough. We understand. Stop it.

418
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,232
We are not going.

419
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:10,886
Young Lord, the event
was arranged in a rush today.

420
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:12,685
I didn't have time to invite more.

421
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,606
It does not matter.
The thoughtfulness is what counts.

422
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,045
Everyone is here.

423
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,646
Today is Young Lord's birthday.

424
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:28,285
We have invited
the most important friends of his.

425
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,926
Let's get started then.

426
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:33,886
T-There you go.

427
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:37,205
Young Lord, this is the gift I prepared.

428
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:38,765
I wish you and Jinrong happiness.

429
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,765
Young Lord, I also prepared a gift.

430
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:44,926
What is it?

431
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,126
Are you ready?

432
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,205
I am ready? For what?

433
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:10,725
Misses, let's dance.

434
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:28,957
(Indescribable)

435
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:48,886
Collections of the finest poems.
You can't find them anywhere else.

436
00:24:56,926 --> 00:25:01,005
"Shennong Secret Techniques."
Please say yes, Third Miss.

437
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,005
Mr. Lu, it seems I really
don't know how to dance.

438
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,566
It's okay. Just follow me.

439
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:21,792
Stop.

440
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:29,920
Thank you for watching.

441
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:37,024
Okay.

442
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:46,525
(Praise me.)

443
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:47,406
(What is this?)

444
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:50,525
(I tapped their potential
in a short time)

445
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:52,045
(for you to enjoy.)

446
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,406
(Are you sure it is enjoyable?)

447
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:58,126
(This is how the wealthy families do it.
Confidence is the most beautiful.)

448
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:01,525
- Madam.
- Banxia, Keling, it's okay.

449
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:03,846
Just bear with it for a while.

450
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:06,646
(Only if Jinrong was here.)

451
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:26,245
Young Lord, Miss Jinrong
is quite talented.

452
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:33,285
Well done. You know men the best.

453
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:36,100
(Happy Birthday)

454
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:47,008
♪Fluttered snow all over the sky♪

455
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:50,078
♪Disappeared into thin air♪

456
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:56,486
♪I feel like I've met you,
but I can't see you clearly♪

457
00:26:56,486 --> 00:27:00,516
♪Gently unfolding the paper fan♪

458
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:04,204
♪Setting down my thoughts for you♪

459

♪Drawing unmelting snow for you♪

460
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:34,926
It's been a while.

461
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:36,765
- I'm a bit unfamiliar with it.
- Not at all.

462
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:38,205
Young Lord, please don't laugh at me.

463
00:27:38,806 --> 00:27:42,406
Miss Jinrong, your gift is so special.

464
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:47,205
Miss Jinrong, I didn't
expect you to dance so well.

465
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,205
The fan is beautiful too.

466
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:53,965
To prepare for your birthday,

467
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:55,445
I bought it especially.

468
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,926
Young Lord, I wish you a happy birthday.

469
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,566
Alright. Come on. Thank you everyone.

470
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,086
Tonight, we won't go home
until we're drunk.

471
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,584
Cheers.

472
00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:15,285
I'm sorry for
causing embarrassment today.

473
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:18,485
Not at all. It was great.

474
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:21,566
I just don't know
where to start praising.

475
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:25,646
Yes. It's unique, right?

476
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:28,725
Yes, I thought so too.

477
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:30,806
I'm getting the hang of it.

478
00:28:32,806 --> 00:28:34,285
Thank you all.

479
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:38,005
It's getting late. Why don't we...

480
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:41,685
It's getting late.

481
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:43,445
Why don't we have dinner

482
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:45,126
while chatting, ladies?

483
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:46,525
Our dinner

484
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:48,445
will definitely make you feel

485
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:50,166
at home.

486
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:53,285
(Dinner? Where did you get the money?)

487
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,968
(Leave it to me.)

488
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:02,806
Don't worry. Mrs. Chun will thank you.

489
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,166
I pawned the century-old ginseng for it.

490
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,205
You must give it back to me.

491
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:10,965
I have to redeem my ginseng.

492
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:15,005
(You really have a solution.
Cancel the food order)

493
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:16,765
(and redeem your Master's ginseng.)

494
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:19,606
(Aren't you going to
keep them for dinner?)

495
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:23,725
Let's not bother then, shall we?

496
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:27,326
Yes, it's getting dark. Let's go back.

497
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,725
Yes, we've been here for too long.

498
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:34,566
I'm sorry about today.

499
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:35,886
What are you saying?

500
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:37,045
There's nothing to apologize for.

501
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:40,566
Yes. Now we can say
we've been to the Young Lord's Mansion.

502
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:42,485
Then I won't keep you any longer.

503
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,846
Ladies, please wait a moment.

504
00:29:45,406 --> 00:29:47,045
(Well, Madam, everything is arranged.)

505
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,285
(You should let me show off.)

506
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:49,920
Shut up.

507
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:54,848
(Spring River Restaurant)

508
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:09,886
Young Lord, what's on your mind?

509
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:16,606
I-I miss my mother.

510
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,685
Look how you are feeling wronged.

511
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:29,886
Jinrong, you don't know
how much I envy you.

512
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:32,965
Your mother is here.

513
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:35,086
She can scold you.

514
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:41,285
You must be drunk now.

515
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,416
I'm not.

516
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:49,965
When she scolds you,
there's a feeling of home.

517
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,326
I also want my mother to scold me.

518
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:58,886
But she didn't get a chance to scold me

519
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,926
before she left.

520
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:16,166
Alright. There, there.

521
00:31:17,886 --> 00:31:20,926
Jinrong, can you ask your mother

522
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,445
to scold me?

523
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:27,485
My mother is very good at scolding.

524
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:30,045
Don't cry then.

525
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:32,765
I won't. Just scold me.

526
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:37,725
Jinrong, you're really nice.

527
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:43,886
You're good at dancing.
And you are nice as well.

528
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:48,846
It's great to know you.

529
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:55,584
Jinrong.

530
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:02,646
(What is he going to do?)

531
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,086
(Does he want to kiss me?)

532
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:07,205
(How could he do such a thing?)

533
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:09,525
(What a rogue.)

534
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:24,445
Are you satisfied?

535
00:32:30,806 --> 00:32:31,806
Jinrong, you...

536
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:36,205
I-I need to go home.
Or, my mother may criticize me.

537
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:37,326
See you.

538
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:57,765
Feel free.

539
00:32:57,765 --> 00:32:59,205
- Okay.
- Come on. Enjoy it.

540
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:00,646
Cheers. Enjoy your drinks.

541
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:04,205
- Okay.
- Take your time.

542
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:07,685
Have some, too.

543
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:11,366
You, too. Enjoy it. Don't hesitate.

544
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:12,685
- Never mind.
- Come here.

545
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,445
What's going on?

546
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,005
Where did all these people come from?

547
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:20,765
These are people I found nearby.

548
00:33:21,326 --> 00:33:23,846
Having more people makes our house
seem lively and prestigious.

549
00:33:24,806 --> 00:33:29,245
Mrs. Chun, we are a prominent family.
Dignity is very essential.

550
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:36,326
Everyone, Mrs. Chun is generous

551
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:37,806
and has always educated us

552
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,326
that as members of a prosperous family,
we need to benefit the world.

553
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:43,926
Our neighborhood friends

554
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:45,685
love coming to our house for meals.

555
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:49,045
If any of the three ladies have friends

556
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:51,005
who would like to visit the Mansion,
they are welcome...

557
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:52,480
Enough!

558
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:57,685
I-I'm sorry. I lost my composure.

559
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:04,485
It's okay. Keep eating. Never mind.

560
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:08,286
Mother, give it up.
We clearly are not like this.

561
00:34:08,366 --> 00:34:09,286
Let's be honest.

562
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:10,366
What are we doing?

563
00:34:10,846 --> 00:34:11,726
- Banxia.
- Stop talking.

564
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,726
You taught us to stand upright
since we were young.

565
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:18,045
What are we doing now?

566
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,440
Mother.

567
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:27,926
Banxia is right. Ladies.

568
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:31,806
I'm really sorry.

569
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:34,406
There has been some misunderstanding.

570
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:35,366
Mrs. Chun.

571
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:37,206
Our family is actually
just an ordinary...

572
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:39,445
Mother, I'm back.

573
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,165
So many people here.

574
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:44,926
Chun Jinrong, where have you been?

575
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:45,846
I just...

576
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:47,206
Did you drink alcohol?

577
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,525
Just a little bit.

578
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:51,686
This is my eldest daughter.

579
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:53,366
Hello everyone.

580
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:54,806
Sorry,

581
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,366
I just went to celebrate
Young Lord's birthday.

582
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:58,286
Young Lord.

583
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:02,125
Mrs. Chun, it turns out
your eldest daughter

584
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:03,926
has a good relationship with Young Lord.

585
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:06,080
Yes.

586
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:08,926
How do you all know?

587
00:35:08,926 --> 00:35:09,846
They should have earlier.

588
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:13,846
Jinrong, stop pretending.
Mother and I have decided to be honest.

589
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:14,926
Mother, say something.

590
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:17,165
Our family is not what you see.

591
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:19,525
Jinrong's relationship with Young Lord
is not what you think.

592
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:25,045
Jinrong! Jinrong! Jinrong.

593
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,085
Why is he here?

594
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:31,085
Fan! Your fan.

595
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,246
Move!

596
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:35,165
What brings you here?

597
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:37,806
- Why are you here?
- It's Young Lord.

598
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:42,005
Why can't I come? This is my house.

599
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,726
You all are living in my house!

600
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:47,886
They were right.

601
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:49,246
Actually we are...

602
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:51,726
Yes, we are a family.

603
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,632
A family.

604
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:59,005
Steward Xin. Steward Xin.

605
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:00,686
There's no Steward Xin here.

606
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:02,206
There's only Steward Lu.

607
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:04,246
- Be careful.
- You are Steward Lu?

608
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:05,565
Yes.

609
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:06,926
Serve the wine.

610
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:07,846
Right away.

611
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:12,485
Mrs. Chun. No. Auntie.

612
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:17,525
Let's have a few drinks together.

613
00:36:18,206 --> 00:36:20,005
Do you know how to play
finger guessing game?

614
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:23,406
You three know
how to play it too, right?

615
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:25,246
Let's go. Let's go.

616
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:27,846
We have to leave now. It's getting late.

617
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:33,246
No! No one is allowed to leave.

618
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:34,605
No one is allowed to leave.

619
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,726
Today is Young Lord's birthday.

620
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:39,326
Let's all together

621
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:41,286
- live it up.
- Live it up.

622
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:46,766
(It doesn't feel right.)

623
00:36:49,886 --> 00:36:50,965
I really wish

624
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:52,326
I wasn't here tonight.

625
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:54,286
I've never felt so humiliated.

626
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:55,726
Me neither.

627
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:59,286
I really believed in
Lu Buping's nonsense.

628
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:00,485
So embarrassing.

629
00:37:02,326 --> 00:37:04,525
Let's drink. Drown our sorrows.

630
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:07,616
You two...

631
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:10,125
Drink, Peilan.

632
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:20,645
Come on.

633
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:21,485
Just get drunk.

634
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:27,504
