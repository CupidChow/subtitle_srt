Master,

36
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:59,777
I just made some honey cakes.

37
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,697
You can take some for the road.

38
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,578
I'm sorry, Master.

39
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,137
I didn't really want to drive you away.

40
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:11,258
I've been
under a lot of stress recently.

41
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:12,898
Don't worry.

42
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,097
I didn't expect my visit

43
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:17,018
to cause you so much stress.

44
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,537
Master,

45
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:21,537
you have medical skills.
You can go anywhere.

46
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:24,258
But Mr. Lu...

47
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:26,848
He...

48
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:29,097
He has also been
under a lot of stress recently.

49
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,817
Enough. I understand.

50
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:35,458
I'll go.

51
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,298
Let me see you off, Master.

52
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:40,937
- Slowly.
- It smells so good.

53
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,138
I should wait for Banxia to come back

54
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:45,018
so that I can talk to her.

55
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:46,298
Otherwise, she might blame you later.

56
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:47,258
Master, Master.

57
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:48,657
You'd better leave now.

58
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:49,377
You can come back

59
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,138
to say goodbye

60
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,657
when things have calmed down.

61
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:53,258
Right? Let's go.

62
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,777
You're driving Master away again?

63
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,377
Oh no. This is bad.

64
00:02:58,377 --> 00:02:59,898
Who are you, exactly?

65
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:01,578
Why do you always drive Master away?

66
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,178
How come you can stay at our house?

67
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,097
Banxia, Mr. Lu...

68
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,777
Peilan, now you're also
driving Master away, aren't you?

69
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:09,497
No, I... I'm not.

70
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:11,138
Miss Banxia, every debt has its debtor.

71
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:12,497
You should vent anger at Mrs. Chun.

72
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:14,138
It was Mother who asked Master to leave.

73
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:14,698
Sycophant!

74
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:15,898
You are so unreasonable!

75
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:16,817
Banxia didn't mean that.

76
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:17,937
It really was Mrs. Chun's idea.

77
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:19,777
Mother said if Master doesn't leave,
he has to leave.

78
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,018
- You...
- I really can't leave now.

79
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:21,858
I'll explain the reason

80
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:23,057
to you later.

81
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:24,657
Why don't you talk to
Mrs. Chun about it?

82
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,657
Excuse us.

83
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:30,217
Banxia,

84
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:31,777
don't make it difficult.

85
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,537
I should go.

86
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:34,258
You can't leave.

87
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:37,018
Miss Peilan,

88
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:41,578
how have you been all these years?

89
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:44,898
I-I just made it through.

90
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:51,097
It must have been hard for you.

91
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:56,097
But what can I do?

92
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,458
At this point,

93
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,178
only one person can help us.

94
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,937
Jinrong! Jinrong!

95
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:13,298
Jinrong!

96
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,258
What's wrong?

97
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:15,938
- Think of a way.
- Don't...

98
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:17,498
Don't shake me.

99
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:18,698
Just speak.

100
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,578
Jinrong, can you talk to Mother

101
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:23,177
and ask her not to drive Master away?

102
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:24,378
Jinrong!

103
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:27,898
Or you can ask Mother
not to let others drive Master away.

104
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:30,138
Peilan, it's not that
I don't want to help you.

105
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,058
Let the adults

106
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,177
solve their own problems.

107
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:35,537
But Master has been so good to us.

108
00:04:35,537 --> 00:04:38,258
Now it's Mother
who doesn't let him live here.

109
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:39,217
I was scolded by Mother

110
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:40,657
because of this.

111
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:42,097
Don't bother me anymore.

112
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,818
No, Jinrong.

113
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:46,578
We must help Master.

114
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:47,777
What do you want me to do?

115
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:48,938
If Master stays,

116
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:49,938
where will he live?

117
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,657
Aren't there
two vacant rooms by the street?

118
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:53,857
He can live there.

119
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:54,777
Vacant rooms?

120
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:57,177
Mother relies on the rent
for the living.

121
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:05,417
Master has taught us to be good people
since we were young.

122
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,777
He always bought us new clothes,

123
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:09,097
and gave us pocket money.

124
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:13,058
Jinrong, please help him.

125
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:14,818
Pocket money?

126
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,698
Collecting rent?

127
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:21,177
Mother, if Master leaves,

128
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:22,777
there won't be another "master".

129
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:24,657
No way.

130
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,258
I can't possibly rent the rooms to him.

131
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:28,618
He is really cunning.

132
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:30,618
How did he win you two over?

133
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:31,898
Mother,

134
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:33,938
how could we possibly
be bought off by him?

135
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:35,698
We're on your side.

136
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,058
That's right, Mother.

137
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,818
You were thinking of
turning those two rooms

138
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:43,138
into a tofu shop.

139
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:45,378
Just rent them to Master
at a higher price.

140
00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:46,458
What, Peilan?

141
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,977
Now even you are
speaking for that old fox?

142
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:50,938
Have you guys forgotten

143
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:51,698
how your father died?

144
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,058
- Mother, Mother!
- Your father...

145
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:55,138
Mother, we haven't forgotten.

146
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:56,977
What I mean is that letting him go now

147
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,058
is too easy on him.

148
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:03,657
Mother, I've checked. Those two rooms

149
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:04,618
by the street

150
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:06,737
can be rented
for three taels a month at most.

151
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:08,337
Let's rent them to him for ten taels

152
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:09,618
and squeeze him dry.

153
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,297
That's a good idea.

154
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,258
Impossible.

155
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:13,177
Ten taels isn't enough.

156
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,138
At least 20 taels.

157
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:18,138
I knew you would know best.

158
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:23,458
No, no, I'm getting confused

159
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,578
by you two.

160
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,657
Even 20 taels isn't enough.

161
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,177
Mother,

162
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:29,898
we have to pay back the money
we owe Master sooner or later.

163
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:31,217
With 20 taels a month,

164
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,857
we'll be clear in five months.

165
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,297
But he's the one
who got your father killed.

166
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:36,977
Mother, I think

167
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:39,378
it was Father who sent him here.

168
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:43,058
Father sent him to atone for his sins.

169
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,217
Mother, are you worried

170
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:50,938
that Master can't afford the rent?

171
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,938
If so, you can let him open a pharmacy

172
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:53,898
to resume his old business.

173
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:55,537
He's sure to earn the rent.

174
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,498
This is a good idea.

175
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:00,097
If Master
gets the pharmacy up and running,

176
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,378
maybe we can even share the profits.

177
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,018
That's some real money.

178
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:05,657
I don't care about
his little bit of money.

179
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:08,177
Mother, I don't have money for food.

180
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:14,977
No, you two have been tricked.

181
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,737
You've all fallen
for that old fox's schemes.

182
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,737
I'm driving him away now.

183
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:18,498
Mother! Mother!

184
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:19,498
Mother,

185
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:21,857
please consider us.

186
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:24,458
When we used to run a tofu shop,

187
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,737
the matchmakers would introduce me

188
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:28,097
to butchers or blacksmiths.

189
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:29,058
If we could

190
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,657
get this pharmacy up and running,

191
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,417
we could be considered

192
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,977
a medical family, right?

193
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:35,097
Then the guy they introduce

194
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:37,177
would at least be a match
in terms of social standing.

195
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:38,898
He should at least be...

196
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,657
From a medical family.

197
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:41,378
Yes.

198
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:46,857
Mother, why did we come to Jianglin?

199
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:48,297
Mother?

200
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:51,177
Why, Mother?

201
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,498
Mother, no matter how hard it is,
you can't make your kids suffer.

202
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:56,138
I don't mind.

203
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:57,537
I'm only 30.

204
00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:58,977
But what about Peilan?

205
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:00,737
What about Banxia and Keling?

206
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:02,537
The kind of people
they can marry in the future

207
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:05,337
all depends on your decision, Mother.

208
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:07,018
It all depends on your decision, Mother.

209
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:09,018
Just treat him as our servant.

210
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:10,378
He's here to pay off a debt.

211
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,458
Let him work for you.

212
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,258
Work for you.

213
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:30,777
Sit down.

214
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:33,258
My waist isn't feeling very well.

215
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:34,098
I'll stand for a while.

216
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,138
I have prepared gifts for everyone.

217
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:40,258
This is a headscarf
given to me by a Persian patient.

218
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:41,297
It's very beautiful.

219
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:42,537
Thank you, Master.

220
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:44,937
He seems to be
the son of a tribal chief.

221
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,417
The taste of home.

222
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,018
The cured meat
personally made by Qing City's

223
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:51,537
most famous chef, Mi Xilin.

224
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:54,537
The prescription
from Longmen Grottoes' Medicine Cave.

225
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,777
It's a gift from my patients
in the western regions. Very precious.

226
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:04,858
This is a jasmine ointment
that I prepared myself.

227
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:06,338
When you were young,

228
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,328
- you liked it...
- Master!

229
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:08,657
I'll keep this for my mother.

230
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:09,657
Thank you.

231
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:11,937
Let's get to the main point.

232
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:12,498
Okay.

233
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:13,777
The thing is,

234
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,618
Master is facing difficulties now

235
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:17,218
and urgently needs a place to stay.

236
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:18,378
No one has any objections

237
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,498
to the rent of 20 taels a month.

238
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:21,177
- So we can skip that...
- Wait.

239
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:21,898
How much is it?

240
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:23,898
Tw... taels.

241
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,417
If it's two taels a month,

242
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:27,777
- I...
- 20 taels. It's 20 taels.

243
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:30,937
Then I think we need to talk about it.

244
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:31,618
Chun Banxia,

245
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:32,777
is it up to you,

246
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:34,218
or is it up to Master?

247
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:36,057
- Let's...
- I have the final say. I'll stay.

248
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,378
Master, you're very understanding.

249
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:43,057
Mainly, my mother is also
considering you, Master.

250
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,858
If you stay here for free,

251
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:47,258
you will certainly feel bad.

252
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:48,218
Yes, that's right.

253
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:51,297
Thank you, Ruyu,
for being so thoughtful.

254
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:53,177
By the way, Master,

255
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:55,338
the idea of opening a pharmacy

256
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:56,858
was proposed by us.

257
00:09:56,858 --> 00:10:00,057
My mother thinks it's necessary for us
to have a share of the profits.

258
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:01,218
What do you think?

259
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:03,898
Everyone,

260
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:05,937
let's be honest.

261
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,218
20 taels a month

262
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,657
is already akin to robbery.

263
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:10,258
If you still
want a share of the profits,

264
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:11,777
I suggest
we go to the government office.

265
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:12,898
Mother, Mother.

266
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:14,618
Banxia, let Master speak for himself.

267
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,697
Let me make my own decision.

268
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:17,338
Sit.

269
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:20,457
Master, how much do you think

270
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:21,618
this share should be?

271
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:24,138
Three to seven.

272
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:25,498
Mother, what do you think?

273
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,297
I haven't decided
whether to keep him or not.

274
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,338
Two to eight is also possible.

275
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,777
Don't get too carried away.

276
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:31,297
Get him out.

277
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,657
One to nine! It's definitely fine.

278
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:33,338
Mother!

279
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:34,898
Mother, Mother!

280
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:36,177
Master, who takes one?

281
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,457
Clearly, it will be me.

282
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:38,218
I'll take one.

283
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:39,697
He'll take one.

284
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:45,777
Banxia, Banxia! Where are you going?

285
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:46,848
- Banxia?
- To file a lawsuit.

286
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:47,417
Don't!

287
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:48,697
Think about the big picture, okay?

288
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:50,138
I've already signed the lease
for Mother.

289
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:51,537
- Take a look...
- You can't sign it.

290
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:52,338
If you dare to sign...

291
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:53,417
Happy working with you.

292
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,018
Thank you, Ruyu.

293
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:56,378
Thank you.

294
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,098
Master, do you know what you're doing?

295
00:10:58,138 --> 00:10:59,577
Peilan, don't wake me up tomorrow.

296
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,417
I overused my brain.

297
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:01,218
Rest early, Jinrong.

298
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:02,417
Master, I'll prepare the bed.

299
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:03,258
Thank you.

300
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:06,338
Where is Keling?

301
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:07,457
I have a gift for her too.

302
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:08,338
A great writing brush

303
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,858
that was used by Li Bai. Very precious.

304
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,378
Keling? Keling?

305
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:24,057
Mr. Lu,

306
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,498
I brought you another quilt.

307
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:28,417
So you won't fight over the quilt
when you sleep.

308
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:29,777
Thank you.

309
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:35,378
Mr. Lu, don't worry too much.

310
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,777
It's all solved.

311
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:38,498
And Master is a good person.

312
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,738
When we were young,
he always secretly took care of us,

313
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:41,817
taught us to read,

314
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:43,057
and gave us pocket money.

315
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:47,258
Then why did your mother
drive Master away?

316
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,817
I think, with your mother's temper,

317
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:52,498
even if I stay now,

318
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:55,057
the days to come
might not be easy for me.

319
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:58,338
It's not easy for my mother either.

320
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,378
For all these years,
my mother has always felt guilty.

321
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:03,937
She has always felt

322
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:05,937
the rumors about her and Master

323
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:07,138
affected our family.

324
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:10,417
So she made so much effort to move here.

325
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:14,697
This is also why
my mother doesn't want Master to stay.

326
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,498
I understand.

327
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:19,177
A widow's door invites gossip.

328
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:27,498
Mr. Lu, rest early.

329
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:28,498
Alright.

330
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:30,858
Mr. Lu,

331
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,417
you should talk less in the future.

332
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:43,194
(Spring River Restaurant)

333
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,290
(Young Lord, 30, unlearned, scheming)

334
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:57,338
Young Lord, you are here.

335
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:58,777
We're most welcomed.

336
00:12:58,858 --> 00:12:59,738
Girls from Music Bureau

337
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:01,138
recently rehearsed "Flowing Light Song".

338
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,218
It will definitely satisfy you.

339
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:04,537
Do they know who I am?

340
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,338
Rest assured.

341
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,777
I absolutely won't let them
know your identity.

342
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:10,177
Stupid! I'm the heir of Lord Ling.

343
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:11,098
If they don't know me,

344
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:12,098
they won't do their best.

345
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:13,378
You are right.

346
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:15,258
Then I'll arrange it right away.

347
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:16,338
Hurry up.

348
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:17,738
I can't wait too long.

349
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:21,657
So boring.

350
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:28,537
Miss, if you have nothing to do,

351
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,098
let's play a game.

352
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:31,898
If

353
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,537
you can take back this fan

354
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:34,738
within half an hour,

355
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:36,378
I'll give you ten taels of silver.

356
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:37,378
Ten taels?

357
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,378
Today's weather...

358
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,417
In broad daylight,

359
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:43,537
how dare you assault a girl?

360
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:44,777
Who do you think you are?

361
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,817
Do you know who I am?

362
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:48,618
What was that?

363
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,218
Wait. How can you be like this?

364
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:54,218
I am Lord...

365
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:56,018
What are you...

366
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:56,738
Alright, alright.

367
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:57,697
Stop hitting me.

368
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:58,297
I'll be quiet.

369
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,138
Apologize to her.

370
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:05,817
I'm sorry.

371
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,258
It's okay.

372
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:11,417
She left. Your apology didn't work.

373
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:13,978
I apologized, and then she left.

374
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:19,018
Help!

375
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:20,937
Someone!

376
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:22,817
Young Lord was hit by someone!

377
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:24,858
After her!

378
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:27,338
Stop! Stop!

379
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:30,010
(Yuanyang Temple)

380
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:50,457
Don't make sound.

381
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,138
Or it'll cost your life.

382
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:03,218
- Is she in the front yard?
- No.

383
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,338
Let's search from here.

384
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,297
Yes.

385
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:12,512
Go.

386
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:20,177
Wait for me here.

387
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,650
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

388
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:30,537
That hateful girl!

389
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:32,177
How dare she hit me!

390
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:34,218
And she called herself a heroine?

391
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:35,177
I'll find you.

392
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:35,858
Once I find you,

393
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:37,577
I will dismember you.

394
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:39,498
We found it.

395
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,417
Where is she?

396
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,697
We finally found you, Young Lord.

397
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:44,577
What do you do?

398
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,457
Are you an idiot?

399
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:46,338
Are you an idiot?

400
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,098
- Idiot!
- Young Lord.

401
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:48,577
- Are you an idiot?
- Young Lord.

402
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:50,498
The lord is looking for you.

403
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:54,138
My father is looking for me?

404
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:57,057
Your Highness,

405
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,848
you have developed
a profound understanding

406
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:00,457
(Virtuous and Generous)
of calligraphy recently.

407
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,177
(Lord Ling)
The word "endure" carries...

408
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:04,697
Perseverance.

409
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:06,777
No, I just want to know

410
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,657
if there is a dot on the top or not.

411
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:10,464
(Endure)

412
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:12,817
Yes.

413
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:13,858
There is?

414
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:19,817
Father.

415
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:20,858
Young Lord.

416
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:22,738
Have you behaved lately?

417
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:23,378
Yes.

418
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:25,138
I have behaved as per your instructions.

419
00:16:25,138 --> 00:16:25,978
I didn't act recklessly.

420
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:27,498
Is it that

421
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:29,018
some servant has been gossiping again?

422
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,057
If you said so, I believe you.

423
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:31,937
Why are you flustered?

424
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:35,018
Can't you just be prudent?

425
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:37,577
Yes, I will be especially prudent.

426
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:41,858
These past few years,

427
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:43,457
our relations with the royal palace

428
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,898
have been drifting further apart.

429
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:47,537
I heard His Majesty
is hosting a family banquet.

430
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:49,258
He didn't invite us.

431
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:50,858
But this time,

432
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:54,018
the Empress Dowager and the Fourth Prince
came to Yuanyang Temple to pray.

433
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:56,218
This is a good opportunity for us.

434
00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:59,018
The Fourth Prince

435
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,457
is about your age.

436
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,618
And he's the most likely choice
for the Crown Prince.

437
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:05,858
If you can associate with him,

438
00:17:05,977 --> 00:17:08,298
we will have backing

439
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,217
in the future.

440
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:11,858
You mean

441
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,818
I need to hang out
with the Fourth Prince?

442
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:26,937
Hang out? Hang out?

443
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:28,977
Use some decent language!

444
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:34,578
Get yourself prepared.

445
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,898
In the afternoon, we will pay respects

446
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:37,697
to the Empress Dowager
and the Fourth Prince.

447
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:38,778
Be smart.

448
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:41,217
This is an opportunity
that others would beg for. Understand?

449
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:45,138
Yes, I will not let you down.

450
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:46,457
I will surely take down

451
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,217
the Fourth Prince.

452
00:17:48,618 --> 00:17:49,657
- Take down?
- No, no.

453
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:50,657
I'll handle him.

454
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,217
Go prepare.

455
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,017
Handle?

456
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,618
- Go prepare.
- I will deal with him.

457
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:57,017
Your Highness, endure.

458
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,818
Endure, endure.

459
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:00,858
He's ignorant and incompetent.

460
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,697
I don't know who he takes after.

461
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:18,137
Peilan,

462
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:19,577
what is this?

463
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:21,658
This is a hoe, Mr. Lu.

464
00:18:23,057 --> 00:18:23,817
A hoe?

465
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:26,297
So there are such weapons in the world.

466
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:29,377
Mr. Lu, it's used for hoeing the ground

467
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,498
to loosen the soil.

468
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:33,978
I've heard of it.

469
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:47,178
Lu Buping.

470
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,258
What are you doing?

471
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:55,377
What are you trying to do?

472
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:57,018
I'm going to hit the rat in the kitchen.

473
00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:58,777
Mother.

474
00:18:58,777 --> 00:18:59,458
What is he doing?

475
00:18:59,458 --> 00:18:59,898
He...

476
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,337
He's repairing the hoe.

477
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:02,178
Repairing the hoe?

478
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:03,898
He is so reckless.

479
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:05,137
Has he ever been a servant?

480
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:06,178
Yes, he has.

481
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:07,458
Mother,

482
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:08,577
what are you doing?

483
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:10,057
Let me see what you're holding.

484
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:12,978
This is...

485
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:14,898
Your portrait.

486
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:17,537
Who is this?

487
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:19,137
Isn't this you?

488
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:21,537
It doesn't look like me.

489
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,537
How can it not?

490
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,658
Isn't this exactly like you?

491
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,978
A newly bought portrait?

492
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:28,137
Mm, it's nice.

493
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:30,377
It's late.

494
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,218
You should go to work.

495
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:32,817
I came back to get something.

496
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:34,698
I was thinking

497
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:37,018
about setting up a free tea stand

498
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,498
at the door of the pharmacy

499
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:40,218
so that passing people
could have some hot tea.

500
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,866
(Yuanyang Temple)

501
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,426
(Morning Bell and Evening Drum)

502
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,616
(Fourth Prince, 20 years old)

503
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,258
What is it?

504
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:01,218
Are you trying to remember my look?

505
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:03,577
No.

506
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:11,097
You are quite cute.

507
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,418
I'm leaving.

508
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:15,218
Miss.

509
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:18,377
There are many guards over there.
You should go this way.

510
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:20,498
I won't believe you.

511
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:35,617
You mean that way, right?

512
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:42,297
What's your name?

513
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:06,097
Your Highness?

514
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:07,658
Your Highness?

515
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:11,777
Greetings, Your Highness.

516
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:13,498
You are...?

517
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:15,857
I'm Lord Ling's son.

518
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:22,337
I wonder if you have ever

519
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:23,938
had a tour around Yuanyang Temple.

520
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:27,137
Not yet.

521
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,297
Well, the palace,

522
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:31,178
of course, is majes...

523
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:33,018
Yes, the most majestic in the world.

524
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:35,297
But the scenery around Yuanyang Temple

525
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:36,617
is also refre...

526
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:39,738
refreshing.

527
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:41,258
If you want to take a tour,

528
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,658
I will accompany you.

529
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:44,738
I'm not interested.

530
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,458
The cus... customs outside the palace

531
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:52,498
have their own unique characteristics.

532
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,218
Just like here.

533
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:56,258
The nature is pretty,
and the people are even prettier.

534
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:58,658
Even prettier...

535
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:02,738
I want to find someone. Can you help?

536
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:03,577
Find someone?

537
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:04,817
Of course.

538
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:06,777
Who do you want to find?

539
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:09,137
A girl.

540
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,418
Understood.

541
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:20,178
What kind of girl

542
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,537
are you looking for?

543
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,817
Her eyes are very clear and bright,

544
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:30,057
and her skin is very white.

545
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:33,817
No problem.

546
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:35,537
Can you really find her?

547
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,057
How dare I joke with you?

548
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:38,498
You are the Fourth Prince after all.

549
00:22:39,178 --> 00:22:40,978
Alright, thank you then.

550
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:44,978
I am Lord Ling's son.

551
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:47,978
Grandmother.

552
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:53,537
Greetings, Your Majesty.

553
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:57,258
I wish you good health and a long life.

554
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,658
So this is your son?

555
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:03,258
Rise.

556
00:23:03,658 --> 00:23:04,658
Thank you, Your Majesty.

557
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,738
You and the Fourth Prince
are of the same age.

558
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:12,458
You should talk more in the future

559
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:15,018
so that he doesn't feel stifled
while staying in this temple.

560
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:16,577
Your Majesty,

561
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,458
I just talked with His Highness.

562
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,418
It was indeed a pleasure to meet him.

563
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:23,577
What did you talk about?

564
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:24,817
I saw that His Highness

565
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,617
was bored in Yuanyang Temple.

566
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:28,698
So I offered to take him out
for a tour to open his eyes.

567
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,018
I'm a bit tired today.

568
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,857
We'll chat another day, Lord Ling.

569
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,258
Yes, Your Majesty.

570
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,057
Grandmother.

571
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:52,224
(Believe in Buddhism)

572
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:53,418
I want to go.

573
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:03,297
Young Lord.

574
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:04,978
Lord Ling.

575
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:07,097
I will leave now.

576
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:07,738
Alright.

577
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:28,377
Father.

578
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:30,218
You!

579
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:32,057
Young Lord! Young Lord!

580
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:34,018
Open his eyes? Open his eyes?

581
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,018
How dare you
let the Fourth Prince open his eyes?

582
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,297
Who do you think you are?

583
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:39,738
Wasn't it you who told me
to show off more?

584
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:40,738
- Show off?
- Your Highness!

585
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:42,097
- Calm down.
- I won't show off then.

586
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:43,258
Forget it.

587
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:46,097
The Fourth Prince is the apple
of the Empress Dowager's eye.

588
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:48,337
He has never left her since childhood.

589
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:49,658
How dare you

590
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,938
instigate him to go out and play?

591
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,337
What if something goes wrong?

592
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:54,738
Can you take responsibility?

593
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:57,297
Father, it was the Fourth Prince
who suggested it to me.

594
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,097
Nonsense!

595
00:24:58,178 --> 00:24:59,178
Even if he wanted to go out,

596
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:00,658
he wouldn't ask
a waste like you for help.

597
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:07,337
What? You want to argue?

598
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:08,777
No, I don't.

599
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:10,418
Then hold it back.

600
00:25:10,498 --> 00:25:12,057
You look like a pillar.

601
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:14,137
I don't know who you take after.

602
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:17,418
I...

603
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:23,777
Master,

604
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:26,577
do you really want
to place this ginseng here?

605
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:27,857
Isn't it strange?

606
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:29,658
We're newly opened.

607
00:25:29,817 --> 00:25:30,337
The prestige

608
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:30,898
and facade

609
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:31,857
all depend on it.

610
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,738
It's a hundred-year ginseng.

611
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:34,617
Its spirit

612
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,057
will last forever.

613
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,658
What are you writing?

614
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:46,337
Big discount for the opening

615
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:47,498
of Jiren Pharmacy.

616
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:48,297
Treat two patients

617
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,057
for the price of one.

618
00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:49,738
Full refund

619
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:50,458
if not cured.

620
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:52,738
Why are you doing this too?

621
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,178
We have been open for days.

622
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,817
Not a single customer has come.

623
00:25:58,178 --> 00:25:59,658
When I was soliciting customers,

624
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,658
I saw other shops

625
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:01,698
promoting like this.

626
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:02,377
The effect

627
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:03,458
was quite good.

628
00:26:03,577 --> 00:26:04,658
Soliciting customers?

629
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,057
The words you use
are really embarrassing.

630
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:08,938
It's the journey that makes the monk.

631
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:11,018
This is our family's
only source of income.

632
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:12,577
We all rely on this pharmacy.

633
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:13,658
Master,

634
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,218
you are a doctor.

635
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:18,057
You are meant to save lives.

636
00:26:18,297 --> 00:26:20,057
People will come
if they are sick, right?

637
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:22,057
What's "Treat two patients
for the price of one"?

638
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,057
Did you forget
what you taught me before?

639
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:25,698
We only want to save lives

640
00:26:25,698 --> 00:26:27,218
without caring if the medicine is sold.

641
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:30,817
You remember it.

642
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:36,458
Treating patients

643
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:37,817
and making a living do not contradict

644
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,698
each other,

645
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,137
right?

646
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:45,978
You've lost your dream.

647
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:02,778
(Jiren Pharmacy)

648
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:03,777
Young Lord,

649
00:27:03,777 --> 00:27:05,658
I'm sorry
for letting you down this time.

650
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:08,337
(Spring River Restaurant)
I will make up to you next time.

651
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:08,817
Get lost.

652
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:10,018
Young Lord, please calm down.

653
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:11,498
Get lost now.

654
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:14,978
I... Mantis Fist!
Tiger-Crane Double Form!

655
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:16,617
- I will scare you to death.
- Young Lord.

656
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,658
What kind of people are these?

657
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:22,817
And it's so hot today.

658
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:30,817
What are you doing?

659
00:27:34,698 --> 00:27:35,857
You shouted at me?

660
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,728
(Fortune Telling)

661
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:39,337
You misunderstood.

662
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:40,978
I was not shouting at you.

663
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:41,777
I was...

664
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:43,658
I was shouting at him.

665
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:45,057
Him?

666
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:48,498
But your shouting just now scared me.

667
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:49,898
I'm sorry, Childe.

668
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:51,178
I won't shout anymore.

669
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:52,137
Sorry.

670
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:54,898
What are all these for?

671
00:27:56,498 --> 00:27:57,617
To make a living.

672
00:27:58,258 --> 00:27:58,817
Fine.

673
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,272
I want you to give me a fortune telling.

674
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,337
Okay.

675
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:07,857
Just by looking at your appearance,

676
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:09,938
I know you are from a noble family.

677
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:11,137
You are rich and noble.

678
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:13,898
Go on.

679
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,498
Your appearance tells me

680
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:19,698
you have the help of a noble person.

681
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,218
You are in purple today.

682
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:25,898
You have a purple glow on your face
and a purple aura around you.

683
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:27,817
You must be

684
00:28:27,817 --> 00:28:29,978
doing well recently.

685
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:31,698
You have very good luck.

686
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:36,498
Good luck. Good luck.

687
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:37,218
Yes, yes.

688
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,418
You are indeed brilliant.

689
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,337
Thank you.

690
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:41,738
Did you foresee

691
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:43,057
that you would be beaten today?

692
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,537
Good luck, huh?

693
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:48,577
(Kindness Brings Good Luck)

694
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:49,577
Good luck?

695
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:53,377
Young Lord, where have you been?

696
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:55,018
I just went for a stroll.
What's the problem?

697
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:56,698
His Highness has been waiting for you.

698
00:28:56,698 --> 00:28:58,297
You really made a scene this time.

699
00:28:58,377 --> 00:28:59,218
He's waiting for me?

700
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:00,777
Quickly! Quickly!

701
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:01,577
Hurry!

702
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:04,898
By His Majesty's decree,

703
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:08,297
"Lord Ling, your family
has been dedicated for generations.

704
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:09,698
You are loyal,

705
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:11,817
and you're the pillars of our dynasty.

706
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,577
You're deeply trusted by me.

707
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,577
The Fourth Prince is young and ignorant.

708
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:18,418
I specially instruct the Fourth Prince
to go out of the palace for experience,

709
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,377
observe the various aspects
of people's lives,

710
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:22,898
and understand the right path
to do good to the society.

711
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:26,018
During his time outside the palace,
he will stay in your mansion.

712
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:29,258
I hope that your family
will take good care of him

713
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:31,857
to alleviate my worries."

714
00:29:32,577 --> 00:29:34,097
That's all.

715
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:36,777
Yes, Your Majesty.

716
00:29:43,777 --> 00:29:44,297
Allow me.

717
00:29:45,498 --> 00:29:46,297
Your Highness,

718
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:47,537
congratulations.

719
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,057
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

720
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:53,258
But I wonder
what His Majesty's intention is.

721
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:58,057
I wonder what the Young Lord said
to the Fourth Prince.

722
00:29:58,057 --> 00:30:00,258
The Fourth Prince
didn't demand much since he was little.

723
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:01,577
He suddenly petitioned His Majesty,

724
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:03,258
saying he wanted to go out
for some experience.

725
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:05,577
But His Majesty agreed immediately.

726
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:10,617
But Her Majesty, the Empress Dowager...

727
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:13,258
Don't worry. His Majesty has decided.

728
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,458
Her Majesty won't object to that.

729
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:16,658
Your Highness,

730
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:19,137
this is a rare opportunity.

731
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:20,498
I understand.

732
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:22,018
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

733
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:27,107
There's something I must remind you of.

734
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:30,107
You must ensure the safety
of the Fourth Prince.

735
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:31,907
If anything goes wrong,

736
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:34,587
Her Majesty will definitely blame you.

737
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,867
Thank you for the reminder, Eunuch Wang.

738
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:38,387
I have matters to attend to.

739
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:39,706
I'm leaving now.

740
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:41,186
Please wait.

741
00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:42,666
Eunuch Wang.

742
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:44,827
This is a small token of appreciation.

743
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,107
- This is unnecessary.
- Just take it.

744
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:47,147
- It's okay.
- Your Highness.

745
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:48,627
- You don't have to.
- Just take it.

746
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,946
- You don't have to.
- Just take it.

747
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:56,867
Father.

748
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:03,706
Be gentle.

749
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:16,307
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

750
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,587
(Lord Ling's Mansion)
Spare me, sir.

751
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:20,426
Young Lord, he's here.

752
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:23,986
What are you doing?

753
00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:25,347
Can't you do things properly?

754
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:26,387
I asked you to invite him here.

755
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:27,547
Who told you to catch him?

756
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:28,067
Leave us.

757
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,666
Master, please rise.

758
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,147
Come.

759
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:31,587
I…

760
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,587
Here.

761
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:36,147
I presume you must have guessed

762
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:37,627
who I am.

763
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:40,946
Young Lord.

764
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:43,907
You are indeed wise.

765
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:47,506
What are you doing? Leave us.

766
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:48,387
Yes.

767
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:53,627
Today, I was indeed too impulsive.

768
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:56,506
But your calculation is really accurate.

769
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:58,587
Accurate?

770
00:31:58,946 --> 00:31:59,787
Did you forget you said

771
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,307
I would have a noble person's help?

772
00:32:02,347 --> 00:32:03,506
Yes, a noble person.

773
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,347
Master, to be honest,

774
00:32:05,387 --> 00:32:07,266
there is indeed a noble person
coming to our mansion.

775
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:09,266
I wonder if you can
give me some pointers

776
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:12,307
on how to win over this noble person.

777
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:15,307
About the matter...

778
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:19,067
As they say, man proposes, God disposes.

779
00:32:19,986 --> 00:32:22,426
This needs a long-term plan.

780
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:24,067
Professional!

781
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:25,627
You are indeed a master.

782
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:28,426
By the way,
I still don't know your name.

783
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:30,266
My name is Li Tengyun.

784
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:31,107
Good.

785
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:32,466
Master Li,

786
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:34,986
are you interested in
hanging out with me?

787
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:36,387
Hanging out?

788
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:38,666
I mean, assisting me.

789
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:41,506
You can foresee things,

790
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:42,867
and I have a high position and power.

791
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:45,307
We are simply a heaven-made match.

792
00:32:45,946 --> 00:32:47,067
A heaven-made match?

793
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:48,026
Yes.

794
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,426
Starting today,

795
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:52,627
you will help me
deal with the Fourth Prince.

796
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:56,387
The Fourth... Prince?

797
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:57,547
Master,

798
00:32:58,107 --> 00:32:59,907
as long as you help me rise to the top,

799
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,426
I can make you benefit from it too.

800
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,666
(On the day of Gengyou,
the weather is clear.)

801
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:41,216
(I didn't expect that I, Li Tengyun,
would also have my day.)

802
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:52,147
Did you soak your feet?

803
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:53,226
Yes.

804
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:54,746
Soaking your feet before bed
is comfortable.

805
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,186
It's quite comfortable.

806
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:08,442
I heard

807
00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:11,681
you are a renowned doctor in Qing City.

808
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:12,881
I'm flattered.

809
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:14,482
Then why do you

810
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:16,082
prefer to pay 20 taels each month

811
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,562
to stay here?

812
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:21,347
Young man,

813
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:22,986
I heard you are a servant here,

814
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:24,347
and you don't take any money.

815
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:25,986
I think you are

816
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,387
young, promising, and robust.

817
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:30,506
Why are you doing this?

818
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:32,146
Because I...

819
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,066
Let's sleep.

820
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,506
Just sleep, Master.

821
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:39,227
Right, it's getting late.
