(Please stay tuned for the new chapter)

34
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,470
Peilan, you are cooking.

35
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:00,190
Let me help you.

36
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:01,069
No need, Mr. Lu.

37
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,429
You don't know how to cook.

38
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,069
It's not a big deal.
I've learned by watching you.

39
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,550
I'll get the vegetables ready.

40
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,949
I'm very good at this.

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,349
We will eat tender parts, right?

42
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:13,910
Exactly.

43
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,870
Alright.

44
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:23,590
Done.

45
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,270
So soon?

46
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:26,549
Take a look.

47
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:27,710
I told you I could do it.

48
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,310
Is this how you prepare the vegetables?

49
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,509
Yes. You said we only eat
the tender parts, right?

50
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:35,789
But these parts are all quite tender.
They are all edible.

51
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,389
Why didn't you say that earlier?

52
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,150
It's okay. I can prepare them again.

53
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,829
Okay.

54
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,949
I will help you cut vegetables.

55
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,270
No need, Mr. Lu.

56
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,150
This radish needs to be cut, right?

57
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,430
Then you can help me
cut the radish into cubes.

58
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:49,109
Alright.

59
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:02,549
Done.

60
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,829
You've finished, Mr. Lu?

61
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,109
Look. There are
both large and small cubes.

62
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,430
(Character Ding)
[*Literal meaning]

63
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,870
You're really good at this, Mr. Lu.

64
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,710
Don't mention it.

65
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,069
You can sit here and rest for a while.

66
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,949
Wait, I can help you
cut the rest of them.

67
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,109
No. There's no need, Mr. Lu.

68
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:17,990
You waste too much
when you cut the vegetables.

69
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,109
I can cut them even smaller.

70
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,430
You can rest here for a while.

71
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,509
I can do it myself.

72
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,069
Peilan, I know how to do this.
Let me help.

73
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,389
Mr. Lu, you don't know how.

74
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,590
You will waste it later.

75
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,710
I know.

76
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,669
The dough won't become less
as you knead it.

77
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,710
I really don't need you.

78
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:36,870
The water is boiling.

79
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:37,870
I'll cook the chicken.

80
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,990
Mr. Lu!

81
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,669
Don't touch the chicken.

82
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,710
Peilan, why is it so sticky?

83
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,190
Did you add too much water?

84
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,270
You can add a little more flour.
Just a little.

85
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,069
Well, it's not sticking together now.

86
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:58,430
Did you add too much flour, Mr. Lu?

87
00:03:58,549 --> 00:03:59,949
Add some more water, then.

88
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,270
How is it now, Mr. Lu?

89
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,509
Peilan, look.

90
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,150
It's still so sticky.

91
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,829
Should I add some more flour?

92
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,430
I'll add a bit more.

93
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:20,229
Come on.

94
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,390
It's time to eat.

95
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:24,669
Eat as much as you can.

96
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,549
From now on, let's eat more buns.

97
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,510
Buns fill you up and are storable.

98
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,109
Right.

99
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,270
It's pretty good.

100
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:35,590
After all, I will eat delicacies
in the future.

101
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,070
By then, I might not even

102
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,749
be able to eat the buns at home.

103
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,989
A bun feast?

104
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,189
Keling, is your head all right?

105
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,309
It's fine.

106
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,229
How is A-Si's foot?

107
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:49,789
I don't know.

108
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,749
You should care more about him.

109
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,109
Buping, your letter.

110
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:57,070
Thank you. My letter.

111
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,510
What are these?

112
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,429
They are buns, master.
They can fill you up.

113
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:05,669
Peilan, good knife skills.

114
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,830
Well, I did the cutting.

115
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,229
Character Ding?

116
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:13,989
A bunch of flowers
are outside the house.

117
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,070
A bunch of buns are inside the house.

118
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,070
Good.

119
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,549
(Your father had a stroke. Hurry home.)

120
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:19,869
It should be a pile of buns, right?

121
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,070
Pile is better.

122
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,950
Mr. Lu, what's wrong?

123
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,429
My father is sick.

124
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,109
Wrap it tight.
It must be moisture-proof.

125
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,869
As a practitioner of martial arts,

126
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,030
Master Lu has strong vitality.

127
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:35,749
He must avoid meat, greasy food,

128
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,189
and alcohol. Make sure to convey that.

129
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,229
Understood, Master.

130
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:40,390
Ginseng.

131
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,869
Thank you.

132
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,630
Take this century-old ginseng.

133
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,549
In case Master Lu feels unwell,

134
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,429
quickly brew it for him.

135
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,189
It will not happen.

136
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,470
He'll be fine.

137
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,109
Master, this is too valuable.
I can't accept it.

138
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,229
It couldn't be more valuable
than Master Lu's life, right?

139
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:54,830
Just take it.

140
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,150
That's right. Take it with you.

141
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,510
- Pack it up.
- Mr. Lu,

142
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,070
come and take a look.

143
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,349
I've sorted and packed the medicine

144
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,749
Master prepared for you.

145
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,510
The yellow ones are astragalus.

146
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:07,510
This is Suhe Musk.

147
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:08,950
- The blue ones are Tianma.
- Peilan.

148
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:11,309
The letter says the doctor
had prescribed the medicine.

149
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:12,989
You don't need to prepare so much.

150
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:15,429
Mr. Lu, the medicine in Lu's Manor

151
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,030
can't compare
with the medicine in Jianglin.

152
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,989
I also prepared these clothes
for you to change.

153
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,510
This is food, and here's water.

154
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,429
- If you are...
- Peilan.

155
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:22,910
When will the carriage arrive?

156
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,309
It should have arrived.

157
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:25,869
Can we have a word outside?

158
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,070
I'll explain once more when I get back.

159
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,390
Is the carriage at pharmacy's door

160
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:30,510
or the house's main entrance?

161
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,749
Come.

162
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:37,950
Peilan.

163
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,070
Are you worried about Lu Buping?

164
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,549
Yes, mother.

165
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,950
Mr. Lu is a bit careless.

166
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:47,869
I understand.

167
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,070
I think you should accompany him.

168
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,950
Mother, what will you do without me?

169
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,309
We are a big family.

170
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:58,910
Can we not survive without you?

171
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,429
You don't have to worry about us.

172
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,510
On the contrary,
there are all men in Lu's Manor.

173
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:05,749
Who can take good care of Master Lu?

174
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,549
If something happens to Master Lu,

175
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,749
how will Lu Buping handle it?

176
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,989
Here, take this.
It's a small token from our family.

177
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,869
Take good care of Master Lu
when you're in Lu's Manor.

178
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:19,989
Mother.

179
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,309
Alright, stop crying.

180
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:24,789
Take good care of yourself.

181
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:27,429
You all should also
take care of yourselves.

182
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:28,510
I know.

183
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,910
Banxia, can you come over
and take a look for me?

184
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,510
Is this entadae stem or entada sten?

185
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,109
I can't see it clearly.

186
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,109
The second one.

187
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,429
Who is this prescription for?

188
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,429
It's for Mrs. Wang next door.
Her cough hasn't gotten better.

189
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,109
Then I recommend adding

190
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:00,349
a bit of aster and tenuifolia.

191
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,309
That's not right. It won't be effective.

192
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,429
Well,

193
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:05,789
Mrs. Wang's children are not with her.

194
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,309
She works all day long.

195
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,189
And she coughs all night.

196
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,189
She can't rest well, can she?

197
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,390
And how can she recover
from her illness like that?

198
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:15,429
These two herbs
can help her sleep and calm her mind.

199
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,749
That's never been done before.

200
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:19,989
This prescription has been
passed down from our ancestor.

201
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,189
We'd better not change it.

202
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,669
Doctor.

203
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,309
Doctor.

204
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,070
Are you here buying medicine
or seeing a doctor?

205
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,150
I can't move my neck.

206
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,510
Please take a look for me.

207
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,949
I can't lift this arm.

208
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,829
Please, this way.

209
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,350
Okay.

210
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,789
What's the matter?

211
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,870
My hand is a bit numb.

212
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,709
Give it to me.

213
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,990
Let's give it a try.

214
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,469
Does it hurt?

215
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,270
It hurts.

216
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,510
How about this?

217
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,390
Ouch. It hurts.

218
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,350
Master, I don't think it is
just a simple spine problem.

219
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,110
His meridians
should have been oppressed.

220
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:20,709
How about we try

221
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:23,189
acupuncture at his Quchi, Shousanli,
and Shouwuli acupoints?

222
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,510
No need. Listen to me.

223
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,990
Acupuncture at his Baihui acupoint.

224
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:57,910
Put your arm on the table.

225
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,630
Don't move.

226
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:03,870
There are two more acupoints.

227
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,069
Thank you. It's really comfortable.

228
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,990
Sir, do you work
with your head down a lot?

229
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,350
Indeed, I work as a bookkeeper.

230
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,110
Thank you.

231
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,829
I didn't expect a young lady like you

232
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,630
to be so proficient in medical skills.

233
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:22,390
Thank you.

234
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,669
It feels much better.

235
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:25,829
Take the medicated wine home.

236
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:27,829
Apply it to the back of your neck.

237
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,750
Rub it until it gets warm.

238
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,510
You should personally hand it
to the doctor.

239
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,469
Okay.

240
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:39,669
Take care.

241
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:43,630
Doctor, thank you.

242
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,750
Thank you.

243
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:14,030
Mother, let me help you.

244
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,829
No. Step aside.
Don't cause trouble here.

245
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,750
This needs washing?

246
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,230
Can you do the washing?

247
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,150
I can.

248
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,150
Should I use this?

249
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,350
It's already soaked.

250
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,669
I'll help you wash.

251
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,750
Is someone knocking at the door?

252
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,630
Seems like it.

253
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:34,270
Okay.

254
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,750
I'll accompany you.

255
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,350
Coming.

256
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,230
Eunuch Wang.

257
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:46,990
Mrs. Chun.

258
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:51,789
A-Si.

259
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,150
Mrs. Chun.

260
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,669
How's your injury?

261
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,990
I'm okay.

262
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,150
Keling, are you okay?

263
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:03,709
Come in.

264
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,669
There are so many people following you.

265
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,110
I'm sorry, Keling.

266
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:36,110
My grandmother insisted
I could only leave the palace

267
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,150
after my injury is healed.

268
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,630
Because of me,

269
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:42,390
your family suffered.

270
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,990
It has passed. Let's not talk about it.

271
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,789
- Then, we...
- A-Si.

272
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:53,990
Listen to me first.

273
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,230
I used to always talk about

274
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,350
being the Heroine in Jianglin
and upholding justice.

275
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,669
But after what happened lately,

276
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,189
I found that I don't even have
the ability to protect my family.

277
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,510
I was really too naive before,

278
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,069
dreaming of being a heroine.

279
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,789
What happened is not your fault.

280
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:21,270
It is my fault.

281
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,110
I was too eager to introduce you
to the Empress Dowager

282
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:26,630
without considering the consequences.

283
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,270
It is not your fault either.

284
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,469
You wanted me to meet her

285
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:33,910
for our sake.

286
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,390
And I agreed to meet her

287
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:37,910
for our sake.

288
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,110
Eunuch Wang taught me all those rules

289
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,789
for our sake too.

290
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,990
Even the Empress Dowager
was for our sake.

291
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,589
But why has all this goodwill

292
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,390
turned out like this?

293
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:51,510
I think I'm still too young

294
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,230
to understand it.

295
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,189
Don't worry.

296
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,270
This kind of mishap won't happen again.

297
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,230
The Empress Dowager said

298
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,949
she wouldn't interfere with us.

299
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,990
I think

300
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,750
this matter of us being together

301
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,990
is not just about the two of us.

302
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,709
We thought of it as a simple matter.

303
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,110
I think

304
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,750
we need to give each other some time.

305
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,030
We should separate for now.

306
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:41,270
But now

307
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,789
everyone agrees that we can be together.

308
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,589
That's because
everyone is doing it for our sake.

309
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,510
So we should grow up even more quickly
to protect them.

310
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:56,910
We can grow together.

311
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:00,150
Do we really have to separate?

312
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,829
Growing together
isn't as simple as it seems.

313
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:10,870
We can't decide a lot of things now.

314
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,469
Have you thought it all through?

315
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:50,990
A-Si,

316
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,350
are you leaving now?

317
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,789
Aren't you staying for dinner?

318
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:57,429
Mrs. Chun, take care.

319
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,870
Keling...

320
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,150
Take care.

321
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,270
You take care too.

322
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:08,110
Let's go.

323
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,630
Depart.

324
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,270
What's the matter with you and A-Si?

325
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,630
We will meet again.

326
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,309
Meet again?

327
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,069
It's not because of us, right?

328
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,990
How could it be?

329
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,469
You couldn't possibly affect me.

330
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:30,789
Have you thought it through?

331
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,669
The people of the martial world

332
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,510
like us don't have
so much consideration.

333
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,350
Have you finished washing clothes?

334
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,589
Let's continue.

335
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:46,789
There's no need to work so hard.

336
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,510
It's exhausting.

337
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,230
It's okay.

338
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,469
Alright. Enough.

339
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,469
Feeling better?

340
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,230
Much better. Thank you.

341
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:57,110
Dr. Guo.

342
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,669
Dr. Guo, Miss Banxia.

343
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,150
Mr. Wu.

344
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,309
Long time no see.

345
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,229
Long time no see.

346
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,910
What brings you here?

347
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:11,350
I've come to recruit talents
for my Baohe Clinic.

348
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,390
I told you.

349
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:15,630
I am needed at home and won't go.

350
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,989
Dr. Guo, I know you won't come.

351
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,269
So this time,

352
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,150
I come to invite Miss Banxia.

353
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,429
Me?

354
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,229
Yes.

355
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:31,110
Miss Banxia,

356
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:33,229
did you recently treat one patient

357
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:36,429
who had cervical spine pain
caused by the oppression in meridians?

358
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:43,110
It's really a case of the student
surpassing the master in your pharmacy.

359
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,870
Dr. Guo, you have a good apprentice.

360
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:47,790
Of course.

361
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,429
I need to confirm.

362
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,630
Is it the Baohe Clinic
that wants me to be a doctor?

363
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,350
Yes.

364
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,910
And this is the first time

365
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,310
we have employed a female doctor.

366
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:02,709
We'll pay you 15 taels per month,
with a dividend at the end of the year.

367
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:03,870
What do you think?

368
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,350
Miss Banxia,

369
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,429
you don't have to answer me now.

370
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,870
Please think about it carefully.

371
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,590
We look forward to your response.

372
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,110
I'll take my leave first.

373
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,949
Take care, Mr. Wu.

374
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:25,590
Goodbye.

375
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,229
The offer is so good.

376
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,150
It won't be easy.

377
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:48,189
The buns are coming.

378
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,469
These are the last of them, right?

379
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,590
My stomach burns
when I see the buns now.

380
00:18:58,189 --> 00:18:58,949
One dish is missing.

381
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,189
I forgot the fish.

382
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,070
Wait a moment.

383
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:08,949
Mother.

384
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,630
Today, the manager from Baohe Clinic
came to ask me to be a doctor.

385
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:15,229
They are offering me 15 taels per month.

386
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,910
That's great.

387
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,189
I'm impressed, Banxia.

388
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,910
You're catching up with Master.

389
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,630
This is exactly
what I wanted to say to you.

390
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:23,790
I feel that Master is getting older

391
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,949
and a bit overwhelmed.

392
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,949
What will he do if I leave?

393
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,509
So he is the most important,

394
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:33,830
not me, right?

395
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:36,350
You're the most important.

396
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,110
But Master is quite important
to all of us, right?

397
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:42,070
What importance does he have to me?

398
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,390
Hot, hot.

399
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,550
You should have used a heat-proof pad.

400
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,669
Are your hands burned?

401
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:51,390
Let me see.

402
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:51,910
No.

403
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:53,949
What do you mean by that? They are red.

404
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,830
Go soak them in the water tank. Hurry.

405
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,390
It's fine. Really.

406
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,590
It's as if you have never worked before.

407
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:04,150
Be careful.

408
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,310
Alright. Let's eat.

409
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,870
Give me half.

410
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,390
Help yourself.

411
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,630
I'll do it myself. It's okay.

412
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,110
Still not resting, Master?

413
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:42,469
Aren't you resting either?

414
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,830
I planned to do more work today,

415
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,070
so you could do less tomorrow.

416
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,229
That way, we can be more relaxed.

417
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,669
If there are those who come
seeking help for illnesses,

418
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:58,709
you should never question
their wealth or poverty.

419
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:00,469
Whether they are friends or foes,

420
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,429
domestic or foreign, smart or foolish,

421
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:03,590
treat all of them equally

422
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,310
and consider everyone as kin.

423
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,630
You shouldn't worry too much
about the good and the bad.

424
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,029
No matter day or night, cold or heat,
hunger, thirst, or fatigue,

425
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:17,669
concentrate on providing help

426
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,189
- and never show off skills.
- And never show off skills.

427
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,150
The instruction from the ancestor.

428
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,429
Isn't this what you taught me
since I was little?

429
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,390
When you were four and a half,

430
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:32,790
you sat like this on this little bench

431
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,310
while waving your head back and forth
as you recited.

432
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,870
It was just like yesterday.

433
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,989
And now, you've grown up,

434
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,269
and I have aged.

435
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:42,669
Why are you saying this suddenly?

436
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,150
Banxia, I want
to discuss something with you.

437
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,669
Recently,

438
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,070
I've been feeling some numbness
in my wrist.

439
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:58,150
For all these years,
I have risen early and rested late,

440
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,749
dispensing medicine,
diagnosing, and treating patients.

441
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:02,229
Honestly, it's very tiring.

442
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:04,630
Now that you guys have grown up

443
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,469
and your mother
doesn't have much burden,

444
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:08,550
I'm planning

445
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:10,070
to travel around

446
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:13,429
and see the world with your mother

447
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,910
and gather some herbs in the meantime.

448
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:19,110
So I'm thinking
of closing the pharmacy for a while.

449
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,189
You want me to join the Baohe Clinic?

450
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,189
No, not at all.

451
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:27,910
Have I urged you all these years
about what to do

452
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:29,390
and what not to do?

453
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,110
People are born lost.

454
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,550
Finding something that brings joy to you

455
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,630
is quite rare indeed.

456
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,830
If you truly feel like it,

457
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,870
even if there are storms
and obstacles in the future,

458
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:42,029
you will be able to get through them.

459
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,310
As long as you are willing,

460
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,910
how you choose is up to you.

461
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,590
If you say so,

462
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:53,669
I have nothing to worry about.

463
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:54,870
I do want to go there.

464
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:02,029
You should think about it.
Don't be so hasty.

465
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,310
This is a serious matter.

466
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,709
Think about it seriously.

467
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,669
Ponder it for a while
before you answer me.

468
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:08,150
Don't just blurt it out.

469
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,669
I'll go back.
Go to sleep after you finish.

470
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:15,029
Master.

471
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:21,429
Thank you.

472
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:39,790
I wanted to be by your side.

473
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,310
I wanted to stay and take care of you.

474
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,029
But then I thought again

475
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,910
that if...

476
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,110
Then I thought again

477
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,189
that if we are always

478
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,910
by each other's sides,

479
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,790
none of us can move forward, right?

480
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:07,469
But we are medical practitioners.

481
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,790
We should make the promotion
of medical skills our duty.

482
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:12,429
This is what you and my father
taught me since I was little, right?

483
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:18,870
Besides,

484
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,029
I really

485
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,509
want to go out
and meet those excellent doctors.

486
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,910
Because I want to be
that kind of outstanding person too.

487
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:31,429
I hope to protect you,

488
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,910
my mother,

489
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,150
and all the others I care about.

490
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:39,550
I want to be your pride,

491
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,590
the pride of my father and mother,

492
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,669
and the pride of everyone.

493
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:07,949
Why is he crying like this?

494
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,830
I told him I wanted to be his pride.

495
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,150
I thought there was a ghost
when I heard him crying.

496
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:15,429
Why did you tell him that?

497
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,630
Senior Chun,

498
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:25,390
Banxia hasn't failed you.

499
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,429
Senior Chun,

500
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:31,669
Banxia can be called a great doctor now.

501
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:34,229
Guo Zhensheng,

502
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:36,390
stop crying. You're aged.

503
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:37,910
It's bad for your health
to cry like this.

504
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:52,364
(Jiren Pharmacy)

505
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,550
Stop sweeping. It's good enough.

506
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:04,590
It has to be clean.

507
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,029
It's dusty. Be careful.

508
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,590
I'll sweep lightly.

509
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:18,870
Look quickly.

510
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:22,310
The charred tree has sprouted.

511
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,790
Indeed.

512
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:31,390
It has a second life.

513
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:34,709
I'll water it a bit more.

514
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:39,310
This is indeed a bit touching to see.

515
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:43,469
Look, more new leaves on top.

516
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,669
The vegetables are prepared.

517
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,029
Will Banxia come back for dinner?

518
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,150
She said
she's been really busy recently.

519
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,790
It's good to be busy. That means
they appreciate her medical skills.

520
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,630
Did you know?

521
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:06,590
Someone gave Banxia a plaque.

522
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,709
Really?

523
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:10,150
That annoys me.

524
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:11,790
I've been practicing medicine here
for so long,

525
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,550
and I couldn't even get half a plaque.

526
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:14,910
Banxia is really something.

527
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:17,669
You are no match for Banxia, right?

528
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,150
Who says I'm not?

529
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:21,310
After all, Banxia is my apprentice.

530
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,709
I deserve some credit, right?

531
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,830
Keep consoling yourself.

532
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,830
What happened?

533
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,150
Seems like I've strained my back.

534
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,310
Don't rush. Take it slow.

535
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,390
How do you feel
about lying prone like this?

536
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:48,550
Why don't we
do the acupuncture on the bed?

537
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,870
No need for that.
I can do the acupuncture here.

538
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:03,269
Have we started?

539
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,029
I need to disinfect the needles
with alcohol.

540
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:23,070
Let's start.

541
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:27,070
Why aren't you doing it?

542
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:28,429
What are you waiting for?

543
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,350
How about we wait for Banxia

544
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,949
to come back to do the acupuncture?

545
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,709
My hand has been a bit shaky recently.

546
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,790
Could you do it quickly?
I'm in so much pain.

547
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:39,790
Okay.

548
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,070
This is where it hurts, right?

549
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:58,150
I...

550
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:00,229
Could you hurry up?

551
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:08,429
How does it feel?

552
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,870
Seems like it's much better.

553
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,350
Then you... I...

554
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,910
Rest for a while. I will go make dinner.

555
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:20,590
What are you cooking for?

556
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,949
Just eat whatever we have.

557
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,189
Let me help you rest on the bed.

558
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:28,429
That's not necessary.

559
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:31,870
Right. It's best for you to rest here.

560
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,390
After this, you must make sure

561
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,070
your movements are small and slow.

562
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:39,350
The smaller and slower, the better.

563
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:41,029
If you need anything, just call me.

564
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:48,469
Slowly.

565
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:51,110
Alright. Sit tight.

566
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:51,790
Okay.

567
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,630
I'll let go of my hand.

568
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:58,669
These are the last two buns, right?

569
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:03,350
I'll go and buy some more food.

570
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,469
Don't go.

571
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:06,709
The children are not at home.

572
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:08,830
We can just eat like this.

573
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,350
Why is that?

574
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,669
Making a couple of dishes
is pretty simple.

575
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:14,029
It will be Start of Autumn soon.

576
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,310
We can ask them to come back
for some euryale ferox soup then.

577
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:18,310
We can have a good meal together then.

578
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:20,189
- So don't go.
- Okay.

579
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:21,189
Let's eat these. Sit down.

580
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:23,550
I will have Banxia ask Mr. Wu

581
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,630
for a day off on that day.

582
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,830
We can also take a stroll
around Nanhu Lake.

583
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:29,189
Don't disturb Banxia's work.

584
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,590
How would that disturb anything?

585
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,110
The children have all grown up,

586
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:33,830
and they have their own things to do.

587
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,949
We agreed on a family reunion.

588
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,509
How is that a family reunion
without her?

589
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,550
Why are you so annoying

590
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,189
at such an old age?

591
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,229
I kind of miss Peilan right now.

592
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,949
What do you mean by that?

593
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:47,469
When don't you miss her?

594
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:48,630
Mother.

595
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,189
I'm back.

596
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,790
We were just talking about you.

597
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,630
Mother.

598
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,790
Why are you back?

599
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,189
I miss home.

600
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:03,429
Master.

601
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,709
Come. It's just in time for dinner.

602
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,669
Hurry. Come on.

603
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:07,429
Come on.

604
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,630
Why are you two eating these?

605
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,550
You made the buns.

606
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,630
They are not finished yet.

607
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,630
These are the last buns.

608
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,509
We can't waste them.

609
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,229
Right.

610
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,469
It's not what you think.

611
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:23,669
We were originally planning
to make something delicious.

612
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,310
But I accidentally sprained my back.

613
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,229
You sprained your back?

614
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,070
Don't make a fuss.

615
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,229
Master has already
given me acupuncture. I'm fine.

616
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,350
Don't worry. She's all right.

617
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,550
It's okay. Take a seat.

618
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,189
No. You two wait a moment.

619
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,390
I'm going to cook a few dishes.

620
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,550
Don't. The luggage
is still on your back.

621
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,870
You just came back.

622
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:43,469
Well...

623
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,469
You go.

624
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:47,469
I'll help her.

625
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:48,150
Go.

626
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,070
All right. Just a few simple dishes.

627
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:55,269
It's different when we have you, Peilan.

628
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,350
Just eat, mother.

629
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:00,989
Peilan.

630
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:03,469
You've only been gone a few days.

631
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,550
Why did you hurry back?

632
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,229
How is Master Lu?

633
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,429
As soon as we arrived,
Master Lu woke up.

634
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:12,070
He took Master's medicine for a few days

635
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,350
and was able to walk soon.

636
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,150
The doctor said he would be fine soon.

637
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,229
So Mr. Lu had someone send me back.

638
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,669
You shouldn't have rushed back.

639
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,229
You should stay there
for a few more days.

640
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:27,110
Mother, there's something else
I want to tell you.

641
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,189
What's up?

642
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:34,830
Mr. Lu said he wanted to come here
to propose marriage.

643
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,830
That's a good thing.

644
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:45,229
Why was a proposal mentioned
all of a sudden?

645
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:47,669
That's Master Lu's idea.

646
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,830
He wants to see Mr. Lu get married

647
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,469
while he's still healthy.

648
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:55,070
When do they plan to propose?

649
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,896
At the beginning of next month.

650
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:58,870
It's a few days away.

651
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:00,709
Right. It's the end of the month now.

652
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,870
Right.

653
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,350
That's good.

654
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,669
You've had a long trip.
Hurry up and eat something.

655
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,590
When Peilan was cooking this earlier,

656
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:16,669
I was drooling on the side.

657
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,110
Banxia, let me count for you.

658
00:33:36,229 --> 00:33:37,669
How can bride count her own dowry?

659
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:39,150
Hurry up and make way.

660
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:40,830
Peilan,

661
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,390
come and see what I've prepared for you.

662
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,830
These are all good things.

663
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:46,910
This is eyebrow dye.

664
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:49,469
This is a gold-plated hairpin.

665
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:50,910
And these are two pairs of bracelets.

666
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,949
You can wear them in rotation
to match your clothes.

667
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,709
Jinrong, the Young Lord
gave all these to you.

668
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,910
And you're giving them to me?

669
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,630
You are getting married.

670
00:33:58,509 --> 00:33:59,790
She has saved some for herself.

671
00:34:00,189 --> 00:34:01,590
Chun Banxia, you've become a doctor.

672
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,870
But you still can't speak properly.

673
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,910
Keep counting.

674
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:06,709
Peilan,

675
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:09,830
do you want to use the cloud pattern

676
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,429
or the orchid pattern for the bedding?

677
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,429
I personally think
the orchid pattern is better.

678
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,830
Orchid goes well with your name.

679
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,790
Which one of the two is cheaper?

680
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,629
Don't consider the fees
for such a big event in your life.

681
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:22,190
Keep them both for her.

682
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:24,310
Keep them both.

683
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,989
So much dowry.

684
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:29,989
I didn't know we were so rich.

685
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,830
You have no idea how long
your mother has been saving.

686
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,949
Mother, why did you make
so many wedding buns?

687
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:46,790
We're not even there yet.

688
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,589
Mother, I'll help you make them.

689
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,790
Don't do anything.

690
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,870
You are going to be a bride soon.

691
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,469
Don't come into the kitchen these days.

692
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,509
After you get married,

693
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:56,989
you won't be idle.

694
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:01,390
This is the first time
we marry off a daughter.

695
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,670
I must hold a grand ceremony.

696
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,230
We cannot lose etiquette.

697
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:07,949
How many more do you have to make?

698
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:09,029
Why don't you take a break?

699
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,190
Your back was just fine.

700
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,190
I'm not tired.

701
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:14,029
There's not much else I can do for you.

702
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:17,949
What are you talking about?

703
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,549
In the future,
I might bother you quite a bit.

704
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,350
Listen.

705
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,390
Once you have your own family,

706
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,029
you must discuss everything
with the family, understand?

707
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:29,710
Don't worry.

708
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:31,429
Mr. Lu will listen to me.

709
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,149
And the people from Lu's Manor
won't bully me.

710
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:35,270
They all treat me very well.

711
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,549
You've said what I wanted to say.

712
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:41,830
Of course, you are the most sensible.

713
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:45,429
I just think
you're too good for Lu Buping.

714
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:52,870
Mother,

715
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:55,670
thank you.

716
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,270
Why thank me?

717
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,949
Thank you for taking good care of us.

718
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,190
Well, that's what a mother should do.

719
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,390
I should be thanking you.

720
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,750
What did you feel when you got married?

721
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:18,549
When I got married...

722
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,390
I was too young when I got married.

723
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,790
I don't even remember.

724
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:28,549
I remember

725
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:31,710
that your grandmother
said something to me

726
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,750
that I still remember to this day.

727
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,469
What did she say?

728
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,390
She said,

729
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:43,989
"We'll always be behind you.

730
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,230
There are more pains than joys in life.

731
00:36:49,149 --> 00:36:51,350
Once you've made a choice,
don't give up.

732
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,670
Everything will get better".

733
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,710
Mother.

734
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:16,390
Aren't you...

735
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:17,190
Kick her off.

736
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,029
Stop fighting.

737
00:37:23,149 --> 00:37:24,949
Did you see Mother crying today?

738
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:27,310
Yes.

739
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,589
She has scolded us so harshly

740
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:32,270
since we were young.

741
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,350
And it's my first time seeing her cry.

742
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:39,629
That's because you were young
and didn't get what was happening.

743
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:43,670
When our father passed away,

744
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:45,750
Mother always cried behind our backs.

745
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,390
Really, Peilan?

746
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:52,910
Eventually, she stopped crying,

747
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:55,670
as you and Keling started to cry.

748
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,469
She cried.

749
00:37:57,549 --> 00:37:58,429
I wouldn't cry.

750
00:37:58,429 --> 00:37:58,910
Me, neither.

751
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,870
Chun Banxia, you're the crybaby.

752
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,710
Peilan, do you remember that time?

753
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,390
Both of them fell into a pit.

754
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,149
I remember. I remember.

755
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,230
I don't want to leave.

756
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,750
Peilan,

757
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:24,069
who will mend my clothes
when they are torn in the future?

758
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,270
Will you come to Lu's Manor
to find me, Keling?

759
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,629
Peilan, if we want to eat the food
you cook in the future,

760
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:33,830
what should we do then?

761
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:38,670
I don't care.
We'll still be sisters in the next life.

762
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,870
Ladies, please come inside.

763
00:39:01,149 --> 00:39:02,910
Please come in. Please.

764
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:04,469
- Slow down.
- Mrs. Chun.

765
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,190
- Xiaoxiao, you're here.
- Congratulations.

766
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,429
- Please come in.
- Okay.

767
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:08,029
Okay.

768
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:08,670
Master.

769
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,509
Xiaoxiao, right?

770
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:10,190
Young Lord.

771
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,230
- You're here.
- Uncle.

772
00:39:11,469 --> 00:39:13,670
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

773
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:14,790
By the way,

774
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,670
this is a gift.

775
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,629
It's a plaque specially sent
by the Fourth Prince.

776
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:18,910
- A-Si sent it?
- Yes.

777
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:20,989
It will add glory to our house
if we hang it up.

778
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,149
I'll hang it up later.

779
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:22,910
And this one.

780
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,350
It's a gift that Li Tengyun sent back
from Sulala Ghuriyya.

781
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:28,190
- Tengyun sent this?
- Yes.

782
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:29,429
I'll lead them in.

783
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:29,949
Okay.

784
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:31,069
Come on. Please come in.

785
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:32,390
Please come in.

786
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,830
Is Tengyun doing well
in Sulala Ghuriyya?

787
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,790
Mrs. Chun.

788
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:37,069
Congratulations!

789
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:38,149
Mr. Xin!

790
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:39,710
I really didn't expect you to come.

791
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,390
We were once
the mistress and the servant.

792
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:44,710
And today's groom is my disciple.

793
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,149
Isn't that true?

794
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,350
Please come in.

795
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,069
Thank you.

796
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:48,870
Okay.

797
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,910
What are you looking at? Let's move.

798
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:52,429
Mother, look how grand they are.

799
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,069
Let's stay a little longer.

800
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,149
Will you go or not?

801
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,750
- Let's stay.
- Please stay.

802
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:01,469
It's destiny that brings you here.

803
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:03,429
Here, share the joy.

804
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:04,670
Thank you.

805
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,870
Is this your daughter?

806
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:06,390
Yes.

807
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,790
She's very beautiful.

808
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:09,870
She's sure to marry into a good family
in the future.

809
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:11,710
Congratulations!

810
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,149
The wedding is impressive.

811
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:13,790
Quite impressive.

812
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,310
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

813
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,230
- Congratulations, Mrs. Chun.
- Thanks, everyone.

814
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,149
Thank you, everyone.

815
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,710
Everyone gets one. Here.

816
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,670
Mrs. Chun.

817
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:24,549
Mr. Shen.

818
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:28,190
Mr. Shen,

819
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,870
are you now serving
in the imperial court?

820
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,750
I'm just a minor official
in the Hanlin Academy.

821
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,549
You are so capable.

822
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:37,589
I'm flattered.

823
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,149
How is the pharmacy
of Master and Banxia?

824
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,949
Banxia has gone to Baohe Clinic.

825
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:43,830
Our pharmacy has been closed
for some time.

826
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,350
However, I plan to re-open it

827
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:46,710
with Keling.

828
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,949
Miss Keling?

829
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:50,190
Yes, Keling is studying medicine
with Master.

830
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,549
She is finally starting a career.

831
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:53,549
Although it's not long,

832
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,949
she is learning quite fast.

833
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:57,390
Your Master has also taken on
two more apprentices.

834
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:58,469
They are right there.

835
00:40:58,509 --> 00:40:59,469
Master! Master!

836
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:00,870
Mr. Lu's preparation is almost done.

837
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:01,589
Really?

838
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:02,710
Yes. Peilan is almost ready too.

839
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,469
That's great.

840
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:04,750
That's really great.

841
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:06,469
Sorry. These two are like monkeys.

842
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,830
- Come in.
- Come in.

843
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,589
Please come in.

844
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:14,469
Xiaoxiao.

845
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:15,230
Xiaoxiao.

846
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:20,989
I'm so envious.

847
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,710
Jinrong.

848
00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:26,029
Don't envy them. This is nothing.

849
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,029
We will have ours, right?

850
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:29,910
I tell you.

851
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,029
My father seems almost ready to concede.

852
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:32,949
Almost?

853
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:37,469
If you can't handle your father,

854
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,750
I'll handle him.

855
00:41:40,629 --> 00:41:41,390
You wouldn't...

856
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:44,149
Boss, where's A-Si?

857
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,350
Don't mention him.

858
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,629
By the way,
I think I saw Mr. Shen earlier.

859
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:50,910
Which Mr. Shen?

860
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:52,230
Shen Wangyan.

861
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:01,949
Are you looking for me?

862
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,989
I'm not. Who are you?

863
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,870
What? You don't recognize
me with my clothes on?

864
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,350
What are you talking about?

865
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,270
Mr. Xu.

866
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,589
Congratulations
on your redemption, Mr. Xu.

867
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,910
Mr. Xin, I need to thank you

868
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:20,949
for extending a helping hand
in times of crisis.

869
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,310
Don't mention it.

870
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,230
You guys continue.

871
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,790
Your surname is really Xu?

872
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,069
Of course, I have never lied to you.

873
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,830
Mrs. Chun, it's the auspicious time.
Please take your seats.

874
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:53,549
Okay.

875
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:54,589
Quickly.

876
00:42:54,629 --> 00:42:55,870
- I'm going.
- Ask me

877
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,350
- if you don't understand.
- Okay.

878
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,589
Hurry up.
Don't miss the auspicious time.

879
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,790
- How could...
- Why are you still standing there?

880
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:03,989
Aren't you going to sit down?

881
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,830
Isn't it unsuitable for me to sit?

882
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,149
What's unsuitable?

883
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:09,350
Just sit down.

884
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:11,870
Come here.

885
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,270
Alright.

886
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,469
I feel kind of weird
wearing this flower on my head.

887
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:19,149
It's not. Just sit down.

888
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,069
Okay.

889
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:24,270
- I'm more nervous than them.
- Stop.

890
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,350
It's the auspicious time!

891
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,870
Let's welcome the new couple.

892
00:44:18,629 --> 00:44:19,629
Serve the tea.

893
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,469
Master, please.

894
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:53,029
Be respectful and careful.

895
00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:57,549
Never disobey your parents-in-law.

896
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:17,390
Mother-in-law, please.

897
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,350
Be diligent and respectful.

898
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,790
Never violate the rites of the family.

899
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:05,670
Yes.

900
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:08,190
For fear of not being competent,

901
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:10,109
I dare not forget your orders.

902
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:46,855
(Spring Is Everywhere)

903
00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:58,190
It hurts a lot.

904
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:58,910
My wrinkles...

905
00:46:58,949 --> 00:46:59,910
- Fix them...
- It hurts.

906
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:01,469
- Then you...
- She bit me.

907
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:03,029
How can I paint if you keep moving?

908
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,390
Alright, everyone, stand still.

909
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,469
Smile!

910
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:12,830
Everyone, listen to the command

911
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,270
and smile. Ready?

912
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:15,910
Three, two, one.

00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:17,670
