(Shen Wangyan)
I'm Shen Wangyan.

37
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:05,498
I'm here to work for Mr. Zheng.

38
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:07,218
Could you please inform him?

39
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:11,218
Mr. Zheng sold us the mansion
and moved away

40
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,417
a long time ago.

41
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,018
What a pity.

42
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:19,657
He invited me to visit so many times.

43
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:22,377
I guess it's not meant to be.

44
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,018
In that case, I'll go somewhere else.

45
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:32,058
It's raining out there.

46
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,938
How about staying until it stops?

47
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:35,738
Thank you so much.

48
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:44,458
Are you here for the test?

49
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:45,824
Not really.

50
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:47,938
I ranked third in the Year Jiazi

51
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,018
and went to work for Mr. Huang,

52
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:51,618
Yangzhou's richest man, as a tutor.

53
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:54,697
Unfortunately,
he passed away some days ago.

54
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:55,977
That's why I'm here.

55
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,312
You ranked third?

56
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,257
Then why did you

57
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,137
become a tutor

58
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:02,257
instead of an official?

59
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,018
I'm from an ordinary family

60
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:06,178
with no connections

61
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,498
or money to offer
to the Ministry of Personnel.

62
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:11,377
I became a tutor to make ends meet.

63
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:14,178
Mr. Zheng is so careless.

64
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:17,137
Why didn't he tell you that he moved?

65
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:18,618
You came here in vain.

66
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:19,936
It's okay.

67
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:22,338
I know some other
major families in Jianglin.

68
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:23,377
I'll ask around.

69
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:25,248
Major families?

70
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:27,618
Mr. Shen.

71
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:30,898
You know
the major families in Jianglin well?

72
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,537
That's exaggerated.

73
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:33,537
I have a few friends.

74
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,137
Friends?

75
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:38,498
Banxia, what are you doing?

76
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:40,377
Bring Mr. Shen some tea.

77
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:42,458
The rain has stopped.

78
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,338
Are you staying?

79
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:45,178
What kind of question is that?

80
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:46,048
Just go.

81
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,938
Thank you so much.
I happen to be thirsty.

82
00:03:57,657 --> 00:03:59,498
The tea is burning a bit.

83
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:01,938
Banxia, what's wrong with you?

84
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:04,498
It's fine.

85
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:06,618
Mr. Shen.

86
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,178
You mentioned the major families.

87
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:11,058
Who do you know

88
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:12,458
in Jianglin?

89
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:14,857
You want to meet them?

90
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:17,978
This is awkward.

91
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:20,498
I'm trying to marry off

92
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,257
my four daughters.

93
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:24,978
Mother, don't tell a stranger so much.

94
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,938
Stay quiet or go help your Master.

95
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:31,697
(I'm not leaving.)

96
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:33,217
(Let's see what this guy)

97
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:34,738
(is up to.)

98
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,658
Madam, is your husband an official?

99
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:39,337
Or what does he do for a living?

100
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:40,992
How much does he make?

101
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,096
Well...

102
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:46,978
We only have a pharmacy that makes

103
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:48,377
a dozen taels per month.

104
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:49,664
Why are you asking?

105
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,178
A couple should be the right match.

106
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,538
I need information

107
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:55,098
to help you, Madam.

108
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,337
With what?

109
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:57,632
Marrying you off.

110
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,528
I don't need it.

111
00:04:58,528 --> 00:04:59,392
Shut up.

112
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:01,098
Madam, please don't be mad.

113
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:02,978
I was too direct

114
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,538
and offended her.
Please don't blame her.

115
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:07,377
You're so polite.

116
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:09,978
Madam, the rain has stopped.

117
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,058
Thank you for the tea.

118
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:13,577
Please take care.

119
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:17,858
Mr. Shen.

120
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:20,137
You have nowhere to go, anyway.

121
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:22,697
Why don't you stay here for a few days?

122
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,618
Mother.

123
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:25,377
We don't have extra rooms for you.

124
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:26,304
Shut up.

125
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:27,577
We do.

126
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,538
I hate to bother you.

127
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:33,088
Oh.

128
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,577
I prepared a gift for Mr. Zheng.

129
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:37,858
Keep it, Madam.

130
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,777
Thank you.

131
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,098
I hope I can see you around.

132
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:43,456
I'll take my leave.

133
00:05:58,137 --> 00:05:59,377
He must have written it himself.

134
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,512
(Harmony brings fortune)

135
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:03,017
Great handwriting.

136
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,178
Are you sure you can tell, Mother?

137
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:19,938
A-Si is coming back for real.

138
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:22,697
Come on, Boss, why are you so nervous?

139
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:23,897
Do I look nervous?

140
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,257
You read the letter ten times.

141
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,298
Are you illiterate?

142
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,137
It just says that A-Si is coming back.

143
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:32,658
Boss, let me remind you.

144
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,897
Don't beat him

145
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:35,337
if he confesses to you again.

146
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:44,858
Can you stop sighing?

147
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:45,897
It's been a whole day.

148
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:46,978
Leave me alone.

149
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:48,137
I'm like a mess.

150
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,120
Got it.

151
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:50,457
You're in love.

152
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:05,600
Brother.

153
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:08,017
How's it going with that girl

154
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,058
you told me about?

155
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:10,858
Which girl?

156
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,738
Too many girls like me.

157
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:14,257
The one you're pursuing.

158
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,352
You mean Hua?

159
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:18,298
How do I put it?

160
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:20,337
She's pretty and sweet.

161
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:21,664
I kind of like her.

162
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:23,178
But I feel that

163
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,978
she's lacking some

164
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:27,577
girly traits.

165
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,058
What do you mean?

166
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:32,858
Well, I mean

167
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:35,377
girls have a peculiar charm.

168
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:37,337
Let's take Jinrong for example.

169
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,257
She likes to dress up and put on makeup.

170
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:41,618
That makes her charming.

171
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:43,058
Hua doesn't put on makeup?

172
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:44,897
Will you like her more

173
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,538
if she puts on some makeup?

174
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:47,618
Isn't it perfect

175
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:48,704
if the girl you like

176
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,618
acts cute in front of you?

177
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:52,337
Hua never acts cute?

178
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,472
And she beats people.

179
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,688
Who would like that?

180
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:55,897
Exactly. She can't beat people.

181
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:26,498
Who took my eyebrow pen?

182
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:46,058
Keling.

183
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,058
Jinrong's clothes...

184
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:52,778
Ghost!

185
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:55,497
I don't know anything.

186
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:56,416
I don't know anything.

187
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:57,457
- Spare me.
- Hey.

188
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:59,058
It's talking.

189
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:00,898
W-Who are you?

190
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:02,898
It's me. You rascal.

191
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:08,817
K-Keling.

192
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:11,778
W-Why are you all made up like that?

193
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,208
I'm not made up.

194
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:17,538
Right, you're not.

195
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,008
What did you see?

196
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:23,337
I saw you wearing Jinrong's clothes.

197
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:24,544
No.

198
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,977
You saw nothing.

199
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:28,096
Yeah.

200
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,337
I saw nothing.

201
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,720
Get lost.

202
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:32,416
Okay.

203
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,617
It's okay for girls to dress up

204
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:37,664
occasionally.

205
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,192
I'm warning you.

206
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:48,497
If a third person finds out about this,

207
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:52,298
you'll be buried in our backyard.

208
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,857
Get lost.

209
00:10:05,298 --> 00:10:06,240
Oh no.

210
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:07,424
Oh no.

211
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:12,544
(Spring River Restaurant)

212
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:14,178
The rain is not stopping.

213
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:21,778
Thank you for your help, Mr. Shen.

214
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:23,168
No problem.

215
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:25,258
I just ran into
the Minister of Personnel

216
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,538
and mentioned

217
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:27,538
your family.

218
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:30,298
His third son turned out
to be very interested

219
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:31,737
in Miss Jinrong.

220
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,217
I'll find a chance
to arrange for a meeting.

221
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:35,898
That's great.

222
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,497
Mrs. Chun, you're so blessed.

223
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,058
Mr. Shen, you're so sweet.

224
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:41,778
Miss Banxia, see you around.

225
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,968
So...

226
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:44,864
Mother.

227
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:46,848
Banxia.

228
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:48,737
What are you doing here?

229
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:50,977
Jinrong may finally

230
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:52,337
get married.

231
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:54,018
I'm telling Mr. Shen

232
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:55,538
about her.

233
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:56,697
Mother.

234
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,817
Who would help marry off your daughter?

235
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,538
Besides, he's supposed to be a scholar.

236
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:01,617
Don't get deceived.

237
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:03,258
Listen to yourself.

238
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,857
Do you think everyone's

239
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:05,977
as cold as you?

240
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,977
Miss Banxia is very cautious.

241
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:09,376
Good for her.

242
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:10,497
Mrs. Chun.

243
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:12,497
Of course, I'm not helping you for free.

244
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:14,368
See?

245
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:17,778
I get it.

246
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:20,032
Mrs. Chun.

247
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,378
I'm not asking for money.

248
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:23,296
So...

249
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:25,298
I don't know where Mr. Zheng is

250
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:27,097
and I need time to find

251
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:28,497
someone else to work for.

252
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:30,304
Mrs. Chun.

253
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:34,018
I may have to stay
at your mansion for a while.

254
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:36,258
Oh, come on.

255
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,457
No problem. We have plenty of room.

256
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:40,977
We have no extra guest room at all.

257
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:43,097
Mother, let's not bring trouble home.

258
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:44,778
What are you talking about?

259
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:46,176
Mr. Shen.

260
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:48,298
Please help Jinrong find a good man.

261
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:49,216
Of course.

262
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:50,400
Mother.

263
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:51,378
How can you invite

264
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,817
a stranger to live with us?

265
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,457
Shut up.

266
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:55,936
You...

267
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,857
You're an educated girl.

268
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:00,058
Mr. Shen ranked third in the test.

269
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:01,697
"Scholars look at each other", right?

270
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:04,138
But you're so impolite to him.

271
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,378
Madam,

272
00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:07,577
it should be
"scholars look down on each other".

273
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:10,538
Yeah, it means scholars don't get along.

274
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,688
So I'll take

275
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,737
Mr. Shen home.
You'll get salted duck eggs.

276
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:21,920
No way.

277
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:24,138
Then you can take Mr. Shen home.

278
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:25,056
No way...

279
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:26,400
You...

280
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:28,617
Mrs. Chun, see you later.

281
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:29,504
See you later.

282
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:33,337
You can trick my mother,

283
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:34,304
but not me.

284
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:35,424
I didn't trick her.

285
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:38,258
You said you'd introduce

286
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,538
Jinrong to the third son
of the Minister of Personnel.

287
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:41,408
Right?

288
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:42,977
So what's his name?

289
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:43,872
Where does he live?

290
00:12:44,658 --> 00:12:45,577
I don't know.

291
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:46,457
I was just saying.

292
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:47,898
So you tricked my mother.

293
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:50,658
Why would you say that?

294
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,457
I'm working on it.

295
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:53,898
I just hate to see

296
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,138
your mother anxious.

297
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:56,544
Besides,

298
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:57,857
it's all about planning.

299
00:12:58,217 --> 00:12:59,217
I will start by

300
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:01,497
getting to know
the Minister of Personnel.

301
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,737
Then I'll try to marry off your sister.

302
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,097
So it's not just that
you didn't pull the string.

303
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:07,778
You don't even know them.

304
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:10,938
You're really...

305
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:12,544
What?

306
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:15,817
You're really a fraud.

307
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:16,768
What?

308
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:18,617
I'm flattered.

309
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:20,320
You...

310
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:24,577
I'm warning you.
Stay away from my mother.

311
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:27,497
Don't follow me.

312
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:46,656
I told you to leave.

313
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:47,737
Or I'll get the authorities.

314
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,857
Mrs. Chun invited me here.

315
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,178
I couldn't turn her down.

316
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,658
And you'll be in trouble

317
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:54,217
if I leave.

318
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,128
You...

319
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,138
Mr. Shen.

320
00:13:58,178 --> 00:13:59,217
Mr. Shen.

321
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:00,064
Mrs. Chun.

322
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,737
Sorry, I took so long.

323
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:02,656
Not at all.

324
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:04,658
Why didn't you

325
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,497
bring Mr. Shen some tea?

326
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:07,497
Don't just sit here.

327
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:09,938
Mother, let me tell you the truth.

328
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:11,040
Sit.

329
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,778
He doesn't know
the third son of the Minister.

330
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,577
He was just making things up.

331
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:16,977
Liu Daiyan, male,

332
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,097
age 28,

333
00:14:18,097 --> 00:14:20,097
third son of Liu Wennan,
the Minister of Personnel.

334
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:22,058
He showed his talent

335
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:23,857
at an early age.

336
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,817
Sounds great.

337
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:26,912
Right?

338
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:28,378
That's not what he...

339
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:29,888
You just made it up?

340
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:31,737
Try making it up now.

341
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:33,337
Stop messing things up.

342
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:36,697
Mr. Shen, your next step...

343
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:37,920
Next.

344
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,178
I have to contact

345
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,418
some of his friends

346
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:41,440
and try to make him

347
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,178
meet Miss Jinrong in a couple of days.

348
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:45,697
I see.

349
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:46,912
Mr. Shen.

350
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:49,217
Here's some money for you to maneuver.

351
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,097
Madam, I didn't mean that.

352
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:52,832
What are you doing?

353
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:54,378
You're being tricked, you know?

354
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:57,097
You think you know better?

355
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:58,977
Give it here.

356
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,857
Here, take it.

357
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,737
I'll start cooking.

358
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:05,898
Dine here tonight.

359
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:08,857
Madam, I'd better hurry.

360
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:10,097
I'm on it.

361
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:18,817
Look at Mr. Shen.

362
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,617
He's already on it.

363
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:22,337
What a trustworthy young man.

364
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:23,857
You're so generous now?

365
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,216
You've changed.

366
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:26,217
I'm doing this for you.

367
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,217
- What a nice young man.
- I...

368
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:32,778
Whatever.

369
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:34,737
You won't believe me, anyway.

370
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:36,337
L-Let's see if he comes back.

371
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:37,248
Let's take a bet.

372
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:38,737
Let's see if he comes back.

373
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:02,784
A-Si.

374
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:04,352
I'm sorry.

375
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:10,337
Should I be friendlier?

376
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:12,538
Hi, A-Si.

377
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:17,977
No, it's been a long time.

378
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:19,697
Should I be gentler?

379
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,080
A-Si.

380
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:31,538
Actually,

381
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:32,977
I've been missing you.

382
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:39,008
Chun Keling, you got this.

383
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:41,952
Boss.

384
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:43,168
A-Si is here.

385
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:02,080
Keling.

386
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:05,440
You're wearing make-up.

387
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:10,400
Hi, there.

388
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,578
Well...

389
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:13,536
Why did you come?

390
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:15,537
I came to see you.

391
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,497
Wait, stop.

392
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,217
Let's talk about something else.

393
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:20,640
Don't worry.

394
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:22,217
I won't make you awkward.

395
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:24,858
I've thought a lot about it.

396
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:26,898
I was too selfish.

397
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:29,658
I was eager to express myself,

398
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:31,858
regardless of your feelings.

399
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:33,777
I shouldn't pressure you.

400
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:37,737
Did I make you awkward again?

401
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:40,098
I'm just saying.

402
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:40,977
You don't have to like me.

403
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:43,744
I...

404
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:51,392
Well...

405
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,297
Let's eat something first.

406
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,818
Boss, why didn't you tell him?

407
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,376
Tell him what?

408
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:11,138
Didn't you deeply regret it?

409
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:12,257
Says who?

410
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,457
Boss, listen to me.

411
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:14,497
If he confesses again,

412
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:15,418
don't turn him down.

413
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:16,608
He didn't...

414
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,497
What does it have to do with you?

415
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:20,777
Why do you care?

416
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,057
Okay.

417
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:24,098
Bro, I think Boss knows what to do.

418
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:25,696
Let's go.

419
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,017
Well, what's wrong?

420
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:37,600
Nothing.

421
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:38,720
Did you order?

422
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,178
No, I was waiting for you.

423
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:42,368
Waiter.

424
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:44,928
Enjoy.

425
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:49,338
A-Si, you know?

426
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:51,578
While you were away,

427
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,418
Boss has missed you...

428
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:55,457
A-Si.

429
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:57,378
Is there something
you'd like to say to Boss?

430
00:18:57,818 --> 00:18:59,378
Seize the chance.

431
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:00,288
The chance...

432
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:01,697
Should I say it for you?

433
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:04,384
Sorry, A-Si.

434
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,432
It's okay.

435
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:10,618
Don't you feel

436
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:13,297
a bit unwanted here?

437
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:25,338
W-Won't they sit with us?

438
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:28,138
No, it's better like this.

439
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,064
Oh, Keling.

440
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:34,017
You like wine.

441
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:35,658
So I brought you Western wine

442
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:36,737
from the Palace.

443
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:37,777
Try it.

444
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:38,977
- Really?
- I don't know if it's nice.

445
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:45,618
Pretend to be weak.

446
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:52,224
A-Si.

447
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:55,616
It's too tight.

448
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:57,697
I-I can't open it.

449
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,472
Let me.

450
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:14,208
I can't open it, either.

451
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:17,408
Give it to me.

452
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:23,378
Come on, bottoms up.

453
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:31,338
Why is it so sour?

454
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:32,618
Is it?

455
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:33,472
Let me try it.

456
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:34,457
Boss, hurry up.

457
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:42,592
A-Si.

458
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:45,217
You know I'm sometimes

459
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,537
inconsiderate.

460
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,457
Last time when you...

461
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,858
I was like...

462
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:52,457
And you were fine, right?

463
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,217
A-Anyway, I'm sorry.

464
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:58,938
Are you talking about my confession?

465
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:02,016
Keling.

466
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:03,232
Like I said,

467
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:04,818
you don't have to like me.

468
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,697
I mean it.

469
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:08,448
I won't

470
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:09,792
bring it up again.

471
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:12,448
You...

472
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:14,912
You won't...

473
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:16,288
Bring it up...

474
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:21,138
Never mind. Let's drink.

475
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:22,912
Where is my wine?

476
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:23,818
Where is my wine?

477
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:24,658
Here.

478
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:32,777
The soup is ready.

479
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:35,418
Fish soup with tofu.

480
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,098
Mother, you made fish?

481
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:38,658
I have to try it.

482
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:43,858
Mr. Shen is not back yet.

483
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:44,777
Wait for him.

484
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:46,098
We're waiting for him?

485
00:21:46,818 --> 00:21:48,618
It's good to be taught a lesson.

486
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:50,618
I believe that

487
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:51,977
Mr. Shen will be back soon.

488
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,497
Let's see if he comes back.

489
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:54,400
Just wait.

490
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:56,064
Mrs. Chun.

491
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,138
Mr. Shen.

492
00:21:58,138 --> 00:21:59,578
Hurry up. Let's eat.

493
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,658
Get him some rice.

494
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:01,600
Okay.

495
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:03,418
- Get the rice.
- Alright.

496
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:04,288
You're back?

497
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:07,008
Mr. Shen.

498
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:08,864
How did it go?

499
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,648
All fixed.

500
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:13,737
They're quite happy

501
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:14,658
with Miss Jinrong,

502
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:17,098
except for

503
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:19,138
her age.

504
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:22,618
I knew there'd be an excuse.

505
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:26,138
Madam, don't be upset.

506
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:27,777
In three months,

507
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,497
I will find Miss Jinrong

508
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:30,938
a better husband.

509
00:22:31,257 --> 00:22:33,098
What? You're staying for three months?

510
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:36,017
It's fine as long as
Jinrong can be married off.

511
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:39,497
We're counting on you, Mr. Shen.

512
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:40,384
My pleasure.

513
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:42,257
I'll go to rest now.

514
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:44,032
Wait.

515
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:47,178
I have a question.

516
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:50,138
Where did you go?

517
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,416
Why?

518
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,472
Answer my question.

519
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:54,496
I saw you.

520
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:58,338
I saw him...

521
00:22:58,578 --> 00:22:59,658
I went to the brothel.

522
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,737
Alright, you have the guts to admit it.

523
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:11,552
He admitted it. He went to the brothel.

524
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:13,378
And I asked Xiaoxiao.

525
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:15,658
Mr. Zheng doesn't know
anyone called Shen Wangyan.

526
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,378
And the third-best scholar

527
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:18,737
of the Year Jiazi wasn't Shen Wangyan.

528
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,777
Is there any truth to what you said?

529
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:23,217
Mr. Shen.

530
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,658
Is Banxia telling the truth?

531
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:29,418
Is that a guilty laugh?

532
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:32,977
Miss Banxia, it's a pity
you haven't become an official.

533
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:35,938
The show is over.

534
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:37,257
Give us our money back.

535
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:38,464
Two taels.

536
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:42,560
Mrs. Chun.

537
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:44,777
I helped you because I thought

538
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:48,217
you were kind
and fate brought me to you.

539
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:51,818
It's fine that
you don't understand my job.

540
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:54,178
But you lack the basic respect.

541
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:55,338
Manipulating them again.

542
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,178
I went to the brothel

543
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,057
to gather information.

544
00:24:01,737 --> 00:24:02,624
What?

545
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:05,658
Why do tutors like us know everything?

546
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,057
Are we supposed to ask around?

547
00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:10,017
A brothel is where

548
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:11,697
all walks of life gather.

549
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:14,457
Those people have all kinds

550
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:15,578
of information.

551
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:18,898
It's the best place to get information.

552
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:21,338
Why can't I go there?

553
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:23,537
It's totally the right cause.

554
00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:26,217
Am I only allowed to do things

555
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:27,057
approved by you?

556
00:24:30,497 --> 00:24:31,392
Okay.

557
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:32,737
Let's drop it here.

558
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:34,737
What about Mr. Zheng?

559
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:38,737
Mr. Zheng never invited

560
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:39,777
Shen Wangyan.

561
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:40,658
It's true.

562
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:43,457
And the third-best scholar

563
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:45,057
of the Year Jiazi was not Shen Wangyan.

564
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,017
But Miss Banxia,

565
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:50,378
was he called Xu Yuanchi?

566
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:52,288
What do you mean?

567
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:56,497
Here is the letter from Mr. Zheng.

568
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:57,858
Madam, please take a look.

569
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,616
(To Xu Yuanchi)

570
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:01,297
Seriously?

571
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:02,777
You knew I'd look you up,

572
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:03,858
so you prepared this?

573
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:04,800
Since you know him,

574
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,257
you can take this letter

575
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,777
and confirm with Mr. Zheng.

576
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:15,497
To Xu Yuanchi.

577
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:19,818
Everybody goes by a pseudonym out there.

578
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,578
How do we know if you're Xu Yuanchi?

579
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,578
Fine, Madam.

580
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:29,178
Since you no longer trust me,

581
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:30,537
there's no point of me staying.

582
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:31,898
I bid you farewell.

583
00:25:33,138 --> 00:25:34,378
Mr. Shen.

584
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:36,497
My little daughter

585
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:37,938
is immature and has offended you.

586
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:39,977
Please don't take it to heart.

587
00:25:40,418 --> 00:25:41,938
Sit down, please.

588
00:25:42,098 --> 00:25:43,008
So...

589
00:25:43,297 --> 00:25:45,618
Why did you use a pseudonym?

590
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:47,818
Others may get you wrong.

591
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:49,344
Madam,

592
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:50,592
actually,

593
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:52,288
I had my reasons.

594
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:57,378
My father Xu Wangshan
was wronged by corrupt officials.

595
00:25:58,217 --> 00:25:59,257
My family went down

596
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:01,257
when I was eight.

597
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:04,578
I was the only one who survived.

598
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:07,858
Later, I started working as a tutor

599
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:09,618
under a pseudonym

600
00:26:09,977 --> 00:26:12,737
to gather evidence

601
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:14,057
and discover the truth

602
00:26:14,818 --> 00:26:17,017
so that my father's name

603
00:26:17,457 --> 00:26:18,697
could be cleared one day.

604
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:28,497
What a poor kid.

605
00:26:28,497 --> 00:26:30,057
Have more food.

606
00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:31,938
Come on, you believe that?

607
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,112
Banxia.

608
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:36,217
Apologize to Mr. Shen.

609
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:37,138
Hurry, Banxia.

610
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:38,578
Apologize.

611
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:39,977
Apologize to him?

612
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:41,257
In his dreams.

613
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,400
Mother.

614
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:48,497
Mr. Shen, come on.

615
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:50,178
Put the letter away.

616
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:52,338
I'll cook a few more dishes for you.

617
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:53,248
Thank you.

618
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,098
Put it away.

619
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:01,818
I've studied the Four Books

620
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:03,017
and Five Classics.

621
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:03,936
Really?

622
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:05,257
You're so knowledgeable.

623
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,176
- Yeah.
- A little.

624
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:12,098
P-Peilan.

625
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,457
Are you done with chores?

626
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:16,178
Yeah, Banxia, I'm done.

627
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:18,818
Don't chitchat with that guy.

628
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:19,818
You'll be tricked.

629
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:21,984
Miss Banxia,

630
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:24,497
everyone gets to decide what to do.

631
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:26,057
Why are you interfering with them?

632
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:28,017
I'm not interfering.

633
00:27:28,338 --> 00:27:29,378
I'm reminding my family

634
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:30,297
of potential danger.

635
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:33,777
An interference disguised as care

636
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:35,818
is the worst to accept.

637
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:38,737
Mr. Shen, well said.

638
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:42,720
I was wrong.

639
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:44,864
I thought he could

640
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,898
only deceive older people
like our mother.

641
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,017
I didn't expect the young ones would

642
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,618
also fall victim to his words.

643
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:52,418
When you think

644
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:54,418
that everyone around you is problematic,

645
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:55,697
is there a chance

646
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:57,457
that it's your problem?

647
00:27:57,858 --> 00:27:58,898
Yeah, Banxia.

648
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:00,064
Think about it.

649
00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:16,418
Mr. Shen.

650
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:19,378
I've never seen anyone winning Banxia

651
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:20,297
in a debate.

652
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:22,457
Reason is our ultimate guide.

653
00:28:22,457 --> 00:28:23,697
We can't progress without it.

654
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:26,240
It's so true.

655
00:28:41,737 --> 00:28:42,938
Why wouldn't he say it?

656
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:46,457
Why wouldn't he stop?

657
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:50,144
Who are you talking about?

658
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:53,600
Who are you talking about?

659
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:56,384
Go to sleep.

660
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:23,552
Mother.

661
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:26,898
What's wrong with you?

662
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:28,257
Mother.

663
00:29:28,257 --> 00:29:29,737
Listen, you have to trust me.

664
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:31,938
Shen Wangyan is a fraud
who wants our money.

665
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:33,338
We're broke.

666
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:38,977
Then he's here for free food
and mental exploitation.

667
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:40,777
Listen.

668
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:41,858
Hide there.

669
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:43,338
I'll show you his true nature.

670
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:44,736
Mother.

671
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,178
Trust me.

672
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:49,257
I'm your daughter. Would I lie to...

673
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:53,378
I wouldn't lie to you. Trust me.

674
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:55,818
Fine, fine.

675
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:57,578
Oh, my.

676
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:04,257
So annoying.

677
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:08,497
We should have come earlier

678
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:09,378
for the roasted chicken.

679
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:11,497
We have mille-feuille cake.

680
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:14,017
Who drinks to that?

681
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:15,578
We need a roasted chicken.

682
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:17,098
Brother.

683
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,257
We've worked for Boss for years

684
00:30:19,658 --> 00:30:21,217
and she treats us well, right?

685
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:22,138
Yeah.

686
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:23,017
It's one step away.

687
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:24,512
Let's give it a push.

688
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:26,418
Are you ready to die?

689
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:46,178
You...

690
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,104
Shut up!

691
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:47,977
It's a robbery.

692
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:49,138
Come on.

693
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,016
It's a kidnap.

694
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah.

695
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:53,056
If you want her free,

696
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:54,178
say that you love her.

697
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,952
Yao Wen, Yao Wu, what are you doing?

698
00:30:57,952 --> 00:30:59,697
- Who?
- Who? It's a kidnap.

699
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:04,818
You... What do you want?

700
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:06,338
Take it easy.

701
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:07,217
We'll hurt him.

702
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:08,098
I-I'll hurt him.

703
00:31:08,178 --> 00:31:09,217
Stay back.

704
00:31:11,658 --> 00:31:12,608
Don't.

705
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,856
- I...
- Stay back.

706
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,338
Stay back.

707
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:16,992
Stay back.

708
00:31:18,257 --> 00:31:20,138
A robbery, huh? A kidnap, huh?

709
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:23,858
Die, you fools!

710
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:24,777
- Die!
- Keling.

711
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:26,217
Let go of Yao Wen and Yao Wu.

712
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:29,728
You got it wrong.

713
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:33,098
How can they be

714
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:35,138
Yao Wen and Yao Wu?

715
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:47,858
I didn't expect you

716
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:50,138
to do something so stupid.

717
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:51,858
We wanted to

718
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:53,338
help you.

719
00:31:54,257 --> 00:31:55,136
Keling.

720
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:57,217
Did you have something to say

721
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:58,777
but couldn't say it?

722
00:32:01,497 --> 00:32:02,464
No.

723
00:32:03,057 --> 00:32:04,057
I have nothing to say.

724
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:05,977
Or is there

725
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:07,697
something I should say?

726
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:12,497
N-No.

727
00:32:15,497 --> 00:32:16,352
Keling.

728
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:18,752
I like you.

729
00:32:32,257 --> 00:32:34,257
D-Do you hear me?

730
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,520
I...

731
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:37,378
I hear you.

732
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,192
I...

733
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:44,576
I...

734
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:47,840
I'm going home now.

735
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:49,184
Wrong way.

736
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:56,537
Congratulations.

737
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:03,338
We didn't get beaten in vain.

738
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:08,017
Get some rest.

739
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,418
We'll drink together.

740
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:37,418
Look who's back.

741
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:39,392
You're waiting for me?

742
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:43,178
For what? You were at the brothel.

743
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:44,416
How do you know?

744
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:46,138
You wasted my mother's money

745
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,457
at the brothel, huh?

746
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:49,408
Yeah.

747
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,157
You didn't ask around

748
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,537
for Jinrong, right?

749
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:55,138
It's true.

750
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:59,017
Alright, Shen Wangyan.

751
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:00,457
That's it.

752
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,138
At least, you have the guts to admit it.

753
00:34:03,537 --> 00:34:04,448
Good for you.

754
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,297
I wasn't asking around for your sister.

755
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,097
I did it for your mother.

756
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:11,520
What?

757
00:34:12,537 --> 00:34:14,537
I grew up without any support.

758
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:16,938
I sustain myself with my art of words.

759
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:19,057
I have better places to go.

760
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:21,137
But whenever I see Mrs. Chun

761
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,657
looking after you girls,

762
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:27,378
I remember my late mother.

763
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,338
Don't divert the topic.

764
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:30,858
She brought you up

765
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:32,177
despite all the hardship.

766
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:33,858
Have you cared for her?

767
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:34,298
Shut up!

768
00:34:34,298 --> 00:34:34,698
Have you?

769
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:34,898
S...

770
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,137
You only care about yourselves.

771
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,304
Shen...

772
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:39,298
So selfish.

773
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:40,378
- Shen...
- So selfish.

774
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:41,408
Shut up!

775
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:43,177
Mr. Shen.

776
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:47,008
Mrs. Chun?

777
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:48,977
Why are you here?

778
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,200
I misspoke.

779
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:53,057
Silly kid.

780
00:34:54,698 --> 00:34:56,137
Why didn't you tell me?

781
00:34:56,858 --> 00:34:57,792
I should have

782
00:34:58,057 --> 00:34:58,912
consulted you.

783
00:34:59,738 --> 00:35:01,898
Mother, I swear he's a fraud.

784
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:02,778
Trust me.

785
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:04,608
Mr. Shen.

786
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:07,298
Our top priority is to

787
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:08,537
marry off Jinrong.

788
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:10,097
Don't worry about me.

789
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:12,457
But I'd like to thank you.

790
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:14,977
It's nothing.

791
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:17,938
But I do wish you the best.

792
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:22,208
Mother.

793
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,537
I swear he's a hypocrite.

794
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:25,698
I saw it with my own eyes.

795
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:27,097
Thankfully, you made me hide.

796
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:28,378
Or I wouldn't know

797
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:29,418
how kind Mr. Shen is.

798
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:32,258
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

799
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,177
Get some rest.

800
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:36,192
Take care, Madam.

801
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:42,944
Mother.

802
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,072
Miss Banxia,

803
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:49,258
the stubborn look on your face

804
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:50,944
is so pretty.

805
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:56,977
Shen Wangyan.

806
00:35:58,738 --> 00:35:59,858
Where did it go?

807
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:02,418
I kept it here.

808
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,657
Where is it?

809
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:05,177
Did I lose it?

810
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:06,698
I left it here.

811
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:07,584
Jinrong.

812
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:12,224
You look pretty.

813
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:15,177
Girls should dress up a bit.

814
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:16,457
Stop being sloppy.

815
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,497
Others may think
you're my little brother.

816
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,288
So pretty.

817
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:21,248
Jinrong.

818
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,258
I'd like to tell you something.

819
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:26,537
Promise me you won't be mad.

820
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,698
What is it?

821
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:30,057
Promise me first.

822
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:32,320
Tell me first.

823
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,497
I wore your clothes a bit.

824
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,704
You did?

825
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:38,338
Chun Keling, how dare you?

826
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:40,177
You know how pricy it is?

827
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:41,577
Without my permission,

828
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:42,657
it's considered a theft.

829
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,338
Don't you know your size?

830
00:36:44,657 --> 00:36:46,617
Look how dirty you made it.

831
00:36:46,617 --> 00:36:48,258
Jinrong, calm down.

832
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:49,977
There's something else.

833
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:53,184
What is it?

834
00:36:58,497 --> 00:36:59,338
Your eyebrow pen.

835
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,338
My eyebrow pen?

836
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:08,218
It's fine.

837
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:10,977
We're sisters.

838
00:37:10,977 --> 00:37:12,137
Chun Keling!

839
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:13,497
- Help!
- I'll kill you!

840
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,698
- Mother! Jinrong's killing me!
- Stop there.

841
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:16,576
Mother.

842
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,017
Chun Keling!

843
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:24,640
Shen Wangyan.

844
00:37:25,338 --> 00:37:26,418
Hello, Miss Banxia.

845
00:37:27,017 --> 00:37:27,858
What's wrong?

846
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:29,258
You'd like to talk to get over

847
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:30,338
the lengthy night?

848
00:37:31,738 --> 00:37:33,177
Listen, don't get cocky.

849
00:37:33,177 --> 00:37:34,898
I'll catch you sooner or later.

850
00:37:35,617 --> 00:37:36,512
Miss Banxia.

851
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:38,137
I have a question for you.

852
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,537
Why are you paying
so much attention to me?

853
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:42,378
And you minded me visiting

854
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:43,712
the brothel.

855
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:47,378
Who cares if you visit the brothel?

856
00:37:47,617 --> 00:37:49,097
I care because you're a fraud

857
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:50,457
who's after my family.

858
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:51,680
Really?

859
00:37:53,698 --> 00:37:55,177
But why do I feel

860
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:56,418
that you can't

861
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,418
look at me in the eyes?

862
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:03,537
S-Says who?

863
00:38:04,457 --> 00:38:05,698
You're not a pleasant sight.

864
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:07,698
Don't tell me that

865
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:09,378
you like me.

866
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:14,097
Shameless.

867
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:19,584
Why so serious?

868
