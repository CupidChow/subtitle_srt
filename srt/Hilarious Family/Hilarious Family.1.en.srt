00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:18,240
(Bench Part)

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,920
(My name is Chun Peilan.)

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,399
(Can you believe that I,
who am currently making rose pastries,)

4
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,640
(am experiencing
the biggest change in my life?)

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,799
(Chun Peilan, 28, thrifty, but with bad luck)
(On my 10th birthday, Mother took me to the temple.)

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,039
(I prayed to God in my heart)

7
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,640
(that our family could live happily.)

8
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,320
(Memorial tablet of late husband, Mr. Chun)
(But God did not grant my wish, my father...)

9
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,399
Chun Jinrong, are you deaf?
What time is it now?

10
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,456
Hurry up!

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,234
(Du Ruyu, 47)
(This is my mother who lives in anxiety)

12
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:00,360
(Skilled in household management)
(about marrying her daughters.)

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,920
Mother, when we get there,

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,480
you must not shout and yell like this.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,640
Besides, why are you in such a hurry?

16
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,359
You're not in a hurry now?

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,079
You're already thirty. Do you know that?

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,319
Twenty-nine.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,079
What's more,
you're not just waiting for me.

20
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,760
I wonder
if Peilan's pastries are ready yet.

21
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,920
Peilan, are the pastries ready yet?

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,296
(Chun Jinrong, 30)
(This is my eldest sister)

23
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,300
(Versatile, with high aspiration)
(who wants to marry into a rich family.)

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,740
(She's determined to
be a person above others.)

25
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,719
On my way. Jinrong, here.

26
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,640
It's still hot.
Taking it now is just right in time.

27
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,799
Mother, when we get there,

28
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
just say that I made this.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Don't make mistakes.

30
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,040
Keep pretending. After you're married,
see how you keep doing so.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,599
Hurry up and go.

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,480
(Although they occasionally quarrel,)

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,879
(I know they are the ones who care the most
for each other deep in their hearts.)

34
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,560
Why is my medicine less?

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,879
Is this medicine? Isn't this sugar?

36
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,536
It's poisonous.

37
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,039
(Chun Keling, 18, helps the weak,)
(This is my fourth sister. You'll never know)

38
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,159
(but gets beaten a lot)
(what kind of trouble she'll get into.)

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,599
This is a match made in heaven.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,639
We haven't known each other for long,

41
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,479
but my son is particularly

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,439
satisfied with Jinrong.

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,560
What a fate.

44
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,319
Who would have thought
that Jinrong's fate

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,960
would be actually here?

46
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,759
Totally right.

47
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,039
If you had moved to Jianglin earlier,

48
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,400
maybe, we would
already have grandchildren.

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
It's not too late now.

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,400
It's not too late now.

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,080
Yeah, let's set the wedding date
on the seventh day of next month.

52
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,759
Let's settle this.

53
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,560
Inedible.

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,680
(Jinrong is really virtuous.)

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,520
(Look at these pastries.
How good they look.)

56
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,000
(Have a taste.)

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,360
(Taste it.)

58
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,240
(It smells delicious.)

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Don't eat it.

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,808
What are you doing?

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,240
Luckily, you didn't eat it.

(The destined ones meet for the first time in Jianglin)

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Why is our family so unlucky?

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,160
Mother, do we really have to
pay them a hundred taels?

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,079
(Chun Banxia, 20)
(This is my third sister, a book lover)

98
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,440
(Upright and outspoken)
(and someone who loves to persuade us to read.)

99
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,944
Do you think we have a hundred taels?

100
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:39,800
No.

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,839
That's it.

102
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,240
Mr. Zhang even said he was being merciful,
and fifty taels would be enough.

103
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,959
We have fifty taels?

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,519
But we've apologized
and taken them to the doctor.

105
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,879
He still wants fifty taels.
Do you think that's fair?

106
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,759
Mother, to be fair,
it would be considered manslaughter.

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,720
It's actually reasonable
that they want fifty taels.

108
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,319
What manslaughter?
It was just a misunderstanding.

109
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,959
When it's the end of the year,
we can't pay the fifty taels,

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,199
and we have to sell the house,
it would be reasonable?

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,759
Mother, where's breakfast?

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
Chun Jinrong, why did you just get up?

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,279
We have to meet Matchmaker Wu later.

114
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
- Take care. Take care.
- Another blind date?

115
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,680
Without blind dates, where would we
get fifty taels to pay Mr. Zhang?

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,439
Are you suggesting
selling your daughter?

117
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,040
This is called
getting up from where you fell.

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,319
She's already thirty.
If she's not married by thirty,

119
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,240
we'll have to pay a fine
to the imperial court.

120
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,240
Could you be louder?

121
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,079
The man selling grain up front
hasn't heard you yet. Oh, my.

122
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,199
I didn't want to get married before

123
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,600
because we were in Qing City.
Now that we're here in Jianglin,

124
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,199
I'm sure I can get married.

125
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,759
What's more,
without Mr. Wang, there's Mr. Li.

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,360
Without Mr. Li, there's Mr. Zhao.

127
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,079
I'm sure I can get married this year.

128
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:47,439
That's the best. If you're not married
by the end of the year,

129
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,680
pay the fine yourself.

130
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
Oh, after paying the fine,
you don't have to come back.

131
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,079
Go straight to Mr. Zhang's house
and work off your debt as a maid.

132
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,319
Here you go again.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
Fetch the hammer.

134
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,136
Chun Keling! The hammer.

135
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,551
I'm asking you to get it.

136
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,080
Here it is.

137
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,079
Mother, you've crippled Keling?

138
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,439
What are you saying?
I was chasing her and she fell.

139
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,079
I've been kneeling, so my legs are numb.

140
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,592
Mother, take it.

141
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,600
Here you are.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,759
I'm telling you, if you ever
bring back those inedible trash,

143
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,319
see if I will beat you to death or not.

144
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,959
Go on kneeling in the ancestral hall.

145
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,648
Alright.

146
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,040
(Li Tengyun, 27)

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,319
(Helps grow fortune, good at fortune-telling)
Miss, you look pale, with evil spirits over your head.

148
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,360
You've been having bad luck
for a while, haven't you?

149
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,519
To be honest, Master,

150
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,399
last month our family just owed
a lot of money because of me.

151
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,879
Qian of three long lines, and Kun of three short lines,
which means endless troubles.

152
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,879
It's a bad omen. Judging by this,

153
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,879
today you could at least
get involved in disputes.

154
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,120
In the worst case, there could be
a disaster involving bloodshed.

155
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,759
What should I do then, Master?

156
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,559
Fortunately, I can solve it.

157
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,320
That's great, Master.
Please help me solve it.

158
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,240
One hundred wen.

159
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,080
You want money?

160
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
You dragged me over here,
saying it wouldn't cost any money.

161
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,720
Did I ask for money
after I talked for so long?

162
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,879
Fortune-telling is for free,
but solutions cost money.

163
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,080
Are you going to solve it or not?

164
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,360
It is so expensive. I'll pass.

165
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,919
Wait, wait. Sit down.

166
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,639
You see, all these things cost me.

167
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,360
How about this, Miss?
I'll give you a discount. Fifty wen.

168
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,840
Take care, Master.

169
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,360
Tell me, how much?

170
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:06,000
One wen.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,720
One? Impossible.

172
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,080
It's okay. Just be cautious.

173
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,440
Twenty wen. Ten wen will also do. Hey!

174
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,720
(Xishi Fresh Vegetables)

175
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,000
(Wet Market, Wang Xishi)
Spinach, Chinese cabbages, pak choi.

176
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,200
Spinach, Chinese cabbages, pak choi.

177
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,519
Shallots. Have a look?

178
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,600
I'll take some fresh ones.

179
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,840
They're all good. All fresh.

180
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,039
- Take more.
- I'll take good ones.

181
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,279
- Just put them in.
- Let me pick.

182
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,679
Pretty good. You don't have to pick.

183
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,759
Let me pick some.

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,639
You've peeled so much.
How can I sell them?

185
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,840
Not much at all.

186
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,159
You've peeled so much.
Weren't they peeled by you?

187
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,720
Someone else did it.

188
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,408
You...

189
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,879
Did you see it? She just peeled it.

190
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,960
(Today you could at least
get involved in disputes.)

191
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,840
I didn't see it.

192
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,159
Look, I said I didn't peel it.

193
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,639
You are really stingy. I won't buy it.

194
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,776
Whatever.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,360
You clearly saw her peeling just now.

196
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,399
Why did you say you didn't see?

197
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,480
I-I-I really didn't see it.

198
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,840
I won't buy it either. I'm leaving.

199
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,120
Stand there. Robbing in the daylight?

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,960
I am sorry.

201
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,080
I forgot. I won't buy it. I'm leaving.

202
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,600
What the heck?

203
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
I won't buy it either.

204
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,639
Just leave. Don't buy it.
Really bad luck in the early morning.

205
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:54,840
Chinese cabbages, pak choi, shallots.

206
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,399
Hurry up. She is
a famous matchmaker in Jianglin.

207
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,720
Oh, my, what's the rush?

208
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,399
We must get there early
to leave a good impression.

209
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,879
Hurry up.

210
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm telling you,
you're now atoning for your sins.

211
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,799
If it weren't for you...

212
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,759
Mother, aren't we too early?

213
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,320
Someone might think we're for night watch
but not for a blind date.

214
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,840
It is "respect." What do you know?

215
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,480
Father, it's all my fault for being careless about
what happened between Jinrong and Mr. Zhang.

216
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,360
Mother and Jinrong didn't scold me,

217
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,559
but I feel really bad inside.

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,440
So today, you must bless Jinrong
to have a smooth blind date.

219
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,200
Father, if you have time,

220
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,039
bless me and the whole family
to be doing well.

221
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,824
Peilan.

222
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,480
Banxia.

223
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
- Busy?
- What's up?

224
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,840
I want to buy a book
that I've wanted for a long time.

225
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,080
But I think Mother
probably won't buy it for me now.

226
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,639
Have you finished
all the books you bought?

227
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,840
I finished them a long time ago.

228
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,960
Let me see how much money I have left.

229
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Where is my purse?

230
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,559
(Lin's Mansion)
Mother, someone seems to have a celebration.

231
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,759
Quite a spectacle.
It's obviously a wealthy family.

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,480
Let's go. Let's take a look.

233
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,240
Enough. You have time
to care about others?

234
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,120
Let's hurry up and go.

235
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,320
When I get married in the future,

236
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,000
these experiences will come in handy.

237
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,720
The sedan chair is here.
Let's go, Mother.

238
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,639
Jinrong, Jinrong.

239
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,559
Bride, please get out of the sedan chair.

240
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,600
The bride isn't as pretty as me.

241
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,720
Come on. She's probably 18 at most.

242
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,120
But you're already thirty.

243
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,624
Enough, let's go.

244
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:47,840
- Dear guests, please enter.
- Later.

245
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,536
Let's go.

246
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:51,200
Stop pushing me.

247
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,919
Jinrong, hold onto your purse.

248
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,840
Guests from the groom's family,
this way.

249
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,399
Mrs. Han, please go that way.

250
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,559
Welcome, welcome.

251
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,759
Young man, you're mistaken.
We're not from here.

252
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,320
- That way, please.
- Got it.

253
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,000
- Don't keep them waiting.
- Follow me this way.

254
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,960
- This way.
- Mother, he said we should go this way.

255
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,879
Hello, stallkeeper.

256
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,600
Hello... There.

257
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:21,320
Have you seen a blue purse?

258
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,600
Did you just watch that woman
peeling the Chinese water bamboo?

259
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,960
I did see it.
She was truly unreasonable.

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,879
Why didn't you say it?

261
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,600
I-I... I really wasn't in a position
to say anything today.

262
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,320
Well, if you find the purse,

263
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
could you please return it to me?

264
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,840
The purse, right?

265
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,056
Purse, purse. No.

266
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,879
Thank you, stallkeeper.

267
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,000
Bow to heaven and earth.

268
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,399
- Bow to your parents.
- The bride's family sits here.

269
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,000
Why did you take us here?

270
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,320
We're not going to sit.
We have to go. We have our business.

271
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,919
Did we do something
to make you uncomfortable?

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
No, no.

273
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,879
- We are not.
- Please sit, distinguished guests.

274
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,960
You two, please take your seats.

275
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,240
Please have a seat,
the two distinguished guests over there.

276
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,279
My ladies, please sit here.

277
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
Mother, let's sit.

278
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,240
Sit down quickly. Everyone is watching.

279
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,272
It's all your fault.
You insisted on watching it.

280
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:28,519
- Since we're here now, we might as well
- Please welcome Mr. Lin

281
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,040
- see how Jianglin conducts wedding banquets.
- a congratulatory speech.

282
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,759
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

283
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,000
(Big, Small)
Come on. Pay attention.

284
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,480
Go.

285
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,919
Bet on Big to win big.
Bet on Small to win small.

286
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,000
Ten on Big.

287
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,919
This one is definitely on Small.
I bet on Small.

288
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,200
- I also bet on Small.
- No take-backs after bets.

289
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,840
Small.

290
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:55,195
(Lu Buping, 26, behaving like a hero,
but pretty ordinary)

291
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,480
Clean sweep.

292
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,559
Young man, if you don't want this dice,
don't just throw it away.

293
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,360
It's essential
to protect the environment.

294
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,856
Here you go.

295
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,360
- You're cheating.
- You're cheating.

296
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,639
- Take them away.
- Take away.

297
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,679
- Stop scrambling.
- They are our money.

298
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,600
Brother, we've done it for nothing.

299
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,960
(Hong Zhong, Bai Ban, Fa Cai)
You're messing with my business?

300
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,984
Go.

301
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,240
If you don't give us the money today,
don't think about leaving.

302
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,279
Then you can have a try.

303
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,480
I think he seems to be quite skilled.

304
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,480
Then let's take the first move.

305
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,679
Uncle, the cheater is over there.

306
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,416
Retreat, retreat.

307
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,600
Miss, are you alright?

308
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,360
Should be okay.

309
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
- Did you see
- Miss, you...

310
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
a blue purse?

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,680
I didn't see it.

312
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,360
Miss, you're bleeding.

313
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,200
(In the worst case, there could be
a disaster involving bloodshed.)

314
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,200
He was right. I need to find my purse.

315
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,399
- Help!
- Miss.

316
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,960
They don't even take
the wedding gift money and let us in.

317
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,879
Maybe Jianglin doesn't
take the wedding gift money.

318
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,600
A wedding without taking
the money. Seriously?

319
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,960
Who will pay for your wedding?

320
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,000
We need to pay off debts.

321
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,360
Lower your voice.

322
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,559
Welcome to my son's wedding.

323
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,000
Thank you for coming.

324
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,559
Mother, I wonder how many sons
the Lin family has.

325
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,840
Stop dreaming.

326
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,600
Our Lin family is fortunate to have you.

327
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,200
Now whenever I see the pastries,

328
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,600
my heart is pounding severely.

329
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,079
Mother, don't point around.

330
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,680
- Lovers will eventually become married.
- Every table has it.

331
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
Today is my son's wedding.

332
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,960
It's like a fish has found water.

333
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,880
- Why are you eating their food?
- Stop yelling.

334
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,519
It's a match made in heaven.

335
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,839
It's not that I want to eat it.
It melts in my mouth.

336
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,599
What? Put it back here.

337
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,599
Don't use your chopsticks.

338
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,759
It's okay.

339
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
We'll go after he finishes.

340
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,599
If there is any lack of hospitality,
please forgive us.

341
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880
- Great.
- Bravo.

342
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,559
He's done. Let's go.

343
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,319
- The feast begins.
- Mother, wait.

344
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,079
Go. Let's go now.

345
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,319
Give me.

346
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,960
Go, go.

347
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,160
The bleeding will stop.
The purse will be found.

348
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,119
Better than spending
some taels of silver.

349
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
Purse? It's not mine.

350
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,440
Anyone lost a purse?

351
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,920
Did anyone lose a purse? Whose purse?

352
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,160
Anyone lost a purse? Whose purse?

353
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,400
Did anyone lose a purse?

354
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,416
I'll send it to the police.

355
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,920
What are you doing?

356
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,119
I-I-I am looking for the owner.

357
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,079
If I hadn't seen it,
you would have pocketed it.

358
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,319
No, I just shouted.

359
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,160
I asked whose purse it was,
but no one answered me.

360
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,359
If this is your purse,
here, I'll give it back to you.

361
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,839
Well, since you returned it to me,

362
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,920
I won't be against you.

363
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,599
Miss, Miss.

364
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,400
She shouted she found a purse.

365
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,799
Miss, you said you found a purse, right?
A pink one.

366
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,000
It's her. It's her.

367
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,279
Then give me back my purse.

368
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,680
I... The purse was taken by its owner.

369
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,519
It was taken? Really?

370
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,319
I didn't see it.

371
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,112
You...

372
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,640
I... No. He just...

373
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,680
I didn't pick it up, okay?

374
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,240
I saw it with my own eyes just now.

375
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,359
She took the purse.

376
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,359
I... Wait, you just saw it.

377
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,279
- I did pick up a pink purse.
- Alright.

378
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,119
You don't need to say more.
Take her to the police.

379
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,559
Say something if you saw it.

380
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,680
You did see it.

381
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,359
I gave it back to him. It's not me.

382
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,759
I did pick it up, but I didn't know
who it belonged to.

383
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,440
Wait a minute.

384
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,240
(Xishi Fresh Vegetables)
Pak Choi, spinach, Chinese cabbages.

385
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,519
(Lin's Mansion)
Mrs. Qian, please take the gift.

386
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,720
Take care.

387
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,720
Two distinguished guests,
please accept our Lin family's gift.

388
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,920
No, thanks.

389
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,880
What do you mean?

390
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,720
Thank you.

391
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,359
Why do you take it?

392
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
Mother, if you don't take it,
it seems like you're not respecting them.

393
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,440
Thank you.

394
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,119
Fifty taels of congratulatory silver
for the Qian's Mansion.

395
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,519
Mother, it turns out
they don't reject the gift money.

396
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,920
They receive it when we leave.

397
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,279
Young man, come over.

398
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,119
We were just passing by

399
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,359
and somehow we were pushed in.

400
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,240
What's the matter?

401
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,759
They must be freeloaders.

402
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,599
No, no, I-I...

403
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,559
I told him before.

404
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,599
Yes, I told him.

405
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,440
We're not from here,
but then he had someone

406
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,079
take us in. He made a mistake.

407
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,599
Aren't you from the bride's family?

408
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,039
When did I say I was from
the bride's family?

409
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,079
- No.
- Yeah.

410
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,720
Today, our Lin's Mansion
is holding a big event.

411
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,720
And Mr. Lin is a philanthropist.

412
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,880
It's okay to eat and drink a bit.
You could leave now, please.

413
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,519
Let's go, Mother. Let's go.

414
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,839
- No, no, young man.
- Go.

415
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,359
You seem to be a reasonable person.

416
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,640
Let me tell you one more time.

417
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
We really aren't freeloaders.

418
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,960
There really are various people
in this Jianglin City.

419
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,759
Freeloaders, huh?

420
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,920
Who are you talking about?
What are you saying?

421
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,720
- Who are freeloaders?
- What's the matter?

422
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,240
- Master.
- Master.

423
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,640
Mr. Lin. Here's the thing.

424
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,279
My daughter and I were just passing by,

425
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,920
and somehow we got pushed in.

426
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,480
We're really not freeloaders.

427
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,039
- We're wronged.
- It's fine.

428
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,880
Have you done yet? If yes, please go.

429
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,640
- Let's go.
- No.

430
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,920
Mr. Lin, let me explain.

431
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:19,240
Let them go. Why did you let anyone in?

432
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,864
- Sorry, Mr. Lin.
- Sorry, Mr. Lin.

433
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,880
What's going on?

434
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,200
Madam, you've eaten and drunk, so...

435
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,799
I-I haven't eaten or drunk. I...

436
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,720
How many times do I have to tell you?

437
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,240
You! I really can't stand the injustice.

438
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,240
Well, I'll give you fifty wen.

439
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,039
You go explain to Mr. Lin.

440
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,640
Tell him I didn't eat or drink,
but I gave you the gift money.

441
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,039
- Go and explain to him.
- One hundred taels from Zhang's Mansion.

442
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,599
Madam, it's really not necessary.

443
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,759
Fifty wen. It's really not worth it.

444
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,279
Mother.

445
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,839
Sit here and eat openly.

446
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,200
You're not in a hurry
to meet Matchmaker Wu, right?

447
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,720
It's already late for Matchmaker Wu.
We can't lose here.

448
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,119
Mother, what condition are we in?

449
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,720
You give out one guan of money?
[*guan equals to 1000 wen or so]

450
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,759
Chun Jinrong, let me tell you.

451
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,799
You have to chin up.

452
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,119
We just moved to Jianglin.

453
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,799
We can't be poked in the back.

454
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,640
If this trivial thing ruins your reputation
and you can't get married,

455
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,519
that's not a matter of one guan.

456
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,839
I'll apologize to
Matchmaker Wu personally.

457
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,839
Isn't this melt-in-your-mouth?
Melt them all.

458
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,359
If you don't eat, I will.

459
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,359
Oh, my.

460
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,200
It's delicious. Eat up.

461
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,240
People and money are all gone.

462
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,640
What do you mean by it?
There're drumsticks.

463
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:04,000
Dispel disasters, change fortunes,
and make money. Miss, a fortune telling?

464
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,640
Can you lower the price?

465
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,440
Are you okay?

466
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,880
Master, can you tell me
if my disaster is over yet?

467
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,960
Is there any need to resolve it?

468
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,359
Of course, there's a need.
You haven't even started resolving it yet.

469
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,480
Five guan of money.

470
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,599
Why are you raising the price?

471
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,599
You don't understand.
Your bad fortune has already started.

472
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,200
I need more power to help you.

473
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,359
It's reasonable. Just pay it.

474
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:47,200
But I just own...
I still haven't found my purse yet.

475
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,839
I don't want to.

476
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,519
My purse.

477
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,039
You see? I was about to help you resolve

478
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,440
and there was a turn.
Come on. Let me continue to help you.

479
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,880
Well, since there's already
a turn of events,

480
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,400
how about we don't resolve it anymore?

481
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,839
No, no. Listen to me.

482
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,240
Master, I'll come to you if I need you.

483
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,640
- Wait.
- I'm leaving. Thank you.

484
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,880
Listen to me.

485
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,440
You'll have bad luck.

486
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,039
How come I didn't see it?

487
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,680
Brother, we're so unlucky.

488
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,880
It's okay. If we can't roll the dice,
let's do something else.

489
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,440
Well, we are
on our first day in Jianglin City,

490
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,640
but why so unlucky? We just wanted to
earn money by running a stall.

491
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,359
But the heavens
just don't give us a chance.

492
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,680
Yeah, what a lousy place.

493
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,000
Brother, we have to figure it out.

494
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,960
Isn't that what I'm doing?

495
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,960
In my opinion,
wealth is sought amid dangers.

496
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,768
Stop there.

497
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,799
What are you looking at? Robbery.

498
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,519
I just found it back.

499
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
I don't care. Just give me.

500
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,400
No, no! Help, help!

501
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,576
Stop it.

502
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,920
It's inappropriate for you three men
to bully a weak woman, right?

503
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,039
It's you again, isn't it? Not done yet?

504
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,759
It's you again.

505
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,759
Someone is taking my purse.

506
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,160
Don't worry, Miss.
I came down the mountain to uphold justice.

507
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,319
Sword. This sword is from Lu's Manor.

508
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,240
Are you from the Lu's Manor?

509
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,000
What's your relation to
the martial arts alliance leader, Lu Jiang?

510
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,440
I am

511
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,079
Lu Jiang's very son.

512
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,400
Today is also my first time...

513
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
He's fake.

514
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,599
Look at your idiot appearance.
Still pretending to be from Lu's Manor?

515
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,152
I...

516
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,480
Fine. Since you guys
don't take the soft approach,

517
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,519
don't blame me for not being polite.

518
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,640
Take my 72 styles of swordsmanship
from Lu's Manor.

519
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,440
You're killing me.

520
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,799
You're killing me.

521
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,400
This doesn't count. A gust of wind came.

522
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,720
You...

523
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,800
Get him.

524
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,368
Don't hit him.

525
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,176
Stop it. Stop it. Help.

526
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,400
What are you doing?

527
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,799
Help. Stop it.

528
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Bro, use this.

529
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,480
- Brother!
- Brother!

530
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,640
He killed him. He killed him.

531
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,400
- Brother!
- Brother!

532
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,359
- Someone's killed.
- Brother.

533
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,839
No, I-I didn't. It's not me. H-He...

534
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,568
Run.

535
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,000
Brother, wake up.

536
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,400
Is anyone there? Somebody! They ran?

537
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,920
I killed someone. I killed someone.

538
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,640
Hero, don't panic.

539
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,359
Where is this place?

540
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,559
It is my home.

541
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,119
I think I should turn myself in.

542
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,680
I think so too.

543
00:28:04,672 --> 00:28:06,039
Farewell.

544
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:06,920
Wait a moment.

545
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,319
I'll go with you.
You were trying to save me,

546
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,119
and it was me who gave you the stick.

547
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,759
If I go, I will share the punishment.

548
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,319
Miss, you're honorable.

549
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,400
- No, no.
- Let me think about it.

550
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,920
- That's not it.
- Wait. Let me reconsider.

551
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,599
It's my first day off the mountain.
I can't just...

552
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,279
Peilan, help me hide the clothes.

553
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,319
I'll come for them later.

554
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,920
Are you alright, hero?

555
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,160
- I should be okay.
- I...

556
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,119
Well... Don't take it out
to wash or dry.

557
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,720
Hero, you're bleeding.

558
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,960
Let me stop your bleeding.

559
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,160
My little sister will be back soon.

560
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,680
I'll take you to a safer place to hide.
Hurry, this way.

561
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,680
Come on, hero. Follow me. Let's go.

562
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,079
Hurry up. Go, go.

563
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,559
Banxia, look how beautiful the sky is.

564
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,279
Look at that cloud. Those stars.

565
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,160
What stars?

566
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,440
It's a bird.

567
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,440
What are you talking about, Peilan?

568
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,440
What are you doing, Banxia?

569
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,960
The books in the box are all damp.

570
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
I'll take them out to dry.

571
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,759
Are you drying clothes?

572
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
What are you looking at?

573
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,279
Chun Jinrong.
Chun Jinrong, I'm calling you.

574
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Chun Jinrong, what?

575
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,680
Who are you showing
your sulking face to?

576
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,119
I just don't understand
what you are thinking.

577
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,519
Now it's great.
We didn't meet the matchmaker

578
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,200
and we lost one guan of money.

579
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,759
That's because someone insisted on
watching the show there.

580
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,359
Now you're blaming me.

581
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,880
Alright, alright, it's all my fault.

582
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,599
You did nothing wrong, okay?

583
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,119
The whole family
moved to Jianglin for you.

584
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,400
What is it? We spoiled you?

585
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,880
Moving to Jianglin
was all because of me?

586
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,000
Then couldn't the three of them
marry into a better family?

587
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,920
Alright then.
Let's go back to Qing City.

588
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,599
I can't live this life anymore.

589
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,519
Du Ruyu.

590
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,319
Mother, look at you.

591
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:42,839
Don't just keep saying
"Go back to Qing City."

592
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,400
You should be reasonable.

593
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,640
Don't talk to me emotionally.

594
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,960
Stop arguing! If you want to argue,
go back to do it in your room.

595
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
I mean, Mother, go back to rest.

596
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,480
As a mother, I've done
what I should and shouldn't do.

597
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,200
If you can't get married,
it's your own business.

598
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,680
Take some time to think about it.

599
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,759
I'm leaving.

600
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,839
She has got a point?

601
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,720
No. Jinrong, go talk to
Mother a bit more.

602
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,119
I have nothing to say to her.

603
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,000
Jinrong, please say a few words.
I'm begging you.

604
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,759
I really am...

605
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,079
Do you think she's reasonable?

606
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,200
No.

607
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,008
Alright then.

608
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,519
Bro.

609
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,240
Miss, I'll hide here for now.

610
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,416
Okay, okay.

611
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,960
What's wrong, Peilan?

612
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,519
W-W-Why did you come down from above?

613
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,319
Mother's back?

614
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,000
I don't know.

615
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,839
Can you keep the clothes for a few days?

616
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,400
Bro? Bro?

617
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,720
M-My hands are broken.
