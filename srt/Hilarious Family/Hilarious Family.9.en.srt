(Li Tengyun needs to die for his master)

34
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:06,597
It is a bit cold. I need to
remind mother to put on more clothes.

35
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:56,677
Everyone, come have some peaches.

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,117
Mr. Lu.

37
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:00,517
- Peaches?
- Come on.

38
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:02,397
I just washed them. Have one.

39
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:05,397
Eat quickly. Or else,
my mother will find out later.

40
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:08,256
Lu Buping.

41
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:10,557
Mrs. Chun, have a peach.

42
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:14,277
What are you doing here?
Have you swept the yard?

43
00:03:14,797 --> 00:03:15,797
I'll do it now.

44
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,397
Being lazy when there is a chance.

45
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,837
Mother, eat a peach. I just washed them.

Where are the others?

47
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:29,957
They probably didn't hear me.
I'll call them later.

48
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:34,304
Quite sweet.

49
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:38,517
Why are you looking at me?
Do I have something on my face?

50
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,792
No.

Peilan.

00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:47,397
What's wrong, Mother?

53
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,557
Have Chun Jinrong come to me.

54
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:51,598
She wasn't back
until the middle of the night.

55
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:53,478
She is becoming more unreasonable.

56
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:01,797
He kept me waiting inexplicably
till the middle of the night.

57
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:02,957
If he can't come,

58
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:04,677
he should at least explain it.

59
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:07,638
How come Young Lord is so arrogant?

60
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,797
Even if you are pretending
to play hard to get,

61
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:12,598
y-you need to show up at least.

62
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:15,957
Jinrong, Mother needs you.

63
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:17,118
Why?

64
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:19,798
I don't know either.
Maybe about what happened last night.

65
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,558
What's the point in asking about it?

66
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:25,397
Jinrong, you should go.
Otherwise, Mother will get angry again.

67
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:27,917
So annoying.

68
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,717
I washed peaches
and put them in the living room.

69
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,397

70
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:36,896

71
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:43,157
Mr. Lu, Mr. Lu, don't be angry.

72
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,638
Jinrong is not targeting you.

73
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:46,878
Is there anyone else?

74
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:49,157
She...

75
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:50,758
- I just feel that she...
- M-Mr. Lu.

76
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:08,998
Mr. Lu, have a peach.

77
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:18,878
Does it taste good?

78
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:20,096
Yeah.

79
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:25,280
Right.

80
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:33,157
Open it.

81
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:33,998
Okay.

82
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:45,517
Mr. Lu, where did you pick this up?

83
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:48,198
I bought it.

84
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:50,477
I specifically asked Master
to buy it for me.

85
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:53,878
Why did you ask him to buy it?

86
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:55,357
It's your birthday today, isn't it?

87
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,438
I need to give you a gift, anyway.

88
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,277
Mr. Lu.

89
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,717
Why did you know it's my birthday?

90
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,638
I just asked Master.

91
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:15,638
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

92
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:17,318
- You're welcome.
- It's so beautiful.

93
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:24,798
D-Do you like to eat

94
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:26,318
soft peaches or hard ones?

95
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:27,798
I like hard peaches.

96
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,198
Me too.

97
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:30,318
When I was a child,

98
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,517
my father would take me
to the market to buy those

99
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,917
large red peaches every year.

100
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:39,678
When I am rich,
I'll buy you a peach mountain.

101
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:41,998
You can enjoy them
however much you like.

102
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:44,597
That's too much. How wasteful.

103
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:46,798
Take a bite and throw it away.

104
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:49,504
Peilan.

105
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:53,438
Banxia, have a peach.

106
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:57,998
Thanks. By the way, Peilan.

107
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:02,078
I'll get one for Master too.

108
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:06,878
Lu Buping.

109
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:11,957
Can you come to the pharmacy

110
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,438
and dump the medicinal dregs later?

111
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:14,758
Sure.

112
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:19,758
Lu Buping, when talking to others,

113
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:20,837
looking into their eyes

114
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:21,998
is the basic respect.

115
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:23,198
Hasn't anyone taught you this?

116
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:24,837
- Wait, wait.
- Also,

117
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,998
regulate your emotions before you speak.

118
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:28,992
I...

119
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,277
She doesn't know it's your birthday?

120
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:37,998
She spoke to me like that?

121
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,318
Simmer down, Mr. Lu. She's nice.

122
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,957
- Peaches.
- Keling.

123
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:49,198
Peilan, have you heard
that someone stole children

124
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:50,357
near Guantou Temple?

125
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:52,837
No, I haven't.

126
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,998
Once I catch them,
I'll teach them a lesson.

127
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,558
Wait. Can you finish them
as you took so many peaches?

128
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,998
Mother. I'm leaving.

129
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:05,998
Where are you going, Keling?

130
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,680
To study.

131
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:17,536
That girl.

132
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:26,784
She drove me crazy.

133
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:36,957
Have you eaten yet?

134
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:38,880
Not yet.

135
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:43,198
Well, this is for you.

136
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,558
No, thanks. Mr. Lu, you eat it.

137
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:48,837
How about I break it open?

138
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,318
We can share it.

139
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:53,318
It's okay, Mr. Lu.

140
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,717
I don't want to eat it now. You eat it.

141
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:00,158
What family members are they?

142
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:01,717
It is your birthday today,

143
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:02,798
but an extra peach isn't saved.

144
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,518
It's not like that.
They have their own business.

145
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,158
And it's just a birthday.

146
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,158
Not a big deal.

147
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:20,357
Forget it. Have this half.

152

Yes.

153

Young Lord, the men at the gate said,

154
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:06,637
last night Mr. Li was at the gate,

155
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:08,997
calling for you all night
until he lost his voice.

156
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:10,518
Didn't they drive him away?

157
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:13,717
He refused to leave,
saying he must see you one last time.

158
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:15,518
He almost alarmed His Highness.

159
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,798
Li Tengyun.

160
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:24,957
Young Lord, I had previously not
lived up to your expectations.

161
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:27,438
But I guarantee
there won't be a next time.

162
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:30,158
Young Lord, considering my loyalty,

163
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:32,678
please give me one more chance.

164
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:38,757
Are you done? You've seen the last time.

165
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,078
Leave now.

166
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:43,038
Young Lord, you can't leave.

167
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:45,678
Please give me one more chance.

168
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,278
I'll count from three.

00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:49,637

help you deal with Fourth Prince.

172

- So you'll have no worries.
- Two.

173
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:57,438
I'll definitely help
get it done once and for all.

174
00:10:57,477 --> 00:11:01,078

177

I... How about we...

178
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,278
What do you mean? Murder?

179
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:16,918
It's feasible.

180
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:19,757

But you can't...

00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:30,038
Then I ask you how you will kill her?

184
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:34,038
First, we can climb over their wall.

185
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,957
Find Chun Keling's room.

186
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:38,637
Take the chance to kill her
when she's asleep.

187
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:41,117
That simple?

188
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,237
It doesn't seem difficult.

189
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:44,717
Okay, it's that simple, right?

190
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,117
Go ahead. Now go. Do it.

191
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:48,558
No, Young Lord. I didn't mean that.

192
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,477
Don't we have assassins in our mansion?

193
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:55,038
What do you think
our Lord Ling's Mansion is? Assassins?

194
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:56,597
If we don't have any assassins,

195
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:59,038
then we'll have to make long-term plans.

196
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,024
Young Lord.

197
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:11,318
Mr. Li is so resourceful.

198
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,757
You should learn from Mr. Li.

199
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:15,637
- Learn from Mr. Li.
- Learn from Mr. Li.

200
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:16,918
I'm flattered.

201
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:18,357
Mr. Li said,

202
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,637
"Murder is simple."

203
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:22,117
You go and experience it.

204
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:25,597
Anyway, you must
bring back a corpse today.

205
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,237
If it's not Chun Keling's,

206
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,477
then it's Mr. Li's.

207
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:30,798
- Yes.
- Yes.

208
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:31,918
Wait a minute.

209
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:34,877
Young Lord, as specialists
only master their own fields,

210
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:37,798
I'm really not suitable. I...

211
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:41,038
Haven't you always wanted a chance?

212
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:42,117
- I...
- What's more,

213
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:45,757
you can try out your own idea,

214
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:47,477
and see if it works.

215
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,637
If it works, I'll invite you back,

216
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:56,558
and respectfully call you Mr. Li.

217
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,816
I...

218
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:07,837
Peilan.

219
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,198
Mr. Lu.

220
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:10,477
- You bought so much.
- Yeah.

221
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:11,997
- Let me help you.
- Thanks, Mr. Lu.

222
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,877
You're welcome. Give them all to me.

223
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:16,117
It's not my fault.
You are always blaming me.

224
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,038
Jinrong, are you going out?

225
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:22,757
Your older sister is so impolite.

226
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,717
She might not be in a great mood.

227
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:27,398
- Jinrong.
- Xiaoxiao.

228
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:28,637
Let me greet your mother.

229
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:29,678
No need. Let's go.

230
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,278
What's with your dark circles?

231
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:33,518
Don't ask. I'll tell you
in the carriage.

232
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,757
- Banxia.
- Peilan.

233
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:43,597
She is even more outrageous.
You are her elder sister.

234
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:46,158
We are family. I am used to it.

235
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:48,997
Peilan, what are we eating tonight?

236
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:50,278
I've made tofu soup.

237
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,768
Tofu again.

238
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:55,918
Tofu again. She could make it herself.

239
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,918
It's odd for a family
to speak so politely.

240
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,438
Do they consider you
as part of the family?

241
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:03,357
You were carrying so much,
but no one offered to help.

242
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:05,357
They all have their own things to do.

243
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:06,798
Well, caring won't hurt.

244
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,278
Mr. Lu, calm down.

245
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:09,637
I get anxious when you're upset.

246
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:12,558
You... You're the only carefree one.

247
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:14,997
Don't you like to carry? Keep on then.

248
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,696
Like carrying that much.

249
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,456
Give me.

250
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:35,997
(Where am I headed?)

251
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:37,158
(Am I going to kill someone?)

252
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:38,717
(Am I dreaming?)

253
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,837
(I'm shooting myself in the foot.)

254
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:44,078
(Should I run away now?)

255
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,237
Young Lord said if you dare to run,
you will be executed on the spot.

256
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:50,398
Who wants to run away?

257
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:52,160
Move.

258
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,597
- Peilan, are you free now?
-Master.

259
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:02,438
I have a favor to ask.

260
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:03,398
What is it?

261
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:06,038
Sorting out veggies.

262
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:09,597
Never mind. I will do it myself.

263
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:16,398
What are you doing?

264
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:17,717
I am whisking tea, right?

265
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:19,518
Of course not. It's scenting tea.

266
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:21,038
Evenly sprinkle these jasmine flowers

267
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:23,398
on top of the tea leaves.

268
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:26,237
Then mix.

269
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:29,158
Scent for 15 minutes,
then take it out and mix again.

270
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:32,717
And scent for another 15 minutes.
Repeat it nine times. Understand?

271
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:33,717
I got it, Master.

272
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,717
I'll leave it to you. Thank you.

273
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:37,357
No problem.
You can go back to your work.

274
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:50,757
I didn't expect
your Master looks innocent,

275
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,038
but would also boss you around.

276
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,518
Why didn't he ask Banxia to do it?

277
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,518
Banxia has to prepare the medicine.

278
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,344
Is that so?

279
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:05,398
Before preparing the medicine,
she needs to read some books and learn.

280
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:10,637
You're always finding excuses for them.
Let me help you.

281
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:12,918
Okay.

282
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:13,877
How do we do this anyway?

283
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:16,717
Peilan, put aside
the jasmine tea for now.

284
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:18,757
It's fine. I can do it.

285
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,997
No. Can you first help me wash herbs?

286
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:27,357
When washing herbs,
don't soak them too long.

287
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:28,757
Or else, there will be no effect.

288
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:30,678
If not soaked, they won't be clean.

289
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:31,877
Weigh this carefully.

290
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:33,398
- Understood.
- Thank you.

291
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:34,717
It's okay, Master.

292
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,877
Look, no matter how good
you are to them,

293
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:48,597
nobody cares about you.

294
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:50,038
Mr. Lu, please stop it.

295
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:53,757
Today is your birthday.

296
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:55,477
Since you woke up
this morning until now.

297
00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:56,757
they've treated you like that,

298
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:59,237
Mr. Lu, what exactly
do you want me to do?

299
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,477
It's not about what you should do.
Why should they order you around?

300
00:17:02,477 --> 00:17:03,877
Are you their servant?

301
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:06,038
As the saying goes,

302
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:07,798
"Only crying children get candy."

303
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:13,917
I'm not asking you to cry right now.

304
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:15,397
Peilan, Peilan.

305
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:18,718
I am already sad
and you are still criticizing me.

306
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:21,278
I'm sorry. Let me help you.

307
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:24,558
Come on. Don't cry.

308
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,758
I'm so upset.

309
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:28,197
It's okay. It's okay.

310
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:29,728
Lu Buping.

311
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:32,558
What are you doing?

312
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:33,558
I... Well...

313
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:34,798
You bullied Peilan?

314
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:37,197
- No.
- No, Mother. Mr. Lu didn't bully me.

315
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:38,318
Then why are you crying?

316
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,357
I got sand in my eyes.

317
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:41,837
Mr. Lu is helping get rid of it.

318
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:44,597
- That's right.
- Lu Buping, I'm warning you.

319
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:46,558
Don't think you can bully Peilan.

320
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:47,718
I'm watching you.

321
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:51,518
Whoever bullies her will know.

322
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:54,597
Mother, Mr. Lu really didn't bully me.

323
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:57,318
Then what's wrong? Let me tell you.

324
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:59,318
You can't cry on your birthday.
It'll bring bad luck.

325
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:05,837
Mother, do you remember?

326
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:08,197
How could I forget? I gave birth to you.

327
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:12,558
Mother, what do you want to eat?
I'll make it for you.

328
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:13,837
Today is your birthday.

329
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:16,078
You buy whatever you want to eat,
and I'll cook for you.

330
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,637
Let's all have a good meal together.
Make it lively.

331
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:23,718
Lu Buping, don't slack off.

332
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,216
Alright.

333
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:31,798
Mr. Lu. My mother remembered it.

334
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,038
What's so special about that?
She should remember.

335
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:36,677
I need to grab groceries.

336
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:37,917
I'm going to steam rice for Mother.

337
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:39,558
Didn't you buy groceries already?

338
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:41,518
Mother likes chicken.
I'm going to buy one for her.

339
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,558
Near the place where chickens are sold,
there are buns?

340
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:46,117
Yes.

341
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,712
Okay.

342
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:01,558
Let's keep an eye on it here.

343
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:04,278
Observe it for a while.

344
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:05,917
No one should be able to discover us.

345
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:07,837
Mr. Li.

346
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,357
Miss Peilan.

347
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:12,958
What are you doing here?

348
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:16,278
I... Where are you going?

349
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:18,917
It's my birthday today.
I'm going to buy a chicken.

350
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:20,597
Wish you boundless happiness.

351
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:22,157
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

352
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:23,238
Thank you all.

353
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:26,197
Then I'll leave you. Goodbye.

354
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:27,958
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

355
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,078
When will we take action?

356
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:35,958
At night. Who would kill people
in broad daylight?

357
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:41,837
Mr. Li said
we can't kill people during the day.

358
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:43,397
What are you doing?

359
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:45,877
Young Lord asked me
to record everything you do.

360
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:48,038
Let's go. Hurry up.

361
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,958
It's an ominous sign.

362
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:59,718
Mr. Li said, "It's an ominous sign."

363
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:01,558
Why do you record everything?

364
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,418
(Happy Birthday)

365
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:15,597
Clean properly.
It's all dust everywhere.

366
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:18,677
Mother, why didn't you tell me earlier
about Peilan's birthday?

367
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:21,038
I'm all flustered.
My plans are disrupted.

368
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:22,758
It's already good enough I remember it.

369
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:24,798
I have to remember
the birthdays of four of you.

370
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:25,758
But none of you can

371
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,998
remember my birthday.

372
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:29,758
What are your plans?

373
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:34,357
Do you want to
put the word "fortune" in the middle?

374
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,478
Or the word "longevity"?

375
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:40,798
Aren't you highly educated?

376
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,078
Why are you asking me?

377
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:44,157
Fine, just write "longevity."

378
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:48,038
Where's Chun Jinrong?
She rarely stays at home.

379
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:49,078
Everything in the house

380
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:50,518
only needs me to arrange.

381
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,597
On this day of good weather

382
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:55,157
with a happy event, don't quarrel.

383
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:56,357
Just shut up.

384
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:58,798
Wasn't it you who asked Peilan

385
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:00,238
to wash those herbs?

386
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:03,837
The pharmacy is bustling
early in the morning.

387
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,318
I totally forgot.

388
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,758
I tell you.

389
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:08,597
Only I can order my daughters around.

390
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:10,197
Sorry.

391
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:12,637
Peilan, you are back.

392
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:14,278
Peilan, you are back.

393
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:16,318
How do you think our decoration?

394
00:21:16,478 --> 00:21:18,197
You didn't have to
go through all this trouble.

395
00:21:18,238 --> 00:21:20,837
What's the trouble?
I think it's still lacking.

396
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:24,597
Do you think
there are enough lanterns outside?

397
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:25,597
That's enough.

398
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:26,558
Hang up a couple more.

399
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:28,597
It's enough, Mother.

400
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,318
Mother, let me help you.

401
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:38,798
Hang one here.

402
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:42,958
- Come on, I'll do it.
- Here.

403
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,357
Mr. Lu, my mother is cooking for me.

404
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,798
Everyone is busy for me.

405
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:57,998
Do you know there is

406
00:21:57,998 --> 00:21:59,558
something fishy
when things suddenly change?

407
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:01,677
Mr. Lu, you're really
misunderstanding everyone.

408
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,998
Suddenly having a day off,

409
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,357
I'm still not quite used to it.

410
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:13,357
Rest well for the day, alright?

411
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:15,998
I'm going to help my Mother.

412
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:18,208
You.

413
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:20,318
Mother, let me help.

414
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,278
Bring the vegetables over to me.

415
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:23,744
Okay.

416
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:27,917
My birthday is even more boisterous.

417
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,157
Mother, who are we waiting for?

418
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:37,078
There is a mysterious guest today.

419
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:39,478
Mrs. Chun.

420
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:43,278
- Yao Wen, Yao Wu.
- Happy birthday to you, Peilan.

421
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:45,318
- Thank you.
- What brings you here?

422
00:22:45,318 --> 00:22:47,318
Boss asked us to come
and celebrate Peilan's birthday.

423
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:48,518
Which boss?

424
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:50,837
Keling called us
to celebrate Peilan's birthday.

425
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,917
Thank you. Please come in and sit.

426
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:53,958
Okay. Alright. Let's go.

427
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:55,357
Is there anything to eat?

428
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:57,184
Yes.

429
00:22:58,597 --> 00:23:00,238
Mother, let's go in too.

430
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,357
What's the rush?
There are still visitors.

431
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:03,278
More?

432
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:04,278
Hello, Mrs. Chun.

433
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:05,397
A-Si.

434
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:07,117
Happy birthday, Peilan.

435
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:08,837
Thank you, A-Si.

436
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,677
Let's go. Let's go.

437
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:14,718
Mrs. Chun.

438
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:16,518
Xiaoxiao.

439
00:23:16,518 --> 00:23:17,558
Xiaoxiao.

440
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:19,238
We should have invited you home earlier.

441
00:23:19,318 --> 00:23:21,197
Jinrong, why didn't you
bring Xiaoxiao home earlier?

442
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:22,518
Don't be polite.

443
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:23,837
Peilan, rouge.

444
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,437
Rouge?

445
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,437
Happy birthday.

446
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:27,798
Thank you, Xiaoxiao.

447
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,157
How do you know?

448
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,238
Your sister told me.

449
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:31,798
Jinrong.

450
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:34,758
Could I forget? Happy birthday!

451
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:36,397
Alright, please go in.

452
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:40,238
Mother, everyone's here now.

453
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:41,078
Let's go in.

454
00:23:41,238 --> 00:23:43,478
Not everyone's here yet.
What's the rush?

455
00:23:43,518 --> 00:23:44,558
Ruyu.

456
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:48,238
Ms. Zhang. Why did you bring a gift?

457
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:52,157
This is Matchmaker Zhang who I met
at the Marriage Bridge. Greet her.

458
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,357
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

459
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:55,157
- It's Peilan, right?
- Peilan.

460
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:57,078
Peilan looks a lot like you.

461
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:58,278
Like me, right?

462
00:23:58,318 --> 00:23:59,238
A beauty.

463
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,437
A beauty.

464
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:04,038
Xu, you came. Finally.

465
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:07,078
- I miss you so much.
- I miss you too.

466
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:09,758
Happy birthday.

467
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,437
Thank you.

468
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:14,278
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay.

469
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:16,597
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Come on.

470
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:18,357
- Quickly, take this.
- Okay.

471
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:19,718
Congratulations.

472
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:23,197
Please go inside. This way.

473
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:30,038
Thank you. Thank you.

474
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:36,758
Mother. Mother?

475
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,437
Mother. Mother?

476
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,718
Hold on, Mother.

477
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:59,117
Come. All the sisters, here.

478
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:00,518
Let me tell you all.

479
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:03,318
The fish Peilan cooked
is absolutely delicious.

480
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:04,917
I'm going to check on the dishes.

481
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,837
Hurry up.

482
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,597
- Peilan.
- Mother.

483
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:13,597
When will it be ready?

484
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:14,958
It's almost ready, Mother.

485
00:25:15,117 --> 00:25:16,518
Is it time for the toast?

486
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:19,758
No, I mean the fish.

487
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:22,197
Fish? Well...

488
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:23,357
I'll cook it after I finish this.

489
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:24,597
Alright, hurry up then.

490
00:25:24,677 --> 00:25:26,238
I've been praising you to my sisters

491
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:27,837
that your fish is amazing.

492
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:28,758
Alright, Mother.

493
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:31,278
By the way, the wine is running out.

494
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:32,837
You need to go get some more later.

495
00:25:32,877 --> 00:25:34,238
Alright, Mother.

496
00:25:34,238 --> 00:25:35,917
Mrs. Chun.

497
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,318
How could I have forgotten about you?

498
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:39,357
You don't have to go.

499
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:40,597
Make a few more dishes.

500
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:42,038
Lu Buping, you go get the wine.

501
00:25:42,238 --> 00:25:43,357
Quickly, please.

502
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:44,837
I'll go to the front
and greet the guests.

503
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,368
Alright, Mother.

504
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:51,877
This is not a birthday party for you.

505
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:54,917
Why wouldn't it be my birthday party?

506
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:58,637
Clearly they are using your birthday
as an excuse to treat guests.

507
00:25:58,718 --> 00:25:59,837
I thought they had changed.

508
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:05,197
It's okay, Mr. Lu.

509
00:26:05,478 --> 00:26:07,758
Anyway. They're here for my birthday.

510
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:10,677
What are you doing then?

511
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,758
I... I'm fine.

512
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:39,958
Why are you always staring at me?

513
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:42,078
It's been a day.
When are you going to do it?

514
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:44,078
Didn't you hear it's her birthday today?

515
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:46,197
Do you think that's appropriate

516
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:47,518
we commit a crime today?

517
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:49,078
It's not Chun Keling's birthday, anyway.

518
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:51,038
You're not going to kill her.

519
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:52,558
Listen, you'd better not urge me.

520
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:53,718
I'm under great pressure.

521
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:55,038
I don't know what I might do.

522
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:00,278
Mr. Li said
he was under great pressure.

523
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:01,998
Stop taking notes.

524
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,917
If you have time for this,
can't you help me instead?

525
00:27:04,078 --> 00:27:05,558
Young Lord said no help is allowed.

526
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,296
You.

527
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,437
Bro, it's getting dark.

528
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:17,078
They are tired. Why not...

529
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:18,958
Why not take your body back?

530
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:21,998
Why not wait a little longer?

531
00:27:30,478 --> 00:27:32,798
- Take it.
- No, thanks.

532
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:34,437
Why are you being polite with me?

533
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:36,478
This fish is so delicious.
You keep it for yourself.

534
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:37,437
If I want to eat,

535
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:39,157
I can ask Peilan
to make it for me anytime.

536
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:41,078
I not only ate but also took it.

537
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:42,798
What's the big deal?
Aren't we old friends?

538
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:44,038
I'll feel so embarrassed.

539
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:50,837
Chun Peilan, today is your birthday.

540
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:52,558
Your family has treated you like that,

541
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,917
but you don't have a single complaint.

542
00:27:56,238 --> 00:27:57,677
You always make excuses for them.

543
00:27:58,157 --> 00:27:59,917
Is there anyone
who remembers what you have done?

544
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:01,357
When you do all these chores,

545
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:03,478
is there anyone
who comes to help you? Except me.

546
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:07,197
Why are you the only one
who is wronged in this family?

547
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:09,238
Why should the good child
always be bullied?

548
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,597
Mr. Lu, please stop it.

549
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,478
My mother will hear it.

550
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,518
Peilan, I've made up my mind.
I'm going to take you to Dali.

551
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:24,758
Anyway, there will be
no soldiers to catch me.

552
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:27,197
Let's start all over there.

553
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:30,278
Find a hidden place to live a good life.

554
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,998
I never allow you to do
these chores anymore.

555
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:35,958
Will you come with me?

556
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:43,078
Mr. Lu, please stop it.

557
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:46,238
I can't leave my family.

558
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:49,478
Are they your family members?

559
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:53,078
It was you who was yelling out just now.

560
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:54,688
Mother.

561
00:28:57,117 --> 00:29:00,837
Mrs. Chun, I have something to tell you.

562
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:05,216
Say it later. Peilan, come over. Hurry.

563
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:29,357
Chun.

564
00:29:31,078 --> 00:29:35,597
Our Peilan has grown up safely.

565
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:39,038
She remains so capable and sensible.

566
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:42,798
Rest assured.
She takes good care of all of us.

567
00:29:43,318 --> 00:29:44,837
You must continue to bless her,

568
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,597
and also bless our whole family.

569
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:50,176
Mother.

570
00:29:51,078 --> 00:29:55,877
Peilan, in front of your father,

571
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:57,758
I will give this to you today.

572
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:04,318
I can't take it off. Lend me a hand.

573
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:10,758
It's on your wrist now.

574
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:15,157
Mother, isn't this our family heirloom?

575
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,518
This is the treasure
left by your great grandmother.

576
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:19,798
I never took it off

577
00:30:19,877 --> 00:30:21,518
during the hardest time in our family.

578
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:24,597
You need to keep it well.

579
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,718
But my sisters...

580
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:29,238
Don't worry about them.

581
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:31,238
Among the four of you sisters,

582
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:33,837
you are the most gentle one,
with the best temperament.

583
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:36,238
Since childhood, they all knew

584
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:38,278
how to fight for what they wanted.

585
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:42,958
Only you think about helping others.

586
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,157
Okay, Mother.

587
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,798
Being able to be sisters
with you is their luck.

588
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:55,038
Keep it for all of us. We'll be at ease.

589
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:02,478
What I am most worried about is you.

590
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:05,518
You are too kind.

591
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:09,078
I'm really afraid you will be wronged
when you are married.

592
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:13,958
Sometimes I think

593
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:16,998
how great would it be
if you could talk back.

594
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:21,518
Mother, I won't get married.

595
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:25,958
You blamed me
for what I've done today, didn't you?

596
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,288
No.

597
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,558
As you know,
we finally moved to Jianglin.

598
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:33,917
But we have no one to rely on.

599
00:31:34,397 --> 00:31:37,397
It is better to have near neighbors
than distant relatives.

600
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:39,357
It's good for our family to interact

601
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:40,837
more with our neighbors.

602
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:44,478
I am getting older day by day.

603
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:47,357
But I want our house

604
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:48,837
to be lively.

605
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:50,837
But I am incapable.

606
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,038
Thank you for helping me today.
Peilan, you have worked hard.

607
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:00,597
Mother, I'm fine.

608
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:04,597
If there's anything I don't do well,

609
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,478
don't take it to heart.

610
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:09,357
Mother, I understand.

611
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:14,718
I know you understand.
You're my best daughter.

612
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:20,558
I said you couldn't cry today,
but you're crying.

613
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:23,998
I've told you it'll bring bad luck.
Come on. Wipe your tears.

614
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:31,157
I forgot it.

615
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,677
Look.

616
00:32:41,078 --> 00:32:42,837
I bought such nice peaches

617
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,958
at a place far away.

618
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:48,958
Only you can eat them.

619
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:58,048
Mother.

620
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:00,038
Fine.

621
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,078
Stop crying. Stop it.

622
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:05,152
Mother.

623
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,998
Take your time. Don't open your eyes.

624
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:10,238
I dare not open.
Where are we going, Keling?

625
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,278
Almost there.

626
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:15,157
Turn around. When I count to three,
you can open your eyes.

627
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,758
One, two, three.

628
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:22,278
Peilan, this is the birthday present.
A peach tree.

629
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:25,197
Thank you, Keling.

630
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,558
Peilan, I know
every year on your birthday,

631
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:30,318
you would think of
Father giving you peaches.

632
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:33,078
I was young when Father died

633
00:33:33,197 --> 00:33:34,478
and didn't remember much about him.

634
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:37,558
From now on,
when you celebrate your birthday,

635
00:33:37,597 --> 00:33:38,917
I'll give you peaches on behalf of him.

636
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:41,798
My dear sister.

637
00:33:43,677 --> 00:33:45,437
Where did you dig this from?

638
00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:46,798
Did you ask for permission?

639
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,958
It's from A-Si. It's actually his idea.

640
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:52,837
Happy birthday, Peilan.

641
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:54,157
Thank you, A-Si.

642
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:59,278
But I think I need to tell you

643
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:01,558
that this is actually a cherry tree.

644
00:34:03,478 --> 00:34:04,998
Didn't you say it is a peach tree?

645
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,558
I thought it is a peach tree.

646
00:34:07,637 --> 00:34:10,677
No. I also love cherries.

647
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:13,038
It's nice Keling had that intention.

648
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:14,038
Jinrong.

649
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:17,078
Here, this is a sachet from me.

650
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:18,078
Open it and see.

651
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:20,157
Have a look.

652
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:22,078
I embroidered all of this myself.

653
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:24,757
As a girl, you shall
pay attention to makeup.

654
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:26,317
It's expensive.

655
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:28,518
Jinrong, don't waste money on it.

656
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,117
Peilan.

657
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:31,717
Banxia. Master.

658
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:38,478
Peilan, I think
the most precious about a person

659
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:40,438
is not whether he has money
or how much money he has,

660
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,438
but his spiritual world.

661
00:34:42,677 --> 00:34:44,277
So I chose this.

662
00:34:44,277 --> 00:34:45,157
How pretty.

663
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:47,078
Right. When you go out

664
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:48,518
and see flowers and plants you like,

665
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:49,878
you can pick them

666
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,398
and put them on your bedside table.

667
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:52,717
It can enhance your taste.

668
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:54,358
Thank you, Banxia.

669
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:56,478
I happened to need a jar
for growing green onions.

670
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:58,637
Very suitable.

671
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,558
As long as you're happy.

672
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:03,518
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry about this morning.

673
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:05,677
It's nothing, Master. Thank you.

674
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,157
What is inside? Pills?

675
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,637
They can boost your beauty,
and replenish your energy and blood.

676
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:13,958
Guo Zhensheng, are you crazy?

677
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:15,637
Who gives medicine as a birthday gift?

678
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:18,518
No. It's a supplement, not a medicine.

679
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:20,558
What supplement?
I think you have ulterior motives.

680
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:22,157
Wait. How can I have ulterior motives?

681
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:25,197
Mother, I'm really at the age of
needing supplements.

682
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:26,197
Mother, Mother.

683
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:27,398
- How do I explain it?
- Nothing.

684
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:29,078
No. I really like cherries.

685
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,597
Mother. Master. Stop chasing.

686
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:35,918
It's naturally so.
Peilan stays in the kitchen every day.

687
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:39,438
Not a big deal. Stop quarreling, please.

688
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,317
Master. Mother.

689
00:35:41,317 --> 00:35:49,120
(Happy Birthday from Lu Buping, Guo Zhensheng,
Chun Keling, Chun Banxia, Chun Jinrong, Du Ruyu)

690
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,352
♪Passing through the continuous time♪

691
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:54,240
Thank you all.

692
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:57,078
I'm really happy.

693
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:03,013
♪She emerges from all things♪

694
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:07,438
Mr. Lu, have a peach.

695
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:12,998
Mr. Lu, have a peach.

696
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:24,717
Mr. Lu, I'm really thrilled today.

697
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:27,038
You are content with this.

698
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:29,478
Also, I understood one thing.

699
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:31,277
Family members might not always

700
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,398
talk about you,

701
00:36:32,518 --> 00:36:34,157
but they always
keep you in their hearts.

702
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:36,838
This is what they are supposed to do.

703
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:38,358
This is what it means to be a family.

704
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:44,958
Aren't they the earrings I gave you?

705
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:47,637
Yes, I've put them on. Look pretty?

706
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:48,637
I have such a good taste.

707
00:36:56,438 --> 00:37:02,838
About going to Dali,

708
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:06,558
I thought it over carefully.

709
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:11,078
You can consider it.

710
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:18,597
Mr. Lu, now I

711
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:21,398
just hope to take good care
of my family.

712
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:24,038
And I hope you and my family

713
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:26,438
can all stay safe and healthy.

714
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,637
This is my biggest desire now.

715
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:33,504
Pretty good.

716
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:42,838
So, in your heart,
am I considered a family member?

717
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:44,918
Of course.

718
00:37:44,918 --> 00:37:46,560
Really?

719
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:48,597
So what do I rank?

00:37:49,472 --> 00:37:50,958
Second.

721
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:51,878
Second?

722
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:54,717

723
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:56,918
Mother and my sisters

00:37:56,918 --> 00:37:58,438
rank first in my heart.

Ranking second is pretty good.

728
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:11,597
No.

729
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,398
But Master ranks third.
