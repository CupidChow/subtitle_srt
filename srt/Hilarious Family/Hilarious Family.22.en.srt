Boss,

35
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:15,026
how is your date with A-Si going?

36
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:16,387
I didn't go on a date with him!

37
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,227
We already know.

38
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,227
If you want to date A-Si,

39
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:22,186
you can just tell us honestly.

40
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:23,507
Why are you lying to us?

41
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:24,827
He chopped firewood, and I did laundry.

42
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:25,987
We were both exhausted.

43
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:26,906
Right.

44
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:28,746
We understand
the relationship between you two.

45
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:30,987
If you guys want to go out,
we definitely won't disturb you.

46
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:33,626
But instead, you tried to cheat us

47
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:34,906
and did it sneakily.

48
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:36,466
That was really not right.

49
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:37,344
Not right.

50
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,547
Are you blaming me?

51
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,466
If you two weren't here,

52
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,067
saying "eh" and "oh",

53
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:45,347
would I be sneaky?

54
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:47,667
If you had an issue,
why didn't you take it out on us?

55
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,746
Why did you deceive us?

56
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:49,664
Yes.

57
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:59,306
Alright, I apologize.

58
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:01,507
I-I will try not to lie to you guys
in the future.

59
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:02,347
"Try not to"?

60
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:03,827
I apologized.
What else do you want from me?

61
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,706
Then tell us.

62
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:09,146
How are things between you and A-Si?

63
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:11,787
Don't lie.

64
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:14,987
Just so-so.

65
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:15,904
Did you hold hands?

66
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:18,306
D-Did you kiss?

67
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:19,586
No.

68
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:20,547
Be honest.

69
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:22,347
I said no.

70
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,906
Boss, do you like A-Si or not?

71
00:03:28,387 --> 00:03:29,626
Are you thinking of marrying him?

72
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:31,776
Enough.

73
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,387
I said I would tell you.

74
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:34,947
But it doesn't mean
I'll tell you everything.

75
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,787
Boss, just tell us.

76
00:03:36,787 --> 00:03:37,667
We both want to know.

77
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,227
Yes.

78
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,306
Are you looking for a beating?

79
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,547
Huh?

80
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,146
If you want to die...

81
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:44,626
Boss, A-Si is really here.

82
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,360
Keling.

83
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:48,306
Why are you here?

84
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,586
I need to talk to you.

85
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:51,827
Go wait for me in the warehouse.

86
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:53,827
Let's talk outside.

87
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,347
So, what's the matter?

88
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,186
I want to take you
to the Empress Dowager.

89
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:09,466
To the palace?

90
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,626
The Empress Dowager?

91
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:11,987
Are you joking?

92
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:14,906
I'm not joking.

93
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:17,587
Why should I meet her?

94
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:20,347
I told the Empress Dowager about us.

95
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:21,907
I just want to take you to meet her.

96
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,027
When did you tell her?

97
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:25,707
Shouldn't you ask me first

98
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:27,306
if I wanted to go?

99
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:29,347
Don't you want to go?

100
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:31,907
Who would want to go?

101
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,400
Wait.

102
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,027
Is it necessary?

103
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,707
I'm not familiar with them at all.

104
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:41,826
That's because you haven't met them.

105
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:43,547
The Empress Dowager has already agreed.

106
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,027
She's also very curious about you.

107
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:48,347
What's so curious about me?

108
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:50,266
You don't need to be nervous.

109
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:51,826
Let's just go meet her.

110
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:52,746
You should figure out a way

111
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,227
to make her stop being curious about me.

112
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:57,907
That's a bit hard.

113
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,667
Just tell her
that my family doesn't allow me to go.

114
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:03,347
Tell her it's my father.

115
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,667
Your father has been gone
for more than a decade.

116
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:10,987
You really know
how to make trouble for me.

117
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:12,787
Keling,

118
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:15,347
I think it's better if we don't lie.

119
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:16,667
Besides,

120
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,987
it's not that scary, is it?

121
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:20,667
I won't go.

122
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,227
Why won't you go?

123
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,512
Jinrong,

124
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:38,707
you look

125
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:40,987
really pretty today.

126
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:45,107
What's the use of being pretty?

127
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:48,667
Aren't I still an old maid
that no one wants to marry?

128
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:51,008
Jinrong,

129
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:52,547
are you blaming me?

130
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:53,907
Of course not.

131
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:55,826
Really. I'm not blaming anyone now.

132
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:58,506
But I've been trying. I have.

133
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,547
I know.

134
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,746
Just let our relationship

135
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:04,266
last as long as it can.

136
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:05,824
Come on. Let's drink.

137
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,746
Jinrong, don't say that.

138
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,347
You make me seem so useless.

139
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:11,987
You're not giving up, are you?

140
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,467
Why are you so sensitive now?

141
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,147
Of course, I don't mean that.

142
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:19,266
I just have
a more open-minded perspective now.

143
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,066
I'm telling the truth.
After thinking it through,

144
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:23,426
I've found it's quite hard for you too.

145
00:06:23,946 --> 00:06:25,107
People like you

146
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:26,626
lost the right to choose your life

147
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,626
when you were born.

148
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:30,667
No, it's the people in the palace.

149
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,746
I can still make the choice.

150
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,306
I just need to persuade my father.

151
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:35,520
Can you?

152
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:42,907
I definitely can.

153
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:45,107
For you, I will absolutely resist
until the end.

154
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:46,946
I am his biological son.

155
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:47,987
I want to marry you.

156
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,386
If he forces me, I will choose to die.

157
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:50,426
Let's see if he can

158
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:52,227
just watch his own son die.

159
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:55,306
You're a grown-up.

160
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:56,907
Why are you still so immature?

161
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,266
Come on. Let's drink.

162
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:02,946
Cherish the present.

163
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:17,866
I've told you I don't want to go.
I'm not prepared for this.

164
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,227
You don't need to prepare.

165
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:20,587
It's just a simple meeting.

166
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,707
You make it sound simple. It's not.

167
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:25,347
Trust me. It's just a simple meeting.

168
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,787
Let me be honest with you.

169
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:28,866
I have the plague.

170
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,787
You're lying again.

171
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,907
I'm not lying to you.

172
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,587
If this spread to the Empress Dowager,

173
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,866
wouldn't that cause a big mess?

174
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:36,800
Keling, that's enough.

175
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,147
Can you tell me

176
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,107
why you are so unwilling?

177
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:47,826
We will meet her sooner or later.

178
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,587
So, let's meet her later.

179
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,027
But she already knows now.

180
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,107
Then don't let her know.

181
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,186
I'm done talking with you.

182
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:55,616
Keling.

183
00:07:57,347 --> 00:07:58,272
Keling.

184
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,467
I really don't know
what you're running away from.

185
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,066
Can you stop being so annoying?

186
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:03,587
Don't you consider others' feelings

187
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,347
before you do anything?

188
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,667
Boss, just keep arguing.

189
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:09,626
No, stop arguing.

190
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:10,528
What's it to you?

191
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:12,306
Keling, what do you mean?

192
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,987
Do you really care about my identity?

193
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:15,744
Do you know

194
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:16,987
how harsh your words were?

195
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,347
When I first met you,

196
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,386
you were a person
who was fearless of everything.

197
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:23,147
You would never back down

198
00:08:23,147 --> 00:08:24,266
in the face of any problems.

199
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:25,467
Since I was a child,

200
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,707
everything'd been arranged for me.

201
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,746
I never thought about changing anything.

202
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:31,066
Until I met you.

203
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,666
You taught me to express my feelings,

204
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:35,546
to face my own difficulties,

205
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:37,266
and to fight for the happiness I want.

206
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:40,187
I changed because of you.

207
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,048
But what about you?

208
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,546
You are now constantly retreating

209
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:45,467
and avoiding.

210
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,266
I really don't know

211
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:49,587
what happened to you.

212
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:53,987
How can you talk so much at once?

213
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:56,707
Chun Keling, take this seriously.

214
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:00,587
Wait, bro.

215
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:02,786
You suddenly confessed your love to me.

216
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,386
Then you suddenly said
you were a prince.

217
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,146
Now you ask me
to meet the Empress Dowager.

218
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,227
You're sudden about everything.

219
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:08,827
I need some time to accept it, right?

220
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,827
So how long do you need?

221
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:13,827
A few years.

222
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:16,987
To be fair...

223
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:17,920
Get out.

224
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:20,187
Ask someone else about it.

225
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:22,347
Who can accept such a thing
all of a sudden?

226
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:25,376
I can.

227
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,208
Ouch!

228
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,096
Father,

229
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:46,666
I want to take Chun Jinrong as my wife.

230
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:48,467
You must agree,

231
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,467
whether you like it or not.

232
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,707
Young Lord, that's too forceful.

233
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,626
His Highness is likely to be angry.

234
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:58,976
Is that so?

235
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:00,864
Then how about this?

236
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:04,146
Father, I have something
to discuss with you.

237
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,146
Given His Highness' character,

238
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,827
he won't discuss it with you.

239
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:11,827
So, let's just put it this way.

240
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,827
Father, I have something
to inform you of.

241
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,506
What is it that you wish
to inform me of?

242
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:23,067
- Father.
- Your Highness.

243
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:24,626
W-What brings you here?

244
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:26,187
Well,

245
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:28,987
I also have something to inform you.

246
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:33,307
Then, Father, you should speak first.

247
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:35,296
Here's the thing.

248
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:39,307
Yesterday, I entered the palace
to see His Majesty.

249
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:42,626
I heard that the king of Sulala Ghuriyya
wrote to seek a marriage alliance.

250
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:45,347
He has a single daughter, and he wants

251
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:46,906
to choose a son-in-law from our country.

252
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:50,266
It took me a lot of effort

253
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,107
to secure the position

254
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,827
for you.

255
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:56,827
In the next few days,

256
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:58,786
you should not leave the mansion.

257
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:00,467
Stay home and read books.

258
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,707
Cultivate your temperament,

259
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:03,786
and don't stir up trouble.

260
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:05,546
Trouble is a minor matter,

261
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:07,227
but if you disgrace the imperial family,

262
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:09,146
I will not let you off.

263
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:11,347
Father, I won't marry her.

264
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,026
No, I won't go there.

265
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:14,048
Why?

266
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,026
Is the princess not worthy of you?

267
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,146
No, Father.

268
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,626
- I have...
- The decree has been issued.

269
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:20,307
The diplomatic marriage

270
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:22,067
concerns relations
between the two countries.

271
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,666
You'd better be smart about it.

272
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:26,746
This matter is of great importance.

273
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,144
By the way,

274
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,266
you should cut your ties

275
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:33,786
with all those women outside.

276
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:35,840
Father,

277
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:37,506
I'm your son.

278
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:38,786
I'm not a tool.

279
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,026
I'm a real person

280
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:41,266
with feelings.

281
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,906
You can't do this to me.

282
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,786
The imperial family is merciless.

283
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:49,347
You've had no right to talk
about feelings since you were born.

284
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:51,467
Look at yourself.

285
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,506
Since you were young,

286
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,026
all you have done is eat and sleep.

287
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:56,626
What have you done
that I can be proud of?

288
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,626
And you dare
talk about feelings with me?

289
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:00,608
You are right.

290
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,506
I'm useless.

291
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:04,386
But, father,

292
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:08,427
could you consult me on your decisions?

293
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,666
You dare talk back to me, huh?

294
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,707
Yes, I'm talking back.

295
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:15,626
Have you ever treated me as your son
since I was young?

296
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:17,666
When others recall their fathers,

297
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,546
it's all tender love.

298
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,386
And me?

299
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,506
When I think of you,

300
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:21,546
it's

301
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:22,947
just pain.

302
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,187
Why did I have such bad luck

303
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:27,666
to be your son?

304
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,187
How dare you say that?

305
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:30,386
How dare you?

306
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,427
Your Highness, please calm down.

307
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:33,536
Father,

308
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:35,707
I already have the one I love.

309
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:38,227
I will marry no one but her.

310
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,347
How dare you!

311
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:40,707
Your Highness, please calm down.

312
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:41,707
Get lost!

313
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:43,626
I told you before.

314
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,266
If you bring it up again,

315
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:46,626
I won't spare you.

316
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:49,026
And I won't spare that Chun girl either.

317
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:50,427
What has it to do with Jinrong?

318
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:51,707
You can't hurt her.

319
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:52,906
Chun Jinrong, huh?

320
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,427
Alright. If you say one more word,

321
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:56,347
I will have someone

322
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:58,506
take care of her right now.

323
00:12:58,746 --> 00:12:59,146
Father.

324
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,187
Your Highness, please.

325
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,248
Do you want to do it?

326
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,107
No. Your Highness,

327
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:04,666
Young Lord acts like this

328
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:06,546
because he can't bear to leave you.

329
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:07,552
Li Tengyun,

330
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,107
from now on,

331
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,427
keep a close eye on him.

332
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:12,707
If he causes any trouble,

333
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,307
you'll be the first to die.

334
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,448
Yes.

335
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:18,432
It's over.

336
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:20,827
It's over. Jinrong...

337
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:22,386
- Jinrong...
- Young Lord!

338
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:22,947
Young Lord.

339
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:23,347
Jinrong.

340
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:24,546
You need to pull yourself together.

341
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,626
I have always thought
you were a brave person.

342
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:37,187
I was wrong.

343
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:38,506
What A-Si means is

344
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:39,947
that he thinks you've become gentler.

345
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,026
I'll lose my freedom
if I enter the palace.

346
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,506
I'll be like a bird without wings
or a horse with a broken leg.

347
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:46,146
A-Si,

348
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:47,146
what my boss means is

349
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,266
that she wants to keep
some small animals in the palace.

350
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,746
I have been
considering everything for you.

351
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:53,067
Can't you consider me

352
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:54,786
in this matter?

353
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:56,427
Allow me. A-Si means

354
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:57,947
he really cares about all of you.

355
00:13:57,947 --> 00:13:58,816
Shut up!

356
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:00,067
My boss means

357
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:01,187
that all words are in the wine.

358
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:06,506
Fine, I can enter the palace
if you insist.

359
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:07,616
But I have a condition.

360
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:08,746
Boss, just say it.

361
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:10,546
A-Si will agree to any conditions.
Right, A-Si?

362
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,626
You two go with me to become eunuchs.

363
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:14,496
I agree.

364
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,427
That won't do. We can't agree with that.

365
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,546
What kind of condition is this?

366
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:23,906
- Nonsense.
- Think about it.

367
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,427
- Nonsense.
- Think twice.

368
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:26,947
I'm the only one in my family.

369
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,427
Jinrong! Jinrong!

370
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:31,947
Young Lord, what are you doing?

371
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:32,587
Don't be impulsive.

372
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:33,472
I don't care.

373
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,386
I want to elope with Jinrong.
Get out of the way.

374
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:36,288
Young Lord...

375
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:39,744
Hello, guys.

376
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:42,386
Young Lord, what brings you here?

377
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:43,546
The weather is nice today,

378
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:44,506
so I came to take a look.

379
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,026
Where is Jinrong?

380
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:47,546
Jinrong is inside.

381
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:48,906
Okay, I'm going to find her.

382
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,026
You guys go ahead.

383
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:51,786
Don't follow me.

384
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:53,746
Young Lord. Young Lord.

385
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,546
Long time no see.

386
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:06,386
- Yeah.
- Yes, Mr. Li.

387
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,546
H-How are you doing?

388
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:12,427
Q-Quite well.

389
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:14,707
You don't seem busy today.

390
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,786
We just finished the work.

391
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:18,752
Okay.

392
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:25,107
Any plans for the future?

393
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,866
We have discussed it.

394
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:29,906
After a while,

395
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:31,386
I will return to Lu's Manor

396
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,666
and have my father come
to propose marriage for me.

397
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:35,906
If you want to stay in Jianglin,

398
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:37,506
we will rent a shop

399
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,906
and do some small business.

400
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:40,587
If you want to go to Lu's Manor,

401
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:41,666
I'll go with you.

402
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,067
There is less work there,

403
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:44,227
and you can relax a bit.

404
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,146
Let's discuss this later.

405
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:47,587
By the way,

406
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:48,626
on our wedding,

407
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,187
we must invite Mr. Li to have a drink.

408
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:52,307
Also,

409
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,026
if we have a child in the future,

410
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,266
I'll have them learn martial arts
from my father.

411
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:57,386
I don't think so.

412
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:58,467
It's too dangerous.

413
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,107
Then let him
learn medical skills from Master.

414
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:00,786
That's a good idea.

415
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:01,746
Right?

416
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:03,347
- I'll let him...
- Enough. Enough.

417
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:05,707
You guys go ahead and chat.

418
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,187
I'm going to check on Young Lord.

419
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:09,067
Learn it in the morning.

420
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:11,026
You want them to learn two things?

421
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:12,026
Of course.

422
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:12,467
A boy?

423
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:13,026
You two...

424
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:14,146
We should have two children.

425
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:14,987
You must do well.

426
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:15,827
- Two children?
- Yes.

427
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,227
- Be happy.
- One can learn martial arts,

428
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,386
and the other can learn medicine.

429
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,707
Two children will be hard for you.

430
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:21,187
It's okay.

431
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,176
It will be hard for me too.

432
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:23,386
Okay.

433
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:32,746
Young Lord,

434
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:35,187
I really can't go with you.

435
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:37,307
If we leave,

436
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:38,906
what will happen to my family?

437
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:42,506
Jinrong, I'm sorry.

438
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:44,666
I really have no other way.

439
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,266
Being the Young Lord,

440
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,947
I am so useless.

441
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:51,827
Why?

442
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,467
Why is it you
who have to marry that princess?

443
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,587
Why couldn't it be your brother?

444
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:01,504
Right.

445
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:03,427
He is a prince. He must have a way.

446
00:17:04,227 --> 00:17:05,467
He is a prince?

447
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:06,432
Right.

448
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:07,826
I will go find him now.

449
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,106
I will ask him to beg His Majesty
to retract the decree.

450
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,627
- His Majesty.
- Young Lord. Young Lord.

451
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:13,627
- What?
- Young Lord, don't be impulsive.

452
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,506
The decree has been issued
by His Majesty.

453
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:16,427
Even your father

454
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:17,586
can't turn it down.

455
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,907
Let alone Fourth Prince.

456
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:21,066
Letting Fourth Prince
enrage His Majesty at this time

457
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:22,746
will place him in a dilemma.

458
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:23,987
I have to try.

459
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:24,987
No, absolutely not.

460
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:27,187
Young Lord, calm down.

461
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:30,586
Li Tengyun is right.

462
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,586
We can't be impulsive.

463
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:33,746
We are not children anymore.

464
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:36,546
We all know what we are carrying.

465
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:38,746
We have already tried our best.

466
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,066
There is nothing more we can do.

467
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,712
Young Lord,

468
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:45,627
forget about me

469
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:48,187
and marry the princess.

470
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:53,248
Jinrong,

471
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,467
if I could choose,

472
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:00,707
I would rather not be the Young Lord.

473
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:05,187
I just want us to be an ordinary couple.

474
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:09,187
If only you were not the Young Lord.

475
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,266
Daily necessities!
Everything you need is here.

476
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:28,947
Daily necessities!

477
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:31,627
Get me one of these.

478
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:32,707
Alright, take your time.

479
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:35,424
Keling,

480
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,586
if you are really unwilling,

481
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:41,346
I will go tell the Empress Dowager.

482
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:46,336
(Yuelai Inn)

483
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:49,427
Wait a minute.

484
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,306
If you tell the Empress Dowager,

485
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:53,826
she will think I don't like you.

486
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,627
What if she gets angry
and has me arrested?

487
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:56,672
She won't.

488
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:58,147
She's not that kind of person.

489
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,066
Even if she's okay with that,

490
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:00,928
my mother...

491
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,266
How do I tell my mother?

492
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,106
Are you afraid
of your mother knowing about us,

493
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:06,707
or the Empress Dowager?

494
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:08,746
I'm afraid of both.

495
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:13,867
If I hadn't beaten the Young Lord,

496
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,266
I wouldn't have gone to Yuanyang Temple

497
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,786
and met you.

498
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,586
There would be no problem now.

499
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,586
I could be free and unfettered.

500
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:31,776
I'm sorry.

501
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,746
Can't you see?

502
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:44,746
If I enter the palace with you,

503
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,266
I will be locked up every day.

504
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:48,707
Can I still be free?

505
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,147
I don't know.

506
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:55,147
But I will try to let you be free.

507
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:05,147
Do I have to marry you

508
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:06,266
if I meet the Empress Dowager?

509
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,266
It's not as serious as you think.

510
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,187
She just wants to see you.

511
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:11,616
As for...

512
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,346
As for us getting married,

513
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:15,947
we can select a date first,

514
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:17,826
like a year later.

515
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,346
Do I have to go into the palace
after a year?

516
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:23,066
Are you afraid of entering the palace,

517
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,346
or are you afraid of getting married?

518
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:26,467
I'm afraid of both.

519
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:28,586
How did I become like this,

520
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:29,667
afraid of everything?

521
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:39,066
How about

522
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:40,947
we find a place you like?

523
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:42,867
When the time comes,
I will ask my father

524
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,187
to make me a lord.

525
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,376
And we'll go to that place.

526
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:50,066
Won't you take the throne?

527
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:53,147
Actually, I never thought
about taking the throne.

528
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:54,907
I feel like I don't know anything.

529
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,066
Instead, being with you

530
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:58,306
and living freely and easily

531
00:20:58,627 --> 00:20:59,627
are what I want.

532
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:15,424
What?

533
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:16,987
Did I say something wrong again?

534
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,907
Darn it.

535
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:26,106
You should tell my mother
about my entering the palace.

536
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,586
Alright, I'll tell her.

537
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:44,427
Let me help.

538
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,480
Let's eat.

539
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:53,867
Where is Jinrong?

540
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:54,746
Call her for dinner.

541
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,506
She said she was tired
and wanted to take a nap.

542
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,746
Sleeping at such an early hour?

543
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:00,546
I'll go check on her.

544
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:01,546
Just let her sleep.

545
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:03,707
Good sleep
allows for beauty rejuvenation.

546
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:04,907
Besides,

547
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:06,707
A-Si is here.

548
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:09,987
Alright. Let's eat.

549
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:10,848
Come on.

550
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:11,987
Save some for Jinrong?

551
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:13,106
- Of course.
- Let's eat.

552
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,656
The cooking is excellent.

553
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:16,427
(Keling, can I say it?)

554
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,907
(Just say it.
Why are you looking at me?)

555
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:22,816
Mrs. Chun,

556
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:24,506
there's something
I would like to tell you.

557
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,907
A-Si, you don't need to be so formal.

558
00:22:26,987 --> 00:22:28,427
Just say whatever you want to say.

559
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:32,346
Keling and I are together now.

560
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,026
Aren't...

561
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:39,826
Aren't you two together all the time?

562
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:41,506
What do you think they are?

563
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:42,867
He treats her like a bother,

564
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,586
and she treats him like a sister?

565
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:46,707
That's not the case.

566
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:49,344
You like Keling?

567
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:50,786
Mr. Lu, don't speak nonsense.

568
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,506
They are good friends.

569
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:54,346
So let me confirm.

570
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:55,467
By "being together",

571
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:57,586
are you talking about
a romantic relationship?

572
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:00,480
I'm leaving.

573
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:03,328
Yes.

574
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,546
It's good you two like each other.

575
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:12,867
I've noticed something going on
between you two for a long time.

576
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:15,546
Mr. Lu, Mr. Lu,

577
00:23:15,546 --> 00:23:16,707
just be quiet.

578
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:19,227
What Mr. Lu means is
that he wishes you happiness.

579
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:21,867
Looking at the state of you two,

580
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,346
you have been together
for a long time, huh?

581
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:26,667
Hurry up and eat.

582
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:28,947
Banxia, stop laughing.

583
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:30,346
Keling is shy.

584
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:31,427
Look at them.

585
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:32,786
When are you two going public?

586
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,147
Let's eat.

587
00:23:43,147 --> 00:23:45,387
Have you two decided?

588
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:46,867
We have.

589
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,066
What's the attitude of His Highness?

590
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:50,746
Speaking of which,

591
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,227
I owe you an apology.

592
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,746
Actually, I am a prince,

593
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:56,746
and my father is the emperor.

594
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,467
I want to take Keling into the palace
to meet the Empress Dowager.

595
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:12,467
The emperor you're referring to is...

596
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:14,506
our emperor?

597
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:18,826
And meeting the Empress Dowager is...

598
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:20,667
For what?

599
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,987
I want the Empress Dowager
to approve our marriage.

600
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:28,627
But that doesn't mean
we're going to finalize it.

601
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:31,987
Regarding this, we mainly need
to see what you think, mother.

602
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:43,227
L-Let's eat first.

603
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:46,746
Yes, let's eat first.

604
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,187
Peilan's cooking
is really worth praising.

605
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,227
Come on.

606
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:53,826
I-I can't even pick up the food.

607
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:55,264
I'll eat some radish.

608
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,026
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

609
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:05,867
You took great credit
for this marriage alliance.

610
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:09,707
His Majesty has granted you the title
of Commander in Chief of Lingxiao.

611
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,987
Get ready,

612
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:13,947
and later on...

613
00:25:16,987 --> 00:25:19,106
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

614
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,746
Do you know how good this is?

615
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:28,586
Are you really going to
give up your future

616
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:29,907
for a woman?

617
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:36,187
Look at how useless you are.

618
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:37,867
Tell you what,

619
00:25:38,026 --> 00:25:39,586
you were nothing to begin with.

620
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,066
Your current prospects

621
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,066
are all rewards for you.

622
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:45,826
Don't be ungrateful.

623
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:50,176
Yes,

624
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:53,627
I'm ungrateful.

625
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:57,106
I've been unlearned since I was a child.

626
00:25:57,707 --> 00:26:00,147
In your eyes, I'm nothing but a waste.

627
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:02,707
But don't worry about it.

628
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,667
This time, I won't disgrace you.

629
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:07,667
I will act
according to your expectations.

630
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:08,947
I will marry the princess

631
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:10,867
and give you the result you want.

632
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:12,987
But I beg you for one thing.

633
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,266
Do not harm Jinrong and her family.

634
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,266
You're angry at me,

635
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:21,427
and I know that.

636
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:24,227
But we are family, after all.

637
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:26,147
I don't want you to leave either.

638
00:26:27,707 --> 00:26:28,672
Family?

639
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:33,568
Father,

640
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:35,667
tell you what,

641
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:38,707
I envy Jinrong and her family a lot.

642
00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:40,947
They are the real family.

643
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:42,880
Yes.

644
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,187
They might have their squabbles
now and then,

645
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:48,266
but they truly care for each other.

646
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:50,944
And more importantly,

647
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:53,867
they have a mother.

648
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:01,707
I miss my mother.

649
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:13,024
My son,

650
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:16,227
all parents in this world
want their children to do well.

651
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,187
I scolded and smacked you
since you were a child

652
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:22,627
simply because I wanted you to improve.

653
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:25,506
But it seems now

654
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,627
that I was wrong.

655
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:36,907
But, son, do you know?

656
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:39,586
In recent years,

657
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:42,467
I have lost my standing

658
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,987
in front of His Majesty.

659
00:27:44,826 --> 00:27:46,546
Serving the emperor
is like accompanying a tiger.

660
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,106
Every time I face His Majesty,

661
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,387
I feel like I'm walking on thin ice.

662
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:54,106
If one day I am gone,

663
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:56,427
who will protect you?

664
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:02,707
We were born in an imperial family,

665
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:05,506
and there is too much we can't control.

666
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:08,147
If there is a next life,

667
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:09,907
I hope to be

668
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:12,987
an ordinary father and son with you.

669
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:17,504
Father,

670
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:19,586
in the next life,

671
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:22,066
will you accept Jinrong?

672
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,947
If there really is a next life,

673
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:28,427
you can marry anyone you like.

674
00:28:30,947 --> 00:28:32,467
Father!

675
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,586
Son!

676
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:39,147
I am the one to blame.

677
00:28:39,147 --> 00:28:40,746
No, you aren't.

678
00:28:40,746 --> 00:28:42,907
- It's all my fault.
- No, it's not.

679
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:43,826
It's all my fault!

680
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:46,546
You don't know what happened.

681
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:50,187
I shouldn't have had that drink.

682
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,187
That day,
His Majesty and I were both drunk.

683
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,907
When he started complimenting me,

684
00:28:58,066 --> 00:28:59,506
I got swept away.

685
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:00,907
And then he said

686
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,786
there was a great reward for me,

687
00:29:02,786 --> 00:29:05,346
saying he would give me a princess
as my daughter-in-law.

688
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:09,147
I didn't know he was talking about
the princess of Sulala Ghuriyya.

689
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:11,387
I agreed since I was drunk.

690
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:13,987
Only after I sobered up did I realize

691
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:17,066
that he didn't want
his own son to marry her.

692
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:19,066
That's why he chose you.

693
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:22,106
Now

694
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:23,746
it's too late for regrets.

695
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:25,467
The decree has been issued.

696
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:28,026
What am I supposed to do?

697
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,227
Father, you...

698
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,746
It's all your fault!
It's all your fault!

699
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:35,627
It's all my fault! It's all my fault!

700
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,016
I'll go.

701
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:40,467
Go get lost.

702
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,168
What do you mean?

703
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:46,176
Your Highness,

704
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,520
Young Lord,

705
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:51,026
I used to be

706
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:52,187
a street-side trickster.

707
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:54,346
I lived like an ant for half my life

708
00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:56,266
until I met Young Lord.

709
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,786
Your acknowledgement of me

710
00:29:58,786 --> 00:30:00,506
gave me another chance to live.

711
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:03,147
Later, I came here.

712
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:04,667
Both of you

713
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:06,667
treated me like real family.

714
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:09,627
I also want to do something for you.

715
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:11,786
This time,

716
00:30:11,786 --> 00:30:14,746
if I can help you out of trouble,

717
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:16,947
it would also be my honor.

718
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,000
Moreover,

719
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:25,746
I have long wanted to leave Jianglin,
this place of heartbreak.

720
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:33,947
So, Your Highness, Young Lord,

721
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,227
let me go.

722
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,867
I'll marry the princess.

723
00:30:37,746 --> 00:30:39,427
Li Tengyun, are you out of your mind?

724
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,987
Young Lord, I have once
impersonated Fourth Prince.

725
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:43,467
I can also impersonate you.

726
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:47,026
It seems like His Majesty didn't say

727
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,707
which son of mine should go.

728
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:50,464
What do you mean?

729
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:52,907
Do you have other sons

730
00:30:52,987 --> 00:30:54,187
other than me?

731
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:55,136
Get lost.

732
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:56,512
Li Tengyun,

733
00:30:57,346 --> 00:30:58,867
I'll adopt you as my godson today.

734
00:30:59,026 --> 00:30:59,987
What do you say?

735
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:03,066
I'd love that, Your Highness.

736
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,026
Why are you still
calling me "Your Highness"?

737
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:07,456
Father?

738
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:09,408
Godfather.

739
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:11,707
Godfather.

740
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:14,266
Brother!

741
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:15,232
Brother!

742
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,947
Son!

743
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:57,856
I...

744
00:31:58,147 --> 00:31:59,467
Well,

745
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:01,907
everyone has their own destiny.

746
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:05,746
Keling, you really make me proud.

747
00:32:06,346 --> 00:32:07,586
And you bring honor to our family.

748
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:09,506
Thank you, Jinrong.

749
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:11,066
By the way,

750
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:12,066
wait for me for a moment.

751
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:12,987
Just a moment.

752
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:16,667
Peilan.

753
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:20,667
Keling,

754
00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:23,826
you must take good care of yourself.

755
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:25,746
Remember to come home often,

756
00:32:25,826 --> 00:32:27,147
and don't forget about us.

757
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,667
It's not decided yet.

758
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:32,427
Don't...

759
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:33,280
Keling.

760
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:34,944
Here.

761
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:36,467
I have some documents here.

762
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:38,467
After you enter the palace,
give them to A-Si's father.

763
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:39,746
What are they?

764
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:42,746
It's my thoughts on the reform
of the imperial examination system.

765
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:46,546
Come on, Keling,

766
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:48,640
put these all on.

767
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:49,280
What?

768
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,066
Let the Empress Dowager see

769
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:52,707
that our family is very presentable too.

770
00:32:57,746 --> 00:32:58,656
A-Si.

771
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:01,746
You won't mind
if I call you that, will you?

772
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:03,147
No. It's okay.

773
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:04,746
I knew it.

774
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:06,227
I knew you weren't ordinary
from the start.

775
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:07,106
Your Highness,

776
00:33:07,106 --> 00:33:08,826
we had some misunderstandings before.

777
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:10,746
Mr. Lu, are you still blaming me?

778
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:12,227
No, not at all. How could I?

779
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:13,586
We are family now.

780
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:15,746
The Imperial Hospital
has many good prescriptions.

781
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:16,947
Could you steal...

782
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:18,667
Get a few of them for me?

783
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:19,786
I can take you in.

784
00:33:19,786 --> 00:33:21,907
How do you and Keling know each other?

785
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:23,667
I just happened to meet her.

786
00:33:24,147 --> 00:33:26,467
You'll invite me
to you and Keling's wedding, right?

787
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:27,546
When are you getting married?

788
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:28,627
What is your wedding plan?

789
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:29,867
I know there will be a lot of guests.

790
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:35,427
All of you, go out for a moment.

791
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:37,627
I want to have a word with A-Si.

792
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,187
Okay.

793
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:40,586
We'll talk later.

794
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:41,667
Sit down.

795
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:42,624
Be at ease.

796
00:33:46,427 --> 00:33:47,546
Putting aside his identity,

797
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:49,227
he's still outstanding.

798
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,227
A-Si, sit.

799
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,346
A-Si, how old are you?

800
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:07,346
I'm 20.

801
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:09,706
You are old enough.

802
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,706
Then I will be honest with you.

803
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:22,106
I disagree with your marriage to Keling.

804
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:25,666
Thank you for your love for Keling.

805
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:28,827
We are an ordinary family.

806
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:31,706
Perhaps you are momentarily infatuated,

807
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:33,586
feeling like you can't be
without each other.

808
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:37,387
But you two have grown up
in completely different environments.

809
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:38,907
With the passing of time

810
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,506
and the wearing off of novelty,

811
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:44,146
you'll have to face the reality of life.

812
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,987
Then, would it be you giving way to her,

813
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:48,546
or she giving way to you?

814
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:51,827
Mrs. Chun, I...

815
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:54,267
A-Si, have you considered

816
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:56,827
how Keling can cope
with life in the palace?

817
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:59,787
She's someone who dislikes trouble,

818
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:02,987
restrictions, and rules.

819
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:06,787
I don't know
what life in the palace is like.

820
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:09,506
But I think the palace rules

821
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:11,947
won't allow her
to act recklessly, right?

822
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:15,787
Have you ever thought about

823
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,506
what Keling will encounter?

824
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:21,226
You may be able to have Keling,

825
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:23,008
but

826
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:26,307
Keling may lose her happiness
from then on.

827
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:29,066
Is that what you want?

828
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:31,307
A-Si,

829
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:33,867
you are a prince.

830
00:35:34,186 --> 00:35:35,427
You're noble in status.

831
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,907
You probably can't have a say

832
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,827
in many things, right?

833
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:43,947
Can you be the master
of your own marriage?

834
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:47,747
I don't want to see both of you

835
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:49,747
end up in vain joy.

836
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:53,267
Furthermore,

837
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,066
Keling

838
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:57,706
is my youngest daughter.

839
00:35:58,586 --> 00:36:00,066
Her father died a few years

840
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:01,546
after she was born.

841
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:03,827
Since she was little,

842
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:05,867
she has always been by my side.

843
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:11,546
I can't bear to let her go.

844
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:20,096
Mrs. Chun,

845
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:22,747
I'm sorry.

846
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,586
Even if you say so,

847
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:28,026
I will not give up on Keling.

848
00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:30,267
Do you know?

849
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:33,066
One day,

850
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:34,787
at the break of dawn,

851
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:36,787
I woke up in the palace.

852
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:39,987
I anticipated the potential hardships

853
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:42,026
in our future together,

854
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:45,546
but I was surprisingly calm.

855
00:36:46,347 --> 00:36:47,867
You might not believe me,

856
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:50,186
but this is the first time in my life

857
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:52,226
that I've been
so dedicated to something.

858
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:54,624
Mrs. Chun,

859
00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:57,907
if I could be with Keling,

860
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:00,267
it would be my fortune.

861
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,586
If I couldn't,

862
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,827
that would be my fate.

863
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:07,307
But I will surely strive for it.

864
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:09,546
After all,

865
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:11,546
if I'm going to give up,
I want to be utterly convinced.

866
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:13,267
A-Si.

867
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:14,186
Mrs. Chun,

868
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,546
I don't want to lose sleep

869
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:19,586
many years from now

870
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,387
over my own timidity and compromise.

871
00:37:22,947 --> 00:37:23,867
So,

872
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,546
I hope you can give me an opportunity.

873
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:29,827
An opportunity to live up to Keling,

874
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:31,747
to myself,

875
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,626
and to our love.
