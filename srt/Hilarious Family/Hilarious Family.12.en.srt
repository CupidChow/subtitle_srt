00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:57,978
(Young Lord's Mansion)

35
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,070
Miss Peilan, you're awake.

36
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:22,871
Who are you?

37
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,671
We're here to serve you.

38
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:27,151
There's no need.

39
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,871
I can take care of myself. I'm fine.

40
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,671
I can dress myself.

41
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,551
Miss Peilan, please.

42
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,271
Miss Peilan,
this is for rinsing your mouth.

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,831
This is the one for drinking.

44
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:46,688
Okay.

45
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,910
Miss Peilan, you're not supposed
to swallow it.

46
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,231
Am I going to be okay?

47
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,190
Miss Peilan.

48
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,431
- Please let us help.
- Please let us help.

49
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:01,030
That's unnecessary.
I can really do it myself.

50
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,510
Miss Peilan, please stretch your arm.

51
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,470
Help! Help!

52
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,510
So majestic!

53
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,831
This mansion really has something.

54
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,590
Isn't that the Cross Swordplay
from the Majestic Escort Agency?

55
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,271
Sir.

56
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:37,510
Young master, what can I do for you?

57
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,510
You look like a trained fighter.

58
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,831
Are you up early to practice?

59
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,910
I'm sweeping the floor.

60
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,910
To be honest,
I'm also from a martial arts family.

61
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,630
I know a thing or two about swordplay.

62
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,630
You must be
from the Majestic Escort Agency.

63
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,391
Don't worry. I will keep your secret.

64
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,951
Just now, your two contrary moves

65
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,630
symbolized yin and yang.

66
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,910
If I'm not mistaken,

67
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,630
that's the Cross Swordplay.

68
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,510
My contrary moves were just
to prevent dust from flying up.

69
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:12,231
Don't lie to me.

70
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:15,111
Judging by your strong arms
and firm lower part of the body,

71
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,351
you're definitely
not as simple as a servant.

72
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,791
Young master,
if my arms weren't strong enough

73
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,111
or the lower part of my body was weak,

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,190
I wouldn't be qualified
to sweep the floor in the mansion.

75
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,510
In this case, I will use my Lu Swordplay

76
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:30,750
against your Cross Swordplay.

77
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:33,190
Let's exchange some moves.

78
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,871
Young master, what are you doing?

79
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,270
I'm not what you think I am.

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,911
Hurry up. Raise your hand.

81
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,070
Come on. Bring it on.

82
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,150
I can go grocery shopping myself. Stop.

83
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,710
Miss Peilan, just let us

84
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,031
handle the grocery shopping.

85
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,911
You are the mistress. You should rest.

86
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:48,950
No, I'm the one who knows
what they like to eat.

87
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:50,510
Miss Peilan, you can rest assured.

88
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,431
Our food arrangements

89
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,390
are all according to

90
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,510
Hanlin Academy's health guide.

91
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,591
If you want to eat something,

92
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,630
- just tell us.
- No, no, no.

93
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,830
We'll prepare it for you.

94
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,560
I...

95
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,911
Peilan, who hired all these servants?

96
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,111
They all seem exceptionally capable.

97
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,830
Look. These two maids'
lightness skills are at least

98
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:16,390
five years old.

99
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,750
They are all servants
of the Young Lord's Mansion.

100
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,270
It is really a place
full of hidden talents.

101
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,270
Before I came down the mountain,
I wanted a hermitage to be my master.

102
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,710
I didn't expect

103
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,390
that I would find them effortlessly.

104
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,471
They do all the work.

105
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:35,750
What should we do?

106
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,111
I must pick up my fundamental skills.

107
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,591
I will do some squatting.

108
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:56,830
Why does it feel a bit unreal?

109
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,648
Mrs. Chun.

110
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,630
You have woken up.

111
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:11,911
Who are you?

112
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,471
I'm Xin, the steward of the mansion.

113
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,591
Hello, Mr. Xin. Do you need something?

114
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,031
I do not need anything.

115
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,871
I just came to pay my respects to you.

116
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,111
Your food, clothing, accommodation

117
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:27,031
and transportation
are all our responsibility.

118
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:29,431
If you need anything, you can find me.

119
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,231
That's fine.
We are just staying temporarily.

120
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,390
We will leave in a few days.

121
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:35,471
Mother! Mother!

122
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:39,471
Look at you.

123
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,710
Mr. Xin.

124
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,190
Mother.

125
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,431
Do you need anything else?

126
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:46,390
What would you like for breakfast?

127
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,710
I will tell the kitchen to prepare.

128
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,471
You don't have to.
I will let Peilan prepare it.

129
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:52,471
How can we let Miss Peilan cook?

130
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,471
Indeed, mom. What are the options?

131
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:55,591
Miss Jinrong,

132
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,390
there are four types of main foods:

133
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,070
noodles, pancakes, rice, and porridge.

134
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,710
Meat includes chicken, duck,
beef, mutton, fish, shrimp, and crab.

135
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,830
A total of 36 varieties

136
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,750
of birds and beasts are available
for selection. As for vegetables...

137
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,351
Alright, stop.
Just prepare the breakfast in your way.

138
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,112
Yes.

139
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,710
Jinrong, what are you doing?

140
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,591
Are you really letting him
prepare breakfast for you?

141
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,630
What's wrong with that?

142
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,750
Mother, we're already here.
Just make ourselves at home.

143
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,471
Aren't you being a bit too comfortable?

144
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,630
They're just lending us the place
to stay temporarily.

145
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,270
It's inappropriate for you
to boss their servants around like this.

146
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:31,031
Anyway, I'm definitely going to
lead such a life in the future.

147
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,830
Don't I need to adapt in advance?

148
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,911
Where did you get these clothes?

149
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:37,630
There are so many
beautiful clothes in my room.

150
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,830
And there is jewelry too.
Look, I can't even wear all of them.

151
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:42,390
Hurry and return the jewelry.

152
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:43,911
Don't touch other people's stuff.

153
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:44,871
I won't.

154
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:48,150
I think you are a dog who has
leaped up to the clouds, aiming so high.

155
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,431
Who are you calling a dog?

156
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:51,150
You.

157
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,630
Do you think the Young Lord let us stay

158
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,390
because he's up to something?

159
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:58,471
Mother, stop guessing his intentions.

160
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:01,671
I know all about his little games.

161
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,471
Mr. Lu.

162
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,270
- Peilan, what are you doing?
- I'm going to cook.

163
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,471
Many people are already on it.
You should rest.

164
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:13,750
I can't keep idle all the time.
I'm going.

165
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,830
Who are you?

166
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,871
I'm here to cook.

167
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,791
Are you new?
Has Mr. Xin taught you the rules?

168
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,150
No, I'm here
to make breakfast for my mother.

169
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:36,030
Oh, you're Miss Peilan.

170
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,231
Wait a moment.
Breakfast will be ready soon.

171
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:42,270
My mother only eats the food I cook.

172
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,224
What?

173
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:47,831
I said that my mother
only eats the food I cook.

174
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:56,191
I mean, my mother
is picky with her food.

175
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:57,790
If it's not cooked by me,
she won't like it.

176
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,910
Since the madam is picky,

177
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:06,750
I have to personally cook.

178
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,150
Who are you?

179
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,750
Miss Peilan, this is my master.

180
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:14,231
He used to be
a royal cook in the palace.

181
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,991
You are lucky
that you could have him cook.

182
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:19,430
No, it's fine. I'll cook myself.

183
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,231
You cook yours, and I cook mine.

184
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,871
Wait and see if my cooking skills

185
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,111
can meet your demands.

186
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:55,111
Miss Peilan, what are you going to cook?

187
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:58,951
Do we have wax gourd, cabbage, and eggs?

188
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,711
Yes, I will prepare them for you.

189
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,591
This is really a feast.

190
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:09,111
What is this?

191
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:11,871
This dish is orange-peel chicken.

192
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:14,711
It is known for being clear, fresh,
refreshing, tender, and smooth.

193
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,150
Please try it, Miss Keling.

194
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:25,351
It's even better than what they serve
at the Spring River Restaurant.

195
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,510
To be honest, Miss Keling,

196
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,471
the chefs there

197
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,231
were the ones weeded out of our mansion.

198
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:31,550
So you have been to that restaurant?

199
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,591
Mother, you should eat too.
This is really good.

200
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,871
You also made stir-fried cabbage?

201
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:43,991
This is a common dish
made by Miss Peilan.

202
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,510
I was afraid that you wouldn't be
used to the food here.

203
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,750
So I made a few dishes.

204
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,591
With these fancy dishes,
who would want stir-fried cabbage?

205
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,430
Peilan, put those down.
We are still eating.

206
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,910
Peilan, I just saw
an old woman picking vegetables.

207
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:12,630
It seems that she used Jue Ming Finger.

208
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,910
This technique has now been lost
in the martial arts world.

209
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:20,550
Am I delaying your service?

210
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,360
No.

211
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:26,871
The chefs here are quite average, right?

212
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:28,991
Their cooking is not as good as yours.

213
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:34,591
I made these.

214
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,910
No, I was wrong. Peilan? Peilan?

215
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,951
All these dishes for the three of us

216
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,311
are a waste.

217
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:48,951
Where is Banxia?

218
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,750
She hasn't come out
since she entered the study here.

219
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,831
Then quickly take some food to her.
Don't let her starve.

220
00:11:57,351 --> 00:12:00,030
Take this chicken to her quickly.

221
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:03,750
Wait for me. Save me some.

222
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:10,471
Mother, you should try this.
It's delicious.

223
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:16,831
Jinrong, why don't you go out and ask

224
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,231
how much such a place

225
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,910
costs in a month?

226
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,430
What are you doing? Don't tell me

227
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,871
you're going to pay rent
to the Young Lord.

228
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:29,231
We owe him on this.

229
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,270
I don't want to be labeled

230
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:32,630
as a freeloader someday.

231
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,550
That won't happen.
You have no idea what's happening.

232
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,871
How much money do you have left?

233
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,550
I don't have any money.

234
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:49,111
Ruyu.

235
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:52,071
Master, where did you go
to beg for food?

236
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:54,871
So many dishes

237
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:57,471
are kind of a waste
for the three of us to eat.

238
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,991
There is no "three of us."

239
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,510
Such a big thing happened,

240
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,550
and I can't help.

241
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,311
I'm feeling ups and downs.

242
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,071
Alright, what's the use
of saying these now?

243
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:12,630
Just now, in that pile of ruins,

244
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,071
I rummaged out a jewelry box.

245
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:16,064
Master.

246
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,790
It's mine.

247
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,871
And silver. Here.

248
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,311
This is my private money.

249
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,711
Nonsense.

250
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,311
I must have put it somewhere
and forgotten about it.

251
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,951
Mother, you can't take this money.

252
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:32,550
This is the dowry I have saved.

253
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,910
You won't need it for a while anyway.

254
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,311
Mother...
Master, did you do this on purpose?

255
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,550
You really know how to make a gift
of someone else's money.

256
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:41,991
I was giving it to you.
But I didn't expect...

257
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,231
What's the use of saying these now?

258
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,591
Mother! My money.

259
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:56,111
Isn't it more wasteful if I eat alone?

260
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:01,056
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

261
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,891
(Virtuous and Generous)

262
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,311
You gave away your mansion
to others to stay for no reason.

263
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,750
What were you thinking?

264
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:16,591
I-I was thinking that

265
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,630
since they are
the Fourth Prince's friends,

266
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,591
I should help if I could, right?

267
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,390
That's right.

268
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,111
Do you know how much
I spent on that mansion?

269
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,991
And you've never lived there.

270
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:31,831
When you should be generous,
you are not.

271
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:33,871
When you shouldn't, you just go ahead.

272
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,591
The Fourth Prince left,
and you gave away your mansion.

273
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,111
I lent it to them.

274
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,510
I don't care if it's given or lent.

275
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,750
Tell me, what will you do
when you get married?

276
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,711
I won't get married for a while.

277
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,071
I just thought of
lending it to them for a while.

278
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:50,750
After all, they will move out.

279
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,510
How generous you are!
It's not your money, right?

280
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,951
Your Highness, it has already happened.

281
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,191
If it can make the Fourth Prince happy,
it's worth it.

282
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:05,991
Get out. Don't stand in my way here.

283
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:15,951
What is this?

284
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:18,711
Why is it so hard for me?

285
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:25,184
Stop!

286
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,111
How dare you come back!
If you didn't start the fire,

287
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,591
why did you say you did that?

288
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,550
Young Lord, I just came back
to grab something. I'm leaving now.

289
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,711
Leaving? You can't leave. Come here.

290
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:41,991
Young Lord, Mrs. Chun is here.

291
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,071
She's waiting for you in your room.

292
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,951
Why is she here? What else
does she want? Keep an eye on him.

293
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,040
Yes.

294
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,808
His Highness is calling for you.

295
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,591
Stop!

296
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:06,351
Thank you.

297
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:14,270
What's the matter? Anything wrong?

298
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:19,311
I'll make this short.
Yes, we've moved into your mansion.

299
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:20,750
But we're not living for free.

300
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,191
Our family is not rich, as you know.

301
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,231
Here are five taels of silver.
Consider it rent.

302
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,951
It also represents
the attitude of the Chuns.

303
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,351
It's alright. This is not necessary.

304
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,831
No, just take it.

305
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,071
Don't say that we are

306
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:33,711
freeloading here.

307
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,550
What do you mean by that?

308
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,231
Am I not sincere enough?

309
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,871
Have I not been good to you?

310
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:40,430
How can you think of me like this?

311
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:42,351
What do you mean?

312
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,071
I'm just trying to be kind.

313
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:45,871
I am the kind one, alright?

314
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,351
What sin did I commit

315
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,111
to end up dealing with
a family like yours?

316
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,711
Why would you talk like this?

317
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,311
I'm genuinely here to pay you the rent.

318
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,790
I said I didn't want it.

319
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:55,630
I don't need the rent.
I'm not short on it.

320
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,430
- What attitude is that?
- What attitude is yours?

321
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,030
Fine, if you don't want it, so be it.

322
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,471
Suit yourself.
I really went into unnecessary trouble.

323
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,991
I've never seen someone like you.

324
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,031
What kind of person is she?

325
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,990
She's fussing around,
and now she's the one who's angry.

326
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,150
I... Right?

327
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,071
I'm so angry.

328
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,311
Jinrong, what you said is right.

329
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,071
We should make them pay some price.

330
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,390
What's wrong, mother?

331
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:41,390
I won't leave,
even if they drive me out now.

332
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,351
Mother, you're right to think so.

333
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,910
Now that we're here,
we should enjoy ourselves.

334
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:51,190
Mother, could you
return my jewelry box to me first?

335
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,871
Go call the steward for me.

336
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,430
Tell him to boil ten eggs for me.

337
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,871
Yes, madam.

338
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,511
You really haven't
eaten anything good, have you?

339
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,630
Mr. Li, I'm not in a good mood today.

340
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:16,311
I can tell.

341
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:19,031
It's a good time
to settle our old accounts.

342
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:21,630
Young Lord, let me
explain everything to you.

343
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,791
Alright, go ahead and explain.

344
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,351
Why is it that your diary is full of me?

345
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:32,111
Well, it's because
we were together all the time.

346
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:39,990
The Fourth Prince
insisted on asking me for it.

347
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,511
I dared not refuse him.

348
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:43,150
You are quite flexible.

349
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:48,351
You know what? There's a phrase...
What's it called again?

350
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,871
Something about raising a tiger...

351
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,871
To be a pawn?

352
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,031
No, that's not accurate.

353
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,150
Raising a tiger...

354
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,751
Raising a tiger will bring calamity.

355
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:58,150
Yes, raising a tiger
will bring calamity.

356
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,031
You even have the face to laugh?

357
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,351
Li Tengyun, you are deliberately
trying to mess with me, aren't you?

358
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:09,910
Young Lord, I really had no choice. I...

359
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,311
Tell me, how would you like me
to deal with you?

360
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,071
How about I disappear
from your sight right away?

361
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:19,430
Then I will make you
disappear from this world.

362
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,670
No, Young Lord.

363
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,271
- You two, take him to the woodshed.
- Yes.

364
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:24,871
Young Lord, please listen to me.

365
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,271
Never let him out again.

366
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:27,430
- Go.
- Young Lord!

367
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:39,230
Jinrong,

368
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,670
once you calm down,

369
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,430
you'll feel a lot more relaxed.

370
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:44,871
You're right.

371
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,430
Sometimes, you shouldn't
think too much for others.

372
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,751
Right.

373
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:03,190
Honey, I-I forgot about you.

374
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:06,311
It's my fault for making you suffer.

375
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,111
They are repairing our house.

376
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,791
When our house is repaired,
I will take you back.

377
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,230
This is the Young Lord's Mansion.

378
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:21,111
You are surrounded
by princes of past generations.

379
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,511
Get familiar with them.

380
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:26,150
Honey, you must bless us.

381
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,280
Okay.

382
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,831
Pay respect.

383
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:50,791
Madam, it's midnight. It's time to rest.

384
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,071
Someone will change the candlelight
for the master regularly.

385
00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:55,791
Thank you.

386
00:20:56,551 --> 00:20:59,910
Father, this time it was all my mistake.

387
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,990
I burned our house down.
Do you blame me?

388
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:05,150
We agreed not to mention it anymore.

389
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,351
Where is Chun Keling?
Why isn't she home every day?

390
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,430
Isn't she back yet?

391
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:12,871
Madam, if you are worried
about Miss Keling,

392
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:16,111
starting tomorrow, I will have someone
keep an eye on her for you.

393
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:17,990
Do you offer such a service?

394
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,071
Yes, there are secret guards
at this mansion.

395
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,390
That's great.

396
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:25,831
You've been busy all day too.
Go rest early.

397
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,910
This is all part of my job.

398
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:31,591
Okay, without you, I wouldn't know

399
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:32,871
what to do with this big mansion.

400
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,230
You are welcome.
Escort Madam back to her room.

401
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,390
What are we eating tomorrow?

402
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,390
Don't make it too greasy.
I've gained weight these past few days.

403
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,230
- Okay, Miss Jinrong.
- Good.

404
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,511
We'll go prepare now.

405
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,271
Escort Miss Banxia back to her room.

406
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:53,824
Okay.

407
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,751
Peilan, the waters
at this mansion are deep.

408
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,271
I didn't even know
there were secret guards.

409
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,311
Miss Peilan.

410
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,390
I don't need an escort.

411
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,871
I'll escort her.

412
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:13,461
(Zuiyue Pavilion)

413
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,630
Where are these secret guards?

414
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,591
Mr. Lu, I didn't have anything to do
the whole day today.

415
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,511
Peilan, tell you what,

416
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:38,751
if any random person in this mansion
would teach me,

417
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,071
my skills would be elevated
to the next level.

418
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,591
They're really good.

419
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:50,311
I feel like I'm useless to this family.

420
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,792
What's wrong with you?

421
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,670
Mr. Lu, look at that moon.

422
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,511
The moon is trying so hard to shine,

423
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:10,190
wanting to light up others.

424
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,551
But I can't do anything.

425
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,111
Do you like to shine that much?

426
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:23,430
Mr. Lu, don't you think

427
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:24,670
I am especially incompetent?

428
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:26,990
Look at how capable Mr. Xin is.

429
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:28,630
Chef Cai is also very capable.

430
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:33,190
I can't do anything right,
and I can only cook some homely dishes.

431
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,150
Peilan, don't talk nonsense.

432
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,390
In my heart,
you're much better than Chef Cai.

433
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,311
For example,
the dish you cook, called...

434
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:50,271
What's it called again? That one...

435
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,751
Don't cry. I'm about to remember.

436
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,591
It's that one from the other day,

437
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,271
called...

438
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:03,591
I am not going to cook anymore.

439
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,031
A good gain takes long pain.
But you'll finally get what you want.

440
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:11,150
Heaven rewards diligence.
Nothing is impossible.

441
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,710
Don't cry. Stop crying.

442
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:20,871
Nothing is impossible.
Yes, nothing is impossible.

443
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:24,390
Mr. Lu, I won't give up.

444
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,111
Yes, we should not give up.

445
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,990
Look, there's a shooting star.

446
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:36,192
Really?

447
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:52,630
Although I can't cook
as well as Chef Cai,

448
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,591
I'm sure I can handle other chores.

449
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,031
Morning, Miss Peilan.

450
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:00,351
Morning, Miss Peilan.

451
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,351
Don't. Good morning, everyone.

452
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,950
You guys have started working so early.

453
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,551
Great, I will join you.

454
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:06,751
Miss Peilan,

455
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,111
do you think
we're not doing good enough?

456
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,511
No. It's just that I want to help.

457
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,071
How can we allow our mistress
to do the work?

458
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,031
I'm not your mistress.

459
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,776
Miss Peilan.

460
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,430
It's okay. When Mr. Xin comes,
I will explain it to him.

461
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:19,551
You won't get into trouble.

462
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,990
No, Miss Peilan.

463
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:23,150
This chair is made from
thousand-year-old ebony.

464
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:25,190
It must be maintained with beeswax.

465
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:28,751
If you clean it with a wet towel,
it will be ruined.

466
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,791
Yes, if it's ruined,

467
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:32,591
Mr. Xin won't be happy.

468
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,430
- Yes.
- Then, I...

469
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,591
Miss Peilan! Miss Peilan!

470
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,551
So, can I clean this instead?

471
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:42,591
Miss Peilan.

472
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:43,591
What now?

473
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:45,190
This is a piece of agate
from the Southern Seas.

474
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,990
If you clean it with a coarse cloth,
it will damage the patterns.

475
00:25:48,071 --> 00:25:50,311
It must be gently cleaned
with deer skin.

476
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:52,591
Yes, you need to use deer skin.

477
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,990
Otherwise, Mr. Xin will be unhappy.

478
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,791
Then, I...

479
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,470
Is there a ladder?
I can clean the rafters, right?

480
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:03,751
Absolutely not, Miss Peilan.

481
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,071
Don't tell me the rafters
are also made of ebony.

482
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:09,390
They aren't, but the pillars
are colored with cinnabar.

483
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:11,791
They were made
through a thirteen-step process.

484
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,990
They say the color can't be replicated.

485
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,910
If any of them get chipped...

486
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,630
Yes, if any pillar gets chipped off,

487
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,591
Mr. Xin will be unhappy.

488
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:24,831
Mr. Xin, Mr. Xin...

489
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,390
What am I supposed to do
since there's Mr. Xin?

490
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,031
Well, you actually
don't have to do anything.

491
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,488
I give up.

492
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,271
This is His Highness's favorite vase.

493
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:40,470
Now, Mr. Xin really
isn't going to be happy.

494
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:43,670
Yeah, Mr. Xin really
isn't going to be happy.

495
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,430
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

496
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:50,430
These chores aren't for you.
We'll take care of them.

497
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,190
I just want to help you all.

498
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:58,190
We'd have finished everything
much earlier if you hadn't come.

499
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:18,111
It tastes good.

500
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,150
Today, we prepared
duck-blood vermicelli soup for you.

501
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,591
And we've already modified it
according to your taste.

502
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,751
A few snacks will be here soon.

503
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,448
Good.

504
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:38,311
Well, it feels really good
to have someone serve you.

505
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,190
Madam, there's a small matter.

506
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,511
What is it?

507
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:47,230
The money in the account has been spent.

508
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,670
Account? There's an account?

509
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:54,551
Madam,

510
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:57,871
the daily expenses of the mansion
and food for people and horses

511
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,111
are all recorded in the account.

512
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,831
The money that Young Lord left before
has been spent.

513
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,551
He said whoever lives here
will take care of it.

514
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,190
Madam, what do you think?

515
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:08,190
He didn't tell me.

516
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:11,430
I thought you were part of the package
with the mansion.

517
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,630
We were hired by the Young Lord
for a large sum.

518
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,551
We stewards

519
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,551
only take care of families
that are third-rank or above.

520
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,670
How much money do you cost?

521
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,831
100 taels.

522
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:26,670
100 taels?
It costs 100 taels a month to hire you?

523
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:30,071
It's 100 taels per day, madam.
Please be careful.

524
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:33,111
100 taels per day?

525
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,111
There are the wages of the servants,
the maintenance of the garden,

526
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:38,990
all kinds of dishes and pastries,

527
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,311
and feed for the animals.

528
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:41,990
Animals? Where are the animals?

529
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,910
There are sika deer
and peacocks in the garden.

530
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,190
Madam, did you not know about this?

531
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,470
I-I've never been to the garden.

532
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:54,390
Don't let the servants
serve those dishes later.

533
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:56,352
Don't let the servants serve them.

534
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,831
Madam, please slow down.

535
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:05,791
Dong Xiaoxiao insists
on coming to see me.

536
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,111
I will let her get a good look.

537
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,390
Jinrong! Jinrong!

538
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,271
Mother.

539
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:17,351
Something bad happened.
Mr. Xin is asking us for money.

540
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,630
He's extorting us.

541
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,990
What do you mean?

542
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,791
I told you
that Young Lord was up to no good.

543
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,150
Now his intention is exposed.

544
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,311
Mr. Xin said their people are charging,

545
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,430
and it's terribly expensive.

546
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,390
Do you know how much it costs?
100 taels a day!

547
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,751
100 taels?

548
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,871
Well, it makes sense.

549
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,871
Look at how many people
he has under him.

550
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:37,591
Let him ask the Young Lord
for the money.

551
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,390
The Young Lord said
whoever stays should pay.

552
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:43,111
What? What does he mean?

553
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:45,351
Isn't he obviously
making things difficult for us?

554
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,552
I've said all along that he's no good.

555
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:59,150
Mother, can you talk
with that Mr. Xin again

556
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:00,871
to see if we can put it on credit first?

557
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,630
We can let him go
after Xiaoxiao comes and leaves.

558
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,190
I just need two days.

559
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:06,511
On credit?
Can you afford 100 taels a day?

560
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,150
Mother, why don't you
discuss it with him again?

561
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,111
Ask him
to hang on a little longer, okay?

562
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,111
Okay, you can do that yourself.
I'm not interfering.

563
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:16,416
Mother!

564
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,990
How can I...

565
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:20,511
- Peilan.
- Mr. Lu,

566
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,551
what use am I to this family?

567
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,071
Peilan, don't say that.

568
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,990
Why don't we learn martial arts
from them together?

569
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:32,384
He's doing laundry?

570
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:38,470
Miss Peilan, these clothes
haven't been soaked for enough time.

571
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:39,351
You can't wash them now.

572
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:40,791
These are my family's clothes.

573
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:41,791
I've been washing them.

574
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:42,871
I know how to do this.

575
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,071
Miss Peilan, you wash so fast.

576
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,871
Not only do I wash them fast,
but they are clean.

577
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,871
Indeed.

578
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,311
Let's go hang the clothes.

579
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:09,670
You're hanging them here?
This place is in the shade.

580
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,190
You should go in the sun.

581
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:21,910
This is the Purple Sun Skill!

582
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:24,768
What?

583
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,751
So there are really people
who can dry clothes with internal force.

584
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:31,390
Drying clothes?

585
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,670
Clothes dried with internal force
not only have no wrinkles

586
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:35,511
but also save you a lot of time.

587
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,470
Most importantly,
clothes dried with internal force

588
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:40,351
have a faint scent of sunshine.

589
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:45,390
Miss Peilan, would you like to smell it?

590
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,111
I want to die. I'm too useless.

591
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:52,591
- Peilan!
- I might as well be dead.

592
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:54,311
Stop! What are you doing?

593
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,311
What are you doing?
Come over here quickly.

594
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:02,670
Mr. Xin, Mr. Xin.

595
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:06,230
Miss Jinrong, it's definitely not
going to work without money.

596
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:07,831
I know, but in two days,

597
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:09,751
a very important guest is coming here.

598
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:11,390
For the sake of the Young Lord,

599
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,670
stay two more days, okay?

600
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,751
As always, everything
can be easily handled if there's money.

601
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,630
Mr. Xin, I beg you.

602
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,630
How about I kneel down to you...
And you still won't agree.

603
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,751
Mr. Xin, in fact,
your services are pretty good.

604
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:29,071
The only downside
is that they're too expensive.

605
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:31,831
You get what you pay for.

606
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:35,150
You should know
that even our doormen are educated.

607
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,871
If we don't need doormen,
can it be a little cheaper?

608
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,111
It's a package service.

609
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:41,351
Mr. Xin! Mr. Xin!

610
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,390
Can you give us a small discount?

611
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:46,271
How much do you offer?

612
00:32:46,271 --> 00:32:47,791
If I tell you, don't get angry, okay?

613
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:49,111
Then don't say it.

614
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,791
Five taels, okay?

615
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:56,071
Mr. Xin! Sir! Bro.

616
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,670
How about a total of ten taels?

617
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:00,071
For two days, alright? I beg you.

618
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,111
I'm not paying.

619
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,271
I have my own plan. I beg you, okay?

620
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,591
Is everything ready?

621
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,111
It's ready.

622
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,190
Don't!

623
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:12,871
Mrs. Chun, goodbye.

624
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:14,311
Mrs. Chun, goodbye.

625
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,230
Can you help me?

626
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:18,311
Mr. Xin, please...

627
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,910
What's wrong, mother?

628
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:24,311
Mr. Xin is leaving.

629
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,871
- What about the servants?
- They are all leaving.

630
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:31,311
Really? But I haven't learned
the Purple Sun Skill yet!

631
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,990
Mother, look at you!

632
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:38,271
Why are you so angry with me?

633
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:40,311
I don't even want to talk to you.

634
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,751
Get out of my way!

635
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:45,630
Tell me,
did you hide some private money?

636
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,551
Mother!

637
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:50,470
Everyone is gone.
Then, all the work at home...

638
00:33:57,551 --> 00:34:00,031
Yes, everyone is gone.

639
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:10,240
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

640
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,871
Your Highness, save me, please!

641
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,711
Help, Your Highness!

642
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:27,151
Your Highness, only you can save me now.

643
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,871
Take your time. Tell me.

644
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,950
Who locked you up?

645
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,231
I-It's the Young Lord.

646
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:38,311
Young Lord? Why?

647
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:45,191
Because I-I gave my diary
to the Fourth Prince.

648
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:47,231
Diary?

649
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,751
What diary?

650
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,910
Your Highness,
didn't you say you'd save me?

651
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:05,110
You dared to go behind my back

652
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,871
and commit countless disgraceful deeds,

653
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:13,470
including murder and arson.
How bold of you!

654
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,990
It was the Young Lord who forced me.

655
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:18,711
If not for him,
I wouldn't dare to do these things.

656
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:21,110
So he forced you, huh?

657
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,791
Spare me, father! Father!

658
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:29,910
If it weren't for
Li Tengyun informing me,

659
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,430
I would still be unaware.

660
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,390
You dared to go behind my back

661
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,151
and commit countless disgraceful deeds.

662
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:41,950
You dare to kill people and set fire.
You were too bold!

663
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,791
Father, I'm innocent.

664
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,030
Now I see why you

665
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,351
- gave away your mansion.
- I...

666
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,110
Good that you gave it away. From now on,

667
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:53,351
you are not
the young lord of my mansion.

668
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:55,390
Father, please spare me.

669
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,110
Guards, without my command,

670
00:35:58,271 --> 00:35:59,751
nobody is allowed to let them out.

671
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,831
No food or water is to be given to them.

672
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:03,808
- Yes.
- Yes.

673
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,950
What a disgrace you are!

674
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,871
- Your Highness!
- Father!

675
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:10,430
Please don't lock us up together.
Your Highness!

676
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:12,950
Li Tengyun,

677
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,191
I'll kill you!

678
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,151
