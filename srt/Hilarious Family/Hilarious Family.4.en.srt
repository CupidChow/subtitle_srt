(Dong Xiaoxiao)

00:02:20,794 --> 00:02:22,433
Xiaoxiao!

Jinrong!

39
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:30,546
Long time no see.

40
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:31,986
You've lost weight again.

41
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,347
You've become prettier.

42
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,787
That hairpin you're wearing looks great.

43
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:37,307
Isn't it?
You can't find it in Qing City.

44
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:38,146
Only Jianglin sells it.

45
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:39,787
It took me a while
to find someone to get it.

46
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,106
Sit down.

47
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,507
Spring River Restaurant's honey cakes.

48
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:48,307
The best sweet treat in all of Jianglin.

49
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:49,146
Few are able to buy it.

50
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:50,386
Because I know the owner,

51
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:51,227
I was able to buy it.

52
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,386
Take some with you to try.

53
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:53,467
Never ate it?

54
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:54,947
Share it with your sisters.

55
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:56,666
No need to thank me.

56
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:58,146
It's a custom here in Jianglin.

57
00:02:58,187 --> 00:02:59,386
A souvenir.

58
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,386
You've only been here for a short time,

59
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:05,106
but you've already
become a Jianglin resident.

60
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:13,067
Your eyebrows look fantastic.

61
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,787
But I think that your eyebrows...

62
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:17,106
I was showing you the earrings.

63
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,067
Not bad.

64
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:21,787
Right?

65
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:22,947
My husband bought it for me.

66
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,986
Pure gold, imported from the West.

67
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,227
You'd never guess
that a nearly seventy-year-old man

68
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:33,386
has an aesthetic sense.

69
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,027
Chun Jinrong.

70
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:39,706
Xiaoxiao,

71
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:41,386
do you remember

72
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,706
what you promised me in Qing City?

73
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:44,146
You promised to introduce me to

74
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:46,067
young men from wealthy families
if I came to Jianglin.

75
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:46,947
So here I am.

76
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:48,187
Fulfillment.

77
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:50,266
Invitation to Product Appraisal.

78
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,106
I've already paid the entry fee for you.

79
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:53,866
What's that?

80
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:55,027
It's a merchandise sale.

81
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,986
They have imported goods

82
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:57,986
from the South and West.

83
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:58,866
Most importantly,

84
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:01,467
the people who are going
are all well-known.

85
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,586
Sons of Hanlin Academy scholars

86
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,386
and grandsons of Vice Ministers of Rites

87
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:06,507
are all single.

88
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,146
One can always count
on their best friend.

89
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,507
I don't mean to be critical,
but if you're going to

90
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,947
the Product Appraisal,

91
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:17,667
Jinrong, you really need
to change your attire.

92
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,107
Your outfit is inappropriate

93
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:20,507
and appears to be worn out.

94
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:21,947
Those nobles and officials

95
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:23,586
must have met a wide variety of women.

96
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,706
Only if you get all dolled up will they

97
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:26,586
take you seriously.

98
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:28,226
Xiaoxiao, have some green tea.

99
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,226
You know me very well.

100
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,266
I am competent

101
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:32,867
in this sort of setting.

102
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:33,627
Okay.

103
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:35,947
The shop in the back is

104
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:36,867
very popular among

105
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:37,947
my social circle.

106
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,307
I'll take you to have a look, let's go.

107
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:40,386
Now?

108
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:40,987
Let's go.

109
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:42,867
Could we...

110
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:44,627
Could we go there another time?

111
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:45,906
What's the rush?

112
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:47,067
(Wan Fabric)
Welcome.

113
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,266
Mr. Zhang!

114
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:49,627
Do you still remember me?

115
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,026
Hello.

116
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,627
What do you need?

117
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,067
Do you have any new clothes in the shop?

118
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,507
This section is all new.

119
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,307
This looks good.

120
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:00,627
This is really nice.

121
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,906
Mr. Zhang, how much is this?

122
00:05:02,187 --> 00:05:02,867
Four taels.

123
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:04,187
Four taels? I'll take it.

124
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,507
I'll have my maid pick it up later.

125
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:07,067
Thank you.

126
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:07,906
Four taels.

127
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,747
I know, wrap it up for me.

128
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:12,307
I'll have my maid pick it up later.

129
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,867
Sorry, no credit is offered here.

130
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,427
I come here often.

131
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:19,026
I'm really sorry.

132
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:24,547
The rules have changed.

133
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:26,427
I used to let my maid pick it up.

134
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,266
Wrap it up.

135
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:31,947
Thank you.

136
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,026
You're not trying it on?

137
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:35,826
No need.

138
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,026
It only costs four taels of silver,
and I only buy it for fun.

139
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:39,307
You should try one too.

140
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:41,586
I don't think I need to.

141
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:43,987
I think this shop is just average.

142
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:45,867
Are there any better shops?

143
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:46,586
There are.

144
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:47,706
There are.

145
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:48,747
Let's go.

146
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:52,867
Wait.

147
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,867
Aren't you tired yet?

148
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:57,722
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

149
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:05,307
Fourth Prince has arrived.

150
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:10,106
(Lord Ling's Mansion)

151
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,386
Welcome, Your Highness.

152
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:20,346
Formalities are unnecessary.

153
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:22,947
- Your Highness, you...
- Hey,

154
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:24,226
did you find the...

155
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:26,867
Your Highness,
it's awkward to discuss here.

156
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:28,947
Have a good rest, Your Highness.

157
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,187
Did you find it?

158
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:32,667
Your Highness,

159
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:33,547
I've found it.

160
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:34,947
Let's get going right away.

161
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:36,386
When did

162
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:38,187
he become so close

163
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:39,226
to Fourth Prince?

164
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,627
You must be exhausted from travel.

165
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:42,307
What about this? You should first rest.

166
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,067
I'll take you to your room. This way.

167
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,187
Dong Xiaoxiao

168
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,146
used to hang out with me.

169
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,747
And now that she's
married an elderly man,

170
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,146
she's acting all arrogant about it.

171
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,507
She even considered herself a local.

172
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,187
Great.

173
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:04,307
I can't believe I bought these clothes.

174
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,107
You...

175
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:08,747
What are you doing?

176
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:09,627
I regret it.

177
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:11,067
What's up?

178
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:12,226
Jinrong.

179
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:13,867
I regret it too.

180
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,266
Go drive Guo away.

181
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,627
Mother, why are you always so rash?

182
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:21,107
What do you mean by that?

183
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:23,187
The pharmacy is not profitable.

184
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,507
The mere presence of Guo annoys me.

185
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:29,747
Mother, give me some money.

186
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:32,146
Dong Xiaoxiao is taking me to
a Product Appraisal event.

187
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:32,947
Let me tell you,

188
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,507
those who can attend that event

189
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:36,947
are all wealthy and powerful men.

190
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:38,346
Mother.

191
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:40,226
What does it have to do with you?

192
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,507
I have to seize the opportunity.

193
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,867
Besides, Mother,

194
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:46,627
do you not want me
to marry into a decent family?

195
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,627
I asked you to go to
the Marriage Bridge with me,

196
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:49,947
but you didn't.

197
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,826
You always choose to go
to these expensive places.

198
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:53,747
The Marriage Bridge and that event

199
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:55,427
are not the same thing.

200
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,307
They have a threshold
to enter there, okay?

201
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,867
Then you just go.

202
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,187
The men there won't even bother looking

203
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:03,627
at me if I show up in these clothes.

204
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:05,067
You want me to marry,

205
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:06,187
but you don't give me money.

206
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:07,786
What exactly do you want me to do?

207
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,427
Do you think those wealthy men

208
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:10,667
will notice you

209
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:11,867
if you wear new clothes?

210
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:13,307
Then I'm not getting married.

211
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:14,307
Up to you.

212
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:16,346
Seriously, I'm not getting married.

213
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:16,987
Then don't marry.

214
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:18,427
I'm not joking.

215
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,507
Don't joke.

216
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:23,146
Mother!

217
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:33,307
Jinrong, I've already wiped there.

218
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:34,307
What?

219
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,586
Already wiped?

220
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:37,506
Be careful.

221
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:41,067
Peilan, have you seen my purse?

222
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,626
The purple one.

223
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,067
The one with tassels on it.

224
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,147
Yes.

225
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,067
I gave it to Mother.

226
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:49,826
Gave it to Mother?

227
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,106
Why did you give it to Mother?

228
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:53,826
I didn't know whose it was.

229
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:55,947
And you just gave it to Mother?

230
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:56,787
You didn't know

231
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,626
that the money in it was mine?

232
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,106
Why did you put the money there?

233
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:04,027
Not put, but hide.

234
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:05,427
Did you know "hide"?

235
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:07,226
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:08,746
I really didn't know it was yours.

237
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:10,466
And you just gave it to Mother?

238
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:13,466
Jinrong.

239
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:15,667
I'm not angry.

240
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:17,907
I'm not angry.

241
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,787
Five taels.

242
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,267
Do you know how long it took me?

243
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:24,027
Three years and three months.

244
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:24,986
You...

245
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:27,866
I don't care.

246
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,226
Get it back for me

247
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:30,027
since you gave it away.

248
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,106
Jinrong.

249
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:32,667
How can I get back the money

250
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,387
that went into Mother's pocket?

251
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:39,067
Where's your purse?

252
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:45,907
You still owe me four taels.

253
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:46,667
Remember it.

254
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:48,027
No way, Jinrong.

255
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:50,027
That's the money for groceries.

256
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,746
Father.

257
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,067
Fresh pork.

258
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:56,706
Miss, would you like a piece of meat?

259
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:00,866
No, thanks.

260
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,667
Bamboo shoots, bamboo shoots.
One wen for a bundle.

261
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,746
- Bamboo shoots, bamboo shoots.
- How much for these bamboo shoots?

262
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:12,346
One...

263
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:14,346
One bundle.

264
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,307
One wen for a bundle.

265
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,106
Um, I-I want three bundles.

266
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,106
Just three bundles?

267
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,667
Four bundles are also fine.

268
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:31,626
Pay up.

269
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:42,106
Copycat.

270
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,722
(Xishi Fresh Vegetables)

271
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:47,387
(Wan Fabric)
Hello, what would you like to buy?

272
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:48,746
I'll take a look around.

273
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,866
Mister, how much is this?

274
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:54,586
One tael.

275
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,147
Do you have anything cheaper?

276
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:57,346
This is the cheapest.

277
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:00,746
It's fraying here.

278
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:02,387
Could you lower the price a bit?

279
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:03,547
No bargaining.

280
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:06,586
Mister, I want to return this.

281
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:09,986
Why are you here?

282
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,027
Return?

283
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,907
Weren't you just buying for fun?

284
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:17,986
What? Not fun anymore?

285
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:18,907
It's fun.

286
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,187
It's not a return, it's an exchange.

287
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,586
It does not suit me.

288
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:23,346
Alright, alright.

289
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:26,106
I thought you said
you didn't like the clothes here?

290
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,626
You are just stubborn.

291
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:28,866
Listen.

292
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:31,586
The shops I'm interested in
are all one-of-a-kind.

293
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,147
Trust me, I'll choose for you.

294
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:34,626
That one.

295
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,667
- Mister, take it down for her to try.
- Alright.

296
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:40,427
Thank you.

297
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:45,826
This fabric is so comfortable.

298
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:48,346
This embroidery.

299
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:50,907
So detailed.

300
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:53,226
This is Suzhou silk.

301
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:55,787
Look, isn't it beautiful?

302
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:58,147
Perfectly suited to your skin tone.

303
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,067
Right now,

304
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:02,027
this is the most popular style
in Jianglin City.

305
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,466
How much is this, Mister?

306
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:05,506
Six taels.

307
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:09,947
What's wrong?

308
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:13,466
I just think this dress is a bit...

309
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,027
The neckline here.

310
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,746
Don't you think it's a bit stiff?

311
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,226
Very stifling.

312
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:20,667
Do you have other colors, Mister?

313
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:21,586
Pure black.

314
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,387
Do you have that color

315
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:24,226
of the sky after it rains?

316
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:25,106
Blue, but not blue.

317
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:26,866
Green, but not green.

318
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:27,706
Forget it.

319
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,626
I'll go with the one I chose earlier.

320
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:30,586
Wrap it up for me.

321
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,746
It's the one for one tael?

322
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:36,866
Xiaoxiao.

323
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,226
Weren't you going to exchange yours?

324
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:40,147
I think this dress
is especially suitable for you.

325
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,667
You can exchange it for this one.

326
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:42,387
Listen to me.

327
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:43,506
This looks good.

328
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:44,267
Looks good.

329
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:47,586
I think you make a good point.

330
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,466
The more I look at it,
the less I like it.

331
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,346
You should choose others.

332
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,226
I won't change it.

333
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:54,626
I'll just return it directly, Mister.

334
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:55,506
Alright.

335
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,346
One tael.

336
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:03,226
Okay.

337
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,626
Mother, welcome back.

338
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:19,667
Let's eat.

339
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:21,947
I'm so angry.

340
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:25,027
People don't even look
at the pretty portrait?

341
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:26,907
They picked you
the moment I took it out.

342
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:28,226
Really?

343
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:28,986
They also said,

344
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:30,907
"She appears fertile
and capable of working."

345
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,226
They think they're hiring a maid.

346
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,067
How can they tell?

347
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,667
I find it strange too.

348
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:37,346
Mother.

349
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,907
Don't ever take my portrait

350
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:39,986
to the Marriage Bridge again.

351
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:40,907
I will not marry.

352
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:42,547
If I get married,
who will take care of you?

353
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:44,506
Don't talk nonsense.

354
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:46,667
Surely every single girl gets married.

355
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,106
Don't be so choosy
like your older sister,

356
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,387
I warn you.

357
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:50,746
When you finally reach her age,

358
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,866
it will be too late.

359
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:52,907
What's late?

360
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:54,626
Keling, come and eat.

361
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,106
Peilan, it's all bamboo shoots.

362
00:13:58,147 --> 00:13:59,346
I'm still growing.

363
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,346
Can we have some meat?

364
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,466
I added lard.

365
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,267
Meat, meat. You're always craving meat.

366
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:05,626
Have you earned a penny?

367
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:07,346
Master, just in time.

368
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:08,267
Come in.

369
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,466
Okay, I'm coming.

370
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:13,226
Master.

371
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:14,387
Thank you.

372
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:18,667
Peilan.

373
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,626
It's not that I'm picky.

374
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,106
You make it too obvious.

375
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:23,466
Since Master moved in with us,

376
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:25,106
the food has gotten steadily worse.

377
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,346
I'm sorry, Master.

378
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:28,226
It's okay.

379
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:30,586
When I'm hungry, I can even eat bamboo.

380
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:31,907
Peilan did the right thing.

381
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:34,267
Do you not realize
your business makes no money?

382
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,866
You should be thankful
that you have food.

383
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,626
The bamboo shoot is healthy.

384
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,267
It can clear the lung heat

385
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:44,866
and dissolve phlegm.

386
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:45,746
Eat more.

387
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:47,187
It's good.

388
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,147
You still have the nerve to eat.

389
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:51,466
Mother, aren't you eating anymore?

390
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,787
Let him clear his lung heat
and dissolve phlegm.

391
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:57,226
Good bamboo shoots
know the right season.

392
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,106
May you pick more.

393
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,746
Master, eat more.

394
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:02,667
I'll pick it myself.

395
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,027
Pick it myself.

396
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:05,586
Master, dissolve more phlegm.

397
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:15,986
I'm telling you,

398
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,387
it doesn't make a difference
how much it costs.

399
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:19,387
I think the most beautiful one

400
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,307
in his shop
is this dress that costs one tael.

401
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,106
Yes, I think so too.

402
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:25,346
Clothes are meant to
be thrown away after only a few wears.

403
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:26,187
No need to buy it

404
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:27,466
if you don't like it.

405
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,506
Yes, just return it if necessary.

406
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:31,586
The main issue is
that the clothes here aren't appealing.

407
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:32,466
It's pointless.

408
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:33,267
You can buy good ones

409
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,027
when I take you to
the Product Appraisal.

410
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,106
Remember to bring money when you go.

411
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:39,067
To buy things.

412
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,667
Of course, I know that.

413
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,746
How much do you usually bring?

414
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:45,466
Ten taels.

415
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:46,547
Ten taels?

416
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:48,866
Is it enough?

417
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:55,147
Come and have a look.

418
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:57,147
When we're in public,

419
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:58,586
Your Highness,

420
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,746
you and I should address
each other as Bro.

421
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,346
I know it sounds invasive,

422
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:04,346
but it's for your safety.

423
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:05,226
Okay.

424
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:07,147
Good.

425
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:08,226
- Good.
- Good.

426
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,466
- Good.
- Good.

427
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:11,866
Okay, then.

428
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:12,907
You must not

429
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,106
give away your true identity

430
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:16,907
whenever you're in public, Bro.

431
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,267
Where is that girl?

432
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,427
Don't worry, I've arranged everything.

433
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:22,986
All of the girls with bright,

434
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:24,106
clear eyes are here.

435
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:25,387
Oh, yeah.

436
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,866
Take this hairpin.

437
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,787
You can give it to the girl

438
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:31,226
who brings you joy.

439
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,466
Then she will make you even more joyful.

440
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:35,346
Look here.

441
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:40,027
This is the famous
Spring River Restaurant.

442
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:45,746
It houses every kind of joy.

443
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:49,267
So joyful.

444
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:51,866
So...

445
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:54,907
Where is he?

446
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:56,787
He was just here.

447
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:58,746
- Why...
- Don't worry.

448
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:00,267
Maybe he's already gone inside.

449
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,066
Really? That eager? Let's go.

450
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:06,627
Bro, don't be anxious.

451
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:08,026
It's all our territory.

452
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:22,907
Mother, were you looking for me?

453
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:23,867
Sit.

454
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,506
I couldn't say anything out there.

455
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,466
A simple warning to Guo is sufficient.

456
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:33,147
We should eat as we please.

457
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,026
So what else did you buy
today at the market?

458
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:38,066
Three more bamboo shoot bundles.

459
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:41,947
Mother, I believe

460
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,306
we do not have a lot of money,

461
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:45,587
so I try to save it.

462
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:48,147
But this is not the way to save.

463
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:49,706
I'm sorry, Mother.

464
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:52,107
I know you're trying to save money.

465
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,546
But Keling is still growing.

466
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:55,867
She needs to eat some meat.

467
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,587
What about this? I'm craving ribs.

468
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:58,667
You go and buy some for me.

469
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:00,026
What?

470
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:01,187
What?

471
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:02,147
Didn't you hear clearly?

472
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,387
I'm craving ribs.

473
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:06,706
I heard you, Mother.

474
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:08,387
What are you still doing here? Hurry up.

475
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:10,066
I...

476
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:12,066
Are you hiding something from me?

477
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:18,066
Tell me, what's going on?

478
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,786
Mother, could you give me back

479
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:20,587
that purple purse?

480
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,947
Just the money inside is fine.

481
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:23,147
That's Jinrong's money.

482
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:24,026
What?

483
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:26,266
Because you took her money,

484
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,387
she took mine.

485
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,466
I still owe her four taels.

486
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:32,827
I don't even know how I got into debt.

487
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:34,387
How dare she.

488
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,066
She dared to save a cache.

489
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:36,827
Where is Chun Jinrong?

490
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,107
She went out.

491
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:40,066
Don't tell her I told you so.

492
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:40,786
Don't worry.

493
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,226
Let her come to me when she comes back.

494
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,907
Understood, Mother.

495
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:45,706
Wait a minute.

496
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,587
Since you're in Jianglin,
learn something useful.

497
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,187
Look at your hair.

498
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,347
Jinrong styled it for me.

499
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:55,427
Chun Jinrong!

500
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,627
Don't tell her I told you so!

501
00:18:57,706 --> 00:18:59,147
I'm going to find her.

502
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:11,907
Why are you following us?

503
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:13,587
It's you.

504
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:14,907
Don't you remember me?

505
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,466
This lad is quite cute.

506
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:24,986
Don't worry.

507
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:26,546
As long as you comply with me,

508
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,506
I won't do anything to you.

509
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:33,506
Who are you?

510
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:34,546
You forgot?

511
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,867
You entered my room

512
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:37,147
at Yuanyang Temple that day.

513
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:41,387
You got the wrong person.

514
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,587
It's you. You even asked me to undress.

515
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:51,187
Darn you, stop talking nonsense.

516
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:52,387
Boss,

517
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,347
that happened?

518
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,107
No.

519
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:57,187
It happened.

520
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,107
You even pinched my face.

521
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:00,986
Don't you remember?

522
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:03,387
You shameless.

523
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:04,587
Shut up.

524
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:05,907
Why are you here?

525
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:07,427
Well,

526
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:09,667
your purse was left at my room.

527
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:18,746
It's not mine.

528
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:20,466
Since it's free, I'll take it.
You can leave now.

529
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:26,187
Boss,

530
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,347
who is he?

531
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:29,226
I don't know him.

532
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:30,427
Don't know?

533
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:33,746
Also, I was in such a rush
to get here today that I forgot to

534
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:35,066
bring back your clothes.

535
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:38,387
Clothes?

536
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,226
Boss!

537
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:44,266
She took off her clothes!

538
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:47,427
I...

539
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:50,387
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

540
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:52,786
Jinrong.

541
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:55,947
You're finally back.

542
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,506
Mother wants you.

543
00:20:58,827 --> 00:20:59,627
Why?

544
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:01,506
I don't know.

545
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:11,827
Did you tell her about the purse?

546
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:13,627
No.

547
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:14,907
I don't know.

548
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:16,706
Maybe Mother guessed it herself.

549
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:19,266
Chun Peilan, you!

550
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,466
If I fail to get married,

551
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:28,066
it will be entirely your fault.

552
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:33,347
Isn't that a bit too serious?

553
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:36,107
Mother, I was wrong.

554
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:38,187
I really know I was wrong.

555
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,147
Can you calm down, please?

556
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:42,627
Go away.

557
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:48,827
It's enough to admit wrongdoing.

558
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:49,986
This time, I'll let it go.

559
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,867
See what happens if you try

560
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:53,827
to hide money from me again.

561
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:54,627
I dare not.

562
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:56,187
Who dares?

563
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:01,627
Mother, I want to
discuss something with you.

564
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:02,587
Speak.

565
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:04,506
Do we have ten taels?

566
00:22:05,187 --> 00:22:06,667
Do I look like ten taels to you?

567
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,907
Mother, I'm not joking.

568
00:22:08,986 --> 00:22:10,226
I have an urgent need.

569
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:11,947
I need to go to that Product Appraisal.

570
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:13,506
What's that?

571
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,627
And it costs ten taels?

572
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,827
That Product Appraisal
is very important.

573
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:18,306
I've already bought my clothes.

574
00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:19,506
Mother,

575
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:22,546
I'm just ten taels away
from getting married.

576
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:24,947
Won't our fifty taels

577
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,226
of external debt be settled

578
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:27,587
once I get married?

579
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:29,867
We can't fail at the last hurdle.

580
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,347
You make it sound so easy.

581
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:33,627
You used Peilan's money
to buy the clothes, didn't you?

582
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:35,627
What do you mean?

583
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,466
Aren't we all one family?

584
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:38,427
Isn't Peilan's money

585
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:39,667
your money?

586
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,387
Isn't our money also your money?

587
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,266
Isn't your money our money?

588
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:45,226
Stop trying to trap me here.

589
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:46,706
No.

590
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,147
Mother, I had no choice.

591
00:22:50,187 --> 00:22:51,187
I have to buy something

592
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,506
at that event.

593
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:54,387
Hard pass.

594
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,907
Mother, I beg you.

595
00:22:57,907 --> 00:22:58,947
Mother.

596
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:02,266
Or you can give me back my five taels.

597
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:03,387
Impossible!

598
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:04,907
Mother! Mother!

599
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,347
- Mother!
- No way!

600
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:07,387
- I beg you.
- I said no.

601
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,706
- Get out of the way.
- Mother.

602
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:10,587
Come down.

603
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,706
Mother, just give it to me.

604
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:15,506
Go away, go away.

605
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,627
I won't go, Mother.

606
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:17,867
If not ten taels, five taels will do.

607
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:18,947
Or even three taels.

608
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:19,827
Get out, get out.

609
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:20,986
I won't go.

610
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,506
If you give it to me, then I'll go.

611
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:25,466
Fine.

612
00:23:28,147 --> 00:23:29,867
That's what happened.

613
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:31,466
I made it clear enough, didn't I?

614
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:33,266
No.

615
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:35,667
Shut up.

616
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:37,667
It's not easy for our boss
to explain things clearly.

617
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,627
Shut up.

618
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:40,706
If you don't explain today,

619
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,107
you're done for.

620
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:43,706
Miss,

621
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,827
I just want to be friends with you.

622
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:47,746
Be friends?

623
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:51,226
If you want to be friends,

624
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,667
just say it.

625
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:53,986
You agreed?

626
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:57,907
Be friends?

627
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,427
Finish this.

628
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:05,427
I can't drink.

629
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:06,907
You won't even show your sincerity

630
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,187
since you want to be friends.

631
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:14,706
What is the connection
between making friends and drinking?

632
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:16,587
Brat!

633
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:17,667
Don't be cocky just because

634
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:18,706
you helped me the last time.

635
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:19,867
Don't be cocky!

636
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:21,627
Bro.

637
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:27,627
I'm not cocky.

638
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,627
Waiter, bring me the basin.

639
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:44,907
Are you okay?

640
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:46,506
I'm fine, Boss.

641
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:50,266
Let's go.

642
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:51,827
No way, Jinrong.

643
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:52,627
No way!

644
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:54,867
It's not appropriate for you
to ask Master for money.

645
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:55,587
You think I want it?

646
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,667
Isn't it all your fault?

647
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:57,226
Once we're in,

648
00:24:57,306 --> 00:24:58,427
cry like you did

649
00:24:58,427 --> 00:24:59,427
when you were younger.

650
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,107
No way, Jinrong.

651
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,347
I can't cry.

652
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:02,867
It's my money.

653
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:03,907
Of course you can't cry.

654
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:05,107
Pour your tears now.

655
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,746
I really can't cry.

656
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:08,746
Then think about Father.

657
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:09,706
And then think about me.

658
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:10,466
How will you explain

659
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,667
to Father if I can't marry?

660
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:14,627
Father!

661
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,867
Good job.

662
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:20,266
Peilan, why are you crying?

663
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:23,986
Master, please save me.

664
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:25,627
Don't cry, Peilan.

665
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:26,587
Crying is unhealthy.

666
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:27,627
What's the matter?

667
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:30,466
Master, Peilan wants
to borrow money from you.

668
00:25:31,427 --> 00:25:32,347
Borrow money?

669
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:39,746
Master, she's crying hard.

670
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:40,947
You can't just ignore it, right?

671
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,427
Alright.

672
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:43,347
I'll get it for you.

673
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:49,907
Take a rest.

674
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:54,466
One tael.

675
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,466
Take it.

676
00:25:55,627 --> 00:25:56,627
Just one tael?

677
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:58,746
Although one tael is not a small sum,

678
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:00,667
I can afford it.

679
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:01,627
Don't worry about me.

680
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:03,706
Is there any left in the account?

681
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:05,746
It's all here.

682
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:09,427
Master, I'm sorry.

683
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:10,466
It's okay, it's okay.

684
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:11,986
(Herbs)
No one ever has enough money

685
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:12,706
when they need it.

686
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:14,427
It's okay, spend it.

687
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,266
Master.

688
00:26:16,746 --> 00:26:18,667
This ginseng is quite valuable, right?

689
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:19,986
Extremely valuable.

690
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,427
A hundred-year-old ginseng, you know.

691
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:22,466
If one person is in danger,

692
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:23,667
it can save a life.

693
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:24,667
If two people are in danger,

694
00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:26,187
it can save two lives.

695
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:27,187
It's very valuable.

696
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:30,746
Peilan,

697
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,827
go pawn it.

698
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:35,587
Isn't that bad?

699
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,827
Think about Father, then think about me.

700
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,667
Do you want me to never get married

701
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,387
for the rest of my life?

702
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,427
Jinrong, please stop.

703
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:47,107
- What if Banxia finds out...
- Chun Jinrong?

704
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:48,867
What are you doing?

705
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,667
Just chatting. What else can we do?

706
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:55,066
This conversation has deep significance.

707
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:58,107
Peilan.

708
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,224
Stop Master.

709
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,907
- Jinrong!
- Wait!

710
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:01,627
Help!

711
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:03,066
Master!

712
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:05,587
What's up?

713
00:27:05,627 --> 00:27:06,986
Are you mad?

714
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:18,466
Hand it over.

715
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,947
You two must have a lot of guts

716
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:28,907
to rob a pharmacy.

717
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:30,746
Mother. It's borrow.

718
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:32,066
Chun Jinrong, shut up.

719
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:33,546
Don't think I won't hit you

720
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:35,226
- because you're thirty.
- Mother.

721
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:37,506
I'm sorry.

722
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:39,546
You too.

723
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:40,667
You simply do

724
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:41,746
whatever she tells you to do.

725
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:44,266
Don't you know that robbing is a crime?

726
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:45,266
Report it, Mother.

727
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:48,867
No way!

728
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:50,147
I have to say it.

729
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,587
This is robbery, and it's very serious.

730
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,226
That's not.

731
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,947
Why can't family take a few things?

732
00:27:53,947 --> 00:27:55,667
Yes, we are all family.

733
00:27:57,387 --> 00:27:58,867
Family, family.

734
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:02,147
Who do you call family?

735
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:03,627
You're here for what?

736
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:04,667
How about the pharmacy?

737
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:06,466
I've spoken to
the guy across the street.

738
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:07,986
If something happens, he'll let me know.

739
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:08,986
You, a man,

740
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:10,827
can't even keep an eye on a ginseng.

741
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:12,867
I'm telling you two,

742
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:14,226
if this happens again...

743
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:15,746
Mother, I won't dare next time.

744
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:16,986
You dare to have a next time?

745
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:20,187
Darn it.

746
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:21,907
No.

747
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:28,667
Young Lord.

748
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:31,667
Found him?

749
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,187
Not yet.

750
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:34,867
Then why are you back?

751
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:35,827
Go and find him quickly.

752
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,506
Find him
or I'll throw you all in the river.

753
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:38,867
Go!

754
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:39,667
Yes!

755
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:41,347
Wait a moment.

756
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:43,986
You have to keep this secret.

757
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:45,506
You can't let my father know,
understand?

758
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:46,466
Understand.

759
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:48,827
Hurry up.

760
00:28:50,226 --> 00:28:50,706
I'm done for.

761
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:53,187
Young Lord, please calm down.

762
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:55,107
I don't think
Fourth Prince is missing.

763
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:56,226
Maybe he'll come back

764
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:57,506
by himself after a while.

765
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:00,986
You dare say that?

766
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,347
What are your eyes for?

767
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:03,107
Panting?

768
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:05,226
You can't even keep an eye
on the person in front of you.

769
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:06,986
Aren't you a fortune teller?

770
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:07,986
Tell me!

771
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:09,387
Tell me!

772
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:10,907
- Spare me!
- Aren't you a fortune teller?

773
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,387
- Spare me!
- Tell me where he is.

774
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:13,667
Or I'll kill you!

775
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:14,706
Young Lord, spare me!

776
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:16,066
You're done for.

777
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:18,587
Useless.

778
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,147
B-Boss, I'm off.

779
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:26,827
I'm fine, don't help me.

780
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:28,107
Surprisingly,

781
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:29,867
you have a strong capacity for alcohol.

782
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:31,746
I didn't expect it either.

783
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:33,986
Where do you live? I'll walk you home.

784
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:36,387
Or should I walk you home first?

785
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:38,107
You walk me home?

786
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:41,907
He's there!

787
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:43,427
Over there.

788
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:44,266
Let's go.

789
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:45,387
Go.

790
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:48,427
Don't run!

791
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:57,986
Miss.

792
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:02,827
That was close.

793
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,226
Are you okay?

794
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:06,066
I think...

795
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,266
I broke my arm.

796
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:09,347
Broke your arm?

797
00:30:09,587 --> 00:30:10,387
This?

798
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:12,907
Bumps and bruises

799
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:13,986
are unavoidable in life.

800
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:14,667
It's okay.

801
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:16,907
It's not a big deal.

802
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:20,266
It's fine.

803
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:24,986
You're back.

804
00:30:25,266 --> 00:30:26,066
I'm back.

805
00:30:26,362 --> 00:30:29,818
(Jiren Pharmacy)

806
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:39,506
Master!

807
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:43,147
Keling?

808
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:44,947
There's no one?

809
00:30:45,786 --> 00:30:46,506
It's been days

810
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:47,907
with no one in sight.

811
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:48,907
Where's Banxia?

812
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:52,187
I have her memorizing prescriptions.

813
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:53,627
Come in, come in.

814
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:54,266
What's wrong?

815
00:30:54,347 --> 00:30:54,907
Come.

816
00:30:57,266 --> 00:30:57,947
Master,

817
00:30:58,026 --> 00:31:00,066
his arm seems to be broken.

818
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:01,107
Can you help him?

819
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:08,187
Come.

820
00:31:08,587 --> 00:31:10,147
- Go, sit there.
- Please have a seat.

821
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:14,107
Right arm?

822
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,387
Wrist, elbow, shoulder. Shoulder?

823
00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:24,827
Serious?

824
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:27,466
How did it get dislocated?

825
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,107
Dislocated?

826
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:30,266
Then it's fine.

827
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:32,627
Bear with it, I'll reset it.

828
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,347
Is Keling lovely?

829
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:44,427
Done.

830
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:46,066
You can move now. No problem.

831
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:47,667
This dislocation is caused by

832
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:49,066
sudden force. Be cautious thereafter.

833
00:31:50,187 --> 00:31:51,746
How did it heal so quickly?

834
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:53,827
Let me see your tongue.

835
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,107
Let me see your tongue.

836
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:00,706
The color of the tongue is good.

837
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,066
Come, let's take a pulse.

838
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:02,907
Come.

839
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:03,947
Come, take a pulse.

840
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:06,347
Is it necessary to take a pulse
after a dislocation, Master?

841
00:32:06,387 --> 00:32:07,667
Is there internal organ damage?

842
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:09,066
No, just dislocated and reset.

843
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:10,587
I want to see
if he has any other symptoms.

844
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,107
Hurry up, let's go.

845
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,347
Why not do a full body check, Mister?

846
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,266
I-I haven't had a patient
in quite some time.

847
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:23,226
This is my home.

848
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:25,226
Here.

849
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,147
Come over.

850
00:32:31,546 --> 00:32:32,226
Shoulder.

851
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:34,066
My shoulder is fine.

852
00:32:34,226 --> 00:32:34,907
This one.

853
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:36,107
Stand still.

854
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,867
Alright, you can go back.

855
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:45,587
By the way, what's your name?

856
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,226
You must not give away

857
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:50,947
your true identity
whenever you're in public.

858
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:53,986
You can call me A-Si.

859
00:32:54,746 --> 00:32:55,667
A-Si?

860
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:57,907
Fate, huh.

861
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:00,147
From now on, you're
the fourth member of my Keling Gang.

862
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:01,506
If someone bullies you,

863
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,387
come find me.

864
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:04,667
Miss, what's your name?

865
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:05,627
Me?

866
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,347
I'm Heroine in...

867
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:12,986
Are you okay?

868
00:33:17,427 --> 00:33:18,506
Hon,

869
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:20,187
I've already made plans with my friends

870
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:22,266
to attend the Product Appraisal.

871
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:26,226
You're always blowing money. Pass.

872
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:28,867
Hon, it's just ten taels.

873
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:31,506
Ten taels?

874
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:38,867
Sure.

875
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:41,506
No pocket money for three months.

876
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:42,867
Three months?

877
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,427
Three months is too long.

878
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:46,947
Can it be two months, Hon?

879
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:51,986
Not a day less.

880
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:53,907
You're a spendthrift.

881
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:58,266
Hon, take care. Hon, be careful.

882
00:33:58,347 --> 00:33:59,387
Hon, goodbye.

883
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:00,427
Hon, be careful.

884
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:08,146
Madam Dong, someone just sent a letter.

885
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:08,867
Who?

886
00:34:08,907 --> 00:34:09,586
I don't know.

887
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:10,626
Off you go.

888
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:16,466
(Xiaoxiao,
I hope this letter finds you well.)

889
00:34:16,827 --> 00:34:19,227
(I was invited to travel to the West.)

890
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:21,947
(I won't be able to attend
the Product Appraisal.)

891
00:34:21,986 --> 00:34:23,347
(I'm really sorry.)

892
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:26,146
Why not just admit it

893
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:27,907
if you don't have money?

894
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:29,227
Geez.

895
00:34:31,546 --> 00:34:32,986
Hon, I'm not going.

896
00:34:33,026 --> 00:34:34,267
I don't need the money anymore.

897
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,747
H-He's back.

898
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:39,466
H-He's back.

899
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:42,307
You're finally back.

900
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:43,546
What happened?

901
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:44,986
Just dislocated it.

902
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:46,026
You dislocated your shoulder?

903
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:47,626
But it's already been reset.

904
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,466
How can you be so careless?

905
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:50,506
Imperial doctor!

906
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,387
Come back!

907
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:52,747
Imperial doctor?

908
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:54,267
You wanted to spread the word?

909
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:55,546
Go.

910
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:57,106
Go get Dr. Li from Optimism Pharmacy.

911
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:57,867
Let him have a look.

912
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:58,466
Yes.

913
00:34:58,546 --> 00:34:59,227
Come back.

914
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:01,506
Secret operation.

915
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:02,626
Yes.

916
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:08,827
You drank?

917
00:35:09,347 --> 00:35:10,267
A bit.

918
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:12,307
Have you been crying?

919
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:13,267
Cried for a while.

920
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:14,427
It's fine.

921
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:16,827
You can't leave
like that next time, Bro.

922
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,827
You don't know how dangerous it is.

923
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:20,506
Bro,

924
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,066
would you do me another favor?

925
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:24,427
What favor?
