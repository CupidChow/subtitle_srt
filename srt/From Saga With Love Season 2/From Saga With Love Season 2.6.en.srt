1
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,840
Japanese toilets are the best.

2
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,719
Let’s change drivers. Hadri, take over.

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,319
No, it’s okay. I can drive.

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,720
It’s fine. Hadri, drive.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay.

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,920
Can’t just stick to the one you have.

7
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
What did you say, Bob?

8
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,640
Nothing.

9
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,560
Hello, Master, Sham!

10
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,280
Hi, darling. How was your roadtrip?

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
I bought so many things for Master.

12
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,520
Here, Master.

13
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,080
Bianca, can we talk?

14
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,439
This is from Karatsu.

15
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,280
-Hadri. -Sham.

16
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
Pleased to see you, Master.

17
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,160
Pleased to see you.

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,200
My name is Hadri, I'm Bianca’s coursemate.

19
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,239
Yes.

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,079
Okay, but Karma needed help, right?

21
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,120
Hadri didn’t wash her hands for no reason.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,719
Bianca, that’s not helping. That’s taking advantage.

23
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,319
Tell him not to try anything on Karma.

24
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,999
You’re just being paranoid.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,599
Hadri is friendly towards everyone. With guys and girls.

26
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
In fact,

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,360
I think he might be gay.

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,119
Why do you think he’s gay?

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
Well, he’s never been interested in me.

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,679
Bianca,

31
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,800
you are indeed hot.

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,559
You are the hottest woman I’ve ever met.

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,080
But just because a guy doesn’t hit on you doesn’t mean he’s gay, okay?

34
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,599
Whatever.

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,159
Anyway, I don’t think he likes Karma like that.

36
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,999
Bianca, trust me, I know what I saw.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There’s something there.

38
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,520
Then you talk to him.

39
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
I didn’t see anything.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,359
Fine, I will.

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Okay.

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,599
So they are arranging a little birthday dinner for me.

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,760
Frankly, I think they just want an excuse to party.

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,960
Anyway, please join us as well!

45
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,719
Okay.

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,039
Wow, Master just invited you to his birthday party.

47
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,160
I know. So sweet, right?

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,079
There’s no need.

49
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,599
You’re busy, right?

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,279
You must still be tired from the roadtrip.

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,879
You’ve got your assignments too.

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,520
It's rude to refuse an invitation from an elderly.

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,479
I’ll surely come, Master. Thank you.

54
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,640
Yay! The more the merrier!

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,039
Okay, we’ll get going.

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,160
See you again soon, Master..

57
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
Okay.

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,319
-Bye, Master! -Goodbye.

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,999
-Bye. I’ll make my move. -Bye.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,760
-Bye, Bob! -Bye.

61
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,360
Bye, darling!

62
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,319
What a busybody.

63
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,000
What’s up with you?

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,960
Did you fight with him?

65
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,879
No.

66
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,160
I’m going to have a shower. I feel hot.

67
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,640
Karma is so funny. I like her.

68
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,439
Do you like her, or are you...

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,799
interested in her?

70
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,720
Why are you asking me that? Isn’t she with Sham?

71
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,120
What’s wrong with you, Bob?

72
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,080
You’ve been sighing this whole time.

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,920
Are you having a problem with your bird?

74
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,720
It’s not about the bird.

75
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Then?

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,640
Yes, she’s with Sham.

77
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,600
So it doesn’t matter how I feel about her.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
She’s not available.

79
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,160
So it’s true that you like her.

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Okay, Karma.

81
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,280
I don’t know what’s going on between you and Hadri.

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,120
But I think you have to set boundaries.

83
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
What?

84
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,559
We’re just friends.

85
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,160
I’m with Sham!

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,519
Okay, it’s good that you’re clear about that.

87
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,679
I just don’t want other people to misunderstand.

88
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,719
Because if I can misunderstand,

89
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,360
it means Sham too would misunderstand if he saw what I saw.

90
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Yes.

91
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,080
I like her.

92
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,480
She's cute and very fun.

93
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,680
I mean fun, when she’s not sad.

94
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,080
She’s not usually sad.

95
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,840
She’s actually always happy.

96
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,999
Has she been with Sham a long time?

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,359
Not really, it hasn’t been a year yet.

98
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,359
But, they are pretty serious.

99
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,199
They even have a shop together.

100
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,399
A pottery shop in Kuala Lumpur.

101
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,519
I see. That’s serious.

102
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,400
Yes, very serious.

103
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,239
Sham is not a jealous person.

104
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,119
When I got lost and Hadri helped me, Sham was totally fine with it.

105
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,159
He trusts me.

106
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,399
And I would never cheat on him.

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,879
No, I’m just reminding you.

108
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,160
We can’t take these things lightly.

109
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,400
I don’t know, Bob.

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,119
I don’t know why I’m struggling so hard.

111
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,639
Whatever I do or don’t do,

112
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,719
I’m still failing as a girlfriend.

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,039
What are you saying?

114
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
You’re not failing, Karma.

115
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,919
Then why do you feel the need to remind me?

116
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,320
Obviously, it's because you think I’ve done something wrong.

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,559
In conclusion, we believe that good social media design and content

118
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,879
can really boost tourism here in Saga.

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,760
Thank you.

120
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,160
Any questions?

121
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,599
Thank you, Bianca and Hadri.

122
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,960
-I will let you know your results soon. -Thank you.

123
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
-Good job, Bianca. -Good job, Hadri.

124
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,840
-Please, let us get an A. -Amen.

125
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,239
Hold on, my mother is calling.

126
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,800
Mum! Hey...

127
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,919
Mum?

128
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,759
Are you crying?

129
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
Yes. A little.

130
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,119
Anyway, how did your presentation go today?

131
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,119
-It went great, Mum. They... -I can’t believe I’m crying

132
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,880
like this over Jeff.

133
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,560
I have to move on, Bianca.

134
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,279
I was thinking, for your semester break,

135
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,959
let’s go somewhere for a holiday, okay?

136
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,599
Somewhere nice.

137
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,079
Just the two of us to spend time together.

138
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,239
I can’t be here, Bianca.

139
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,639
-I need to get out of here. -Okay, Mum.

140
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,600
I need to be somewhere, you know?

141
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,519
Happy birthday to you!

142
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,919
Happy birthday to Master Akiro,

143
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,079
Happy birthday to you.

144
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,519
May he live long.

145
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,239
May he live long, may he be treasured.

146
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,240
May he be treasured.

147
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,399
Thank you so much!

148
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,760
How nice to be surrounded by all you young people.

149
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
I feel young too, now, in this baby costume!

150
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,640
Master says he feels young in this baby costume.

151
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,880
This is what the Japanese wear on their 60th birthday?

152
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,239
Yes, because to the Japanese, 60 is when the new life cycle begins again.

153
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
It’s like being born again.

154
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,559
That’s great. It has cultural significance.

155
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,319
Well, shall we have a drink then?

156
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,240
In Saga, any drinking session must begin with sake!

157
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,599
Master, we don’t drink alcohol, but we will drink juice with you.

158
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,120
Oh, really? More for me, then!

159
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,719
He’ll start drinking now.

160
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,600
-Happy birthday, Master! -Thank you!

161
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
Cut the cake!

162
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,519
Master!

163
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,000
No way!

164
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,360
Master!

165
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,680
Hey, form a circle!

166
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,080
Turn back around!

167
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,839
Don’t throw it, Bob! They’re about to win.

168
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,200
That’s the thing, I’m doing it fast!

169
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,799
It fell! We still have time.

170
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,560
I’m sorry.

171
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Sorry!

172
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,520
Master?

173
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
It's okay, Master. It’s okay.

174
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,399
It’s okay.

175
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:38,600
I can’t even stack plastic cups.

176
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,639
I will never be able to make a real cup again.

177
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,720
Never!

178
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,160
You all can’t understand how I feel.

179
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,480
Pottery has been my whole life.

180
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,960
It’s all I have.

181
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,800
I have...

182
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,640
no one!

183
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,639
It was love at first sight.

184
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,039
He thought he would end up marrying Suzume.

185
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,079
But one day, they had a quarrel.

186
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,279
They were both stubborn, neither would give in.

187
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,199
Until one day he heard that Suzume was moving away.

188
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,839
He didn’t look for her,

189
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,960
thinking that Suzume would look for him.

190
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,719
But she moved away,

191
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,800
and they never saw each other again.

192
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,640
What did they fight about?

193
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
What were you two fighting about, Master?

194
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,440
I don’t even remember.

195
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,680
He doesn’t even remember what they fought about.

196
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,399
I regret not marrying her,

197
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,880
not raising a family.

198
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,120
If I had a child that I could leave my legacy to,

199
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,400
maybe it would be easier for me to accept my illness now.

200
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,760
Unfortunately, the closest thing I have to a child

201
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,040
is this boy who lives so far away.

202
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,400
Master says that Sham is the only one who is like a son to him.

203
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,759
Sham, please ask Master, if he were born again

204
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,080
and couldn’t make pottery, what would he be doing?

205
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,159
Master, Karma is asking.

206
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,000
If you were born again and couldn’t do pottery, what would you do?

207
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,240
I would...

208
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,200
I would...

209
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,160
I would...

210
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
I would...

211
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,760
Master!

212
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,480
A+? Really?

213
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,399
Thank you so much, Professor!

214
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,080
Thank you!

215
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,159
That’s not all.

216
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,479
The tourism board representatives were very impressed by your CV, Bianca.

217
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,999
They’d like to speak to you about a contract as Saga’s tourism ambassador.

218
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,920
Are... Are you serious?

219
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,560
They are offering me a job?

220
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,399
Yes, that’s right.

221
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,839
With your experience, they think you would suit the role very well.

222
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,959
Congratulations, well done.

223
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,400
Thank you so much!

224
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,359
Congratulations, Bianca. That’s so great!

225
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,679
-Okay, let’s celebrate this evening. -Yes!

226
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,560
A+!

227
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,999
You wouldn’t believe it,

228
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,040
but when I was young I could drink three times that amount with no problem.

229
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,040
Sham.

230
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,920
How is your father now, Sham? Better?

231
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,039
Much better.

232
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,079
With physiotherapy, he’s almost back to normal now.

233
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,360
That’s good to hear.

234
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,400
You know, I’m so glad that you patched things up with him.

235
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,199
Family is important, Sham.

236
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,880
Always remember that.

237
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,160
Yes, Master.

238
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,760
My head is in pain.

239
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,319
Can you believe it?

240
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,839
They’re offering me a job, Mum.

241
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,199
Oh, good! You can make some pocket money.

242
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,599
What does an ambassador do?

243
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I don’t know yet.

244
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:11,079
They’ll give me the details when we meet.

245
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,679
But Mum, who knows, if I do this well,

246
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,759
they might even give me a permanent job when I graduate.

247
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,759
Permanent job?

248
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,399
What do you mean?

249
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
You’re coming back here after graduating, right?

250
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Mum.

251
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,039
I like it here.

252
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,879
No one recognises me.

253
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,200
I don’t have to look around, worried about being recorded for social media.

254
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,439
I’m tired, Mum.

255
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,239
Tired of gossip. Tired of being judged.

256
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,120
I can be myself over here.

257
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,920
I can breathe. I feel at peace.

258
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,200
Maybe... I won’t return to Malaysia after graduating.

259
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,599
Absolutely not.

260
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,799
You have a name here.

261
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,279
You’ve spent your whole life building your career.

262
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,799
-You want to throw it all away? -Mum!

263
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,799
Did you hear what I said?

264
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,559
This is why I prefer it over here.

265
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,159
Because I can live a normal life.

266
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,559
Why would you want a normal life?

267
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,360
How many people would want to trade places with you?

268
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,079
Be grateful for what you have.

269
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,720
I’m grateful, Mum. I’m very grateful.

270
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,920
But I’m done with all that.

271
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,920
I’ve paid enough with my privacy.

272
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,439
I want to try and live differently.

273
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,839
-No! -Please, Mum.

274
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,039
No, I won’t allow it!

275
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,160
You’ll come home after graduating. Promise me!

276
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,679
Promise me!

277
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,600
I can’t talk to you when you’re like this.

278
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,959
I’ll call you back later, okay?

279
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,480
Don't you dare hang up on me, Bianca!

280
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,760
-Bianca Rozario! -I love you, Mum. Bye.

281
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Bianca...

282
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,040
-To Bianca and Hadri! -Thank you, guys!

283
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,240
She’s eating it.

284
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,880
Rock, paper, scissors!

285
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Awesome!

286
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,840
Okay. Five, four, three, two...

287
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,439
Maintain that.

288
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,360
So cute!

289
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,000
One, two, three, jump!

290
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,040
Okay, let us see.

291
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,920
-How is it, darling? Isn’t Saga great? -Yes!

292
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,719
Everyone talks about Tokyo and Osaka,

293
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,400
but I feel like Saga is better.

294
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,199
You’ve never been to Tokyo or Osaka, how would you know?

295
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,840
It’s true, I’ve never been to either, but I don’t know...

296
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,720
When I’m here, I feel like I’m back in my hometown.

297
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
Do you think you could live here?

298
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,080
Live here. You mean, move here?

299
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,999
It’s like this.

300
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,999
Master is alone.

301
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,400
There’s no one to take care of him. He only has me.

302
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,280
And I’ve come to see him as my own father

303
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,119
So I was thinking, what if we sold our business in Kuala Lumpur,

304
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,080
and invest that money into moving here.

305
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,760
Darling,

306
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,199
I know you must be surprised.

307
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,440
I understand.

308
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
But I’ve really thought about it.

309
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,800
-I feel... -Sham...

310
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,280
I...

311
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,960
I have something to tell you.

312
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,560
Our shop...

313
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,960
-Our shop has burned down. -Burned down?

314
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,360
How bad is it?

315
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,440
Very bad.

316
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,999
Everything is gone.

317
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,520
The money is gone too.

318
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,320
I didn’t manage to deposit it in time.

319
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,640
I'm sorry, Sham

320
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,720
I’ve been wanting to tell you,

321
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,040
but the timing wasn’t right.

322
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,279
-I'm so sorry, Sham. -Okay.

323
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,640
Okay.

324
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
It’s fine.

325
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,560
We have insurance.

326
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,840
We do have insurance, right?

327
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,320
Karma!

328
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
You didn’t settle the insurance?

329
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
How many times have I told you that insurance is important?

330
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,440
All my money is tied to the shop.

331
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,239
I’m sorry!

332
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,159
I didn’t mean to!

333
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,040
Please, Sham. I’m so sorry!

334
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
I can’t talk to you right now.

335
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,440
Sham.

336
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,400
Sham!

337
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,240
Maybe it’s better if he wasn’t with me.

338
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,440
I just want someone I can rely on.

339
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,680
Don’t think I don’t know you like Karma.

340
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,720
Mum.
