1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,320
Hey!

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,479
What the hell?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,560
What the hell with you!

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,759
I saw you pulling her hair!

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,399
Sham! My hair was caught in the zipper!

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,919
He was just trying to help me get it unstuck.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,199
You’re mistaken, Sham. I was just helping her.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
Helping?

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,440
Sham, about that, Karma didn’t do anything wrong.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,039
If you want someone to blame, blame me.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,479
-Hadri, there’s no need... -Sham!

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,200
Calm down, Sham!

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,720
No wonder Bob doesn’t like you. Damn you!

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,159
If you don’t like me, I understand.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,199
But I’m not lying, and I’m not pretending.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,399
I just say what I feel openly.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,199
And I don’t owe anything to anyone.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,319
Hey, enough.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,200
Hey, Hadri.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,000
Hadri!

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,320
Enough, Hadri.

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,480
Sham, I'll take your bag back first. You text me later!

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Enough.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,480
Good thing he only hit you once.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,359
I told you already, Hadri,

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,440
not to try anything with Karma.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,599
Bob, if you see a girl you like

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,240
with a broken heart,

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,840
will you do nothing?

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,039
I wouldn't.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,119
But I would know my boundaries.

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,920
That’s a lie.

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,760
If...

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,240
and when the time comes for me to let Karma go,

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,200
I will let her go, Bob.

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,439
Only, now is not the time.

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
Then, when?

38
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,159
She’s already with someone else,

39
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,599
what are you waiting for?

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,680
I’m waiting for Karma to tell me to let her go.

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,440
Where are you taking me?

42
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,040
Home. You’ve caused enough problems tonight.

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,680
But...

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,080
My car is at Karma’s house.

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,800
You can go pick it up tomorrow.

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,119
I let him help me then

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,919
because I couldn’t wash my hands by myself.

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,559
I didn’t mean to do anything!

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
Okay, I believe you!

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,479
But at that moment, did you even think, even for a second,

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,920
how I would feel?

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,520
You didn’t, right?

53
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,479
Is it just me who has to think about you?

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,079
Do my best for you?

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
Who’s going to think about me?

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,680
Sham...

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
Do you know how I felt when I heard about it?

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,600
I felt like I didn’t even know you, Karma!

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Like I was an idiot, do you know that?

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,480
Sham, please!

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,880
When you’re angry like this, it scares me.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,400
Sham! Don’t go!

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,799
"Seeing her mother cry,

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,640
Ishaal went to comfort Raihana."

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,760
"Grandma has never forgiven you

66
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,360
because you left her for Papa.

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
And now,

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,280
you don’t want to forgive me either?"

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,880
"Whatever it is,

70
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,720
you’ve made your decision, right?

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
It’s okay.

72
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Go.

73
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,080
Just leave me."

74
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,720
"The world is different now, Mum.

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,800
Everything is easier.

76
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,400
Yes, I have to leave.

77
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,040
But wherever I go,

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,000
I will always need my mother’s love.

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,879
You know how painful it was,

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
when you couldn’t get Grandma’s blessing."

81
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,840
So Mum,

82
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,320
please,

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,000
I’m asking for your blessing,

84
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
to live the life of my choosing.

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
I...

86
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,760
I don’t remember reading that dialogue.

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,480
Because this is from my heart to you, Mum.

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,040
We’re the same, Mum.

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
Stubborn.

90
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,160
We both don’t like to be controlled.

91
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,560
But at the same time,

92
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,320
we just want it our own way.

93
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,000
You’re right.

94
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,280
My whole world has been you, Bianca.

95
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,520
If you are not here,

96
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,120
what would become of me?

97
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I’m...

98
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,440
I’m scared to be alone.

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,640
I know.

100
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I know, Mum.

101
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,160
I know it's scary.

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,480
I’m also worried about you, being all alone here.

103
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,440
I worry about who’s taking care of you.

104
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,760
And who'll help you if anything happens.

105
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
But,

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,240
at the same time,

107
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,720
coming back and being unhappy here,

108
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,400
I don’t want that either.

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
So,

110
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,679
what is your solution?

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,479
What if

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,000
we try a few solutions?

113
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,520
What do you mean?

114
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,760
Maybe you can try and stay in Japan for a while.

115
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
See how you like it.

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,200
If it doesn’t work,

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,320
then we try your suggestion.

118
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
And see how I like it.

119
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,040
And if that still doesn’t work,

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,480
we’ll keep looking for a way that works for us both.

121
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,440
You’re all grown up now.

122
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,880
I love you, Mum.

123
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,360
I love you so much.

124
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,280
I’m sorry, darling.

125
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,640
For scaring you.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,640
Do you think I’m always angry?

127
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
No.

128
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
You’re not always angry.

129
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
You’re patient.

130
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
You’ve put up with all the mistakes I’ve made.

131
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,800
So I’m the one who feels guilty.

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,240
I feel like, no matter how hard I try,

133
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,320
I’m still not good enough for you.

134
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,440
You should be with someone who’s not a burden to you.

135
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,680
You’re not a burden to me.

136
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
That’s a lie.

137
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,560
I’m always doing the wrong thing,

138
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,520
and I don’t know how to communicate.

139
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,360
My red flag is

140
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,000
my inability to communicate.

141
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,080
Is it hard for you

142
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,800
to communicate with me?

143
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,040
Normally, no.

144
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
But...

145
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
when you get angry,

146
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,160
you give me the silent treatment.

147
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,360
And then you just leave.

148
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,200
You can cut me off just like that.

149
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,280
I don’t know how to respond.

150
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,480
I’m sorry.

151
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
I get so frustrated sometimes.

152
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,640
I don’t know how to handle it.

153
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,400
But I really love you.

154
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
Why do you love me?

155
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,759
Because...

156
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,000
you care about everybody.

157
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,040
And you always fix the important things.

158
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, sometimes you make mistakes,

159
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,640
but they’re all really small things.

160
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
The things that matter,

161
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,600
you always know how to fix them.

162
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,000
In this world, I won’t find anyone else like that.

163
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,200
I love you, Karma.

164
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,040
I love you, too.

165
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
I really do.

166
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,719
Why do you love me?

167
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,559
Because you take care of me.

168
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,359
You always help me.

169
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,280
Since the day we met.

170
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,279
Karma,

171
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,039
anyone in a relationship,

172
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,080
will do that anyway.

173
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
Other than what I do for you,

174
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,479
why do you love me?

175
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
Why me?

176
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
You...

177
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
You’re nice.

178
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Me?

179
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Nice?

180
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Do you know anyone who’s not nice?

181
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
If you don’t know why you're with me,

182
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,280
am I truly your first choice?

183
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,640
Or are you just going with the flow?

184
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,440
Because I appeared at the right time in your life.

185
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,520
You don’t know.

186
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,719
Karma, listen here.

187
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
It’s not that you’re not good enough for me.

188
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,320
Not at all.

189
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,560
But I was the one who made you feel like you weren’t good enough.

190
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,000
Sham...

191
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,360
I’m sorry.

192
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
Sham!

193
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,120
Hadri has never made you feel like you weren’t good enough.

194
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,840
Am I right?

195
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,600
Actually, I’m the one who’s not good enough for you.

196
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,559
Karma.

197
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,079
Eat something. You’re going for your interview.

198
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,640
Don’t go on an empty stomach.

199
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,560
You look so pale.

200
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,479
Who’s going to give you a job?

201
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,760
I know your heart is troubled.

202
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,920
But solve your problems one at a time.

203
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
Settle the money issue first.

204
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,160
About the relationship...

205
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,600
I don’t know.

206
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,640
I think that neither you nor Sham is right or wrong.

207
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,720
Maybe the approach isn’t right.

208
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,440
I don’t know what to do.

209
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,600
But,

210
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,400
you both have to remember,

211
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,759
you can’t go in with a mindset of

212
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,840
me against you.

213
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
The mindset should be that we’re both on the same team,

214
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,920
tackling the problem together.

215
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,560
Mum is right.

216
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Wow.

217
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,720
I’ve never thought of it like that.

218
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,840
Thanks, Mum.

219
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,440
Suhaila.

220
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,440
Right now, I just hope Sham doesn’t give up on me.

221
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,280
If it’s meant to be, it will be.

222
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,080
It is God’s will.

223
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,560
Is Hadri handsome?

224
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,000
Suhaila!

225
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,439
He must be.

226
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,919
Mum!

227
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,040
If you don’t want him, pass him over to me.

228
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,160
What is my story even about?

229
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,240
Oh my God, her timing...

230
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,560
God, please protect me.

231
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,799
Hello, Aunty Kathy!

232
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,119
Yes, I know the deadline is tomorrow.

233
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,719
The script is almost ready.

234
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,279
Just a little bit more.

235
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,640
Don’t bother, Bob.

236
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,600
You still don’t know what your story is about, right?

237
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,439
Are you a fortune teller?

238
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
You know what?

239
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:41,719
It's fine.

240
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,879
If you have to return the grant,

241
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,240
just return it.

242
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,120
We’ll just look for another one later.

243
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
Are you sure, Aunty?

244
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,240
You can’t force creativity.

245
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,799
And I’ve come to realise

246
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,600
that there are many ways to do something.

247
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,240
So if you’re unable to make a film using this grant,

248
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,799
we’ll find another way.

249
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,680
When your script is ready.

250
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Wow.

251
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Wow.

252
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,200
Aunty... I...

253
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,640
I’m so touched. I suddenly feel much lighter.

254
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,520
Why are you feeling so emotional?

255
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,999
Okay, let’s discuss it later.

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,439
Okay. Thank you.

257
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,320
Thank you, Aunty.

258
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:36,479
Thank you very much.

259
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,040
Thank you.

260
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,920
You’ve never had a long-term job. Why is that?

261
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,559
I don’t like doing the same thing every day.

262
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,040
So that’s why I like to look for different kinds of jobs.

263
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,239
If that’s the case, I don’t think this job is suited to you.

264
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,879
Before this, I worked at a pottery store

265
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,719
for about 6 months.

266
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,519
So actually I am able to do the same things every day.

267
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,240
Only the shop burned down.

268
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,719
And that’s why I have to look for another job.

269
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,199
Why couldn’t you do the same thing every day before,

270
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,320
but now you can?

271
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
I think I’m more mature now.

272
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,760
Everything is exciting in the beginning,

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,519
but to go to the next level,

274
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,440
we have to do the same thing every day.

275
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,040
Keep learning.

276
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,000
Keep improving.

277
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,199
If we keep changing,

278
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,119
we’ll never grow.

279
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,639
So what has changed your mindset so drastically?

280
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,080
Mindset...

281
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,359
Congratulations!

282
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,239
I knew you could do it. When do you start?

283
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,559
Next week, Aunty.

284
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,239
Praise be to God. I’m so grateful.

285
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,799
Okay, come by my house this afternoon?

286
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,360
I have a surprise for you.

287
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,799
What kind of surprise?

288
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,679
Aunty, please don’t go to any trouble.

289
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,999
Just come over. I’ll see you later.

290
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,480
Okay, Aunty. Bye!

291
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,720
Hi, Hadri.

292
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,480
How are you? Are you okay?

293
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,880
A little sore, but okay.

294
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,920
Sorry.

295
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,999
You got hurt because of me.

296
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,200
No.

297
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,240
If I were Sham, I’d punch myself too.

298
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,800
Are you okay?

299
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,079
I’m not sure.

300
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,639
We spoke at length yesterday.

301
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,799
I thought it was going to be okay.

302
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,240
But then, afterwards, Sham asked,

303
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,039
why I love him.

304
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,279
Suddenly, I couldn’t think.

305
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,199
I didn’t know how to answer him.

306
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,759
Karma,

307
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,639
you must know

308
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,119
what you see in him

309
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,880
and why you chose him.

310
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,520
Yesterday,

311
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,520
I didn’t know.

312
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,000
But today, I do.

313
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,920
And that’s why I have to keep trying with him.

314
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,120
That is, if he wants to keep trying with me.

315
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,759
Whatever your reasons are for choosing him,

316
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,280
he’s a very lucky guy.

317
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,879
I’m lucky too, Hadri.

318
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,119
It’s true. And I hope one day,

319
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,839
you’ll find someone

320
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,800
who’ll make you feel how Sham makes me feel.

321
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,600
Thank you, Hadri, for the ride.

322
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,359
I have no idea what Aunty Kathy’s surprise is going to be.

323
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
It’s always something.

324
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,400
One day,

325
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,480
when everything has settled down,

326
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
we’ll hang out, okay?

327
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,879
Okay. But we have to inform Sham first.

328
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,040
Or I’ll get another punch to the face.

329
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,480
No, you won’t. God willing, he’ll be okay.

330
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,400
I’m off now.

331
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,320
Take care, Karma.

332
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,440
-Bye. -Bye.

333
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,999
HADRI: THE TIME HAS COME. I’M LETTING HER GO.

334
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,520
Good for you, bro.

335
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,640
You finally let her go.

336
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,360
Let it go.

337
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,880
Let it go when the time comes.

338
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,320
Is this real, Aunty Kathy?

339
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,480
It is.

340
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,279
-But if you don’t want it... -I do!

341
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,080
Thank you, Aunty!

342
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:03,160
Thank you so much!

343
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
But...

344
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,079
Is it okay for you to lend me this much money?

345
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,799
It’s fine.

346
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,519
Now that you have a job,

347
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,160
you can pay me back monthly.

348
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,279
Sham can also use the money to move to Japan.

349
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,239
If he needs to.

350
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,800
I’m so touched that you have this much faith in me.

351
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,560
That’s why I’ve prepared the loan agreement,

352
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,919
You may be like my own daughter,

353
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,119
but I don't do anything without a proper agreement.

354
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,839
Remember that.

355
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,880
Yes, Aunty. Thank you.

356
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,120
Not just for the money.

357
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,520
I’ve learned a lot of things from you.

358
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,399
I’ve also learned a lot of things from you.

359
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,880
Especially about flags.

360
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,479
Yes, Aunty.

361
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,239
We have to work hard to achieve our dreams of becoming green flags.

362
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,880
-Let's do our best! -Yes!

363
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,520
-“Hai!” -“Hai!”

364
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
“Hai.”

365
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Karma!

366
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,719
Sham is on the way to the airport!

367
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,239
Bob texted that he tried calling you but you didn’t pick up.

368
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,560
Oh no! I kept it on silent for the interview just now!

369
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,720
BOB 5 MISSED CALLS

370
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Okay, let’s go!

371
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,679
-Surely he’s not leaving me? -Karma, we’ll stop him!

372
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,600
-Drive carefully! -Okay, Mum!

373
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,640
You're driving so slowly.

374
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,720
Sham, you know that I’m a careful driver.

375
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,920
We’ll make it, don’t worry.

376
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,240
Don’t take too long or I’ll miss my flight.

377
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,240
Do you think I'm that clingy?

378
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,280
As if!

379
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,320
Sham?

380
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,480
-Don’t you think that... -Bob.

381
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
Enough.

382
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,200
This is the best for her.

383
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,840
Hadri?

384
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,559
Sham, I can face anything as long as I'm with you.

385
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,559
Please don't give up on us.

386
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,520
Love always, your Karma.

387
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,960
HADRI: HER HEART HAS NEVER BELONGED TO ANYONE ELSE. ONLY YOU.

388
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Turn around.

389
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,680
Turn around, I have to see Karma!

390
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Okay.

391
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,599
-Hello? -Sham!

392
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,199
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

393
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,799
Wait for me, please?

394
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,120
I’m not leaving! I’m turning back now!

395
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,640
Don’t you leave me!

396
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,680
Sorry, darling. I won’t leave you!

397
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,759
Sham?

398
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,199
Stop! Bianca, stop!

399
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,359
Bob, stop!

400
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,640
That’s Sham.

401
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,719
I know now why I love you.

402
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,040
You make me feel like I want to be the best version of myself.

403
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,680
'Karma level 9000'.

404
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,040
And you’re the only person who makes me feel that.

405
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,120
So please,

406
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,480
don’t go, darling.

407
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,320
I’m staying.

408
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,600
I’m not leaving you.

409
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,600
Forever, right?

410
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
Forever.

411
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,320
Yes!

412
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,719
SIX MONTHS LATER

413
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,480
Until one day, the waves whispered,

414
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,520
“Enough.”

415
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,040
“Enough with your endless questions.”

416
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,640
“Enough with the memories you keep replaying.”

417
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,360
“Enough with going through that heartbreak again and again.”

418
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,640
In that moment, I realised that I cannot put my life on hold.

419
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,079
And with a single breath, I collected myself.

420
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,680
And I let her go,

421
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,960
with the wind,

422
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,080
with my feelings,

423
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
with time.

424
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,240
FOR TIME

425
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,320
A FILM BY BAHARI MALIK.

426
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,440
Bob,

427
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,200
Congrats. But it’s so deep, I don’t get it.

428
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,239
Yes!

429
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,999
If it's difficult to understand, it will win a lot of awards.

430
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,600
Ladies and gentlemen, "For Time"!

431
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,400
Please welcome the director, Bahari 'Bob' Malik!

432
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,879
Have you watched Bob’s movie yet?

433
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,479
Don’t forget to watch it, okay?

434
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,239
The film has won many awards.

435
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,839
One, two, three, Bob!

436
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,679
But that’s not the best part about the movie.

437
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,199
The best part is,

438
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,920
because of this movie, someone met their match!

439
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,480
Don’t be jealous.

440
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,680
Even older people can fall in love, you know.

441
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,399
Who would have thought?

442
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,439
Sham was supposed to move to Japan to live with Master,

443
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,079
but it turns out Master is the one who moved to Malaysia!

444
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,720
What a plot twist!

445
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,200
Speaking of soulmates...

446
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,319
After everything that happened,

447
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,839
Sham and I are stronger than ever.

448
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,679
Like Mum said, we’re a team.

449
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,800
And finally...

450
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,000
Will you be my life partner despite all my shortcomings?

451
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,560
Our team is now official!

452
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,839
#TillJannah,

453
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,599
#MaSham!

454
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,120
So cringey.

455
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,800
#FromSagaWithLove!
