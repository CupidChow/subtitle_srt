1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,960
Karma.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,960
Is Master okay?

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,840
He’s passed out.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,520
He’s really drunk.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,599
Poor Master.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,280
It should be a happy birthday.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,200
Not a sad birthday.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,080
If I couldn’t pursue my passion,

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,080
I'd be depressed too.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,279
Well, the Japanese do say,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,959
when you reach 60,

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,280
it’s like being born again.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,039
I guess, like it or not,

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,840
Master has to start a new life, without pottery.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,480
He has no other passions?

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,360
Any unfulfilled dreams?

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,800
He’s been doing pottery since he was a child.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,519
It’s been in his family for generations.

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,759
But before he mastered pottery,

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,680
didn’t he have anything else he liked to do?

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
I don’t know.

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,799
Even if he did, he left it behind a long time ago.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,240
Pottery is his whole life.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,840
When I was doing pottery,

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,439
he just watched the clay.

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
His face...

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,600
It was like he was looking at a picture of someone who’s gone.

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,280
Don’t think I don’t know that you like Karma.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
Listen carefully.

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,759
Sham and Karma may have had a fight today,

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,560
but they’ll be fine again tomorrow.

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,240
So don’t try to get involved, okay?

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,880
Are you sure?

34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
Of course I’m sure.

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,960
Hold on, sure about what?

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,520
Are you sure they’ll be fine tomorrow?

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
I’m sure.

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
The day after tomorrow?

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Next week?

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Next month?

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Bob, I haven’t known Karma for long.

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,680
But in that short time, I've only seen her sadness.

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,520
And every time she’s down, it’s always because of Sham.

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,560
Am I right?

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,160
That’s what a relationship is, Hadri.

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,159
It can’t just be all laughs everyday,

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,199
it’s going to have ups and downs.

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
But what if there are more bad times than good?

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
Is it worth it?

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,400
If Karma’s happy, I wouldn’t interfere,

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
but I don’t see her being happy.

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,319
If she’s better suited to someone like me,

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,880
I don’t think it’s wrong for me to try.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,280
Don’t you want to see her happy?

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
Isn’t she your friend too?

56
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,760
Sham, calm down.

57
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,320
Why are you throwing a fit in the middle of the night?

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,280
You’re the problem!

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,640
Why didn’t you tell me, Bob?

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,280
My shop burned down!

61
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Sham,

62
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,600
I wanted to tell you.

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
But Karma wanted to tell you herself.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,119
Sham, Karma really wanted to tell you

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,280
but she didn’t know how.

66
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,319
You were worried about Master.

67
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,799
She didn’t want to add to your stress,

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,439
she was waiting for the right time.

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,160
There was never a right time

70
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,560
for her to tell me that my shop had burned down.

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,600
My money’s all gone, Bob.

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
I was depending on that money.

73
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,200
I had everything planned.

74
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,400
Sham, I understand.

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
But it happened.

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,719
Karma didn’t mean to keep it from you.

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
She was scared. And if this is how you react, I understand why.

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
Then how am I supposed to react?

79
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,199
I told her early on,

80
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,439
to settle the shop’s insurance.

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,560
She didn’t do it at all. It’s been months.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,559
Now that it has come to this,

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,000
how do you expect me to react?

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,360
I’m tired, Bob.

85
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,079
Tired of managing everything.

86
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,800
Being the one to handle everything.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I just want someone I can rely on.

88
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,320
So then,

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,160
are you going to break up with her?

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
I don’t know.

91
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,720
All I know is someone else needs me more

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
because he can’t take care of himself.

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,600
And that person is Master.

94
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Mum.

95
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,880
You didn’t tell me you were coming.

96
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Why?

97
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,600
So you can plan your escape?

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,079
Mum, don’t be like this.

99
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,520
You’re spoiling for a fight.

100
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,840
What do you expect?

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
You hung up on me!

102
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,160
And then you turned off your phone.

103
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,920
-I am your... -Mother! I know!

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,240
I'm sorry, Mum.

105
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,560
But I didn’t want us to fight then.

106
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,520
Better to cool down first, right?

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Okay.

108
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,560
I’ve cooled down.

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,480
So, what have you got to say for yourself?

110
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,880
What do you mean?

111
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,640
Don't ask me that!

112
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,960
How could you even...

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,960
Aunty Kathy!

114
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,560
When did you arrive?

115
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,600
I just got here.

116
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,160
What’s wrong? Are you okay?

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,479
I'm okay.

118
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,560
Sorry, Aunty.

119
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,200
I have a headache.

120
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,880
I'll go and take a shower first.

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,079
What happened?

122
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,240
Looks like she's been crying.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,160
She fought with Sham.

124
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
What about?

125
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,360
Long story.

126
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,000
Anyway, let’s have breakfast?

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,160
Why not. Where?

128
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Hold on.

129
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,320
Good morning! Breakfast?

130
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Wow. You’ve never brought me breakfast before.

131
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,760
You must want to check on Karma.

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Is she okay?

133
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,320
I’ll go and check.

134
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,560
Come in.

135
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,360
Sorry, I didn’t know you had a guest.

136
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,840
It's okay, this is my mother.

137
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,240
Mum, this is Hadri, my coursemate.

138
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,600
Aunty.

139
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,279
Hadri, is it?

140
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,359
Yes.

141
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,560
Full name?

142
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,040
Hadri Zafri, Aunty.

143
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,560
How do you spell that?

144
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,920
-How do you spell that? -H...

145
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Karma?

146
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,600
Hadri is here to speak to you.

147
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
What course are you taking here?

148
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,639
I’m taking art and...

149
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Hadri?

150
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Come in.

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,400
Here’s coffee for you, Aunty.

152
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Karma?

153
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,399
I was going to ask if you were okay

154
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,800
but you’re obviously

155
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
not okay.

156
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,440
Do you want to talk about it?

157
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,920
There’s nothing to talk about.

158
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,520
It’s my fault.

159
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,840
Is it your fault or

160
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,120
is Sham blaming you?

161
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
It’s my fault, Hadri.

162
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,840
Can you fix it?

163
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
Fix it?

164
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,360
Is Karma two-timing?

165
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,119
Of course not.

166
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
Karma won’t do that.

167
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,359
Can you not assume?

168
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,040
Then, what is that boy doing here?

169
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,680
Obviously he likes Karma.

170
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,480
Karma’s pretty impressive.

171
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
Only been here a few days, and she’s already got it.

172
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,240
You’ve been here longer, and you still don’t have any.

173
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Wait.

174
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,840
Are you staying here because you have a Japanese boyfriend?

175
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,000
Who is he?

176
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,080
-I’ll kill him! -Mum!

177
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,479
I don’t have a boyfriend,

178
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,479
Malay or Japanese or Caucasian.

179
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,320
-I don’t! -How can that be?

180
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,280
You’re ten times prettier than Karma.

181
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,279
If she can have two boyfriends,

182
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,479
you can too!

183
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,719
Don’t hide it from me.

184
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Mum, please. Don’t assume.

185
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,600
That must be him.

186
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,400
Oh my God!

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Okay.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,640
Bianca, how’s Karma? Is she okay?

189
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,720
I think it's not the right time now.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,080
-Why don’t you... -Is that you, Bob?

191
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,120
Aunty Kathy! What are you doing here?

192
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,520
Can I not visit my own child?

193
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,000
Of course you can.

194
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,440
You can.

195
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,119
Bianca, I want to see Karma.

196
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
Just for a while. It’s important.

197
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,120
Hold on, let me ask her.

198
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,280
Come in.

199
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,920
Sorry, guys.

200
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:55,720
Karma, Bob is here and he’s insisting to speak to you.

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,239
Hadri, stay in the room.

202
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,639
Don’t let Bob see you.

203
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,200
What?

204
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,719
Why? We’re not doing anything.

205
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,559
Doesn’t matter. It won’t look good for Karma!

206
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,399
Hadri, please?

207
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,320
Or it will get worse. Please.

208
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,200
Fine.

209
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,640
Where’s your script?

210
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,960
I have it!

211
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,959
It’s almost ready.

212
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,400
Just a few more pages.

213
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
Good!

214
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,399
What’s the story about?

215
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,800
The story?

216
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,240
The plot. The tale.

217
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,320
The narrative is...

218
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,199
The premise, Aunty...

219
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Bob.

220
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
But...

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,879
If I tell you now,

222
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,080
then it won't be as good.

223
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,439
You have to read it yourself, to get a clearer...

224
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,880
The story, now.

225
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,759
The story?

226
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,440
Once there was this guy...

227
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
The girl, right?

228
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,680
Is it a guy or a girl?

229
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,240
A guy who becomes a girl.

230
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,240
-Edgy! -Edgy, right?

231
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,239
That’s what I’ll be doing!

232
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,439
It’s in the style of those dramas that always win awards.

233
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,599
Festival movies?

234
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,400
Yes, but not exactly like that.

235
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,160
It’s like...

236
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,400
Karma!

237
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,440
Mum, let’s eat?

238
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
I understand now.

239
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,640
Karma isn’t two-timing.

240
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,440
She’s three-timing!

241
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,920
Oh God.

242
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Karma.

243
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,920
You have to do something

244
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,039
because Sham is really frustrated right now.

245
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,359
Right now, everything depends on you.

246
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,240
It depends on you to fix your relationship.

247
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,200
How?

248
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
My head’s a mess.

249
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,720
What should I do?

250
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,079
Okay. Maybe you can show him that you’re dependable?

251
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,920
That you’re responsible and mature. Something like that.

252
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,919
He thinks I’m not mature

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,119
and not responsible?

254
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,200
No, that’s not it. I’m just using my own words.

255
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Maybe you can pay some of his money back?

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,480
It’s a lot of money, Bob!

257
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,519
I even had to borrow your money to come here.

258
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,600
How am I going to pay back such a big amount?

259
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
I don’t know.

260
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,400
But I’m confident you’ll find a way.

261
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,519
Hey, Karma. You have to find a way.

262
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,600
Please. Because I don’t want to see you guys break up, okay?

263
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Maybe...

264
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
it’s better if...

265
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,960
he’s not with me.

266
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,000
I keep troubling him.

267
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,719
Causing endless problems.

268
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,279
Karma, don’t say that!

269
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,960
It’s true, right?

270
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,800
Maybe it’s better if he’s with someone else.

271
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,880
Someone he can rely on.

272
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,199
Someone not like me.

273
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Karma.

274
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Karma!

275
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,040
Give her some space.

276
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
If you’re done with Karma,

277
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,760
come here and continue the story.

278
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,520
Actually, I really want to talk to you but...

279
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,839
What time is it now? I have an appointment.

280
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,159
I have to go wash the laundromat.

281
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,760
We’ll catch up soon. Bye, Aunty!

282
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,520
Karma?

283
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,120
Maybe you and Sham need a bit of space right now.

284
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,640
Why don’t you go back to Kuala Lumpur?

285
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,920
I have to go back to Kuala Lumpur this week.

286
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,240
My mother is getting married.

287
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,480
If you go back, call me, and we’ll hang out.

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Guys,

289
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,840
Bob has left.

290
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,200
If you need anything,

291
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I’m here.

292
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,120
Even if it’s only for a good cry.

293
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Anything, just text me.

294
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Stay strong, okay?

295
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,839
KARMA: SHAM, I KNOW THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. THE SHOP BURNED DOWN, WITH NO INSURANCE.

296
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,839
THEN I WAITED WAY TOO LONG TO TELL YOU. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE ANGRY.

297
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,639
EVEN IF I APOLOGISED A THOUSAND TIMES, IT WOULDN’T MATTER.

298
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
You’d better not be taking a photo of me in here.

299
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
Of course not, Master.

300
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,159
KARMA: I DON’T KNOW HOW, BUT I PROMISE I’LL PAY BACK ALL THE MONEY.

301
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,039
I JUST HOPE YOU CAN BE A BIT PATIENT.

302
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:29,759
KARMA: I'M GOING BACK TO KL TO START EARNING SOME MONEY.

303
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:37,040
CAN WE MEET BEFORE I LEAVE?

304
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,159
SHAM: KARMA, I...

305
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,439
SHAM IS TYPING...

306
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,560
SHAM IS OFFLINE

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,439
Mum, you’ve already had two cups.

308
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,119
You can’t have too much coffee, or you’ll get anxiety.

309
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,879
It's okay, Japanese coffee is so light.

310
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,999
I don’t feel any effect at all.

311
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,640
You never listen.

312
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Who’s not listening to whom?

313
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Mum.

314
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
Tell me the truth.

315
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,480
You have a boyfriend over here, right?

316
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,919
That’s why you don’t want to come back to Kuala Lumpur.

317
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,320
Mum, I don’t have a boyfriend anywhere.

318
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,520
I don’t believe you.

319
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,119
If you don’t have a boyfriend, then why don’t you want to go back?

320
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,920
I told you, I love it here!

321
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,000
I have privacy, different opportunities,

322
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,960
lots of things I can do, not just acting.

323
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,680
Okay, fine.

324
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,600
I hear you.

325
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,559
Thank you.

326
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,119
You’re bored of playing the same stereotypical character.

327
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,479
Yes.

328
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,680
It's always the village girl, the other woman, the token hot girl.

329
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I know.

330
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,800
So I found you a different kind of role.

331
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,000
You would love this!

332
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
This one,

333
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,199
is about a female astronaut who has to survive alone

334
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,320
while fighting aliens.

335
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,080
This one is about a set of triplets who were separated at birth.

336
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,840
Three roles in one movie

337
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,159
-And this one... -Mum...

338
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,399
Stop. We agreed on this.

339
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,199
I'm taking a break from acting to study.

340
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
And you said okay.

341
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,439
Exactly!

342
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,280
A break to study.

343
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,599
Not to look for work here

344
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,239
and definitely not to move here permanently!

345
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,200
Why not?

346
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:51,039
Why can’t I move here if I want to?

347
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,960
If you move here, what happens to me?

348
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,639
SHAM: WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?

349
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,279
KARMA: I DON’T KNOW YET. I HAVEN’T BOUGHT MY TICKET.

350
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:19,280
SHAM IS TYPING...

351
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,999
SHAM: YOU SHOULD HEAD BACK FIRST. IT’S NOT THAT I DON’T WANT TO MEET UP,

352
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
BUT I’M AFRAID I’LL SAY SOMETHING I’LL REGRET.

353
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,519
KARMA: IT’S OKAY. YOU’RE STILL ANGRY.

354
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,239
I UNDERSTAND.

355
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,959
SHAM: I’M NOT ANGRY.

356
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,159
KARMA: REALLY? I...

357
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:59,040
SHAM: I’M DISAPPOINTED.

358
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,080
I know it’s hard for you to be apart from me.

359
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,080
It’s hard for me too.

360
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,080
I worry about you, and I don’t want you to feel lonely.

361
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,839
I’m happy that you’re dating again.

362
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,480
If I could, I’d want to be there to make sure all those men are good guys.

363
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,159
Exactly, Bianca.

364
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,320
I need you at home.

365
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,320
But at the same time,

366
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
I don’t want to go back to my old life.

367
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,000
The longer I stay here, the more I realise that I need my privacy.

368
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,040
In Malaysia, everyone knows who I am since I was a kid.

369
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,120
So it’s my fault for letting you act since you were young?

370
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,920
-I’m a bad mother, right? -No.

371
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,400
That’s not what I’m saying.

372
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,360
You’re my mother and I love you.

373
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,600
I love you too, Bianca.

374
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,400
I can’t stand you being so far away from me.

375
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,880
I don’t want to be so far away from you either.

376
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,720
Okay Mum, just hear me out.

377
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,280
Have you ever thought that maybe, just maybe...

378
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,600
you’d consider moving here?

379
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,919
Please. What am I going to do here?

380
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,839
Anything you want, Mum.

381
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,719
Nowadays, there are a lot of things you can do remotely.

382
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,639
Yes!

383
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,999
You can do whatever you want to, from Kuala Lumpur!

384
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,119
You don’t want to be a public figure? Okay, fine!

385
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,479
You don't have to act anymore.

386
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,959
People will forget you in two or three years.

387
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,840
You can have your privacy back.

388
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,280
I don't know about that.

389
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,719
Okay Mum, you know what?

390
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,560
I’m not even done with my studies yet

391
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,440
and who knows what’s going to happen next month, next year.

392
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,760
Who knows, maybe you’ll get a Japanese boyfriend.

393
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,600
And I might get married to a Malaysian. Who knows?

394
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,920
Instead of moving here for a man,

395
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,719
I’d rather move here for you.

396
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,400
And rather than moving to Kuala Lumpur for some guy,

397
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,240
it’s better to come home for you.

398
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,759
Right?

399
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,040
As long as we’re together, doesn’t matter where it is.

400
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,199
Yes.

401
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,800
Everything else can be sorted out.

402
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,920
I just need my mother with me.

403
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,600
And I need my daughter.

404
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,760
At least, now you know what’s important.

405
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,000
I promise you, our lives in Kuala Lumpur will be so different.

406
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,480
Wait.

407
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,480
Just now, you said

408
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,320
it doesn’t matter where we are as long as we’re together.

409
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,839
So you’d consider moving here, right?

410
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
No.

411
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,440
You said as long as I was with you.

412
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Which means you’ll be coming back to Kuala Lumpur.

413
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,200
You only hear what you want to hear!

414
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,279
Nothing is decided, Mum.

415
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,600
What are you saying?

416
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,720
Are you still set on your crazy idea to move here?

417
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,039
I’m not going to allow it!

418
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
I don't care whether you allow it or not.

419
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,399
It is my life.

420
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
You can’t tell me what to do!

421
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,400
Do whatever you want to do.

422
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
I’m going home.

423
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,920
Coming here was a waste of time.

424
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,159
I shouldn’t have come.

425
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,959
Go ahead, sulk all you want.

426
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,520
Fine! Go!

427
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,119
Aunty.

428
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Bianca.

429
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,679
Do you want to go out and eat?

430
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,200
No!

431
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,560
Seriously? Sham is not going to see you before you leave?

432
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,920
He’s such an idiot.

433
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,440
It’s okay, Bob.

434
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
Let him cool down.

435
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,760
Anyway, I have something to tell you.

436
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
About Sham?

437
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,560
No. About Master.

438
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,759
Is it Sham's issue or yours?

439
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,079
Today is a bit of a special day for Rin.

440
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,519
So what will she be doing?

441
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,280
It feels good to play with the earth again.

442
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,159
He washed and washed...

443
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,240
What are you talking about?
