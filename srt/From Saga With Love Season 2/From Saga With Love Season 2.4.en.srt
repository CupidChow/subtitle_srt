00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,880
Sorry! Coming through!

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Excuse me!

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Coming through!

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,320
Excuse me! Sorry!

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
Karma.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,000
Sorry, Hadri.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,479
Can you help me look for Sham?

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,920
No problem. Where is he?

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,280
At a photography shop.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,520
It’s near a statue that spews out water when you shake its hand.

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,960
Like this. Do you know it?

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,400
-The Lucky Boy statue? -Yes!

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Okay.

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Sham!

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,720
Where did you go?

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,480
I’ve been looking for you.

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,320
Sorry, I got lost. The wind blew this photo away.

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,000
I chased after it and before I knew it, I was at a public phone.

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
Who is this?

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,560
Hadri. He's Bianca’s coursemate.

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
He’s Malaysian, too.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,720
I wanted to call you but my phone ran out of battery.

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,160
I only had Hadri’s number.

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,840
Thanks, bro.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
No problem.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Okay, I’ll make a move. Call me if there’s anything.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,520
Are you upset?

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
No.

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
It’s just...

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,640
You don’t know my phone number?

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,640
Who remembers phone numbers nowadays?

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Do you remember my phone number?

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,560
-012 35... -Oh no...

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Next time,

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
remember my number.

36
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,319
So you can call me if you need help.

37
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Okay?

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,320
You want to meet Jeff?

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,679
Of course.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,360
I want to meet the guy who managed to win your heart.

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,480
Must be a hunk.

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,040
Okay, sweetheart.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,280
He’s in Singapore, seeing his family.

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,839
He’ll be back in KL tomorrow.

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,160
I’ll arrange for a video call with you, okay?

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,840
Yes, please.

47
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,439
Okay Mum, I’ll talk to you later.

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,919
Okay, take care.

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,640
-Bye. -Bye. Love you.

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,880
KATHY: MY DAUGHTER WANTS TO MEET YOU.

51
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,519
All right, I’m going to go.

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,560
You know how to get to Master Akiro’s place, right?

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Yes.

54
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,700
Don’t worry.

55
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,600
I’m only worried because it’s you.

56
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,519
Please don’t be like my sisters,

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
they’re always hovering over me.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,760
Can you blame us?

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Anyway, are you hanging out there today?

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,680
Yes.

61
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,440
I should help where I can. To get Sham in a better mood.

62
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Okay, good luck.

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,440
Text me when you’re there.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,559
Yes, ma’am!

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,640
Okay, take care.

66
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
-Bye! -Bye.

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,040
KATHY: MY DAUGHTER WANTS TO MEET YOU. (SENT)

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,639
KATHY: MY DAUGHTER WANTS TO MEET YOU. (SENT)

69
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,480
KATHY: HEY YOU, ALL OKAY? YOU’VE BEEN QUIET.

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,880
Hello!

71
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,360
So excited? What’s up?

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,440
There he goes, showing off.

73
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,520
-Hi, Master. -Hi, Karma.

74
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Sham, I came here to help.

75
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
Cooking...

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,080
Or cleaning...

77
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,360
Or cooking...

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
What do you want to eat?

79
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,120
Don’t worry about cooking.

80
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
We have a food expert.

81
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,279
Karma!

82
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,799
Let’s party!

83
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,040
Yes!

84
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Master!

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Master!

86
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,439
Master, I’m sorry!

87
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,560
Sorry. I’m sorry, Master!

88
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Darling.

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Why don’t you spend some time with Bianca?

90
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,440
Don’t worry about us.

91
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
We can manage.

92
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,160
-But... -Sham is right.

93
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,720
Besides, I haven’t been to the university. Shall we?

94
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
Okay.

95
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
-Bye. -Bye.

96
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,200
-Thanks, bro. -No problem. Bye.

97
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,240
Karma!

98
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,120
I didn’t mean to do it.

99
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,680
I just wanted to help.

100
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,520
But, I don’t know.

101
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,440
I didn’t expect it to turn out like this.

102
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,720
Okay, you know what?

103
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,720
-Why don’t we... -Bianca!

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
Hadri!

105
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,119
Hadri, meet Bob.

106
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,000
-Bob, meet Hadri. -Hi, Bob.

107
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,520
-So, you’re Hadri. -Yes, I am. Why?

108
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,040
It’s nothing.

109
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
Hadri, since you’re here...

110
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Here.

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,400
Sorry. I’m really sorry.

112
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,680
I didn’t notice there was a red sock in the load.

113
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,760
It’s okay. Not a problem.

114
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,480
It’s like a new scarf!

115
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,799
You’re not angry?

116
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Why?

117
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,439
Do I not look good in pink?

118
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,240
No, I mean...

119
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,279
I've ruined your scarf.

120
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,279
It’s not ruined. I can still wear it, right?

121
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,360
Anyway, it’s just a scarf.

122
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,479
As I was saying,

123
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
why don’t you come with us tomorrow, Karma?

124
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,240
Hadri and I are going on a roadtrip for our assignment.

125
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
We're going to places that are social media-worthy.

126
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,479
Hey, what is this?

127
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,600
I want to come too!

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,720
Let’s bring Sham along.

129
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,199
But Sham has to take care of Master Akiro.

130
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
If you want to come along, let’s go.

131
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,679
But it will be much more fun if it’s the four of us going on a Saga road trip.

132
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
That’s what I want. That’s why I came here.

133
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,399
Excuse me, we’re not going for fun.

134
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,960
We’re working on our assigment.

135
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,560
But it’s not complete without Sham.

136
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,600
KATHY: MY DAUGHTER WANTS TO MEET YOU. (SENT)

137
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,120

138
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,600
Please try again..."

139
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,920
KATHY: JEFF. CALL ME!

140
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
Are you okay, Karma?

141
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,279
Okay. I’m just sleepy.

142
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,760
Okay. All set?

143
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Almost.

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
We just need to put on some 'road trip music'.

145
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,040
Bro, I’m already nervous about driving in Japan.

146
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,640
So I need to focus.

147
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,200
Hey, I love this song!

148
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Let's go!

149
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,520
Yobuko morning market.

150
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,640
This is the place for good seafood.

151
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
Let’s go.

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,560
Good morning!

153
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,760
Thank you!

154
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,760
Cute!

155
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,800
Wow.

156
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,119
This is the one you ate before, right Bianca?

157
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,559
When you were into Sham.

158
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
What?

159
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,160
What are you talking about, Karma?

160
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,720
She’s kidding.

161
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,760
I didn’t get to eat this last time.

162
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,960
How do you eat it?

163
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,640
What does it taste like?

164
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Let me.

165
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
This is my favourite.

166
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,800
Every time I see this snail, it gets on my nerves.

167
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,840
What did you say?

168
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,480
Nothing. Here.

169
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,040
Karma, let’s go. Stop stuffing your face.

170
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,440
Can I have one please?

171
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Let’s go there.

172
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,600
Please come by and have a look.

173
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,120
Come on over.

174
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,320
What a beautiful girl you are!

175
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,720
Thank you.

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,800
What did she say?

177
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,120
She said Bianca is beautiful.

178
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,480
Am I beautiful?

179
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,600
Oh my! You shouldn’t say that!

180
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,840
Why? What’s wrong?

181
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,560
There is a “yokai” around here.

182
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,800
“Yokai” is a Japanese ghost.

183
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,759
The old lady just now said

184
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,999
that there’s a ghost here of a woman wearing a mask.

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,520
She'll ask you,

186
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,240
“Am I beautiful?”

187
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,200
If you answer, "Yes."

188
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,720
She'll take off her mask,

189
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,200
revealing her mouth that's been slashed so deep,

190
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
that her face is split in two.

191
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,480
And then, she’ll ask again.

192
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,800
"How about now?

193
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,680
Am I still beautiful?"

194
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,760
And then...

195
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,480
She will slash your mouth open!

196
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,600
That’s messed up.

197
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,840
Bob, you should totally make a movie about Japanese ghosts.

198
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,680
Bob is afraid of ghosts.

199
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,720
-That’s not true! -It is.

200
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:40,240
I’m only afraid of your mother.

201
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,560
Hey! So cute!

202
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,440
Let’s go in?

203
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,320
So cute! Looks like Mochi.

204
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,880
"Saga Fortune Candy."

205
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,320
Pose together for the camera.

206
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,920
KARMA: WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE? PICK ONE.

207
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,680
Hello?

208
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,920
Darling, did you get the photo I sent?

209
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,480
What? Hold on.

210
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,919
Oh yeah, why?

211
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,520
Which one do you like? I want to buy it for you.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,920
There’s no need. Don’t waste money.

213
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,840
But it’s cute.

214
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,079
Darling, there’s no need. Anyway, I’m busy.

215
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,079
Why don’t you just follow them today.

216
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,120
We’ll talk tonight, okay?

217
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Okay.

218
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Hey, Karma.

219
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,840
Come and take a photo with me.

220
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,399
It's okay. You are working on your assignment, right?

221
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,599
It’s okay, we’re done. Let’s take a photo.

222
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,480
Just for fun, it’s just us.

223
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,800
-Okay. -Let’s go.

224
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,680
Here, you hold this.

225
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,640
Okay. Ready?

226
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,040
One, two...

227
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,120
three.

228
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
-Where did you get this? -Back there.

229
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,440
Karma is pretty quiet.

230
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,920
Is she okay?

231
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,200
Must have something to do with Sham.

232
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,560
They can’t be fighting. They’re apart.

233
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,639
With phones,

234
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,960
you can fight anywhere and anytime.

235
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
That’s true.

236
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Karma,

237
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,480
do you want to play a game?

238
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,840
-What game? -Rock, paper, scissors.

239
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,519
But they call it, “Janken” here.

240
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,840
And they play it on the stairs.

241
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,880
Does it have to be at the stairs?

242
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,640
I don’t like stairs.

243
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Same here. I don’t like stairs either.

244
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,080
That’s why this game is fun.

245
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,520
-Okay. -Okay. It goes like this.

246
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,400
Rock, paper, scissors.

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
If you win with 'paper' or 'scissors', you can go up six steps.

248
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,680
If you win with 'rock',

249
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,080
you can go up three steps. The first person to reach the top wins.

250
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,280
Wow. You can lose weight with this game. Okay, you’re on.

251
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Ready?

252
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,040
Rock, paper, scissors!

253
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,640
I win! Six steps, right?

254
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,400
Rock, paper, scissors!

255
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,080
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!

256
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,000
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!

257
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,040
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!

258
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,560
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!

259
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,600
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!

260
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,096
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!

261
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,456
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!

262
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,136
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!

263
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Yes!

264
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,760
Yes!

265
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,640
This guy is smooth.

266
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
What’s up with you?

267
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,520
He’s just trying to cheer her up. Look at that.

268
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,240
Karma is smiling again.

269
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,000
"Dear Miss, kindly find attached..."

270
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,959
KATHY: MY DAUGHTER WANTS TO MEET YOU. (SENT)

271
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,360
KATHY: JEFF. CALL ME! (SENT)

272
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,999
Seriously, Jeff.

273
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
You’re 'ghosting' me?

274
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,920
You’re 'ghosting' me?

275
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,040
If meeting my daughter scares you so much.

276
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,760
Then, we're done.

277
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
Goodbye.

278
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
No.

279
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,840
No.

280
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,000
We don’t cry over boys.

281
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,079
Wow!

282
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,960
Now, this is cinematic!

283
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes!

284
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,400
-It’s beautiful! -Right?

285
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,080
Oh my God, it’s so beautiful.

286
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Wow.

287
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,400
Hadri, I think you should stand here.

288
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,120
KARMA: WISH YOU WERE HERE. MISS YOU.

289
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,680
SHAM: (THUMBS UP EMOJI)

290
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,400
Slow down, Bob.

291
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,520
I need to go toilet right now.

292
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,520
Bob, you didn’t even turn off the engine!

293
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,480
-I’m heading to the toilet too. -Okay, me too.

294
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,120
Karma, are you okay?

295
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,240
Toilet?

296
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Okay.

297
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,320
"Yumi Katsura Lover’s Sanctuary."

298
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,640
SHAM

299
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Karma.

300
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,040
We’re leaving now.

301
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Ready?

302
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,520
Ready. Let’s go.

303
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,600
-Kathy? -Jeff?

304
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
What are you doing here?

305
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,159
You’d better leave before I call the police.

306
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,720
Kathy, let me explain.

307
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
I didn’t mean to disappear.

308
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,520
But my nephew was playing with my phone,

309
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,560
and he accidentally reset it to factory settings.

310
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,800
I couldn’t do anything until I got back to KL.

311
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,840
Jeff, I’m in show business

312
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,960
and I know bad acting when I see it.

313
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,520
But Kathy...

314
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,120
I came directly from the airport

315
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,696
because I didn’t want you to get the wrong idea.

316
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,880
Look, you can check my phone.

317
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,399
I thought you freaked out

318
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,760
because you didn’t want me to introduce you to my daughter.

319
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Wait.

320
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,480
She wants to meet me?

321
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
When?

322
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
How about now?

323
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,160
It’s pretty spooky.

324
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,399
Stop imagining things.

325
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,840
It’s not funny.

326
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,519
When you tell me to stop imagining things,

327
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,240
it makes me imagine the worst.

328
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
Me too. I was thinking about what that old lady said just now.

329
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,400
About the ghost.

330
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
What did she say?

331
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,320
"Am I beautiful?"

332
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
No one here is going to ask us that!

333
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,840
Can you chill?

334
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,120
THE BEACH

335
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,040
Is there enough fuel, Bob?

336
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,640
The indicator light is on.

337
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,680
Yes. We’ll make it.

338
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,200
It’s the road.

339
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,639
-I thought... -You thought what?

340
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,680
We would make it.

341
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,120
There’s no reception either!

342
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,799
Okay, how about this?

343
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,959
Bob and I will go look for the gas station,

344
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,160
while you two wait here.

345
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,400
You want to leave us in the middle of nowhere at this time of night?

346
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,800
No way!

347
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,440
We don’t even know if the gas station is open.

348
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,520
But the hotel is nearby, right?

349
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,080
That’s why I thought we’d make it.

350
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,800
Why don’t we walk?

351
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,720
We walk.

352
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,760
Stop it, Karma!

353
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,960
Don’t walk with me.

354
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,160
I don’t want to walk alone!

355
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,720
Karma, walk with me.

356
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,520
Hey, what’s that sweet fragrance?

357
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Is there?

358
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Hey!

359
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,560
That fragrance is coming from you!

360
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,040
That’s my perfume!

361
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,199
Can you stop scaring me?

362
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Sorry.

363
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Good evening.

364
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,280
Are you all right?

365
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,080
Are you okay?

366
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
What did she say?

367
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,599
“Am I beautiful?”

368
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,800
It’s the ghost!

369
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Karma!

370
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Let’s go.

371
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,320
She’s coming!

372
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,999
Bianca and Hadri need to finish their assignments.

373
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,399
Don’t trouble them.

374
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,159
Is it normal for Sham to speak to you like that?

375
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,800
It feels... somehow shameful to be so helpless.

376
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,039
SELINA: SLEEPING WITH YOU IS ALWAYS RIGHT

377
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,920
Are you checking my phone?

378
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,880
You’re sleeping with your own staff?
