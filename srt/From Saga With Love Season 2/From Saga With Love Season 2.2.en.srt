1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
Hey.

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,800
Wow, Kat.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,400
Why are you smiling?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,640
New boyfriend?

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,760
I'm on this app.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,120
LateLove.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,640
Not bad, okay.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,199
I’m texting with three guys right now.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,440
Wow.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,080
Are they hot?

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,319
This is Razif.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,720
Banker, six feet tall,

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,719
and plays tennis.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,000
Wow.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,319
Introverted extrovert banker in Mont Kiara.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,920
You don’t play around, babe.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,480
Kat, this is Ayi.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,080
My cousin, Lana’s husband.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,160
Lana, the one with seven kids?

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,280
She’s pregnant with their eighth child.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,080
Men!

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,000
It’s okay.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,600
This one is hot, too.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
James.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,160
He looks like a celebrity.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
Right?

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,520
No, I mean like a real celebrity.

28
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,720
Wait.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,719
Yes, I told you.

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,799
This is an actor from Philippines.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,320
His name is Gabby Concepcion.

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,159
He plays the character, Steve Sebastian

33
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,880
in the TV series, "Kung Tayo’y Magkakalayo."

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Okay.

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,920
This is the last one.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,240
His name is Omar.

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,640
Do you know him?

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,080
Is he a drama series actor?

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,160
No.

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,300
Any relation to you?

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,400
No. I don’t know him.

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,680
Speaking of the devil! He's texting me.

43
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,960
What happened?

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,760
What is this?

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,879
Is that his 'birdie'?

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,320
I hate this app!

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,400
MASTER AKIRO

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,159
Hello, Sham?

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,639
Master?

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,560
How are you? And how is Karma?

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,879
Good, Master.

52
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,160
How are you?

53
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,679
I’m great! Everything is great!

54
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,360
Please don’t worry.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,279
I didn’t say I was worried.

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,599
Because there is nothing to worry about.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,679
Okay, I’m very busy.

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,920
I will call you again soon. Goodbye.

59
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,279
What's wrong with you?

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,160
You sound like a broken car engine.

61
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,080
Hey!

62
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,840
Suhaila,

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,280
I just found out that I'm a walking…

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
red flag.

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,360
Praise Be To God!

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,399
You finally realised!

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,799
-Suhaila! -No, I mean it! Praise Be To God.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,319
At least, now that you know, you can change.

69
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,679
Slowly you’ll work your way.

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,800
From a red flag, to a green flag.

71
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,080
Is it possible to change?

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,320
Sham and I...

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,000
haven’t spoken in a long while.

74
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,160
How long is that? A day?

75
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,799
It’s only been a day.

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,280
Three days.

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
Three days?

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,000
You didn't call him at all?

79
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,800
What if he's tired of my behaviour?

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,199
What if he doesn't want to see me anymore?

81
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,400
What if he's…

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
What if I strangled you?

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,560
-I already folded your laundry... -Sham!

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,120
We need to talk.

85
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,720
We need to talk!

86
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,560
We need to talk.

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
Karma.

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,560
If he says, "We need to talk”...

89
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,680
Good luck, Karma. Okay?

90
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,040
Don’t give up.

91
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
Keep it up.

92
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,920
Oh no!

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,200
Karma.

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,160
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:42,839
I know I'm a red flag, but I can change to a green, pink or a turquoise one.

96
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Give me some time to improve and be a better girlfriend!

97
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
What?

98
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,000
Didn't you want to talk about...

99
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,360
About?

100
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,200
What do you want to talk about?

101
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,559
I have to go back to Saga.

102
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,160
What? Why?

103
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Master Akiro.

104
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,600
There's something going on.

105
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,520
But he doesn't want to tell me.

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,400
He said not to worry.

107
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,920
That's even more worrying.

108
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,079
That's right.

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,640
So can you take care of the shop by yourself?

110
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,760
While I keep an eye on him?

111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,440
Not for long. About a week.

112
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Can you?

113
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Yes!

114
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Go and see Master Akiro.

115
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,839
I'll take care of the shop.

116
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,360
No problem, no issues, no worries.

117
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I know you can.

118
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I believe in you.

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
But what were you saying just now?

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,640
What's with the green, pink and turqouise flags?

121
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Have you packed?

122
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,696
You're traveling far, so you need to pack a lot.

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,600
Where's your bag? I'll help you pack.

124
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
Hey, bag! Where are you?

125
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,480
This shade of blue suits you.

126
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,239
It matches me, so you’ll remember me there.

127
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,920
Okay, which pair of trousers?

128
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,639
DEAR KARMA - DRAFT

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,960
How did I make my previous short film?

130
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
What did I do?

131
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,960
What?

132
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,720
Okay. Okay Bob, it's fine.

133
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,520
Think carefully.

134
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,920
Back when we were in Saga,

135
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,960
you shot a lot of Karma.

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,439
But if I do that again,

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,880
Sham will think I'm trying to hit on his girlfriend.

138
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,880
But if I don't do it, what am I supposed to do?

139
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,520
Hello, handsome boy.

140
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,800
Bob, I have to go back to Saga.

141
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
I feel like Master Akiro isn't okay.

142
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Not okay?

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
How is he?

144
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
I don't know.

145
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,760
He won't say.

146
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,281
That's why I want to check for myself.

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,119
Oh no. I understand.

148
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,160
So you're going alone? Karma is not going with you?

149
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,040
No, she's taking care of the shop.

150
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,880
But I'm worried about her being alone.

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,600
Can you check on her and keep her company?

152
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Of course.

153
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Yes, I can.

154
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,280
Sham, I want to ask you something.

155
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,600
What if I asked Karma to help with my script?

156
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,160
Why don't you ask her? I'm okay with it.

157
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,919
Great.

158
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Okay.

159
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,800
Thank you. I'll treat you when I get back. Bye.

160
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,720
Get ready to be written. My backup is here.

161
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,159
His 'birdie'? You mean his bird?

162
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,280
Yes, Bianca. His 'birdie'.

163
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,160
That he keeps in a cage?

164
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,479
No, not that kind of bird.

165
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,040
His 'birdie'!

166
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,439
Gross!

167
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,960
So disgusting.

168
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,919
That's it! No more online dating!

169
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,999
No!

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,679
Come on, you just started.

171
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,559
You're quitting already?

172
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,440
Bianca,

173
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:28,000
the men on the app are either horny or liars.

174
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I want to delete the app now.

175
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,279
Don't, Mum!

176
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,799
You will find someone, I know it.

177
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,479
But you can't be too choosy,

178
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,799
especially at your age.

179
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,920
Excuse me?

180
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,440
Thirty-eight?

181
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,440
Slow and steady, okay?

182
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,400
What if you deleted the app,

183
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,759
and then the right guy comes along.

184
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,039
He won't get to meet my beautiful mother,

185
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,120
who's also smart, amazing and funny.

186
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,560
Fine, I'll give it a week.

187
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,560
If Mr. Right doesn't come along,

188
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,200
I'll delete the app.

189
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,080
Increase the sales, okay?

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,240
We're running out of money.

191
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Yes!

192
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,319
Don’t worry.

193
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,959
I'll make sure that everything is sold

194
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,240
by the time you return.

195
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Take care, okay?

196
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
I love you.

197
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
I love you too.

198
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
Bye.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Bye!

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,600
No price tag.

201
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,240
INSURANCE FORM

202
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,240
I haven't sent it yet!

203
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
Welcome.

204
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,680
Please come in.

205
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,159
Hey, be careful.

206
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,599
Dear, look at our kids!

207
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,960
Look, don’t touch.

208
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,280
Look, don’t touch.

209
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,920
Don't play with it. Put it down.

210
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
I’m back!

211
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Master Akiro?

212
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Sham?

213
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,640
What are you doing here?

214
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
I thought I’d visit you.

215
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Why?

216
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,120
Can I... come in?

217
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,760
Sure.

218
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Come in.

219
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,280
Looks like sales have been good!

220
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Yeah, sure.

221
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,479
Good thing I’m here, then!

222
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,640
I’ll help you make more things to sell.

223
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,320
Peace Be Upon You.

224
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
Peace Be Upon You.

225
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,840
You must be tired from work.

226
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,680
I didn't sell much.

227
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,800
I managed to sell one item.

228
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,080
Only because a kid broke a plate.

229
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,359
And then, his mother complained.

230
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
“This ugly plate is so expensive!”

231
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,159
Luckily, her son only broke one.

232
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,640
If he had broken ten?

233
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,760
Then she has a real reason to complain!

234
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,360
And why would she scold me?

235
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,400
Because she can.

236
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
Have patience.

237
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,440
In business, there are all sorts of challenges.

238
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm worried.

239
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,440
There's no money to pay next month's rent.

240
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
I have to think of ways to increase sales.

241
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,640
God willing.

242
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm sure you can.

243
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Here.

244
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,000
This is for you.

245
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
So cute!

246
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Where did you get this?

247
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:02,240
From someone who was collecting donations for an animal shelter.

248
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,119
I gave him some money.

249
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,360
He gave me this keychain.

250
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,320
I know you like these Japanese trinkets.

251
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Thank you, Mum.

252
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,600
Donations for an animal shelter...

253
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,640
Are you going to join me, Master?

254
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
That’s okay.

255
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
I don’t feel like it right now.

256
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Master,

257
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
you once said that pottery

258
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,600
is like breathing for you.

259
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,599
You said, “I would use my left arm”...

260
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,400
"If I broke my right one."

261
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Yes, I remember.

262
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,280
So... Why has my master stopped breathing?

263
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
I don’t feel like it.

264
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
SPECIAL SALE

265
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,960
Wow, Mochi looks so cute!

266
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,920
Right?

267
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,920
I shared this poster on social media.

268
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,440
Can you share it too?

269
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,600
Okay, I'll share it now.

270
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,639
-Pose next to it. -Okay, I'll get in the frame.

271
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,199
One, two, three.

272
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,760
Okay wait, let’s take a selfie.

273
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,759
One, two, three.

274
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,640
One, two, three.

275
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,920
One, two, three.

276
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,920
I hope this works.

277
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,560
If not, I don't know what else to do.

278
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,759
Karma, you’ve got this.

279
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Do your best!

280
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,280
Do your best!

281
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,280
You haven’t done this technique in a while.

282
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Yes, Master.

283
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Don’t look.

284
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Feel it.

285
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,840
I’ve forgotten.

286
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,080
Come, I will show you.

287
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Master.

288
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Master.

289
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Master!

290
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,640
Are you all right?

291
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,320
Parkinson’s?

292
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,720
Why didn’t you tell me?

293
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,920
I didn’t want you to worry.

294
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,960
You have a good life in Malaysia. I don’t want to interfere with that.

295
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,520
My life in Malaysia isn’t all good.

296
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,680
Sometimes I really miss being here.

297
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,880
Well, it’s good to have you here.

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Now, please tell me everything.

299
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,560
Three dates in a day?

300
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,720
Mum, what happened to slow and steady?

301
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
I don’t have time for slow and steady.

302
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,079
I want it fast and faster, okay?

303
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,239
Anyway, it's more convenient.

304
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,320
I'll wear the same outfit for all three dates.

305
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,320
Done.

306
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
You might get a bit musty by midday.

307
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,240
I've brought my perfume.

308
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,600
I’m proud of you, Mum.

309
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
For trying.

310
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,840
I love you.

311
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,080
Love you too.

312
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Bye.

313
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,880
Smells like bread.

314
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
I read a few tips on real estate.

315
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,280
If the house smells like a bakery,

316
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,960
it will sell faster.

317
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,640
But you're not selling a house.

318
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,439
No, I'm not.

319
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,480
But plates are cheaper than a house.

320
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,000
Therefore, it'll be flying off the shelves.

321
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Maybe.

322
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,280
You have to smell like bread, too?

323
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,520
This scent is rose and jasmine.

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,480
I also need to smell good.

325
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Okay. Let's open!

326
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's go.

327
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,320
Be brave!

328
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,040
Welcome!

329
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Hey Karma, don't be like this.

330
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,520
It's still early. Relax.

331
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Okay?

332
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,079
Babe, it’s the same cat.

333
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,120
You're right.

334
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,199
Hey guys, his name is Mochi.

335
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,240
You want to come in?

336
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,039
By the way, we're having a sale today.

337
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,519
And the sale is to raise funds for an animal shelter.

338
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Please come in!

339
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,600
Let’s go in.

340
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Please come in!

341
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,880
That's Mochi and these are our dishes and crockery.

342
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,840
-These plates... -Welcome!

343
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,639
Hi, welcome!

344
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,160
Welcome, please come in!

345
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
Hello, do you like cats?

346
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,760
Yes, of course. Please come in.

347
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,719
Smile! One, two, three.

348
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,519
Thank you.

349
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Thank you.

350
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,160
Okay, yes.

351
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Thank you very much. Come again!

352
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,760
It's okay!

353
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,100
Let me do it.

354
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,480
Okay, for this, there's a huge discount.

355
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Yes!

356
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Come again!

357
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,680
Tell everyone!

358
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,200
You already look amazing.

359
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,160
I’m nervous.

360
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,200
I haven’t been on a date in 20 years.

361
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,840
I get it.

362
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,680
But don’t worry. You look great.

363
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Thank you.

364
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,040
Is your date handsome?

365
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
I get it!

366
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,440
Good taste.

367
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,240
Are you Kathy?

368
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,560
Yes, I am.

369
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,600
You are prettier than in your photo.

370
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,280
-Abdul? -Abdul!

371
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,040
You don’t look the same as your profile photo.

372
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Not the same?

373
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,760
That was from last year.

374
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,400
2023?

375
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,880
No!

376
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,520
The year 2000.

377
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,760
That’s not last year.

378
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,028
It doesn’t matter if it’s last year or in the past,

379
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,600
just got to make sure I don't miss my chance.

380
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,200
I didn’t order this.

381
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,440
It’s okay. It’s on the house.

382
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,320
Thank you.

383
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:21,160
So, this second date,

384
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,400
you’ve never met him either?

385
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,280
I think that’s him.

386
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,120
Kathy?

387
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,440
Yes.

388
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
I’m Eddy.

389
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,120
Hello.

390
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,679
-May I? -Yes, of course.

391
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,760
Thank you.

392
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
Thank God, you're not ancient.

393
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,640
I don’t understand the joke.

394
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,080
No, it’s nothing.

395
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,480
So, you own a business?

396
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,320
Yes. And you’re in the entertainment industry?

397
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,720
-Artist Management, right? -Yes, that’s right.

398
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,159
So, what’s your income like?

399
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,640
Around RM3000, RM4000 a month?

400
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,039
GET-RICH-QUICK

401
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:22,000
What if I could guarantee you a return of RM50,000 to RM100,000 every month?

402
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,320
From a capital of only RM10,000.

403
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,599
I’m serious. I’m not joking.

404
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,040
Because right now, we need to make sure we’re prepared for our old age…

405
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,120
Thank you for saving me.

406
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,239
If you hadn’t spilled soup on him earlier, I don’t think he would have left

407
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,319
until I signed up for his scam.

408
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,280
Exactly.

409
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:39,680
Even I feel scammed.

410
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,800
I think that’s my last date.

411
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,160
Good luck.

412
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Hi?

413
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,440
Hi.

414
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:59,280
-Kathy, right? -Yes.

415
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,040
I’m Ross.

416
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,520
Hello.

417
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,679
Wow.

418
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,160
You’re a thousand times prettier than your photo.

419
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,440
Okay.

420
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,640
You look familiar.

421
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,680
Have we met before?

422
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,040
I don’t think so.

423
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,160
Because if I’d ever seen someone as beautiful as you,

424
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,040
I wouldn’t forget it.

425
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,759
By the way, sorry I was late.

426
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,640
There was a bit of traffic coming from Bangsar.

427
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,800
Do you live in Bangsar?

428
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Why?

429
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,360
Want to go back to my place later?

430
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
No.

431
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,040
I have family in Bangsar.

432
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Really?

433
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Where?

434
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,240
Who knows? Maybe we’re neighbours.

435
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,720
Maarof lane, house number 33.

436
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,920
Maarof lane, house number 33.

437
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,800
That’s my parents’ house!

438
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,920
Your father is Uncle Anjang.

439
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,800
Are you his son, Roslan?

440
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,160
Roslan?

441
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
Khatijah!

442
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,880
Bill, please!

443
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Okay.

444
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Hey!

445
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Our sales today is...

446
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,760
RM7000!

447
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,560
Praise Be To God!

448
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,680
Good job, Karma.

449
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,840
This calls for a huge meal. We have to celebrate.

450
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
-Let's go. -Let's go.

451
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,599
Don't forget the keys and the lights. I'll wait outside.

452
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,880
-Okay. -Let's go.

453
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,440
Bob, wait!

454
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Bob...

455
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,440
WE’RE CLOSED

456
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,280
What is it now?

457
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Sorry.

458
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,240
Khatijah Musa?

459
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,479
You...

460
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,960
left this just now.

461
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,680
Praise Be To God.

462
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:41,200
Sorry. That's the third time I burped.

463
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,440
You ordered too much!

464
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
Sorry.

465
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,520
That's the fourth time.

466
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,160
-Please make way. -Oh no.

467
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,200
The driver at the front, please make way.

468
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
What's going on?

469
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
I don't know.

470
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,680
Karma, that looks like fire.

471
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
You're right.

472
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,760
That's near the shops.

473
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Oh my God.

474
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,160
Please let it not be my shop.

475
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
Karma, it's fine.

476
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,480
We're almost there, okay?

477
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,600
Sham!

478
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,220
Are you okay? How's the shop?

479
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,760
Wait! You want to go to Saga?

480
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,240
I'm sorry!

481
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
It's okay.

482
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,360
If he's so perfect, why is he single?

483
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Are you ready?
