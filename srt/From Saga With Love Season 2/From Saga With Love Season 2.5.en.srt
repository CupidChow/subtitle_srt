00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,840
Thank you for today, Sham. You deserve to rest.

2
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,440
If you need any help...

3
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,680
Good night.

4
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,840
Go!

5
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,000
Go!

6
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,320
-It’s painful. -Karma!

7
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,559
Let’s go!

8
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,120
She’s coming!

9
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,280
Let’s go!

10
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,280
Run!

11
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,760
Guys, hurry!

12
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,520
Run!

13
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,920
What is going on?

14
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,480
Oh well. Maybe they’re shooting a drama.

15
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,719
Guys!

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,360
You guys! That 'thing' is gone.

17
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,240
Thank God. Put me down here.

18
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,120
I’m exhausted!

19
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,040
Guys, what’s that?

20
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Light.

21
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,720
It looks like...

22
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,199
hope.

23
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
The hotel must be nearby.

24
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,959
Let’s head over there.

25
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
Let’s go.

26
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Bob...

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,480
can you carry me instead?

28
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,800
-Why? Does your leg hurt too? -No.

29
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,240
But I’m upset! All this is because of you!

30
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,439
It’s okay. This is what you call an adventure.

31
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,879
We get to see a Japanese ghost.

32
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,519
Don’t say that!

33
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,080
Sorry.

34
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,480
-Let’s go. -Okay. Let’s go.

35
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,759
Yes.

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,599
It was that serious.

37
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,439
Thank God, Bob and Hadri were around to help me out.

38
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,279
I wouldn't have made it to the hotel without them.

39
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,079
You guys...

40
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,719
There are no such thing as ghosts.

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,239
It’s all nonsense.

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,199
Have you applied ice to your leg?

43
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,760
Yes. Look at this.

44
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Good.

45
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,399
Tomorrow, if you can’t walk,

46
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
don’t go with them.

47
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,760
Just rest in the car.

48
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,039
Bianca and Hadri need to finish their assignment

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Don’t trouble them.

50
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Okay.

51
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,720
Okay, I need to clean up.

52
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
We’ll talk tomorrow, okay?

53
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,240
-Good night. -Good night.

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,280
Karma?

55
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,640
Is it normal for Sham to speak to you like that?

56
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,440
What?

57
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,400
Like how?

58
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,520
Like how my mother speaks to me.

59
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,040
I don’t know. I hadn’t noticed.

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,879
Well...

61
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,200
he’s your boyfriend, not mine.

62
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,519
JEFF: MY PHONE IS FIXED! LUNCH WITH ME, MY LOVE?

63
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,080
My love?

64
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,720
KATHY: OKAY (HEART EMOJI)

65
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,920
Wow, it’s so beautiful!

66
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,279
-Bob, let’s take a photo over there? -Let’s do it.

67
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,880
Let’s go!

68
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,960
Okay.

69
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:25,400
One, two, three.

70
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,440
Nice!

71
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,680
KARMA: HI! I'M AT THE BEACH (HEART EMOJI)

72
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,120
I think you'll like this place.

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
Not many people know it.

74
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
It's my favourite spot.

75
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm sure I'll like it too.

76
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
Are we going through any toll stations?

77
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
I don't think my card has enough credit.

78
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Don't worry.

79
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,960
Leave it to me, okay?

80
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,480
I’m going to top up at the shop.

81
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,159

SLEEPING WITH YOU IS ALWAYS THE BEST NIGHT.

85
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,880
WAKING UP WITH YOU IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

86
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,440
Is this the place?

87
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,320
Kashima City.

88
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,400
This is it. Ariake mudflats. Let’s take a photo?

89
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Wait.

90
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,040
Is it okay to park here?

91
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,440
It’s okay, we won’t be here long. Should be fine.

92
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,720
Okay, if you say so.

93
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
NO PARKING ALLOWED

94
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,079
What’s so special about this place?

95
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,279
This is the place where mud sports are held.

96
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,439
Every summer, a mud sports competition is held here.

97
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,040
It's called the Kashima Gatalympics.

98
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,239
There’re sumo, running races, surfboard races,

99
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,319
obstacle courses and lots more.

100
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,959
It's crazy fun! I plan to join it next year.

101
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,320
Why don’t you guys join in? We can form a team.

102
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,119
Looks like we'll be coming to Saga every year.

103
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
Like going back to your hometown.

104
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,960
Like a hometown.

105
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,399
Isn’t it nice?

106
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,879
Your photos are amazing.

107
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,520
But that’s the thing, as an artist, I don’t like compliments, bro.

108
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,040
Hadri!

109
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
Where’s my car?

110
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,800
THIS CAR HAS BEEN TOWED AWAY.

111
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,840
The car has been...

112
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
towed.

113
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,239
Yesterday it was Bob. Today it’s you.

114
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,439
You boys are so unreliable!

115
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,399
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

116
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,599
But, this is...

117
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
a part of our adventure, right?

118
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Okay.

119
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,159
All of you wait here.

120
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,800
I’ll go and settle it.

121
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,999
Hadri, I’ll come with you!

122
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,960
Hey! Wait for me, Hadri!

123
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,040
Useless!

124
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
Useless.

125
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,200
-You checked my phone? -No!

126
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,160
Fine. Yes.

127
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
You know what? I’m not sorry about it.

128
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,520
Who’s Selina?

129
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,840
How do you explain this?

130
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,200
Selina is my new copywriter.

131
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,520
I told you, I own an ad agency.

132
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,599
Your new copywriter.

133
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,240
Wow, you sleep with your own staff.

134
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,720
Read everything.

135
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,320
Go ahead.

136
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,319
SELINA: THE BEST NIGHT’S SLEEP YOU’VE EVER HAD

137
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,559
JEFF: THAT’S SO TYPICAL. EVERY MATTRESS COMPANY PROBABLY USES THAT TAGLINE

138
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,680
SELINA: SORRY, BOSS. I’LL COME UP WITH MORE OPTIONS LATER

139
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,599
JEFF: ALL RIGHT. MAKE IT CATCHIER, PLEASE. THINK YOUNG!

140
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,279
SELINA: GOT IT. SLEEPING WITH YOU IS ALWAYS A GOOD NIGHT.

141
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,160
SELINA: WAKING UP WITH YOU IS A DREAM COME TRUE

142
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,359
So all of it are...

143
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,760
Proposed taglines.

144
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,880
But you understand, right? How I can misunderstand?

145
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,319
I understand your misunderstanding.

146
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,880
What I don’t understand, is why you didn’t wait to ask me directly.

147
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,160
Why do you need to check behind my back?

148
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,400
I was shocked!

149
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,920
I’m very disappointed right now.

150
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,279
I didn’t expect you to be like this.

151
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,840
-I’m not! I... -Listen!

152
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,319
Let’s just cancel lunch.

153
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,760
Okay, I...

154
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,520
I need to process this.

155
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,479
At least there’s a shop here,

156
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,599
or who knows what we’d be doing right now.

157
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,999
Oh my God, guys are just so annoying

158
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,959
with their misplaced confidence.

159
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,759
I'm about to have my period, and they're causing problems.

160
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,600
Girl, same. I’m about to get my period too,

161
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,760
I’m constantly craving sweet things.

162
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,280
-So Aunty Kathy’s boyfriend... -Potential boyfriend.

163
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,200
-When are you going to meet him? -I don’t know yet.

164
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,359
Now that you mention it, she hasn’t updated me for some time.

165
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,200
Since Jeff came along, she hasn’t been calling me as often.

166
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,680
And I really hope Jeff is a green flag.

167
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,480
Please be a green flag.

168
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Speaking of Aunty Kathy.

169
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,800
-Hi, Mum. -Bianca!

170
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,440
I ruined it!

171
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,639
Sham, I want to go somewhere. Can you please take me?

172
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,599
Of course, Master. Where do you want to go?

173
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Come.

174
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,439
I knew it was too good to be true.

175
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,280
The moment she meets a good guy like Jeff, my mother has to act up.

176
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,479
How is she going to make it up to Jeff now?

177
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,719
Right?

178
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,559
People checking your phone is such a turn off.

179
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,040
If it was me, that would be it. We’re done. The end.

180
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,719
Hi, ladies. We’ve arrived.

181
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,879
Finally.

182
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,120
-Okay, let’s go for lunch. -Yes, I’m hungry.

183
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,639
What’s that in your hand?

184
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,279
It’s nothing. It’s for Sham and Master Akiro.

185
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,560
Let’s go.

186
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Ouch!

187
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,800
Let’s go. In the name of God.

188
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
So what are we doing here?

189
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:30,599
Okay guys, today we’re fishing for our lunch.

190
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Interesting.

191
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,000
Thank you.

192
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,919
Hello! So cute!

193
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,680
-Want us to follow you? -Let’s take a photo.

194
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,560
Sorry.

195
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,920
-Let's follow the puppy. -Wait! Let's take a photo.

196
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
How long do we have to wait?

197
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,640
This is an experience. Can you chill?

198
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,200
It’s been 5 minutes.

199
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,639
That's so long. I could have watched five online videos.

200
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,759
Right?

201
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,480
If it's a live stream, I'd have already bought the product by now.

202
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,519
You also enjoy buying things from live streams?

203
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Of course! It’s amazing. You can buy so many different things.

204
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,920
I got a fish!

205
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,040
Pull!

206
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,399
Pull it!

207
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,199
Just pull it!

208
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,360
Pull, Karma!

209
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,160
Bob!

210
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,680
Are you okay?

211
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,839
-Are you okay? -Thank God you were quick.

212
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,479
I'd be in big trouble if this camera broke.

213
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,800
Thank you

214
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,880
Sorry, Bob.

215
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,200
Hey, the fish! Pull, Karma!

216
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,599
Look here!

217
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,560
Closer. Closer than that. One, two, three. Nice!

218
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,119
This is what makes the adventure great!

219
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,199
Okay Bianca. Say it again, but louder. I’m using it as a voice-over.

220
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,440
And... action!

221
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Sham.

222
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,840
When you pray, what do you pray for?

223
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:28,040
Nothing specific. For everything to go well, I suppose.

224
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,280
What were you praying for just now, Master?

225
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,080
I read a book once about why people pray.

226
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,080
Essentially, we turn to God for three reasons.

227
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,599
When we need help.

228
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,359
When we want to give thanks.

229
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,200
And when we are so amazed that we can’t help but praise God.

230
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,599
I have thanked God before, many times.

231
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:09,600
And I have praised God before, for the beauty and wonder of the world.

232
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,000
But, I have seldom asked God for help.

233
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,839
Maybe, deep down, asking for help feels like admitting defeat.

234
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:36,840
It feels... somehow shameful to be so helpless.

235
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,560
But today,

236
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,640
I prayed for help.

237
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,600
KATHY: LET’S TALK? COFFEE ON ME

238
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,680
JEFF: OKAY

239
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,320
You want to break up with me?

240
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,480
I think "breaking up" is too strong.

241
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
We’re not really a couple.

242
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,319
What do you mean?

243
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,879
All the time we've spent together, doesn’t it mean anything to you?

244
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,920
It's not that, Kathy. I...

245
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,080
I can’t trust you anymore.

246
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,160
Jeff, that was just one time.

247
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,319
That’s not who I am.

248
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,200
I’m not the nosy type.

249
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,999
Believe me.

250
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,439
Kathy...

251
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,839
in all my past relationships, I...

252
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,200
I always turn a blind eye when there’s a red flag.

253
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,079
And I always find an excuse to forgive.

254
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,439
Again and again.

255
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,039
Forgiveness is a good thing, right?

256
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,840
No. That’s my red flag.

257
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,360
Because I'm too forgiving. I always get taken advantage of.

258
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,880
So I end up always getting hurt. Okay?

259
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,240
So now I have to change.

260
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,199
For myself, just one red flag is enough.

261
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,360
I just can't.

262
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,120
Jeff, please.

263
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,400
I’m sorry.

264
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,119
Listen, you take care and

265
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,160
thank you for everything. Okay?

266
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,640
Good luck.

267
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,800
Bye.

268
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,319
Why is it not cooked?

269
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,080
You didn’t cook it long enough.

270
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,480
Praise be to God.

271
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,999
-I’m going to go wash my hands. -Okay.

272
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Okay.

273
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,600
It’s cooking but the fire is not strong enough.

274
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,519
Okay.

275
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,600
It’s clean now.

276
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
Thank you.

277
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,999
I don’t know what’s going on between you and Hadri.

278
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,560
But I think you have to set boundaries.

279
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,640
I will never be able to make a real cup again.

280
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,080
How is it, darling?

281
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,639
Do you think you could live here?

282
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,080
I have something to tell you.
