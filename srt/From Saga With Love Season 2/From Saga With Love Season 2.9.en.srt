1
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:08,665
HADRI: KARMA, I’M IN KUALA LUMPUR. YOU’RE BACK TOO, RIGHT?

2
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,707
HADRI: LET’S HANG OUT AND BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,541
KARMA: WHERE TO?

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:22,207
HADRI: IT’S A SURPRISE. YOU’LL DEFINITELY LIKE IT.

5
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:26,333
KARMA: DO I HAVE TO SPEND MONEY? I CAN’T AFFORD IT RIGHT NOW.

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,416
HADRI: DON’T WORRY. IT’S ON ME.

7
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:40,999
KARMA: IT’S OKAY, HADRI. MAYBE NEXT TIME. I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO SETTLE.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,250
BUT THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

9
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:03,958
Hello?

10
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,874
WHAT’S YOUR RED FLAG?

11
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,166
What’s your red flag?

12
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:45,041
We’re doing this quiz to know how to handle our red flags.

13
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,250
Why didn’t you do it first?

14
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,375
Were you waiting for me?

15
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,375
Let's doing it together. It’ll be more fun.

16
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,083
Let’s start?

17
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,999
I guess you don't want to do it alone.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What’s that?

19
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,708
Nothing, Aunty. Let’s start!

20
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,625
So it was a pretty big fight you guys had.

21
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,457
You were asking for it, Bianca.

22
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,750
It was so difficult for Aunty Kathy to let you study in Japan.

23
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,125
Then you go and tell her you want to move here permanently.

24
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,499
Your timing was off.

25
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
I know.

26
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,249
I wanted to have a heart-to-heart with her,

27
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,166
but that day, it just slipped out.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,415
I get it.

29
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,083
So, what’s your plan now?

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,082
You and your mother are both so stubborn.

31
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,833
Neither of you will back down.

32
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,958
It's true.

33
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,291
I don’t know. I don’t really have a plan.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,708
First, I have to get her to talk to me again.

35
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,875
She’s sulking.

36
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,875
And maybe,

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,583
I was too hard on her.

38
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,541
Maybe?

39
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,458
I think you were.

40
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,499
Fine. I was too hard on her.

41
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,416
It’s just...

42
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,458
Thank you for waiting. We will now begin boarding.

43
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,874
Welcome! May I check your boarding pass? Thank you.

44
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,791
Okay. Let’s see my result.

45
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,707
YOUR RESULT

46
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,666
LOADING

47
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,540
YOU ARE CONTROLLING What?

48
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,749
Controlling?

49
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,999
Me?

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Calm down, Aunty.

51
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,790
Let's read first.

52
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:11,875
Okay.

53
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,290
You care about people

54
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,457
but that means you always want them to do everything your way

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,707
because you feel that only your way is the right one.

56
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,249
My way is the right one!

57
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,500
What do you want me to do?

58
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,915
Other people may feel that you do not respect boundaries.

59
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,457
Nonsense!

60
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,208
What is this quiz you're making me do?

61
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,833
You're the one who said we should do it.

62
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,166
Whatever.

63
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,625
Anyway, I wouldn’t do something without a reason, okay?

64
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,500
For example, Jeff.

65
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,333
Seeing suspicious messages like that, anyone would check.

66
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,166
If Sham got strange messages, you’d check too, right?

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,916
I don’t think so. I don’t know his password.

68
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,083
If you did know?

69
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,332
Sham unlocks it with a fingerprint scan.

70
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,665
It’s not like I’m going to cut off his finger…

71
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,249
If!

72
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,958
If you could check, understand?

73
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,708
If you could check,

74
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,958
you’d check, right?

75
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,541
I think I’d just ask him directly.

76
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,583
Sham won’t lie.

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,708
How do you know?

78
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,375
Don't trust men so easily.

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,791
But,

80
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,291
Jeff didn't actually lie to you, right?

81
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,291
Fine.

82
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,291
I was wrong that one time.

83
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,000
But usually I’m right.

84
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,041
Okay, Aunty.

85
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,875
But your result says you’re controlling. Maybe…

86
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,583
you’re too suspicious?

87
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,083
I think you need to trust people more.

88
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,000
Maybe.

89
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,291
Okay. What about your red flag?

90
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,499
Maybe before this, I didn’t understand what it feels like to let go of a child,

91
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,291
so that she finds independence.

92
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,333
Turns out, it’s scary.

93
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,958
Even though Rin isn’t my child,

94
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,707
it was so hard for me to let her go

95
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,708
and let her do everything on her own.

96
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,000
So you understand why Aunty Kathy is controlling?

97
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,416
Maybe.

98
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,208
A little bit.

99
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,041
I don’t know.

100
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,416
Bob,

101
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,833
when I have a child of my own someday,

102
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,083
do you think I’ll turn out like my mother?

103
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,958
I don’t think so.

104
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,040
Because you know what it feels like to be controlled.

105
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,625
So maybe you’ll be a bit more chill.

106
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,041
I think,

107
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,291
as a mother,

108
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,833
you’d be better than her.

109
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,499
Thanks, Bob.

110
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,250
I appreciate it.

111
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,583
Excuse me,

112
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,957
you dropped your ticket.

113
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,458
Thank you!

114
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,291
Looks like someone wants to stay.

115
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:26,916
Okay, let’s go!

116
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,166
Let’s go!

117
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,666
You are incommunicative.

118
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,040
You have good intentions,

119
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,040
but people can misunderstand you

120
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,666
if they don't know what is in your head.

121
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,041
Other people may see you as selfish and uncaring.

122
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,416
Maybe, this is what Sham feels.

123
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,875
It’s not that I don’t want to communicate.

124
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,249
How was I supposed to know I had to spell everything out?

125
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,957
I figured it’d be obvious.

126
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,083
Besides, if anyone wanted to know, they could’ve just asked, right?

127
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,749
It’s not like I was hiding anything.

128
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,499
I was just waiting for the right moment.

129
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,707
Like with the fire incident,

130
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,500
I didn’t want to shock him.

131
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,165
So you delayed telling him because of timing?

132
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,208
Yes, exactly.

133
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,000
Or was it because you were afraid?

134
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,583
Maybe.

135
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,333
A little.

136
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,458
That’s a bit of a selfish reason, isn’t it?

137
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,541
Maybe,

138
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,957
I was hoping if I waited a bit longer,

139
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,333
it would sort itself out.

140
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,541
So things wouldn’t be as bad.

141
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:07,083
But now the problem’s way worse.

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,791
So, what are you going to do?

143
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,874
I’m going to look for a full-time job,

144
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,082
that can pay me a monthly salary.

145
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,166
So that I can pay Sham in small installments.

146
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,625
I know Sham would need the money soon

147
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,916
because he needs to take care of Master.

148
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,207
But I’ve racked my brain, and there’s nothing...

149
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,375
There’s no shortcut to getting money.

150
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,540
Don’t go trying any get-rich-quick schemes, okay?

151
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,915
Those are all scams.

152
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,958
Yes, Aunty.

153
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,790
I’ve already applied for a permanent job.

154
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,250
My interview is tomorrow.

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,208
Good girl!

156
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,833
That's how you become an adult.

157
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,499
Just make sure you don’t pretend that you can speak Japanese.

158
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,666
Of course, not!

159
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,041
I don’t do things like that anymore, Aunty.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,041
Karma,

161
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,583
when you do get a job, let me know?

162
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,375
Why, Aunty?

163
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,166
Just let me know.

164
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Mum.

165
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,906
-Are you going out? -Why didn’t you tell me you’re back?

166
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,124
Never mind.

167
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,499
You don’t need to tell me anything.

168
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,040
You’re all grown up now, right?

169
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,791
-Do what you want. -Mum!

170
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,083
Let’s go out for dinner?

171
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,791
Sorry, I have a date.

172
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,875
This is what you wanted, right?

173
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,041
You want me to find a boyfriend, get married,

174
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,000
so I won’t disturb your life, right?

175
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:29,083
KARMA: SHAM, HOW ARE YOU?

176
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,750
Oh yeah,

177
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,041
how could I forget to put this on?

178
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,041
Karmila Azad!

179
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,749
-Miss Karmila. -Yes, that’s me.

180
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,165
You can call me Karma.

181
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,415
Tell me about myself, right?

182
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,957
Okay, I will tell you about myself.

183
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,624
No. I’ll go straight to the point.

184
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,665
Okay. That’s good. Then we won’t be wasting time

185
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,208
Why haven’t you ever had a permanent job before?

186
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,332
Before this, I was still searching for my passion.

187
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,750
Have you found it?

188
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,790
Not really.

189
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:13,457
So you’ll work here for two or three months, get bored, then leave?

190
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,332
No, I’m sure I'll work here for more than three months.

191
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,540
Four months?

192
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,915
No, I mean...

193
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,374
I don’t think this company is suitable for you.

194
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,457
You can give me a one year contract.

195
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,957
I can confirm I won’t quit because I can’t, right?

196
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,374
You can even give me a two-year contract!

197
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,290
You don’t even have to pay for my employee provident fund.

198
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,416
Thank you. Next!

199
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,499
KARMA: SHAM, HOW ARE YOU? (SENT)

200
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,416
Why didn’t the message go through?

201
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,916
Did he...

202
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,708
Did he block me?

203
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:27,958
KARMA: BOB, ARE YOU WITH SHAM?

204
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:32,249
BOB: NO, I’M BACK IN KUALA LUMPUR.

205
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,791
KARMA: WHY DID YOU COME BACK SUDDENLY?

206
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,291
Bob?

207
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,624
Karma, I have something to tell you.

208
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,625
Okay, what is it?

209
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,833
Bob!

210
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,915
Karma, I’m so sorry!

211
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,540
I didn’t know that you hadn’t told him about this!

212
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,749
If I had known, I wouldn’t have said anything, I swear!

213
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,290
He’s still angry about the shop,

214
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,458
and now, he’ll be angry about this too.

215
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,875
It’s not like anything happened.

216
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,874
I know that you honestly feel nothing happened.

217
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,708
But I feel you don’t understand how this might look to others.

218
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,499
I don’t care about other people, Bob!

219
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,250
I just care about Sham!

220
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,915
He was just fine not knowing anything, especially an innocent thing like that,

221
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,332
and now, for no reason, he’ll be even angrier with me.

222
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,499
Karma, I didn’t mean to, okay?

223
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,083
You've done some mistakes too!

224
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,207
Yeah, okay. It's all my fault.

225
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,291
No wonder Sham has blocked me. I've had it!

226
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,333
Karma...

227
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,415
Bob, calm down.

228
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,208
Calm down, Bob. This costs money.

229
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,041
Bob, take a breath.

230
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:49,499
BOB: SHAM, WHERE ARE YOU? KARMA IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

231
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,291
DID YOU BLOCK HER?

232
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,375
What am I going to do?

233
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:08,166
HADRI: KARMA, ARE YOU BUSY? LET’S HAVE COFFEE?

234
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:17,915
KARMA: HADRI, YOU MENTIONED A PLACE TO RELIEVE STRESS. LET'S GO.

235
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,375
HADRI: SERIOUSLY? LET’S GO!

236
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,166
Okay?

237
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,999
This one is "One",

238
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,290
and this one is, "Two."

239
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,749
One, two, duck.

240
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,208
One, two, duck!

241
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,915
-Okay! -Okay.

242
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,374
One, two, duck!

243
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,333
One more time.

244
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,333
Double kick!

245
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,333
Double kick!

246
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,458
More!

247
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,916
Okay.

248
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,915
Let’s go!

249
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,499
Okay let’s go, 132 pounds,

250
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,832
-Karma! -Yeah!

251
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,625
One, two!

252
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,040
More punching!

253
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,250
More!

254
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,416
Okay chill, stop!

255
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,458
Okay.

256
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,457
Hadri, are you okay?

257
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,250
Are you okay?

258
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,875
Please get up. Are you okay?

259
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,165
You're sweating buckets

260
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,124
yet you still want to hang out in an air-conditioned place

261
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,791
and eat ice cream?

262
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:52,583
When I’m stressed, I really crave things like this.

263
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,333
Hold on, I need to freshen up first.

264
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,123
The zipper is a bit stuck. Let me help you with it.

265
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,666
Why are you stressed? What happened?

266
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,191
I went for a job interview earlier.

267
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,666
But I failed it.

268
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,416
She asked why I’ve never had a permanent job.

269
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,416
Okay, what did you say?

270
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,166
I told her that I still haven’t found my passion yet.

271
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,374
I hadn’t even finished answering,

272
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,499
and she already jumped to conclusions, thinking the worst of me.

273
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,875
She said that I would quit after three months.

274
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,832
You can’t respond like that.

275
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,916
The interviewer doesn’t want to hear all that.

276
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,375
So how should I respond?

277
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,665
Okay, first,

278
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,040
let me ask you this.

279
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,374
If you’ve never had a permanent job,

280
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,175
what did you do after finishing your studies?

281
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,499
I did lots of things.

282
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,624
I made festive hampers...

283
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,916
Sold things online...

284
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,624
I was also a dropshipper until the brand went under.

285
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,825
And then I was Bianca’s personal assistant for a while.

286
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,250
Okay.

287
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,500
Let’s work with that.

288
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,666
Brain freeze!

289
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,833
Yes, for lunch tomorrow.

290
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,625
I’d like to book for two people.

291
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,041
Bianca Rozario.

292
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,333
Okay, thank you so much.

293
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,458
Mum, tomorrow I’m treating you to a lunch...

294
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,375
Who’s this?

295
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,833
My date.

296
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,208
What was your name again?

297
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,625
Aidan.

298
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,749
Eden.

299
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,457
And how old are you?

300
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,916
Bianca, that’s rude.

301
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,125
How old are you?

302
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,833
I’m twenty-one.

303
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,290
Twenty-one?

304
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,333
Twenty-one is already an adult.

305
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,582
Come, Eden.

306
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,666
Aidan.

307
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,666
Where do you think you’re going?

308
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,875
To my room. Where else?

309
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Mum!

310
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Mum!

311
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,500
Don’t you dare!

312
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,250
Mum!

313
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,582
Khatijah Musa!

314
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,790
Open this door right now!

315
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,833
How dare you bring a guy home!

316
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,083
You’d better open this door or I’ll break it down!

317
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,791
I’m going to count to three!

318
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,416
You’d better open this door or else!

319
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,082
Or else what?

320
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,875
It’s my life and you can’t tell me what to do!

321
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,708
One!

322
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,249
Goodness!

323
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,541
Mum!

324
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,250
What are you doing?

325
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,686
This is why we’re in your room, right?

326
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,166
No!

327
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,250
Two!

328
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,750
Put your shirt back on.

329
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,791
Three!

330
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,958
Okay! You asked for it!

331
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,707
All of them have given me invaluable experience,

332
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,207
not just in sales,

333
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:47,124
but also in market analysis, logistics, management, and a lot more.

334
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,041
I would be a strong addition to this company.

335
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,791
Okay.

336
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,415
When can you start?

337
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,124
Today! Tomorrow? The day after?

338
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,874
Whenever you want. I can even do yesterday!

339
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,415
Wow, you’re really motivated!

340
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,415
Okay, so you’re ready for your next interview?

341
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,583
Yes, Coach!

342
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,999
God willing. The next interview is definitely in the bag.

343
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,082
Amen.

344
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,833
I really need the money

345
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,416
to pay Sham back.

346
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,041
Not only that, I'm getting heat for other things too.

347
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,500
What is it this time?

348
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,249
It’s nothing.

349
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,250
It’s Bob, he told Sham about the time you helped me wash my hands.

350
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,166
Now, he’s angry for no reason.

351
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,040
Is he...

352
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,375
angry or is he jealous?

353
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,415
Jealous about what?

354
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,875
You were just helping me.

355
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,541
Bob is the one making assumptions.

356
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:44,083
Hadri, why don’t you speak to Sham?

357
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,249
He’s mad with me right now.

358
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,291
Whatever I say, he refuses to listen.

359
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,083
Please tell Sham that there’s nothing going on between us.

360
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,083
Is there nothing going on between us?

361
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,166
Hurry!

362
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,500
You like playing dress up?

363
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,290
No problem.

364
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,875
Okay Mum, I’m going in!

365
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,583
Why is it so quiet in there?

366
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,416
Mum!

367
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,416
Come here!

368
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,166
Wow, near the windows. Kinky.

369
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:34,875
Get out.

370
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:36,500
Why are there so many keys?

371
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,874
Climb down.

372
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,375
It’s easy.

373
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,750
Khatijah Musa!

374
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,749
It’s a huge drop.

375
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,541
You're handsome, but a coward!

376
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,166
Go!

377
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,833
There are too many keys.

378
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,416
You’ll be fine. Go!

379
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,833
Mum!

380
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,458
Mum!

381
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:02,750
Where is he? Barely out of puberty but trying to hit on my mother!

382
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,916
What do you care?

383
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,707
You have you own life!

384
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,666
Why are you minding mine?

385
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,708
I’m not going to let you make stupid...

386
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,541
Ouch!

387
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,333
I’m being serious, and you’re joking around.

388
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,166
Karma?

389
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,749
I didn’t expect to care for you like this.

390
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,582
I’m always thinking of you,

391
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,416
and I’m always wishing for your happiness.

392
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,290
Yes, I know you’re with Sham.

393
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,582
I try to respect that.

394
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,707
But every time I see you crying because of him,

395
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,915
I feel like telling Sham,

396
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:53,458
"Sham, if you can’t make Karma happy, then let me take over."

397
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,208
I know I’m catching you off guard.

398
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,124
Maybe you’re thinking,

399
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,708
"Hadri is being so rude when he knows I’m with Sham."

400
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,749
It’s just that I don’t want to meet you years down the line,

401
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,665
and see that you’re still unhappy.

402
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,208
Because nothing changed.

403
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,583
I’m afraid I’ll really regret

404
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,166
not saying anything.

405
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,625
I don’t expect you to decide now.

406
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,000
I just want you to think about what I just said.

407
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:52,208
So, how’s the kid?

408
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,541
He’s okay.

409
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,000
Just a broken ankle.

410
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,750
He’s young. He’ll be fine.

411
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,500
What’s his name again? Eden?

412
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,083
I don't even remember.

413
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,290
Mum, this script seems interesting.

414
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,583
I’ve never played a single mum.

415
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,040
Who cares?

416
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,041
You don’t even want to act anymore.

417
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,666
Who am I to force you?

418
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:28,416
I don’t want to be controlling since apparently that’s my red flag.

419
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,416
No, for real.

420
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,500
Seems like a great script.

421
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,458
Why don't I read it now?

422
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,500
"Interior. Raihana’s house. Night."

423
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:53,083
Thanks, Hadri. For today.

424
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,458
My pleasure.

425
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:57,833
Your jacket.

426
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:09,165
My hair.

427
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,625
Let me help.

428
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,791
It’s stuck.

429
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,083
-I’m going to pull, okay? -Okay.

430
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,333
Hold on, let me get ready. Wait.

431
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,458
Sorry!

432
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,583
Hey!

433
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,999
We’re the same, Mum.

434
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,833
Stubborn.

435
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,274
We both don’t like to be controlled.

436
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,500
That’s not Karma’s fault.

437
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,392
If you want to be angry, be angry with me.

438
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,125
Is it just me who has to think about you?

439
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,915
Who’s going to think about me?

440
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:54,416
Sham! Don’t go!
