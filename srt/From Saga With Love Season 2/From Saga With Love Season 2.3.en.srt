1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,440
My God, Karma! You scared me.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,799
Why aren't you asleep yet?

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,400
It's already dawn!

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,920
I can't sleep.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,640
Enough of that.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,999
The fire already happened.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,880
What can you do?

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,080
But everything's gone, Mum.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,560
That was all Sham's money.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,720
Sham trusted me to look after the shop while he is away.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,720
What's going to happen now?

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,480
I know, but…

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,040
You can recover from this.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,680
There will be other new opportunities. God willing.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,080
Try talking to him.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,799
Explain it to him properly.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,120
He'll understand.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm afraid, Mum.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,239
But it was just an accident, right?

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,440
It wasn't on purpose.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,480
Besides, there's insurance, right?

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,960
INSURANCE FORM

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,640
I didn't manage to send it.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,680
The shop doesn't have insurance, Mum.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,640
I will pray for you.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,000
There are still some over there.

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,520
And there are some here too.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,519
All these are limited editions.

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,240
Meaning, there are no other copies.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,559
So you're the only one with this.

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,759
-For social media, right? Find us at... -Sir, this one is priced lower.

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,040
This one is a limited edition.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,480
It doesn't feel right after the fire.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
What are you doing, Bob?

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,640
Weak!

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,440
Come on, Bob.

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,519
What else can you do

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,200
besides shooting Karma?

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
Listen up.

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,280
Let's call him up,

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,280
talk calmly. We'll settle this, okay?

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Are you afraid?

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,639
What's there to be scared of? Who are we?

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
We're honest people.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,480
Okay.

46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,840
-Darling? -Sham!

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Sham, how is everything? How is Master Akiro?

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,320
Master is sick. He has Parkinson's.

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,520
-Parkinson's? -He is losing control of his hands.

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,360
So now, he no longer makes pottery.

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,080
Poor Master.

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Can he get better?

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,320
He can't get better.

54
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,960
This illness can only be managed.

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Darling, I can't bear to see him like this.

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
It's hard for him to accept.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,480
I feel bad just hearing about it.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Anyway...

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,560
Are you okay? How's the shop?

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,336
Everything's okay. The shop is okay. Sales are okay too.

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,640
Seriously? Sales are okay?

62
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
That's good to hear.

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,479
If I'd known you could manage it,

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,200
I would've given the shop to you.

65
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,200
What? Wait a moment!

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,959
There's a customer.

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,479
Can I call you back later, Sham?

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
Okay? Bye, Sham! Bye!

69
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
Okay, bye.

70
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,840
You coward!

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,920
You're good-for-nothing!

72
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,160
Borrow money?

73
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
For what?

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,680
It's complicated.

75
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,920
You know, the shop was Sham's whole life.

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,640
His lifeblood.

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,480
Pottery.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,920
So you're going to buy a new shop?

79
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
No.

80
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,680
I want to meet him in person,

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,240
I want to help him take care of Master Akiro.

82
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,479
Soften his heart, comfort him...

83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Wait!

84
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,040
You want to go to Saga?

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,656
That's why I want to borrow money from you.

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,839
I need to buy a ticket.

87
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,279
Great! Let's go together.

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,200
You want to come along?

89
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,240
I've already thought about it, Karma!

90
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,320
I feel like Saga is the place that can spark my creativity.

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes!

92
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
Let's repeat our adventures in Saga!

93
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,120
I can already see the title of my film!

94
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
"Bob's Saga: Part Two!"

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
Together with Karma!

96
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,320
No, just Bob.

97
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,680
Hopefully, this first date will be okay.

98
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,520
So far the other dates were terrible!

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,840
But this guy, Jeff. He seems promising.

100
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,160
That's good, but are you planning to wear that for a first date?

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,000
He said to where something casual and comfortable. No dress. No skirt.

102
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,439
You're right.

103
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
That's weird, right?

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,679
Where is he planning to bring me?

105
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,959
Okay Mum, whatever it is, send me your live location.

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,279
And share them with Aunty Nina and Aunty Adele.

107
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,239
Okay, I'll do it right now. Thanks, Bianca.

108
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,880
Okay Mum, have fun!

109
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,160
You ready?

110
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,760
-This is the garden? -Yes.

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,760
The best dishes are made with the best ingredients.

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,719
So, today,

113
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,599
we're eating at a place that has the best

114
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
and freshest ingredients.

115
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,200
Okay, you can wait over there.

116
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll call the chef.

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,280
Go.

118
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
So...

119
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,079
We'll start with

120
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,120
special lettuce beef wrap.

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,560
Then I want you to try two different types of pasta.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,040
How does that sound?

123
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
You can cook?

124
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,400
Wow!

125
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,400
I've been too lazy to cook ever since I started living alone.

126
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,320
I only know how to eat.

127
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,760
Then we’ll make a great team.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,240
For sure. Come. Sit.

129
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,160
-Thank you. -Okay. Give me a minute, all right?

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,320
When you're there, don't stay at Master Akiro's house.

131
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,880
It's not proper. An unmarried woman staying at a man's house.

132
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
No, Mum.

133
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:40,080
I'll be staying with Bianca when I'm there.

134
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,560
Call me when you get there.

135
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,720
Of course. I miss you already.

136
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,840
I'm heading off now, Mum.

137
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,080
Mum, tell Fadhila to wait for me when she's about to give birth, okay?

138
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,640
Tell her to wait for me.

139
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,079
Bye, Mum. I'm off!

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,360
Bye. Take care.

141
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Master!

142
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Are you all right?

143
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,720
I was... shaving.

144
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,960
Come. Let me help.

145
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,200
There. All done.

146
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,840
Wow. What a heartbreaker.

147
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,720
Thanks, Sham.

148
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,680
I'm so tired.

149
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
Why wasn't it like this before?

150
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,879
Yeah, back then, we were VIPs.

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,399
We had someone picking us up from the airport.

152
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,520
There was a driver. It's not the same.

153
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,359
Karma? I need to go to the toilet. It's an emergency.

154
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,759
Can you watch my bag?

155
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,920
-Look after the camera. -Hey!

156
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,560
Just a moment.

157
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,920
Coffee.

158
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Coffee!

159
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,400
What is this?

160
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
I’m sorry!

161
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,399
It’s okay.

162
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Please.

163
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,280
I'll wash it for you.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,040
No, please. Don’t worry.

165
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,000
English? Good!

166
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,120
Let me wash it. Please.

167
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,200
I will let you know when it’s clean.

168
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,000
It’s okay. You don’t have to.

169
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,520
I insist.

170
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,760
Okay, then.

171
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,721
I will call you when it’s done. What's your phone number?

172
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,279
Okay, I've got to go.

173
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,520
Thank you.

174
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
Sorry! Again!

175
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Hadri? Sounds like a Malay name.

176
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
-Shall we? -Let's go.

177
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,120
Enjoying the coffee all to yourself?

178
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,960
-Sham! -Handsome Boy!

179
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,040
Bob! Karma! What are you guys doing here?

180
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,359
Just wanted to surprise you, darling.

181
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,440
That's crazy.

182
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I didn’t expect this.

183
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
How's the shop?

184
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,240
Don't worry about the shop.

185
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,039
What's important now is Master Akiro.

186
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,696
We actually came here to see Master Akiro.

187
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
You guys are so sweet.

188
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,760
It's like a reunion, only missing…

189
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,840
-Bianca! -Karma!

190
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Bob!

191
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,400
Cheers!

192
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,599
-Feed her. Feed her now. -I'm doing it. Here.

193
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,640
-Faster. -So sweet.

194
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,200
It’s nice to see all of you here again. Not much has changed.

195
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,200
Yes.

196
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,140
Some things have changed.

197
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,440
Yes! Bianca’s Japanese is very good!

198
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,280
I’m still learning, Master.

199
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,040
She's still learning!

200
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,080
Even though I don't understand, this is the vibe that I want.

201
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,600
Karma, can you move to the side?

202
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,160
You’re the one who needs to move.

203
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,600
Move, sit and eat.

204
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,640
I’m sorry, Master.

205
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,120
Karma!

206
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,560
Not much has changed.

207
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,960
I can't believe

208
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,400
that you actually came.

209
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
How is Master?

210
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
What did the doctor say?

211
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,360
The doctor did provide some medication.

212
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,200
The medication only slows down the progression of his illness.

213
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,320
But eventually, someone will need to take care of him full-time.

214
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,080
Does he have any family?

215
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
He’s never been married.

216
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
He has no siblings.

217
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,040
He’s really all alone.

218
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,520
What worries me the most is if he can’t come to terms with his condition

219
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,640
I’m worried he might become depressed,

220
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,600
especially when I go back to Malaysia.

221
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I understand.

222
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Anyway...

223
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,040
how's the shop?

224
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,440
We must be running low on stock.

225
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,560
I will make some more.

226
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Darling?

227
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,800
Which items sold the most? Plates? Cups?

228
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Sham?

229
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,160
-I have to tell you something... -Sham?

230
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Come here.

231
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Hold on, okay?

232
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Yes, Master?

233
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,839
Your apartment is so nice. It's cute.

234
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,320
I know, right?

235
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,719
But my mother was worried. She was all...

236
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,199
"It's so cramped. Feels stuffy."

237
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,799
"Can you even study here?" And all that.

238
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,959
It almost turned into a fight, okay?

239
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,440
When do you two not fight?

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
How is Aunty Kathy?

241
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,760
She started to date again.

242
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,319
And she found someone. His name is Jeff,

243
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,760
and my mother is crazy about him.

244
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,480
What are you doing?

245
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,640
Are you shaving?

246
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,440
Do you have a moustache?

247
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,800
No.

248
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:36,240
This device is to tighten your face. Want to try it?

249
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
It's okay.

250
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I'm using this.

251
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Who's this Jeff?

252
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,919
Jeff just suddenly appeared

253
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,000
right when my mother was giving up on online dating.

254
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,280
All the guys she's met on the app, their profiles are great.

255
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,480
But in person, it's the opposite.

256
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,201
Back then, Aunty Kathy was the one who taught me how to be a stalker.

257
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,880
Surely she did some research before meeting them?

258
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,960
That's typical. So good at giving advise

259
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,680
but not great at taking it herself.

260
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,840
Anyway, this Jeff seems great so far.

261
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,519
He's handsome, cool, rides a chopper...

262
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,840
Seriously? He's a pilot?

263
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,400
Not the helicopter.

264
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,280
Chopper like the big motorcycle.

265
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,439
-And then... -Yes?

266
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,800
He cooked for her on their first date.

267
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,559
Wow. Handsome,

268
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,920
rich, cool, knows how to cook...

269
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,200
He sounds perfect.

270
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Wait.

271
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,040
If he's so perfect, why is he single?

272
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,280
I once watched a documentary about scammers.

273
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,880
"Love Scammers", right?

274
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,279
And they target…

275
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,120
Women around Mum's age!

276
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,000
Do you think he's a…

277
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,000
scammer?

278
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,080
How would I know? I'm here and she's over there!

279
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,879
Why don’t you ask your mother to introduce you to him?

280
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,120
Isn't it too early?

281
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,559
Better to be early and safe.

282
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,680
You’re right.

283
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,960
My mother is already in a vulnerable state.

284
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,560
She's an easy target.

285
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,920
I don't have a moustache, Karma.

286
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,060
Of course you don't!

287
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
You don't.

288
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
-This is your campus? -Yes!

289
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,319
It's great!

290
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,480
Just like in an anime!

291
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,559
So beautiful.

292
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,680
Let’s take a photo together.

293
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,160
Let’s do a selfie.

294
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,120
Here.

295
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,121
Actually, I've been wanting to further my studies.

296
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Not that I don't want to.

297
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,840
But I think of my sisters.

298
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
So cute!

299
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,320
But why in Malaysia?

300
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,160
Karmila Azad, come down.

301
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,480
This girl.

302
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,640
-It's good. -It's good?

303
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,279
That flavour seems weird though.

304
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,640
-How would you know if you don't try? -You're right.

305
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,160
Didn't you say you wanted coffee? There's coffee there.

306
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,879
This is great. I never thought I would have a friend

307
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,520
who's studying in a Japan.

308
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,040
I'm so proud!

309
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,040
You...

310
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,920
We meet again.

311
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Excuse me.

312
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,560
You two…

313
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,760
know each other?

314
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,960
We met at Saga station yesterday.

315
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,080
We bumped into each other.

316
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
You spilled coffee on me.

317
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,240
Yes! Your scarf!

318
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,160
I haven't cleaned it yet.

319
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,679
No problem.

320
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,040
How do you know Bianca?

321
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,040
It's a long story.

322
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,479
Karma was my personal assistant cum translator.

323
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,400
We first came to Saga together.

324
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,200
And we had a great time, right, Karma?

325
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Karma.

326
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,440
So you can speak Japanese?

327
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
How long will you be in Saga?

328
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,200
I know a little.

329
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,799
Like, "Hello", "Thank you", "Sorry",

330
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,720
and "Where is it?"

331
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,840
So how did you end up as a translator?

332
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,239
And you, how do you know Bianca Rozario?

333
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,160
We're coursemates and assignment partners.

334
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,920
Speaking of that...

335
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Here.

336
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,120
I think these places have potential.

337
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,640
-Okay. -I'll head off first, okay?

338
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,320
-We'll hang out later. -Okay.

339
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Thank you.

340
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
See you!

341
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,720
What a small world.

342
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Hey.

343
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,840
Why are you blushing?

344
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,440
I'm embarrassed.

345
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,920
You don't need to mention about my checkered past.

346
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,119
-Sham. -Yeah?

347
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,520
You said you were making something exciting.

348
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,320
Be patient.

349
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,160
You'll be surprised when you see these cups at a foot height.

350
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
That's it?

351
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,000
That's not exciting, Sham.

352
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
There's no action.

353
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:12,720
If you want me to perform a stunt, I can do it.

354
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,360
But you'd have to pay.

355
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,720
Sham!

356
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,359
It's so boring when it's you alone.

357
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,280
We need to have everyone,

358
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:22,120
so I can get some great shots.

359
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,560
We can't have everyone, Bob.

360
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,560
Bianca has classes every day, right?

361
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,320
She has to find the time.

362
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,200
I'll ask her to cut classes.

363
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,760
As long as we're all together.

364
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
-Sham. -Yes.

365
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,520
I'm serious.

366
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,559
If my script is not finished,

367
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,000
I would lose the grant.

368
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,640
Okay, how about this.

369
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,840
Master Akiro's birthday is next week.

370
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,920
We can do something.

371
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
The four of us.

372
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
That's a great idea.

373
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
We can have a party.

374
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,000
Master Akiro’s birthday.

375
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,920
Films with old Japanese men always win awards.

376
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Right.

377
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Awesome.

378
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Hey.

379
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,440
You're not shooting me anymore?

380
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,560
Shooting the ground is more exciting.

381
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,999
-Master. -Hello.

382
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,280
Hello.

383
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
Master.

384
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,600
Very sweet of Karma and Bob to come all the way here.

385
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,159
They miss you.

386
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,640
That can’t be true.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,480
It’s not me who makes Karma’s eyes light up.

388
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,000
She makes such an effort to see you.

389
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,280
You should take her out on a date.

390
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
A date?

391
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,680
Where?

392
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,800
I have an idea.

393
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,120
So, is there anything going on between you and Hadri?

394
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,400
I could tell the gossip blogs about you.

395
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,840
He’s great but not for me.

396
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,040
I want someone more mature.

397
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,160
Hadri is not mature?

398
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,240
It's not that he's not mature, he's just a bit like…

399
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,040
like you.

400
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,920
Like me? What does that mean?

401
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,760
SHAM: WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S GO ON A DATE.

402
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,879
Look at that face. That must be Sham.

403
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,040
Yes. He's asking me out on a date.

404
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,200
Okay, baby.

405
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,440
Baby?

406
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,800
Karma, have some respect for yourself.

407
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,880
My big baby!

408
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,040
Stop!

409
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,320
-Slowly. -Okay.

410
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm scared, it's dark.

411
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,960
Almost there. -Okay.

412
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,400
-Ready? -Ready.

413
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,520
-Let's go? -Let's go.

414
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,600
Wow!

415
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,960
Yay! Let's go.

416
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,400
One, two, three.

417
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,160
-Just shake his hand. -He'll move.

418
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,320
Just do it. He won't move. Here.

419
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,920
See. Your smile is so bright.

420
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
Happy when I'm with you, right?

421
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,960
Yes, very happy.

422
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,560
I need to go to the toilet.

423
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,440
-Wait here. -Okay.

424
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,520
Wait!

425
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,920
Wait!

426
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,440
Excuse me!

427
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,159
Hey, you!

428
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,800
Excuse me, wait!

429
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,400
Mister!

430
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,399
Mister!

431
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
Wait!

432
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,360
Thank God!

433
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Oh no. Now I'm lost.

434
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,440
It's okay. Let me check...

435
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,640
It died?

436
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,440
I shouldn't have taken so many videos.

437
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,920
Okay.

438
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,920
Wow, it works. What a throwback.

439
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Okay.

440
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
What's Sham's number?

441
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,080
Karma!

442
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,360
Okay. It's fine.

443
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,480
Hadri.

444
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,719
I should help where I can. To get Sham in a better mood.

445
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,440
Darling, why don’t you spend some time with Bianca?

446
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,919
Hadri and I are going on a roadtrip for our assignment.

447
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,919
Why don’t you come along with us, Karma?

448
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,159
Seriously, Jeff.

449
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,640
You’re 'ghosting' me?

450
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,320
This guy is smooth.
