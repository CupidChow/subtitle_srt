1
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,541
Aunty, do you want some chocolates?

2
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,208
Sure, why not.

3
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,666
Thank you.

4
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,625
Craving for sweets,

5
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,375
are you feeling troubled?

6
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,291
Problems with Sham?

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,125
What’s the issue?

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You can tell me.

9
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,541
I’m good at solving problems.

10
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,083
I don’t know, Aunty.

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,791
I don’t know where to start.

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,291
Is it Sham's issue or yours?

13
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,375
Definitely me.

14
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,041
I’m the problem, it’s me.

15
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:39,583
I knew it.

16
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,083
So what’s wrong with you?

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,583
Many things.

18
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,458
I can’t be relied upon.

19
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,083
I don’t know how to communicate.

20
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,083
I don’t think about others.

21
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,625
Long story short,

22
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,458
I am one giant red flag.

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,332
Jeff said the same thing about me.

24
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,583
He called me a red flag.

25
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,916
What are these flags actually about?

26
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:10,499
Okay, a red flag is like a warning.

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,874
This person can’t be trusted.

28
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,707
So don’t get close to her.

29
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,041
For a green flag,

30
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,832
this person is a good one.

31
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,582
All her qualities are on the checklist.

32
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,124
Then there’s the beige flag.

33
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,790
This one means she’s a bit strange,

34
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,790
but still acceptable.

35
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:30,083
So, does that mean red flags like us can’t have relationships?

36
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,375
Not really.

37
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,624
I think it’s possible

38
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,332
if we change ourselves into green flags.

39
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,541
So, how do we change?

40
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,416
That’s the thing.

41
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,791
One more time.

42
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,208
That’s enough.

43
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,958
Just a few more, Master. Come on.

44
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,375
No.

45
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:00,916
What’s wrong?

46
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,625
Is he tired?

47
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,333
He’s bored.

48
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,166
How can I leave him when he’s like this?

49
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,826
Physical health is one thing.

50
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,875
Mental health is another.

51
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,291
I’m scared he might get depressed, Bob.

52
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,208
Understood.

53
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,540
The other day, when we went on the road trip,

54
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,290
there was this one interesting place.

55
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,165
I think Master Akiro will like it.

56
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,125
How about we take him for a little trip?

57
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,958
Maybe it will lessen his boredom.

58
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,458
-This is a good idea. -Right?

59
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,166
Where to?

60
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:41,916
Rin!

61
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,791
Rin!

62
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,375
Rin!

63
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,791
Rin!

64
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,250
I want to go feed the fish.

65
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,041
Okay, you go. I’m going to rest.

66
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,625
BIANCA: MUM, HAVE YOU LANDED?

67
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,416
Something on your mind, Bianca? You’re quieter than usual today.

68
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:49,125
It’s nothing. I had a fight with my mother.

69
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:55,333
I see. What about?

70
00:05:55,791 --> 00:06:01,458
The usual. She wants me to live my life the way she wants it.

71
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:09,457
I used to fight with my mother like that too.

72
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:16,291
Then, I thought I escaped my karma when I had two obedient boys,

73
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:23,833
but I can see that Rin is going to be headstrong just like me.

74
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:32,540
But the love between mothers and daughters will always endure.

75
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,416
It's okay. Don't worry.

76
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,000
KASHIMA CITY

77
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,374
This is Kashima.

78
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,416
What’s in Kashima?

79
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,041
It’s a surprise.

80
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,666
We’ll arrive soon.

81
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,041
Let’s go.

82
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,291
I haven’t been here since I was a teenager.

83
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,500
What are you boys doing?

84
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,000
Follow me.

85
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,750
Let's go.

86
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,666
Okay guys, we’re going to have a race!

87
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:03,875
I’m going to win.

88
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,833
One, two, three!

89
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,166
Wait for me!

90
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,541
Today is a bit of a special day for Rin.

91
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,458
What will she be doing?

92
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,500
Rin will be doing her "Hajimate no otukai." Her first errand alone.

93
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,875
Just to buy some things at the mini mart.

94
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,624
Okay. I will drive her there.

95
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,916
No. She has to make her way there by herself. She will walk.

96
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,333
You want her to walk? Alone? She’s only seven!

97
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:58,750
I know, right? I did my first errand at four years old!

98
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:03,041
It’s way past time for her.

99
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,500
Rin!

100
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,458
-Come here! -Okay!

101
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:35,041
I want you to go to the mini mart, the one we always go to.

102
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,291
You know the way, don’t you?

103
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,541
I want you to go get us some ramune and some dorayaki.

104
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:49,832
And get three sticks of dango from the dango-seller near the mini mart.

105
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,999
-Got it? -Got it!

106
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,375
Well then, here.

107
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,582
-Goodbye. -I’ll be off now.

108
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,625
Okay, be careful.

109
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,291
Take care.

110
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,333
Okay.

111
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,125
It’s amazing. Nice, Bob, beautiful.

112
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,750
Okay, Bob. Now you have amazing footage.

113
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,500
What you need now, is a story. What is the story?

114
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,000
Come on, Bob. You can come up with a story. You’re Bob, after all.

115
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,375
What’s the story?

116
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,332
I’m so glad to see you having fun today, Master.

117
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:45,083
It feels good to play with the earth again.

118
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:50,041
I feel... connected again, to the earth.

119
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,166
I haven’t felt this since the last time I made something with clay.

120
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,291
Sham,

121
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:04,250
you know the question that Karma asked me the other night?

122
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:11,291
She asked, "If you had your life to do over again,

123
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,375
and you couldn’t do pottery, what would you do?"

124
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,333
You remembered? But you were drunk.

125
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,582
I was very drunk.

126
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,500
But it takes more than that for me to lose my faculties.

127
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,875
Anyway, I think I know the answer to her question now.

128
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,791
What?

129
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,375
I’m just going to the toilet for a bit.

130
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,457
My stomach is acting up.

131
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,875
Sure. I’ll just be here.

132
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,291
Bianca?

133
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:55,332
Don’t help her. She has to do this alone.

134
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,333
Okay.

135
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:07,375
My first life, as I knew it, is over. Now, it’s time for my second one.

136
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:15,833
I want to spend it embracing, "Wabi sabi."

137
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,750
"Wabi sabi"?

138
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,958
The nature of all things is impermanence.

139
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:33,083
I have forgotten this simple truth. Or I've let it go a long time ago.

140
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,541
Pottery was my life, but there is more to life than that.

141
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,500
There’s so much more to life.

142
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:55,083
There is beauty in everything, as long as I am present to experience it.

143
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,125
And that experience too, will pass.

144
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:10,708
So it goes with each passing moment, over and over.

145
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:19,916
To embrace what comes, to see what is beautiful and to let go of what leaves.

146
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:25,041
This is "Wabi sabi."

147
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,291
Sham.

148
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:36,708
Thank you for bringing me here, so that I may remember this lesson.

149
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,875
It was Bob’s idea.

150
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:49,500
Was it? I must thank him, then.

151
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,583
Where are you, birdie?

152
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,916
I’m sorry!

153
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,458
Excuse me, Mr. Bear?

154
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,666
I need to get to the mini mart, which way do I go?

155
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,291
Thank you, Mr. Bear!

156
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,541
Thank you!

157
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,583
Hello!

158
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,500
Bob, I think Master really enjoyed himself today.

159
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,000
And I feel like he has made peace with his illness.

160
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,290
I feel a bit more at ease.

161
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,041
Praise be to God. I feel relieved too.

162
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,666
Thanks, Bob,

163
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,083
for recommending this place.

164
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,290
It’s definitely a powerful remedy.

165
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:27,916
Actually, this wasn’t my idea.

166
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,457
It was Karma’s idea.

167
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:37,375
She thought if she suggested it, you wouldn’t listen to her.

168
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,708
Why would she think that?

169
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:49,958
Sometimes, it’s a bit hard to talk to you.

170
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,750
That’s nonsense.

171
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,083
Grandma!

172
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,333
Back already?

173
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,833
That was quick!

174
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,458
-Here. -Okay, thank you.

175
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,500
You bought all these?

176
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,500
Dorayaki.

177
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,416
Dango.

178
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,624
Did you do it all by yourself? Did anyone help you?

179
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,874
I was confused at a street but there was Mr. Bear walking along

180
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,458
and I asked him and he showed me the way.

181
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,291
Good job.

182
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:49,625
That was the right thing to do, ask if you need help.

183
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,333
Come, let’s drink ramune.

184
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,041
-Ramune? -Ramune.

185
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,250
This one’s yours, Bianca.

186
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,166
Teach Bianca how to open the bottle.

187
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,916
-It’s delicious! -Good?

188
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,041
That’s good. Open the other bottle.

189
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,458
Did Karma say that she finds it hard to talk to me?

190
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,291
Not exactly.

191
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,166
But, come on.

192
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,916
Before she left, she wanted to see you, but you didn’t want to.

193
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,375
That’s an example.

194
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,916
It wasn’t the right time, Bob.

195
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,000
I wasn’t ready to talk to her at that time.

196
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,083
But weren’t you the one who said there’s no right time?

197
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,250
That’s different.

198
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,958
I don’t think I’m hard to talk to.

199
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,499
When you guys went on the roadtrip,

200
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,666
and she fell and cut her hand.

201
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,499
Hadri helped her.

202
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,708
I was calm. I wasn’t angry.

203
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,000
You know about that?

204
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,124
It’s good that you’re okay with it.

205
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,249
I was so close to slapping that guy.

206
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,582
Like this, this is Karma’s hand, right?

207
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:36,250
He washed and washed...

208
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,333
What are you talking about?

209
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,625
What did Hadri do?

210
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:50,957
Of course it’s hard to let go.

211
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:55,500
Your instinct is always to protect the child and keep her safe.

212
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,540
Yes, exactly!

213
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:02,832
But at the end of the day, the child must become independent,

214
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,791
and you must let them. Even if it pains you to do so.

215
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,041
So this is what all mothers go through?

216
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,666
This was just a small taste of what motherhood is.

217
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,541
It’s not easy, Bianca.

218
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,707
Letting your child go into the world is

219
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,500
one of the hardest things you’ll ever do.

220
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,166
Sham.

221
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:58,958
Don’t be mad.

222
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,457
What I told you earlier, it wasn’t actually that bad.

223
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,666
I was being dramatic.

224
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,666
Sham,

225
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,750
don’t be angry with Karma.

226
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:14,875
Okay?

227
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,083
Don’t be like this.

228
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:20,125
If you’re like this, what about your relationship?

229
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,743
So, what am I supposed to do?

230
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,540
I don’t know.

231
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:31,249
Just don’t be like this.

232
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:37,790
Maybe this is your wake-up call, to fix what needs fixing.

233
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,166
Or maybe this is

234
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,500
a sign for you to

235
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,250
fight for this relationship.

236
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,833
So, all this time I haven’t been fighting?

237
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,208
Haven't I done my best for this relationship?

238
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,250
It’s always me who has to accept her,

239
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,540
who has to understand her,

240
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,875
who has to support her.

241
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,833
What about me?

242
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,875
Who is supporting me?

243
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,958
Boys, today has been wonderful.

244
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,666
Thank you.

245
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,166
I’m going in first. I really need to pee.

246
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,666
Sham.

247
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:06,457
Please thank Karma too, for suggesting this outing.

248
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:10,499
How did you know that it was Karma’s idea?

249
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,333
Who else would think of such a thing?

250
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,708
Certainly not you boys.

251
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,250
She is a real gem.

252
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:27,875
I know you have problems right now, but you shouldn't let her go.

253
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,541
You will regret it.

254
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,208
Take it from someone who already walked that path.

255
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,165
It’s so awkward now.

256
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,375
Sham doesn’t hide it at all when he’s angry.

257
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,041
I feel like going home.

258
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,665
It doesn’t feel good staying here like this.

259
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,125
You’re going home?

260
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,916
Let’s fly together?

261
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,374
I think I have to go home too.

262
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,040
To talk to my mother.

263
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,833
I have to do a bit of consoling.

264
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:31,333
WAYS TO REPAY SHAM’S MONEY. GET A JOB AND PAY INSTALLMENTS.

265
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:46,791
HADRI: KARMA, I’M IN KUALA LUMPUR NOW. YOU’RE BACK TOO, RIGHT? LET’S HANG OUT?

266
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,124
So you're bad at communicating?

267
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,500
Did he block me?

268
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:00,416
Double kick!

269
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:01,208
More!

270
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:04,790
I don’t think you understand how this could look to other people.

271
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:05,791
Mum!

272
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,583
How dare you bring a man back home.

273
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,416
Is there nothing going on between us?
