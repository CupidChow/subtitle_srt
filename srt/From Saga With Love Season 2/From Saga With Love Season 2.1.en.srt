1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
Karma!

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,360
You made plans with your friends without telling him,

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,640
while he sat around waiting to have dinner together with you.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,919
Seriously?

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
Then you went to karaoke until 2 a.m. without checking your phone?

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,039
I didn't do it on purpose.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,639
I'm not used to reporting everything.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,559
Reporting? That's not reporting. That's informing him.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,800
Let him know where you are and with whom.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,719
That's what you call a relationship.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,120
How would I know?

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,400
This is my first relationship.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,840
It's usually the guys who behave like this.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,800
Right?

15
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,919
If Sham is like that, then I’m fine with it.

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,239
Wow. Such confidence.

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm going to bite you.

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,000
You can’t take things so lightly

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,640
in a relationship.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
-Don't start. -No, I'm serious!

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,079
In a relationship, it's the small things

22
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,920
that could lead to bigger problems.

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
I don't think so.

24
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:00,401
I have no issues with whatever Sham wants to do.

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,599
Oh my God, she's really dense.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,800
Like a block of cement.

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm not talking about Sham, I'm talking about you.

28
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,840
Do you even know how to be a girlfriend?

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,960
Do I know how to be a girlfriend?

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,920
Mochi!

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,800
Mochi.

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,120
Mochi!

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
FROM SAGA WITH LOVE

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,559
Peace Be Upon You!

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
Sham?

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
Breakfast bento?

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
If I had known earlier, I wouldn't eat so much.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
He went to so much trouble,

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,480
I shouldn't waste it.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,460
Karma?

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,600
This bento is delicious.

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,320
Thank you!

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
It's such a sweet surprise.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,300
That's…

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,360
my breakfast.

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,900
Oh no.

47
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,800
Oh no.

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
Sorry I...

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,320
Oh no.

50
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,720
It's okay. I'll buy you Nasi Lemak later.

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,680
What did you do with the flowers?

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
I...

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,820
I trimmed them.

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,760
I arranged them neatly.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,440
And then I put them in a vase.

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Why?

57
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
Did you forget what today is?

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,200
Today?

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,880
VISIT SHAM'S MOTHER'S GRAVE.

60
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,320
The flowers are for his mother's grave!

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Oh my God.

62
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,160
Help me.

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,600
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.

64
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Hey!

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Follow me!

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,199
Follow me, don't let me go solo.

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,239
What's the Healer for?

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,400
Oh my God!

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,839
You're right! He's just dead weight!

70
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,879
Sorry, I'm used to being a Tanker.

71
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,740
Okay.

72
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,900
We'll play again.

73
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
Let me be the Healer this time?

74
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,759
Play again?

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,560
Yes.

76
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,620
I can't.

77
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,140
I have to help my mother.

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,640
I have to get ready to go out with my girlfriend.

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,640
What are you doing with a girlfriend?

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
After breaking up with my old girlfriend,

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,640
it's only right to have a new one.

82
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,240
You're twelve!

83
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,160
Whatever!

84
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,680
Go out with your girlfriend then!

85
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,520
I have work to do anyway.

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
We’ll continue tonight, okay?

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Hello?

88
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Never mind then.

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
DEAR KARMA

90
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,720
A FILM BY BAHARI MALIK

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
I'll continue tomorrow.

92
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Hey.

93
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Where's my Nasi Arab?

94
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,720
What’s taking so long?

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,000
Hello?

96
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,960
Hello, I'm the food delivery guy.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Which one is your condo?

98
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm confused.

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,540
What…

100
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,540
Why are you confused?

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,120
There's a signboard right in front!

102
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,280
And there's a big tree next to the guardhouse.

103
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,200
That one!

104
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:59,280
A big tree?

105
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
Okay, I’ll look for it.

106
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
You damn…

107
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,360
Oh my God.

108
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,759
Where are you?

109
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,960
I should be asking you that.

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,320
Aunty Kathy!

111
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,799
Write a note or something.

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,240
-I wouldn’t have eaten... -Darling.

113
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,520
-You… -Yes?

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,920
This plastic can't be recycled.

115
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,480
Yes, I'm sorry. It’s my mistake.

116
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Oh no.

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
Sorry.

118
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,480
It's fine.

119
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:45,760
It's okay, no need to worry.

120
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,679
Let me do it.

121
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,080
Go home and change.

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,656
You're coming with me to the cemetery, right?

123
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Yes!

124
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,920
Yes, I'm coming.

125
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,240
Wait for me?

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,100
I won't be long.

127
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
I'm going now.

128
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,680
Thank you!

129
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,200
Wait for me!

130
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,160
Okay. I'm okay.

131
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,040
Why didn’t you pick up my calls?

132
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,640
You didn’t reply to my texts.

133
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,960
I've been busy, Aunty Kathy.

134
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,480
I've been busy writing.

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,420
Good.

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,440
So your script is ready?

137
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,920
No, I’ve been writing. And then I…

138
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
I deleted everything.

139
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,240
Because that's part of my process as a creator.

140
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,660
It’s okay.

141
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Just send the document you deleted. Let me read it.

142
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Oh no!

143
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
But it's gone!

144
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,560
It's not even in the trash folder.

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,159
It's okay.

146
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,440
I know how to get it back.

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,960
Bring the laptop over. Now.

148
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,360
But…

149
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:57,480
Bob...

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
your acting is terrible, you know?

151
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,920
You haven't written anything yet, have you?

152
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Bob?

153
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,399
Sorry, Aunty Kathy.

154
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
You know, Bob,

155
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
when the grant expires,

156
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
there goes your chance.

157
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,920
Your reputation in this industry will also suffer.

158
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,000
But if you don't really want to do it, it's fine.

159
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Don't be a film director.

160
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
Just make wedding videos.

161
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
No.

162
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
I really want to make this film.

163
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,120
I swear, this is my passion.

164
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,920
So prove it!

165
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,880
Aunty Kathy!

166
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:41,039
I promise, I'll prove to you

167
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,760
that this is my passion!

168
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,160
Sir, I'm here with your food.

169
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,160
Bianca, your mother is really putting on the pressure.

170
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm stressed. How am I supposed to work like this?

171
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,240
Now you know what my mother is like as a manager.

172
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,880
That's what you get.

173
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,720
Bianca, you have to help me deal with her.

174
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,240
What should I do?

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,079
Okay.

176
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,279
Listen carefully,

177
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,840
do exactly as I say.

178
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,080
Okay.

179
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,280
What do I do?

180
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
You need to…

181
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,160
finish your work!

182
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
Bianca!

183
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,240
Damn.

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,119
I'm serious!

185
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,920
What did you expect?

186
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:26,239
She's going to feel sorry for you?

187
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,279
Please.

188
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm relieved that I'm no longer an actress.

189
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,120
MAMA CALLING My mother is calling me.

190
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,800
Again?

191
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,239
Bob, hold on a moment?

192
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,120
Wait, Bianca.

193
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm not done yet!

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,439
Hi, Bianca!

195
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,839
How’s my girl?

196
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,879
Where are you going?

197
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,679
I'm on my way to class.

198
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,079
I told you just now, right?

199
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
Oh, yes.

200
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Just a quick one.

201
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,760
I wanted to tell you,

202
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,080
I passed by a new gym just now.

203
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,000
It’s only for women.

204
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,280
There's even a swimming pool.

205
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,599
When you come home,

206
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
let's become a member?

207
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,680
When I come home?

208
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
You mean...

209
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,159
in two years?

210
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,199
Yes.

211
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
It's okay to plan early.

212
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,919
Of course it's okay.

213
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,999
But...

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,359
Why are you thinking about this now?

215
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,480
I miss you so much, Bianca.

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,080
I'm not used to not having you around.

217
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Mum?

218
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
I’ve been thinking...

219
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,960
How about...

220
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,359
Maybe...

221
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,519
You start dating again?

222
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
What?

223
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,480
Dating?

224
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,300
Okay.

225
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:33,700
There’s this app. It's called LateLove.

226
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,720
It's a dating app for old…

227
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,760
I mean...

228
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,200
for people your age!

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,120
Why don't you give it a try?

230
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,440
LateLove?

231
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,920
I’m never late.

232
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,640
Mum, that's just the name of the app.

233
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,839
Okay, Mum. I have to go.

234
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,880
We'll talk about this tonight, okay?

235
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Bye. Love you!

236
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,120
Okay. Love you too.

237
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,520
Bianca, I'm your most loyal friend.

238
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
How could you hang up while I was in a panic?

239
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
Bob, listen.

240
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,560
I have an idea on how to keep my mother from smothering us.

241
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,319
I’m listening.

242
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
We'll find her a boyfriend.

243
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Good.

244
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,120
Good. This is a good idea.

245
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,296
It's a good thing you're studying in Japan.

246
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
Okay now, Bob?

247
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,640
I need pictures.

248
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,319
I want photos of my mother looking beautiful,

249
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
sexy and amazing for a dating app.

250
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,200
Why do you think I'd have sexy photos of your mother?

251
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,880
Not sexy. I mean…

252
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,880
-her nicest photos. -Bianca!

253
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,919
Okay, I’ve got to go.

254
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,239
Don't forget to send them, okay?

255
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,640
Let's go? Otherwise, we'll be late.

256
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,720
Wait, Bianca. Who's that?

257
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,920
Bianca?

258
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,800
SAGA UNIVERSITY

259
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,520
Don't do it.

260
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:07,480
You’ve been looking at your phone for 9 hours today.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
Okay.

262
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,119
LANDLORD CALLING.

263
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,960
The shop rent! I haven’t paid the rent yet!

264
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,799
-Excuse me. -Hi!

265
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,879
Welcome!

266
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,800
Please come in.

267
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,160
Please have a look.

268
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,880
-I’d like to ask... -Yes?

269
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,679
The viral café that sells peanut butter coffee,

270
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
where is it?

271
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,760
That café is overrated!

272
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,639
It’s better to make your own,

273
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,800
and serve it in this cup.

274
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,960
You'll save money.

275
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,000
Isn't it pretty?

276
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,239
It's pretty!

277
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,680
RM239

278
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Oh my God!

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,039
This price is for the whole set?

280
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,120
For one cup.

281
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,520
It's pricey because it's from Japan.

282
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,399
Imported?

283
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,360
No. The person who made it is from Japan.

284
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,660
He's Japanese?

285
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,459
No. He's a Malay man from Ampang.

286
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,780
But he has lived in Japan before.

287
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,680
It's okay.

288
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Thank you.

289
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,960
Excuse me.

290
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:08,040
-Thank you. -Wait.

291
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,399
-Wait! -It’s okay, thank you.

292
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,960
There's more. A lot more!

293
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,840
It's okay!

294
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
Buy one free one? Discount?

295
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Staff price?

296
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
Thank you.

297
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Did the landlord call?

298
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
What?

299
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
It's nothing.

300
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Who was that?

301
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
The insurance agent.

302
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,520
He said he hasn't received the documents.

303
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,999
You haven't sent them?

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's been weeks.

305
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,400
That thing?

306
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,160
Sorry.

307
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,640
Karma,

308
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:46,920
insurance is important.

309
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,560
What if the shop got robbed?

310
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,440
I doubt it.

311
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:53,479
Who's going to wrap all these pottery?

312
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
And run off with them?

313
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,640
If they wanted money, there isn't any.

314
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,320
Can you send them?

315
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Please?

316
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,719
-I feel like I have to do everything... -Okay..

317
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I'll send them right now.

318
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
Was there a customer just now?

319
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Yes.

320
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,160
But she didn’t buy anything.

321
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,520
She said it was too expensive.

322
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Expensive?

323
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,760
This would be considered cheap in Saga.

324
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,080
But we're not in Saga.

325
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,320
People here don't appreciate art like this.

326
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,399
They'd rather buy things from the dollar store.

327
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,679
You can get cups there too.

328
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,880
And plates.

329
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,880
This is the feedback that I've been getting.

330
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,960
I think your pottery is priceless.

331
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,360
It's art, right?

332
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
It’s just that...

333
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,680
What if we...

334
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,200
reduce the price a bit more?

335
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
No.

336
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,800
Just a little bit.

337
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Darling?

338
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
No.

339
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,800
Enough. I have to get back to work.

340
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,000
I was just saying...

341
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,200
WE’RE CLOSED.

342
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Closed.

343
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Hello!

344
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Karma!

345
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Sham!

346
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Hello?

347
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Sham!

348
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Karma!

349
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Karma?

350
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,960
Karma! Sham?

351
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,600
Karma!

352
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Sham!

353
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Karma?

354
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,200
You forgot to pay the rent?

355
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,400
I didn't forget but…

356
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Karma?

357
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
I used the money for the supplier.

358
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,319
Because I used the supplier money

359
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,920
to pay the electricity bill.

360
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,840
And the money for the bill?

361
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,480
I used it to pay for social media advertising.

362
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Oh God, please.

363
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,760
I don't know how to run a business.

364
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,240
My savings are almost gone.

365
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
But it's okay.

366
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
It's settled.

367
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Sorry, Sham.

368
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,840
I thought I could make some sales before rent is due.

369
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,120
Let me cook for you tonight?

370
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Why?

371
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,420
Are you trying to comfort me?

372
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
No way.

373
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,700
Yes!

374
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:13,900
Please let me comfort you,

375
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,400
or else I wouldn't be able to sleep.

376
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,880
What are you going to cook?

377
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Surprise!

378
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Because I don't know yet.

379
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,720
KUMIKO CALLING

380
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Hello.

381
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Kumiko?

382
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,680
Hello, Sham?

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,960
I’m sorry to bother you.

384
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,280
Can you talk right now?

385
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,640
It’s about Master Akiro.

386
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,400
Is anything the matter?

387
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,600
He had a bad fall recently. We had to take him to the hospital.

388
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
What?

389
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,879
Don’t worry.

390
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,399
He’s okay now

391
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
and has returned home.

392
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,280
But Sham,

393
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,960
I think he needs assistance.

394
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,799
I did suggest it to him, but you know how proud he is.

395
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,400
In fact, please don’t tell him I called.

396
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,760
It would upset him.

397
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,240
Yes. Of course.

398
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,880
I’ll check on him.

399
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,760
Thank you so much for taking him to the hospital, Kumiko.

400
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,640
What are neighbours for?

401
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,320
Anyway, I’ll leave you to it.

402
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Okay.

403
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,120
Thanks again, Kumiko.

404
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,960
CALLING MASTER AKIRO

405
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,720
So...

406
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,080
KATHY'S PROFILE what do you think?

407
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,800
Okay.

408
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Approved.

409
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,600
Great.

410
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,600
So now, you can start swiping.

411
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,720
So, for no, swipe left.

412
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,000
For maybe, swipe right, correct?

413
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Yes, exactly.

414
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,999
Mum,

415
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
why are you just swiping left?

416
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,040
I have standards, Bianca.

417
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,680
James, 50, is checking you out.

418
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,520
Checking me out?

419
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,440
Wow, that was fast!

420
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Is he handsome?

421
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,160
Bianca, I accidentally pressed "Check him out too."

422
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
How do I undo it?

423
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Undo!

424
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,279
Undo!

425
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,799
Okay, Mum. Calm down.

426
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,160
And stop everything now!

427
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,120
Stop!

428
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:09,279
Stop. Mum!

429
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,320
Stop!

430
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Thank you.

431
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,680
The soy sauce-chicken was delicious.

432
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
It was good, right?

433
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,519
Okay, Karma. Focus.

434
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Okay.

435
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Darling.

436
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,840
Master Akiro’s neighbour called me earlier today.

437
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,599
She told me that Master had a bad fall,

438
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,880
and had to go to the hospital.

439
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,920
And she told me,

440
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,280
Master needs someone to take care of him.

441
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,800
And then I called him.

442
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
But he didn't answer.

443
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
I'm worried.

444
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Done!

445
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,200
Look at this. Did I do it right?

446
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Why?

447
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,040
Did you hear what I said?

448
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Sorry I...

449
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,320
What did you say?

450
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,200
I was telling you something serious.

451
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,719
But you're just playing around.

452
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,240
No! I was…

453
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Sorry.

454
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
What did you say?

455
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
I'm listening.

456
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,960
Next time.

457
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Go home.

458
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
It's late.

459
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
But…

460
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm tired.

461
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,760
Today was…

462
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
a lot for me.

463
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
I'm going to bed.

464
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Okay.

465
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
I'll see you tomorrow.

466
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,720
You don't need to come tomorrow.

467
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,400
How about you take a short break?

468
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,120
Let me take care of the shop.

469
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Oh God.

470
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,000
Help me.

471
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
I don't know how to be an adult.

472
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,920
Mum.

473
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,161
Mum, help me charge my phone. I can't reach the charger.

474
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,200
Why haven't you gone to the shop?

475
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Everything okay?

476
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,640
Or is there a problem with Sham?

477
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,120
Yes, a small problem.

478
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,480
Small?

479
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,360
Okay, it was pretty big.

480
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,079
He hasn't called me for 2 days.

481
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
He hasn't even texted.

482
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,640
No "Good morning" texts.

483
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,000
Why don't you text him first?

484
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm scared. What if he doesn't reply?

485
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm probably a bad girlfriend.

486
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,240
Sham said that?

487
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
No.

488
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,960
Suhaila and Fadhila said it.

489
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,000
Your sisters are just teasing you.

490
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,080
No one is perfect.

491
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,680
When we recognise our own shortcomings,

492
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
we just have to work on them.

493
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
That's all.

494
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:01,880
But I've already given it my best.

495
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,440
That's what you think.

496
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,800
But the world doesn’t only see things from your perspective.

497
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,160
We need to seek others' opinions too.

498
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,760
I'm scared!

499
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,640
What are you scared of?

500
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,240
My big girl acting all cute.

501
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,560
That kid is twelve years old!

502
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,320
Twelve! And his girlfriend is fourteen.

503
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,120
While I have nothing going on.

504
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,160
That's on you.

505
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,880
You had Bianca.

506
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,200
But you said no!

507
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,960
Bro, good thing it didn't happen.

508
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,399
If I get a mother-in-law like Aunty Kathy,

509
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,200
I'll be done for.

510
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,460
Daily calls, e-mails, messages,

511
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,860
asking about the script.

512
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,440
There’s no more "Hello, Bob", "Please, Bob."

513
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
She goes straight to it.

514
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:49,960
"Bob, update progress."

515
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,160
Makes sense. You've been dealing with that thing for months.

516
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
When will it be done?

517
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,760
Easy for you to say.

518
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
The ideas are not flowing.

519
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
What am I supposed to do?

520
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,880
How did you do it the last time?

521
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,280
Your short film.

522
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,160
Try to remember.

523
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,440
How did I do it the last time?

524
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,080
How did I...

525
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,520
Let me think.

526
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,999
There're soft fish crackers, and crunchy fish crackers.

527
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,640
There's some chicken satay… Speaking about satay,

528
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,199
don't be like this rich kid.

529
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,720
He asked for a wagyu satay at the night market.

530
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
I didn't!

531
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,639
He was full of it, he even ordered in English.

532
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,600
"Excuse me, wagyu satay please."

533
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,680
You're good at making up stories.

534
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,239
REPLY TO @BAHARIMALIK

535
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,360
WOW. I HAVEN’T SEEN SHAM LAUGH LIKE THAT IN AGES.

536
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Hey, girls.

537
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,640
What are your biggest red flags?

538
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,279
For me,

539
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,600
3 RED FLAGS IN RELATIONSHIPS these three things are major.

540
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,319
First, when they don't know how to communicate.

541
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,079
Never telling you where they are,

542
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,040
or what they're doing.

543
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,000
Is it so hard?

544
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:40,239
Second, when they don't remember the important dates.

545
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,719
Especially for things like birthdays

546
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,039
or anniversaries.

547
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,640
And lastly, they don't care about you.

548
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,639
Okay.

549
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,000
At least I'm not like that.

550
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,999
For example, when we're pouring our hearts out,

551
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,560
and they're totally oblivious.

552
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,359
If I see these red flags,

553
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
I won't hesitate, I'd just break up.

554
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,240
What are your red flags?

555
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,759
I'm a…

556
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,480
red flag?

557
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,959
I just found out that I'm a red flag.

558
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
I have to go back to Saga.

559
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:22,879
Can you take care of the shop by yourself?

560
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,160
Welcome!

561
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,960
Three dates in a day?

562
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,360
I want it fast and faster.

563
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,680
What is it now?

564
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,560
Khatijah Musa?
