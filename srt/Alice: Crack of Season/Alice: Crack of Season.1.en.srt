00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,900
Rose said this:

2
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,900
"Alice, things would come very quickly,
or could maybe come very slowly anyway."

3
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
"Alice: Crack of Season"

4
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,700
Since today is the third, all of those
numbers 3, 13, and 23—come up and solve them.

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,300
Let's stop here for today and
come to Teacher Kwon Daju's office.

6
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
How did you end up at MP, and
did you meet a lot of people there?

7
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,800
Can you take this out?

8
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,300
Just stay still for a moment.

9
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,300
Hey, where are you touching?

10
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,500
I just touched your back.

11
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
Look at them holding hands and walking.

12
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,000
Are they dating?

13
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,500
Is it weird?

14
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Weird, right?

15
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,500
It's not weird, though.

16
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,500
It's probably better to
not be around them, right?

17
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,600
Oz said that it rolls,
walks, jumps, and even flies.

18
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,710
Even so, Alice said that,
no matter how much it

19
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,440
rolled, walked, jumped, or flew, it
would at least pass by her.

20
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,100
Watch where you're walking.

21
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
You know what?

22
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,300
A friend wants me to get a
guy's number. What should I say?

23
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,010
- Is he handsome?
- I don't know.

24
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,730
If he's good-looking, just do it.
Let me see his picture.

25
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,710
Shouldn't you be ready just in time
since I came to pick you up?

26
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,370
Didn't you think about it at all?

27
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,370
I wanted to do that too.
But I woke up late.

28
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,630
You don't even study, though?
What did you do yesterday, huh?

29
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,400
What are you doing?

30
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,700
Why aren't your hands up?

31
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,700
Hey.

32
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,500
Did you do it?

33
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,700
What?

34
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,600
You said you were getting
the number of that guy, right?

35
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
Oh, that.

36
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,700
I didn't.

37
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,500
- Why?
- He was ugly.
- What the heck!

38
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,300
- Yeah...
- Hey, are you even listening properly?
- Yes.

39
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,900
Anyway, then I'll give
your number to my friend.

40
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,500
- No, no need to.
- What?

41
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:01,900
Why not?

42
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,000
He's extremely handsome like a celebrity!

43
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Whatever, I'm fine.

44
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Why? Just accept his number! Hey
Yoon Hye, did you hang up on me?

45
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,300
Uh, hello? Were you asleep?

46
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,400
Me? I'm just exercising.

47
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,300
Are you trying to
lose weight or something?

48
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,400
Traitor.

49
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,500
From now on, all the meat
that comes with school lunch is mine.

50
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,730
In the end, when it appeared in front of me

51
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,940
all of that fear and anxiety went away.

52
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,100
I won't try to avoid it anymore.

53
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,170
If it was something I could control, it

54
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,350
probably wouldn't have gotten this close.

55
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,900
Alice nodded and took it in both her hands.

56
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,000
Who is it?

57
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,000
- Him.
- Him?

58
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,900
The person I was introduced to.

59
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,200
The ugly one?

60
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,200
You agreed to be introduced?

61
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,110
No, it's just that my friend went ahead

62
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,540
and gave out my
number without asking me.

63
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,100
Ignoring him immediately
would be a bit rude.

64
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,300
But then why didn't you say anything to me?

65
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,400
Ahh... I totally forgot.

66
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,900
Are you upset?

67
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,900
Hey, don't get upset. You know
you're the only one I have, right?

68
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,100
Hey, Yoo Eun-hye.

69
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,300
What are you doing?

70
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
Why? What?

71
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,100
Wanna drink?

72
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,700
Why, what?

73
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,220
But seriously, a grown woman like you

74
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,470
shouldn't you not be
wandering around at night?

75
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,100
What about you, then?

76
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,100
Me?

77
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,600
I came here because
you're not talking to me.

78
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,300
I really didn't start talking to him
because I was interested in him.

79
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,700
I was going to turn him down.

80
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
And I was going to tell you,
too. Seriously, I mean it, for real.

81
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,500
So just calm down a bit, okay?

82
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,300
I ate by myself earlier,
and I went home alone too.

83
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,600
Okay?

84
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,700
- Yoo Eun-hye.
- I said it's done. Just stop.

85
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,800
- You're not mad anymore, right?

86
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Fine.

87
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
"There isn't anything I'm
thinking about right now."

88
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,100
Alice said.

89
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,900
It's okay, Alice. Take your time and
think it over again later, much later.

90
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,100
What its name might be.
What you'd like to name it as.

91
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,300
But either way, we have to
go back to school in two weeks.

92
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Why bother giving us this much homework?

93
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Whatever, stop talking.

94
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,800
It makes me feel more tired.

95
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,500
Alright, alright, I was wrong!

96
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,450
I only teased and played around with
you since I won't see you on summer break.

97
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,150
You're going somewhere?

98
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
- No.
- But why can't we see each other?

99
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,100
Wait, are you saying we should just
go to the library every single day?

100
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,100
When you're at home,
you keep falling asleep, right?

101
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,700
Oh, okay.

102
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,820
Alright, then let's take a
break tomorrow and go the next day.

103
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,060
- No, let's start tomorrow.
Starting tomorrow.

104
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,337
Do you want to grab some
ramen before we head in?

105
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,500
Sounds good, hmm.

106
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,400
Alice said, “Is it something you can
only understand once you become an adult?”

107
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,900
"It's not a matter of being
a child or adult, Alice."

108
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Oz said.

109
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
The season of Alice is changing.
