Episode 14

00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,976
[Risking life and limb]

4
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,146
Shopkeeper

5
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:12,082
Shopkeeper

6
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:12,782
I've inquired

7
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:13,750
It was around the 4 pm when people saw

8
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,151
the Supreme Clarity Division head up the mountain

9
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:16,553
They were dragging a prison cart with them

10
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:17,887
They came down before sunset

11
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:19,022
No casualties were seen

12
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:21,124
In just a short span of two hours

13
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,325
With so few people

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,361
It's impossible to capture many spirits

15
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:25,562
The Supreme Clarity Division

16
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,364
paraded the prison cart up the mountain

17
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:28,898
for what purpose?

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,234
From the Northest Mountain
to the Supreme Clarity Division

19
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:32,869
The closest route is to the west

20
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:35,138
But they deliberately

21
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:37,040
Walked past the Herb Hall?

22
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,076
It was clearly meant to be seen by us

23
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:40,910
I understand

24
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:41,911
Shopkeeper

25
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:43,446
Are you suggesting

26
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:44,848
They want to provoke little Isatis

27
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:47,117
And then have her break into the
Supreme Clarity Division to rescue spirits?

28
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:48,918
Little Isatis

29
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:50,920
Has she been in her room all day?

30
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:51,821
No

31
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,189
After she learned of this matter

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,357
She's been bedridden all day

33
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,359
I even brought her dinner to her room

34
00:01:57,628 --> 00:01:58,261
That's not right

35
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,829
Shopkeeper

36
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,232
Little Isatis

37
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:25,348
Langdu

38
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:29,386
Why are you here?

39
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:31,121
So it's just a little Isatis Root

40
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:33,423
What are you doing in this godforsaken place?

41
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:34,958
I'm asking you

42
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:35,759
Today

43
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,660
Haven't you seen any other herb spirits

44
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,661
from the herb fortress get brought here?

45
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:39,963
Herb fortress

46
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm about to lose my life

47
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,668
And you expect me to care about the herb fortress?

48
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:47,904
I know

49
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,839
After you were driven out by the elder

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,307
You've always harbored resentment

51
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:53,476
We are from the same clan

52
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:54,711
How could I stand by and not save you?

53
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:56,279
I'm going to cast a spell to save you now

54
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,167
Isatis Root

55
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:19,235
I owe you one

56
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:21,404
I'll remember that

57
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:23,873
Today

58
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:24,541
Haven't you seen

59
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,942
any other herb spirits here?

60
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:28,077
Then how did you get captured?

61
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,047
Just my bad luck

62
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:33,616
Got greedy for a bit of treasure

63
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:35,885
and fell into their trap

64
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:38,988
If I ever see that Jiuming again

65
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,459
I swear I'll tear him limb from limb

66
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:46,129
Don't let them get away

67
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:52,502
Move aside

68
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:55,905
You should run

69
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:57,407
I'll use my magic to hold them off

70
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,044
I don't need a woman to protect me

71
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,148
Run, why are you just standing there?

72
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:32,442
Miss Isatis

73
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:40,383
Physician Jiu

74
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:42,185
Now that you've laid down your armor

75
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,187
You're no longer a member
of the Supreme Clarity Division

76
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:46,189
Considering our past acquaintance

77
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:47,957
Please don't force me to harm you

78
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:54,464
Search carefully

79
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:55,498
Don't overlook any corner

80
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,834
I did not see any woman

81
00:05:58,435 --> 00:05:59,402
Prince Ye, I beg your pardon

82
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:01,137
Go

83
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:02,005
Let's search over there

84
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,148
You are a prince

85
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,084
The Emperor's brother

86
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,289
I never expected that in the Northest Land

87
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:21,391
There would be someone who
doesn't recognize me, Feiye

88
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:23,793
By seniority

89
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,796
He should actually address me as his elder brother

90
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,500
I've only recently arrived in the Northest Land

91
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,635
I'm not very familiar with this place

92
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,271
That's why I accidentally trespassed on
the Supreme Clarity Division's territory

93
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:36,906
Thank you for saving me

94
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:38,675
It's a trivial matter

95
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:40,243
Not worth mentioning

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,847
I'll give you a lift on my way

97
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:08,998
Feiye

98
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,268
I will not allow you to harm her in the slightest

99
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,870
Ah Jiu

100
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:15,838
To save her

101
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:18,808
You'd even turn against me
