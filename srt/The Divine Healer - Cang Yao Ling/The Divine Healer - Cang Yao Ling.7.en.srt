[The Divine Healer]

00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 7

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,534
[Let's part here, may we not meet
again in the world of martial arts]

4
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:56,456
Eat slowly

5
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:57,857
Eat a little more

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,227
and this too

7
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:01,828
Here comes the chicken soup

8
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:05,265
Give it to me

9
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,702
You like kids so much

10
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,137
Why don't you two have one?

11
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,543
Come on, drink this chicken soup

12
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:22,582
Ning'er

13
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,818
How did you come to the Northest Land alone?

14
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,354
Ever since my father died last year

15
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:28,388
And my mother remarried

16
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,223
I've always been hungry

17
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,958
So I came to seek refuge with my grandmother

18
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,294
I finally managed to get over the Northest Mountain

19
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,062
A very nice couple

20
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,397
took me in for a few days

21
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:38,665
But then

22
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,034
On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival

23
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,636
They were killed

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,104
The Mid-Autumn Festival?

25
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,039
Are you talking about

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,607
the Li couple at the foot of the Northest Mountain?

27
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,944
They were so good to me

28
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:51,945
they fed me

29
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:54,648
And even made mooncakes for me

30
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,650
While we were eating mooncakes

31
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,018
someone knocked on the door

32
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,386
Brother Li went out to open it

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,454
Then suddenly

34
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,458
Ning'er

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,727
Do you remember

36
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,663
what the visitor looked like?

37
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,500
No

38
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,502
But I remember

39
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,137
That person was wearing an official's robe

40
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,672
and was holding a token

41
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:19,873
He said he needed to conduct a search

42
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:22,075
But it was too dark

43
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,410
I couldn't see his face

44
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,177
An official's robe?

45
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,812
I was too scared at the time

46
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,180
So I hid

47
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,620
An official's robe

48
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,755
and a token

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,527
What's wrong?

50
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,329
What's wrong?

51
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,531
Do you know the person?

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,670
It's just that

53
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,906
It's been widely talked about in the streets recently

54
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:54,674
So I was just curious

55
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,510
Oh, by the way, Ning'er

56
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,913
Let's go find your grandmother together tomorrow

57
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:00,647
Is that okay?

58
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,581
okay

59
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,782
Come on, have some more drink

60
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:08,688
How dare you

61
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:12,392
Are you saying

62
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,694
That the murderer on the night
of the full moon wasn't a spirit?

63
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,029
What evidence do you have?

64
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,531
I have found the little girl who

65
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,833
witnessed the whole thing on the day of the incident

66
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,935
She can prove that the visitor was not a spirit

67
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,770
Investigating the case or gathering evidence

68
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,872
Neither is our responsibility

69
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,875
Our mission at the Supreme Clarity Division

70
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,678
is to eliminate all spirits in the world

71
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,146
Not to investigate cases and chase murderers

72
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,248
But if there's a miscarriage of justice

73
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,182
and the real culprit is at large

74
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,118
While we are still capturing spirits

75
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:39,853
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?

76
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:41,654
If they are spirits, how can they be innocent

77
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:45,625
Jiuming

78
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,994
I allow you to be presumptuous in front of me

79
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,029
But if you continue

80
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,865
To overstep your authority and investigate privately

81
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,134
When you anger the Court of Judicial Review

82
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,304
Even I will not be able to protect you

83
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:12,619
Your Highness

84
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,488
I will go investigate the Li family right away

85
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,257
You don't need to go personally

86
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,292
Just send someone to watch over it

87
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,326
Right now

88
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,862
You have more important things to do

89
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,065
Immediately search the entire city

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,534
and make sure to capture Ganoderma

91
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,068
Yes

92
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,345
I've sent Ning'er back to her grandmother's

93
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,014
Now I can finally rest assured

94
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:42,348
But Ning'er is right

95
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,550
This market

96
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,717
is indeed bustling

97
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:47,620
Little Isatis

98
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,056
We should head back to Herb Hall as soon as possible

99
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:51,891
What's the rush

100
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,293
We don't get out often

101
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,260
Let's enjoy ourselves a little longer

102
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:55,728
This is

103
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,197
It smells so good

104
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,933
Boss, how much is this?

105
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:00,767
This is six coins per tael

106
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,135
The Supreme Clarity Division is hunting spirits

107
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,636
All unrelated persons

108
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,671
Please clear the area immediately

109
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,113
Oh no

110
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:15,815
It's the Supreme Clarity dogs

111
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,130
This foolish herbalist

112
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,166
actually risked his life to save me in
front of the Supreme Clarity Division

113
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,702
Because of the Ganoderma incident

114
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,871
The Supreme Clarity Division's
patrols are getting stricter

115
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,573
It seems I can't let Little Isatis

116
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,308
Stay in the Northest Land any longer

117
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,011
Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?

118
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,248
Sorry about that

119
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,616
How much for these spices?

120
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:24,984
I'll pay the original price

121
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:26,619
Take a look

122
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:27,587
Is this enough?

123
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:28,821
Alright, alright

124
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:29,689
Hurry and go

125
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,180
What's the special occasion today?

126
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:55,615
So many delicious foods

127
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,717
It's not any special day

128
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,419
It's just that

129
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,154
You rarely visit the human world

130
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,056
You must try its delicacies

131
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,057
Go on, taste it

132
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,127
These are all Bai's specialties

133
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,796
Not sure if they'll suit your taste

134
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:13,967
Delicious

135
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:21,507
This foolish doctor

136
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,576
I didn't expect him to be so considerate

137
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:26,613
Here, this is for you

138
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,783
You're giving me a gift too?

139
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:32,518
Oh my god

140
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,254
Could it be that he's going to confess to me so soon

141
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,789
I'm not ready-yet

142
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,690
What's this?

143
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,227
These are some clothes and travel expenses

144
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,696
I prepared for you in advance, for the road ahead

145
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,265
It's getting late today

146
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,067
Finish your meal and rest early

147
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,636
and leave here tomorrow morning

148
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,671
Leave?

149
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:52,905
To where?

150
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,507
Leave the Northest Land

151
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,309
Return to the herb fortress

152
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:58,978
I'm already grown up

153
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,380
Why should I go back to the herb fortress?

154
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,450
Now that you're grown up

155
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,219
You don't need me anymore

156
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,022
If you, stay here

157
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,823
And someone discovers you're a spirit

158
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,891
And reports you to the Supreme Clarity Division

159
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:12,992
You'll be in danger

160
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,099
I understand now

161
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,134
What you mean is

162
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,468
We're even, no debts between us

163
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,570
Me sticking around Herb Hall
is just causing you trouble

164
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,705
And holding up your business, right?

165
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,040
That's not it

166
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:27,707
Foolish doctor

167
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,341
I

168
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,776
Let's part ways here

169
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:30,943
May our paths not cross again in this life

170
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,514
Three

171
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,416
Two

172
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:37,917
One

173
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,018
Little Isatis, wait

174
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,423
Foolish doctor

175
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:44,957
I knew you couldn't bear to part with me

176
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:49,929
What's wrong?

177
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,030
Having second thoughts?

178
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,535
Your luggage

179
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:00,707
You can keep it for yourself

180
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,016
Stupid herbalist

181
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:10,717
Idiotic herbalist

182
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:11,517
Silly herbalist

183
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,687
I thought you, the foolish herbalist,
were a decent person

184
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,756
But it turns out you're an ungrateful jerk

185
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,891
If I had known, I would have
let you soak in Qingshui Pond

186
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,792
Forever

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,794
Let that old witch catch you and eat you

188
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:22,895
This makes me so angry
