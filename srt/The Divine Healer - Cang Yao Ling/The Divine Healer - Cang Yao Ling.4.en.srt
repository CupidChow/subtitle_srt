00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 4

3
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:54,656
[Testing each other]

4
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:04,175
Sister Ganoderma?

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,267
Why would she be here?

6
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:07,035
Ganoderma spirit

7
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:10,339
Ever since Supreme Clarity Division was established

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,275
no spirit has ever escaped from
this medicine concealment box

9
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:15,944
It seems

10
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,613
there must be someone on the outside collaborating

11
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:18,780
Ganoderma

12
00:01:18,982 --> 00:01:19,481
I've already brought over

13
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:20,916
the famous Immortal Physician Jiu

14
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:22,784
It must have been him who
infiltrated the Supreme Clarity Division

15
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:24,253
He will surely cure you

16
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:25,187
My medical skills

17
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:26,355
only treat humans

18
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:27,556
not spirits

19
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:30,692
Immortal Physician

20
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:31,226
Freeze

21
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:36,265
Immortal Physician

22
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,302
I didn't expect you to be

23
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,670
so prejudiced and narrow-minded

24
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:43,338
I know

25
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,308
the common people shun spirits like the plague

26
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,477
fearing for their lives

27
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,380
But I've been married to Ganoderma for many years

28
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:53,715
She's kind-hearted

29
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:55,817
and has never done anything wrong

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,387
Originally

31
00:01:58,388 --> 00:02:00,055
if it weren't for meeting me

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,556
and staying in the Northest Land

33
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:05,093
none of this would have happened

34
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:35,891
However, I didn't expect

35
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:37,959
that she would be captured
by the Supreme Clarity Division

36
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:39,594
while out gathering herbs

37
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:42,597
I sneaked in to rescue her

38
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:47,903
but unfortunately got injured by accident

39
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:01,817
Her illness this time

40
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,619
is because she desperately treated my injuries

41
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:17,132
Ganoderma

42
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:20,235
Spirits also have good and evil

43
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:22,571
As a compassionate healer

44
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,272
how can you stand by and watch death?

45
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:26,074
Come closer and take a look

46
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,175
maybe I have a way

47
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:29,411
I order you to come over

48
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:38,854
Come

49
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:44,659
You take her pulse

50
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,494
Let me see

51
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,033
She's suffering from a severe loss of vital energy

52
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:53,268
and her heart meridian is exhausted

53
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:54,469
If this continues

54
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,904
she will slowly wither and
revert to her original form

55
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:58,306
Unless the blood of a spirit
bond is used to nourish her roots

56
00:03:58,307 --> 00:03:59,341
she can be healed

57
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,476
You and her

58
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,178
Are you spirit bonded?

59
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,814
I was once spirit bonded to her

60
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:08,517
but she dissolved our bond

61
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,752
to avoid harming my life

62
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:12,821
No matter

63
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:14,689
as long as her body has his energy, it's enough

64
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:31,106
The prescription is written

65
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:32,841
Will you proceed as instructed

66
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:34,810
The decision is yours

67
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:00,377
[Soulmate's blood]

68
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:17,018
Sister Ganoderma and that scholar named Mengzhi

69
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,320
have such a great love

70
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:20,255
One fights death to heal

71
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:22,090
the other offers blood to save

72
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,359
When will I ever meet

73
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,194
such a good man?

74
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,238
Offering blood

75
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,473
to save a life may not be so easy

76
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,543
What do you mean?

77
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:43,512
Human blood

78
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,746
is extremely precious

79
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:48,850
A slight mishap could endanger life

80
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:51,353
Now that spirit's life is hanging by a thread

81
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,188
would the scholar take such a risk lightly?

82
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:54,789
Are you saying that scholar

83
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,391
will give up on Sister Ganoderma?

84
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,660
Sister Ganoderma

85
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,096
With me here, you have nothing to worry about

86
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:38,333
Human blood is precious

87
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,201
Aren't our spirit lives just as valuable?

88
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,038
Since he willingly became spirit bonded to you

89
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,373
then he's willing to be used for your sake

90
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,042
Don't try to convince me anymore

91
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:49,945
Today, no matter what, I will save you

92
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,329
They're really planning to act together

93
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:14,936
This is Lord Jiuming's signal

94
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,539
We've found the trace of the herb spirit

95
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:18,340
Deploy the troops immediately

96
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:18,940
Yes

97
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,014
Two signals?

98
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,617
Could it be that they've found two spirits?

99
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,265
Not good

100
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:52,707
How dare you spirits

101
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,014
run amok and kill

102
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:00,081
in the Northest Land?

103
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:01,616
I won't let Sister Ganoderma be captured

104
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:21,136
We have no grudge with the Supreme Clarity Division

105
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,737
Why do you relentlessly capture us?

106
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:24,439
If spirits harm human lives

107
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,441
of course, our Supreme
Clarity Division has to intervene

108
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:28,376
Who says spirits harm human lives

109
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:29,711
It's you

110
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,312
who can't distinguish right from wrong
and capture the innocent indiscriminately

111
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:33,314
Let's see

112
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:34,849
what kind of villain you are

113
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,950
under that mask

114
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,142
Fire arrows

115
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:02,911
Better to kill by mistake than let a spirit escape

116
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,651
Ganoderma has never harmed anyone

117
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:11,953
Why won't you ever let her go?
