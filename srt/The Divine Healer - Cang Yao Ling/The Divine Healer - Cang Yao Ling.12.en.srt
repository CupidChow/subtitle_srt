[The Divine Healer]

00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 12

3
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:54,549
[Of course, I spoil my wife]

4
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:56,665
Here you go

5
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,732
Look at this, look at this

6
00:00:58,467 --> 00:00:59,000
Hurry up

7
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:00,969
Miss, take a look at our jewelry

8
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:02,470
Our jewelry here

9
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:03,638
is all one of a kind

10
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:04,306
Take a look

11
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:06,408
These are all the latest designs

12
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:07,008
Yes

13
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:08,210
Take a look, see which one you like

14
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:09,911
So beautiful

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,479
Do they look good?

16
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:12,914
They look good

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,983
Miss, you are beautiful

18
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:16,084
Everything looks good on you

19
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:20,155
This one looks good too

20
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:22,924
It looks good

21
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,470
You say everything looks good

22
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:37,439
How can I choose?

23
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,608
I'll take everything

24
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:40,842
at your stall

25
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:42,644
Alright, alright

26
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:43,478
Sir

27
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,814
You really treat your wife well

28
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,251
Of course

29
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:51,519
My wife

30
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:53,722
I must spoil her

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,023
Wife?

32
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,192
Yes, yes

33
00:01:57,193 --> 00:01:57,792
You are right

34
00:01:57,793 --> 00:01:58,693
Deliver these to Herb Hall

35
00:01:58,694 --> 00:01:59,628
Alrighty, take care on your way, sir

36
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,036
You just called me wife

37
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:09,604
Does that count for anything?

38
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:11,306
Of course, not-

39
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:21,449
The matters of marriage in this world

40
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:22,684
require

41
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:23,952
a formal wedding

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
the three letters and six etiquettes

43
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,821
the four betrothal gifts and
five types of gold jewelry

44
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:28,390
How could it count

45
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:30,425
just because I said so in front of others?

46
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:32,694
Little Isatis

47
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:35,864
If you truly wish to marry me

48
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,333
I will surely not miss a single step

49
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:40,602
and marry you with grandeur and grace

50
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:10,532
Ever since we came to the human realm

51
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,367
I've found myself missing
the life back in the mountains

52
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,838
And here I was wondering why
you insisted on going up the mountain

53
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,073
to gather herbs with me at the crack of dawn

54
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:19,674
Turns out you're homesick

55
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:21,443
Actually

56
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:22,410
it's for this

57
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:47,435
Ever since we descended the mountain

58
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,636
I haven't had the chance to drink

59
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:49,904
the morning dew from the mountains

60
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:51,239
I really miss it

61
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,308
You like drinking morning dew?

62
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:54,409
Of course

63
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,644
This daylight and morning dew

64
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,847
are the most precious nutrients for us herbs

65
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:00,348
After becoming an adult

66
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,283
I just can't seem to wake up early anymore

67
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:03,985
and it's been so long since I last had it

68
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:09,090
I'm going to check over there

69
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:16,431
The morning dew

70
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:33,982
Stand guard outside

71
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:34,716
Yes

72
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:41,723
Sir, sir

73
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:45,026
Supreme Clarity Division, routine inspection

74
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:45,960
Sir

75
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:46,928
Alrighty

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,001
Has there been anything unusual in the shop recently?

77
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,204
No, no unusual occurrences

78
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:08,149
Nothing found

79
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:09,350
No spirits?

80
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:12,387
No, no

81
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,355
No spirits found

82
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,263
Oh, by the way

83
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,766
Where did the Immortal Physician go?

84
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,168
My mother is ill

85
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,269
and I was hoping to get some medicine from him

86
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:30,071
The Immortal Physician

87
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,407
The Immortal Physician they went early in the morning

88
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,242
to the Northest Mountain to gather herbs

89
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:35,310
They haven't returned yet

90
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:36,311
They?

91
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:37,745
I'm waiting too

92
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,154
Go slower

93
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:52,560
Are you tired?

94
00:05:58,601 --> 00:05:59,400
Come on up

95
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:40,675
I saw with my own eyes

96
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,710
That woman is indeed a spirit, no doubt

97
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:44,546
Unfortunately

98
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,614
Lord Jiuming took an arrow for that woman

99
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,283
which is why I failed to capture her

100
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:52,053
You're saying you wounded Jiuming?

101
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:53,988
Yes

102
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,025
Lord Jiuming is too familiar with

103
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:58,226
the Supreme Clarity Division's tactics

104
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:00,028
He sensed something was off
before we even made a move

105
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:01,996
Later, he even helped the spirit escape

106
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:06,334
Your Highness, please calm your anger

107
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:09,837
I will continue to have
people closely watch Herb Hall

108
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,839
We can only act once we lure Lord Jiuming away

109
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,517
Is Jiuming a spirit?

110
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,491
Then why did you injure him?

111
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,163
Useless

112
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,607
How is his injury?

113
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,710
He

114
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:51,646
The arrow was not poisoned

115
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:53,915
It shouldn't be life-threatening
