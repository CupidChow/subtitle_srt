00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 15

3
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,496
[Turn against him]

4
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,274
What's going on with these two?

5
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:03,777
They've been like this since
they came back last night

6
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,050
Today

7
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,518
Have you seen any other
spirits from the herb fortress

8
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,419
brought here?

9
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,553
I'm about to lose my life

10
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,555
And you expect me to care about the herb fortress?

11
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:22,128
The last time they set an
ambush on the Northest Mountain

12
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,298
This time they deliberately lured
little Isatis to break into the jail

13
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,334
Twice the trick of releasing only to catch her again

14
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,270
What exactly is Feiye playing at?

15
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:33,240
Should I tell her the truth?

16
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,711
I don't even know if Langdu got away

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,414
He said the Supreme Clarity Division
didn't capture any spirits

18
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:43,617
But I don't know if that's true or not

19
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:47,587
Should I discuss this matter with him?

20
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:49,923
No

21
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:52,993
Feiye is cunning and hard to deal with

22
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:55,562
I can't risk making little Isatis his enemy

23
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,830
Forget it

24
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:58,632
He's just a mortal

25
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,033
He doesn't understand spirits

26
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:01,668
Nor can he deal with the Supreme Clarity Division

27
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,338
I can't involve him in such dangerous matters

28
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:18,151
Miss

29
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:19,819
Are you here

30
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,554
For a consultation or to buy medicine?

31
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,189
Greetings

32
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:24,691
I am not a miss

33
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:26,926
But a steward from a noble's house

34
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,129
I've come here

35
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:33,533
To seek a physician

36
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:34,834
To seek a physician?

37
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,371
So, are you looking for Doctor Isatis

38
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:39,873
Or Doctor Jiu?

39
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:42,375
A woman at home suddenly came down
with a high fever and can't get out of bed

40
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,312
I heard that Doctor Isatis
specializes in treating this condition

41
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:46,613
I wonder if it would be convenient

42
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:47,714
For you to visit our house?

43
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,449
You're inviting me?

44
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:52,252
Bai, hurry up

45
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,586
Bring out my box

46
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:54,187
Right away

47
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:55,989
Doctor Isatis

48
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,857
Today just happens

49
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,162
Unavailable

50
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:03,797
Unavailable?

51
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:05,131
But I see that there are no

52
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:06,399
patients here

53
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,169
I am Ah Jiu

54
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,603
Greetings, steward

55
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:12,806
Doctor Jiu

56
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:13,707
I've heard much about you

57
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:14,908
Miss Isatis

58
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,177
Is still inexperienced and not very skilled

59
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:18,712
I'm afraid she may not be up to the task

60
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:20,947
Why not let me

61
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,749
Personally visit the house and provide treatment?

62
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,416
How about it?

63
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:25,452
But the patient at home

64
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:26,653
Is a young woman

65
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:28,488
Doctor Jiu, being a man

66
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,456
Might find it inconvenient

67
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:32,592
What are you doing?

68
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,594
Didn't we agree

69
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:36,696
That I would treat the women?

70
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:39,499
Other women, yes

71
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:40,867
But not this time

72
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:42,001
Why not?

73
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:43,803
If I say no, then it's no

74
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:45,205
Alright

75
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:47,974
The healer's heart

76
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:49,109
knows no gender

77
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:50,810
Let's not

78
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,911
Delay any further

79
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:53,079
Lest we worsen the condition

80
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:57,717
Doctor Jiu, this way please

81
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,165
Doctor Jiu, this way please

82
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:15,735
Doctor Jiu, this way please

83
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:23,410
Prince Ye's household

84
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:25,445
Doesn't have any sick women

85
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,780
Right?

86
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,950
Prince Ye is known to be discreet

87
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:33,953
And his residence has always been a secret to others

88
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:36,689
It's truly admirable

89
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,158
That Doctor Jiu is aware of it

90
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:41,528
Prince Ye has always enjoyed the lotus

91
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:44,798
And sends people to pick fresh lotuses daily for him

92
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,434
This scent is unique in the Northest City

93
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,004
And it's on you

94
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:57,010
[Yuanxiang, the steward of Prince Ye's house]

95
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,451
Prince Ye anticipated

96
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:06,119
That Doctor Jiu would come in her stead

97
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,354
And he has been waiting in the study for a long time

98
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:09,923
Doctor Jiu

99
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:11,157
This way, please

100
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:17,964
Asking Herb Hall for medical assistance

101
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,633
was to confirm little Isatis's identity

102
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,803
I set up an ambush at the Northest Mountain

103
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:26,072
Yet you got in my way

104
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:27,574
The move at the Supreme Clarity Division last night

105
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,211
Was to release only to catch her again

106
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:35,682
You are

107
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,218
With blades drawn

108
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:40,720
ruthless

109
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,523
Where will you place

110
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:45,525
your next move?

111
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:47,694
Please enlighten me, Prince Ye

112
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:53,433
When I brought you to my mansion years ago

113
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:55,602
You were but a youth

114
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:59,572
Back then, I let you call me Brother Ye

115
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:01,774
No need to address me as Prince Ye

116
00:06:02,443 --> 00:06:03,643
So many years have passed

117
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:06,179
And you've forgotten?

118
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:08,681
The grace of Prince Ye's help back then

119
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:09,649
Ah Jiu

120
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:11,284
Will never forget

121
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,559
At the age of sixteen, I
volunteered to the late Emperor

122
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,728
To guard the frontier

123
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:24,297
Over a decade of military service

124
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:27,200
Exchanged for the peace and
prosperity of the Northest Land

125
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:29,836
Yet before I could return to the capital

126
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:33,873
My own brother usurped the throne

127
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,410
Now I can only be this

128
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:39,512
idle prince capturing spirits

129
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:40,747
Do you think

130
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,316
I would be content?

131
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,687
Those who serve as leaders

132
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:50,823
Aim to seek welfare for the people

133
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:52,392
and protect the country's peace

134
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,793
Regardless of their status

135
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:55,361
The common people

136
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,430
Will all respect them

137
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:01,734
Good

138
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,670
You speak well

139
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,372
But the current Emperor

140
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,975
Is incompetent and neglects state affairs

141
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:11,477
Obsessed only with the pursuit of longevity

142
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,479
For years, the spirits captured
by my Supreme Clarity Division

143
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,847
Have been used for his elixir offerings

144
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:16,883
The people suffer

145
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:18,184
The imperial court is in turmoil

146
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,989
I see all this

147
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,091
My heart is filled with indignation

148
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,460
yet I am powerless

149
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:30,563
Although the Supreme Clarity Division’s forces are few

150
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:32,231
They are all elite

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,801
If you and I join forces

152
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:36,569
And add the special abilities of spirits

153
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,937
Leverage an uprising

154
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,974
We can surely seize this world

155
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,076
Then, I will issue an edict

156
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:45,378
To coexist peacefully with all spirits

157
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:47,146
You and Miss Isatis

158
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:50,149
Can also be together

159
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:54,854
Feiye

160
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:58,725
If you truly care for the people

161
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:00,960
And pity the innocent

162
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:05,732
You wouldn't have deceived me until now

163
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,269
Prince Ye's newly captured rare spirit tonight

164
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,005
Should be refined by the
alchemist as soon as possible

165
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,775
Good, hurry and take this old man to see

166
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:19,245
Even if the Emperor is obsessed with alchemy

167
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:22,649
Aren't you just enabling tyranny?

168
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,484
And the case of the Li couple

169
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:25,718
I've been fully aware

170
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,321
It was you who sent people to kill them

171
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,357
The Supreme Clarity Division's
so-called spirits capturing

172
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:32,358
To rid the people of harm

173
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,761
In reality, it's all for your selfish desires

174
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:37,230
Over the years

175
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:40,033
You've fabricated crimes and plotted against spirits

176
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,001
How many innocents have been slaughtered?

177
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:44,570
You preach benevolence and morality

178
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,675
Yet your actions are extremely cruel

179
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:52,612
This time

180
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:56,516
I will not believe you

181
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:02,055
Jiuming

182
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,991
When you were young, you told me

183
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:06,893
I was the only family you had

184
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:07,794
in this world

185
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:09,929
To me

186
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:15,868
Aren't you the same?

187
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:20,173
If you turn back now

188
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:22,608
I will absolve you of all crimes

189
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:27,914
Prince Ye

190
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:31,417
Our paths are different

191
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:33,486
We cannot conspire together
