1
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 17

3
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:54,490
[Fight to the end]

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,859
Little Isatis

5
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,529
After we get married

6
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,864
How about we leave this place?

7
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,366
Leave here?

8
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,535
Then where would we go?

9
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,507
Leaving the Northest Land

10
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,377
We can go anywhere

11
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,247
Southest mountains

12
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,448
Eastern islands

13
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,215
Western regions

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,451
Pick a place you like

15
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,885
We can start another Herb Hall

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,754
Filled with every kind of herb

17
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,256
During the day

18
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,224
I'd still collect morning dew for you

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,359
And at night

20
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,794
Together we'd enjoy the flowers and watch the moon

21
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,731
Isn't that the life we're living now?

22
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,699
Here I have my friends

23
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:41,900
My clan

24
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,336
My roots are in the Northest Land

25
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,374
The Supreme Clarity Division
is only temporarily closed

26
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,110
Mortals still harbor prejudice

27
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,211
against spirits

28
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,747
I'm worried the Supreme Clarity Division
might make a comeback

29
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,415
And then they'll still hurt you

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,317
Then I have even more reason not to leave

31
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,620
How can I abandon my clan

32
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,255
And run off

33
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,690
to live in peace?

34
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,126
I am not one to value life over honor

35
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:09,928
Little Isatis

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,264
You don't know the methods
of the Supreme Clarity Division

37
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,300
But I do

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,138
Actually

39
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,306
I once

40
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,073
I know

41
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,608
That day in the cell

42
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,344
Seeing Langdu tortured like that

43
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,614
And in the cauldron

44
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,016
All the bones of my clansmen

45
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,418
I swore

46
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,421
I would fight the Supreme Clarity Division

47
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,422
to the end

48
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,826
If I see them again

49
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,529
I'd risk my life

50
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,100
To avenge those innocently burned clansmen

51
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,571
The Supreme Clarity Division and
the spirits have a long-standing grudge

52
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,007
If I rashly tell her the truth

53
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,343
She'll act impulsively and take risks

54
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,646
Better to explain it to her in the future

55
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,386
You, the Supreme Clarity Division

56
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,088
Is this all you've got?

57
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,155
If you dare

58
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,624
Burn me to death

59
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:18,797
Prince Ye

60
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,699
This spirit

61
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,735
Still refuses to reveal the
location of the herb fortress

62
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,037
Shall we just set fire and burn him alive?

63
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,211
Do you remember who captured you?

64
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,714
Even if I turn to ash

65
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,984
I'd recognize him

66
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:39,918
Good

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,755
I'll give you a chance

68
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:43,589
To get your revenge

69
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,392
Don't disappoint me

70
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,369
The alchemist said

71
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,606
She has withered for many years

72
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,941
If I don't transplant her roots now

73
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,813
She'll truly perish

74
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,381
But now

75
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,250
With the Supreme Clarity Division temporarily closed

76
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,519
And the Court of Judicial Review getting involved

77
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,221
This mission

78
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,756
Might not be so easy

79
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:18,991
Yuanxiang

80
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,262
When the Supreme Clarity Division was built

81
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,732
I had you leave a secret passage in the dungeon

82
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,734
Is it still there?

83
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,501
Your Highness

84
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,169
It's still there

85
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,171
How many guards do we have now?

86
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,439
Over three thousand

87
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,107
Good

88
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,279
Have Hanye gather all the troops
of the Supreme Clarity Division

89
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,850
I've been planning for many years

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,820
I cannot

91
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,057
Fail at the last hurdle

92
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,779
Ah Jiu

93
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,649
Are you really willing to
marry a spirit as your wife?

94
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,986
Will you regret it?

95
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,055
It's what I wish for in this life

96
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,158
And I have no regrets in this life

97
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:57,890
Mint

98
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,225
Is growing quite well now

99
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,426
Let me trim you

100
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,495
You are about to transform into a human, aren't you?

101
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,231
And you're quite fragrant too

102
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,735
Little Isatis, you're finally back

103
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,536
Sister Ganoderma

104
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,671
Why didn't I see

105
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,206
Physician Jiu come back with you?

106
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,407
Him?

107
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,509
He's preparing the bridal sedan for tomorrow

108
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,577
I even found him

109
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,279
Eight spirits who work in the city

110
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,414
Tomorrow

111
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,949
They can come together for the bridal procession

112
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,816
Good

113
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,184
Elder Ginseng is in the hall

114
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,586
Arranging tomorrow's wedding

115
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,453
We were just missing you

116
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,288
Come with me quickly

117
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,259
The wedding tomorrow

118
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,028
Will be entrusted to the two of you

119
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,897
For this marriage

120
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,332
All the various things that are needed

121
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,266
After you left

122
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,669
Astragalus and Goji got married

123
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,170
The two are in love

124
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,606
And now Goji is even pregnant

125
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,674
That's great

126
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:49,942
Go on

127
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,209
This wedding

128
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,311
Must be lively

129
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:52,811
Elder Ginseng

130
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,412
Rest assured

131
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,213
A day apart feels like three years have passed

132
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,915
I missed you so much

133
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,417
By the way

134
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,818
Astragalus, Goji

135
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,987
I haven't wished you a happy marriage

136
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,088
and many blessings yet

137
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:03,956
For this

138
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,791
I still have to thank little Isatis for the grace

139
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,959
of not marrying that day

140
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,461
Alright, alright, alright

141
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,697
You're about to get married

142
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:14,366
And you're still giggling, not acting properly

143
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,168
If you get married

144
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,503
Physician Jiu may laugh at you

145
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,806
Ah Jiu would never do that

146
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,708
Besides, he said

147
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,308
In the future

148
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,143
He will often accompany me back to visit you

149
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,412
Good, good

150
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,582
The matters of the wedding tomorrow

151
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,852
I have already handed over to
Astragalus and Goji to arrange

152
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,054
The two of them just got married

153
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,089
And have more experience

154
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,423
When tomorrow comes

155
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,992
Ah Jiu and that Mr Bai

156
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,194
Come to pick up the bride

157
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,096
I will cast a spell

158
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,464
Open the barrier

159
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,300
Then they can come and go freely

160
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,339
The Herb Fortress has never
opened its barrier for a thousand years

161
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,008
Won't that be dangerous?

162
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,710
No need to worry

163
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,178
Our Herb Fortress

164
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,947
Is remote

165
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,383
And within a barrier

166
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:05,851
Humans

167
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,186
Simply cannot find us

168
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,556
Rest assured

169
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,090
Good

170
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,270
Jiuming

171
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,798
The Supreme Clarity Division is a thing of the past

172
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,133
Little Isatis

173
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,936
From now on

174
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,007
We can start a new life
