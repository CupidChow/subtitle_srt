00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 8

3
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:54,607
[The only one I want to marry is you]

4
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:19,966
Little Isatis

5
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:24,370
Little Isatis

6
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:31,978
This is bad

7
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:34,714
It's the Supreme Clarity
Division's patrol time right now

8
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:37,316
She couldn't have

9
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:45,691
Hanye

10
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:49,362
Lord Jiuming

11
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:50,730
Did we catch any spirits today?

12
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:53,899
Not today

13
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,567
Alright, I got it

14
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:06,879
What's Jiuming in such a hurry for?

15
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:08,514
I don't know

16
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:11,017
After he asked if any spirits were captured

17
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:12,318
He left in a hurry

18
00:02:14,888 --> 00:02:16,422
The night Ganoderma was arrested

19
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:19,725
Did Jiuming touch the medicine concealment box?

20
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:21,961
After Your Highness left that night

21
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:23,796
He did return to the Medicine Concealment Pavilion

22
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:27,967
Who's there?

23
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:45,985
Lord Jiuming

24
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:48,621
Lord

25
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:49,922
What are you

26
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:52,325
doing here so late?

27
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:56,595
I forgot to take the reward money

28
00:02:56,596 --> 00:02:57,897
I remember

29
00:02:58,298 --> 00:02:59,799
he seemed to have stayed in
the Medicine Concealment Pavilion

30
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:01,767
for quite a while

31
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,139
Have someone keep an eye on Herb Hall

32
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,208
Report to me immediately

33
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:10,743
at any sign of disturbance

34
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:11,744
Yes

35
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:12,745
I will arrange it right away

36
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:16,382
Who's there

37
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:17,917
Let me out now

38
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:26,092
You old Aconite

39
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,160
Untie me this instant

40
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:29,195
Shut up

41
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,397
Aconite is bad enough, but old Aconite

42
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:32,665
Do you have any manners?

43
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,434
Little Isatis, let me tell you

44
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,203
Your escape from the barrier

45
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:38,971
with that wild man

46
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:40,406
Elder Ginseng already knows about it

47
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,775
I was ordered to bring you back

48
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:44,877
Wild man?

49
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:45,945
I think you're just jealous

50
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:48,981
I took that foolish herbalist away

51
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,316
You want revenge

52
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,851
I'll tell the Elder everything in a moment

53
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:55,621
That's perfect, you go right ahead and tell him

54
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:58,023
It just so happens that Elder Ginseng

55
00:03:58,024 --> 00:03:59,658
Also has some good news

56
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:00,960
to share with you

57
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:02,395
What good news?

58
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:04,597
You've been an adult for some time now

59
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:06,098
According to our rules

60
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,299
It's time for you to be wed

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,734
I've discussed it with Elder Ginseng

62
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,136
You're to be married to Astragalus

63
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:11,003
The wedding will be immediate

64
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:11,637
Applause

65
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:13,873
Astragalus?

66
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,944
[Spirit, Astragalus]

67
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:19,979
Little Isatis

68
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:24,617
Elder, I have found the Isatis Root

69
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:27,686
Additionally, I've laid out
clues on the Northest Mountain

70
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:29,455
That herbalist, once he sees them

71
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:31,257
Will surely find his way to our herb fortress

72
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:33,959
Good

73
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:37,596
Since he was able to breakthrough the barrier

74
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:40,299
Let me see what skills

75
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:44,103
he truly possesses

76
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:45,571
Yes

77
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:59,185
Someone help

78
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:00,719
Help me

79
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:02,254
Someone help

80
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:03,255
Little Isatis

81
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,156
I'm here

82
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:08,961
Immortal Physician

83
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:10,763
You've finally arrived

84
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:12,731
Little Isatis, I'm here to save you

85
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:38,457
I knew you would definitely come to save me

86
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:43,195
What's wrong?

87
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:47,166
It's a good thing you came to rescue me in time

88
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:50,102
Because the only one I want to marry is you

89
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:57,243
Ouch, that really hurts

90
00:05:58,078 --> 00:05:58,944
It doesn't hurt

91
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:02,448
That's fake

92
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:06,318
You hurt me

93
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,254
You're not Little Isatis

94
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:14,360
So what if I'm not?

95
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,363
Whatever Isatis Root can give you

96
00:06:17,797 --> 00:06:18,797
I can give you too

97
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:21,767
What have you done with Little Isatis?

98
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:25,404
According to the rules of our herb fortress

99
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:27,740
She is to marry Astragalus at noon today

100
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,975
Now the sun is already high in the sky

101
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,745
If you're thinking of snatching the bride

102
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:34,446
I'm afraid it's too late

103
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:45,824
Immortal Physician

104
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:47,393
Why put yourself

105
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,161
through this trouble?

106
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:52,598
Elder

107
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,533
I don't want to marry him

108
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:56,001
I don't like Astragalus

109
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:59,338
Just look at him

110
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:00,239
I don't like him

111
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,173
Little Isatis

112
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:02,775
Stop causing trouble

113
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:04,443
You've been incomplete in the
six senses since you were young

114
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:05,945
You can't leave the barrier

115
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,513
But I don't want to stay here forever

116
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:09,248
I want to be like Sister Ganoderma

117
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:10,015
Shut up

118
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:11,216
Someone

119
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:12,985
Gag her

120
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,320
Little Isatis

121
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,488
I've waited for this day for a long time

122
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:17,890
You're finally marrying me

123
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:19,658
Isatis

124
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:22,361
I love you too

125
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:25,497
I agree as well

126
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:28,434
Good

127
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:29,635
The auspicious time has arrived

128
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:31,136
Astragalus

129
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:32,338
Isatis Root

130
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:34,206
You have grown up together

131
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:36,442
Bathed in the morning dew and light of heaven

132
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:39,044
Today, I will decide for you

133
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:41,180
To grant you

134
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:42,381
marriage

135
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:51,023
Immortal Physician

136
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:54,159
Once Little Isatis and Astragalus are wed

137
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:57,162
Your spirit bond will naturally be dissolved

138
00:07:57,797 --> 00:07:59,064
Then

139
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,600
If you submit to me

140
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:03,402
Wouldn't that be perfect?

141
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:07,573
If you're willing

142
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,975
I promise you a life of glory and wealth

143
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:10,809
How about it?

144
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:12,444
Please conduct yourself with dignity, miss

145
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:15,414
You'd better not refuse the toast
only to be forced to drink a forfeit

146
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:23,355
Immortal Physician, Immortal Physician

147
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:24,423
Come back

148
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:25,824
Come

149
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:26,759
Stupid man

150
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,014
Ah Jiu

151
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:01,293
Silly herbalist

152
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:02,861
Are you alright?

153
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:05,197
Little Isatis

154
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:06,732
What are you trying to do?

155
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:07,966
Are you trying to crash the wedding?

156
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:08,834
Is he here to snatch the bride?

157
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:10,769
Yes, how could this be allowed?

158
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,603
This is so inappropriate

159
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:12,771
Where does this leave

160
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:13,238
the face of our herb fortress

161
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,773
Exactly, how disgraceful

162
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:15,607
What are they doing here?

163
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:26,819
Step back quickly

164
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:29,855
Elder

165
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,224
Who is this person?

166
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:33,125
Elder

167
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:34,159
How, how can this be?

168
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,329
Lord above

169
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:39,865
I have been impolite

170
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:43,635
Lord

171
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:03,922
Jiudi

172
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:05,724
The tribulation of love is hard to cross

173
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:08,327
I can only help you this far
