[The Divine Healer]

00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:51,827
Episode 18

3
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,241
[Don't get married]

4
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:00,329
Awesome

5
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:01,969
That's so awesome

6
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:03,769
Tomorrow, with the addition of
a palanquin with eight bearers

7
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:05,969
Going to the Herb Fortress

8
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,729
Will also make us mortals look good

9
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:23,849
Shopkeeper

10
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,129
What's happening to you?

11
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:29,409
Is it your old ailment acting up again?

12
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:34,729
No worries

13
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,409
I 'll go to the kitchen and make you
some chicken soup to nourish your body

14
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,489
On such a joyous day tomorrow

15
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:43,929
We mustn't have any mishaps

16
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,409
Fairy

17
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:07,849
Doctor Jiu

18
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:08,969
Greetings from Yuhu

19
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,289
Hu?

20
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:11,809
What Hu?

21
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:19,809
In the Northern Land

22
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,969
we actually have such a pure and refined lady

23
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,529
And I wasn't even aware of it

24
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,969
No wonder I've been single until now

25
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,129
This must be fate

26
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,609
Why do I always feel

27
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,449
That you resemble someone I knew

28
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,089
But I have no memory of it?

29
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:43,169
A long time ago

30
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,929
I was a jade pot in your palace

31
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:47,129
Fortunate to be enlightened by you, 
I transformed into human form

32
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:49,329
This time I've come taking a risk

33
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,289
Simply to persuade you

34
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:52,009
Not to get married

35
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,489
Did you just say

36
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:55,649
Not to get married?

37
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:56,889
Why?

38
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:58,529
Because the bloody wedding you dream of

39
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,529
Is not an illusion

40
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,489
But your past life

41
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:03,569
Past life?

42
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,609
You mean in my past life
I also married little Isatis?

43
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,369
But why did I see her dying in my dream?

44
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,889
Past and present lives have their own karma

45
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,809
Your identities are different

46
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:16,529
A union crossing species

47
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,129
May not end well

48
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,449
But Ganoderma and Mengzhi

49
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,129
One is a spirit and the other a mortal

50
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:24,529
Why can they be together?

51
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:26,169
You are not a mere mortal

52
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:27,489
This life

53
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,249
I'm afraid you can't escape this calamity either

54
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:38,729
Here it comes

55
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:40,289
Here comes the chicken soup

56
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,009
It's still hot

57
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:42,049
You two, have a taste

58
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,849
Where's the fairy?

59
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,369
Sister Ganoderma

60
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:53,729
Look at this

61
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:55,729
Does it look good?

62
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:56,529
It looks good

63
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,649
Then I'll wear this tomorrow

64
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:10,529
Lord Jiuming

65
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,769
Take Ganoderma away

66
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,569
I know you're not the culprit

67
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:15,329
I'll let you go today

68
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:16,449
This matter

69
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,969
Must not be mentioned to anyone

70
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:22,209
The box inside

71
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,009
Also belongs to Doctor Jiu?

72
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:26,649
Right

73
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,609
He took it out of his wardrobe

74
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,689
I just happened to need a box

75
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,169
So I used his to pack

76
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:34,449
It's perfect for holding my jewelry

77
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,729
Could it be that Doctor Jiu has some
connection with the Supreme Clarity Division?

78
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:40,329
That can't be

79
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,249
Doctor Jiu has a healer's benevolence

80
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,129
And deep affection for little Isatis

81
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:46,049
He couldn't possibly be with
the Supreme Clarity Division

82
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:48,689
With the wedding upon us

83
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,729
Just don't stir up trouble

84
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,089
Just a lousy herbalist

85
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:17,289
Here he comes

86
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:18,089
Here he comes, here he comes

87
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,649
Elder Ginseng, please open the barrier

88
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:31,689
Langdu

89
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,049
Lord Jiuming

90
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:35,889
Long time no see

91
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,849
Those bastards at the Supreme Clarity Division

92
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,729
Actually used me to capture spirits

93
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,409
Not a single mortal keeps their word

94
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:58,969
Langdu

95
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:00,849
Now that you've escaped from
the Supreme Clarity Division

96
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,009
If you stop now

97
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,289
I'll let you return to the mountain

98
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:07,929
Return to what?

99
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,289
You ambushed me last time

100
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:11,369
I must avenge

101
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:12,889
this grudge

102
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,929
Shopkeeper, be careful

103
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:55,809
Bai

104
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:06,989
Bai

105
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:08,509
Bai

106
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,048
Shopkeeper

107
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:18,688
This

108
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:19,929
Is for you

109
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,289
Take good care

110
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,449
Of yourself

111
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:03,769
Shopkeeper

112
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:05,569
Other than Herb Hall

113
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:06,609
I'm not going anywhere

114
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:08,969
Since you've set your heart on little Isatis

115
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,769
I have set my heart on you too

116
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:25,649
Let's go

117
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:27,609
Bai

118
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,729
Shopkeeper

119
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,129
This is the first time

120
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:34,329
I've seen you

121
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,609
So powerful

122
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,249
I may not have much ability

123
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:42,429
But before

124
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:43,929
Before I die

125
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,729
I can say I've done something for you

126
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:48,889
What nonsense are you talking?

127
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:50,609
You've still got a whole life

128
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:51,849
ahead of you

129
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:56,929
Hurry up

130
00:09:57,449 --> 00:09:59,049
Go get little

131
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,089
Go get little Isatis

132
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:02,289
Bai

133
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:03,169
Hurry up

134
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:04,809
I want you

135
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,249
I want you to go with me

136
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,209
Go with me, okay?

137
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:14,009
Bai

138
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,049
Bai Kangning

139
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,089
No

140
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:56,689
Something's happened to little Isatis
