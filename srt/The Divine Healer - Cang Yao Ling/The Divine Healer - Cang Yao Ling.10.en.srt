1
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 10

3
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,369
[Only I can drink your bathwater]

4
00:00:58,374 --> 00:00:59,241
Is anyone there?

5
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:01,410
Is Doctor Jiu in?

6
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,980
Coming, coming

7
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:07,015
Who is it? What are you yelling for?

8
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:09,685
Where has Old Bai gone again?

9
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,119
Oh it's you

10
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,121
Is your mother feeling any better?

11
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,058
Doctor Jiu has been unwell recently

12
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:16,992
So I

13
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,926
am standing in for him to see patients

14
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,928
Thanks to Doctor Jiu's blessing

15
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,363
She's safe and sound now

16
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:23,699
But what about you

17
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:26,368
You look so young

18
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,836
Yet you're able to stand in for Doctor Jiu

19
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:29,605
There must be something

20
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:32,040
Special about you, right?

21
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,309
Oh, I definitely have my specialties

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,644
Even if your brain is sick

23
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,112
I can cure it for you

24
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:38,080
Who has a sick brain?

25
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,047
How dare you

26
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:40,215
Hanye

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,117
Do not be disrespectful

28
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:43,919
Yes, Your Highness

29
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,326
Little Isatis, the Immortal Physician

30
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,562
I've caught a bit of a cold

31
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:54,529
And I'm not feeling well

32
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,331
I wonder

33
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:57,933
Do you have an effective remedy, Doctor Isatis?

34
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:00,269
I do

35
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,004
Guaranteed to cure on consumption

36
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:02,471
Just wait a moment

37
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,579
My exclusive secret formula

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,713
The Cold Spirit

39
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,681
One bowl

40
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:13,749
and you'll see immediate results

41
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:21,323
Pay first

42
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:22,057
Then drink the medicine

43
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,659
How much

44
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,593
for this bowl

45
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,096
Fifty taels

46
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,531
Fifty taels?

47
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,001
But your sign clearly says five cent per bowl

48
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,670
Why is it fifty taels for us?

49
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:37,205
If you want to drink, drink;
if not, I'll see you out

50
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:38,073
No worries

51
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,617
I will examine you

52
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,690
I presume

53
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:57,759
This is the famous Doctor Jiu

54
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:09,571
Why even ask for an examination?

55
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:11,206
He's already willing to
pay fifty taels for my bath

56
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,240
The Cold Spirit

57
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,976
From now on

58
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:15,811
Only I can drink your bathwater

59
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:23,285
This medicine

60
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,286
the effects are not stable

61
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:25,921
It might jeopardize the health of a lord

62
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:27,956
Better not to drink it

63
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,858
Then I'll trouble Doctor Jiu

64
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:31,393
to treat me

65
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,199
How is it?

66
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:15,871
It should be a decoction made from Malan

67
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,139
also known as Isatis Root

68
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,074
The usual decoction made from Isatis Root

69
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,809
wouldn't be this potent

70
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:23,111
Nor would it be colorless and tasteless like this

71
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:24,579
This Isatis Root

72
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,415
must be no ordinary item

73
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,616
It could be the work of a herb spirit?

74
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,117
Based on the decoction alone

75
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,519
It's hard to draw a conclusion

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,953
But herb spirits

77
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:33,288
have a strong scent

78
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,890
If I could meet one

79
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,691
I would know with just a sniff

80
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:40,262
Your Highness

81
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,297
Lord Jiuming is outside requesting an audience

82
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:43,498
Let him in

83
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:44,599
Yes

84
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,516
Lord Jiuming

85
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:04,953
What brings you here

86
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:06,922
so late at night?

87
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:10,192
When I first joined the Supreme Clarity Division

88
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,093
we agreed that

89
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,996
once I took off the black robe

90
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,165
I could return to being Ah Jiu, the herbalist

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,767
Now that I'm unwell

92
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:20,435
And the Herb Hall's affairs are 'numerous

93
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:21,870
I can no longer be in two places at once

94
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:24,673
So I ask

95
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:26,475
Prince Ye to honor your promise

96
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:27,843
And allow me

97
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,511
to lay down my robe and return to medicine

98
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,721
The thing is

99
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:41,456
The greater one's abilities

100
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:42,757
the greater the responsibilities

101
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,093
Right now, with spirits running wild

102
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,929
The Supreme Clarity Division
can't afford to lose you

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,597
Besides

104
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,633
I've heard that this Little Isatis
Physician has quite the medical skills

105
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,735
Hasn't she taken some worries off your shoulders?

106
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,573
She's just a country girl

107
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,141
Where would she get any medical skills from

108
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,511
I only took her in out of pity

109
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:03,478
for a few days

110
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,217
I would have forgotten about it if you hadn't come

111
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:11,419
Lately

112
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,421
There's a Wolf spirit causing trouble

113
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:16,157
This spirit is arrogant and skilled in magic

114
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:19,160
I've sent Han Ye to capture
it several times to no avail

115
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,595
This Wolf spirit
[Spirit Wolf]

116
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:21,963
will set fires

117
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,198
in the Lantern Street market

118
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,499
and rob amidst the chaos

119
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:27,335
If you can capture this spirit this time

120
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:28,537
I will allow you

121
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:29,971
to lay down your robe and return to medicine

122
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:46,454
I've long heard that the Lantern Festival
is exceptionally lively

123
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,857
It's the second biggest festival in the
Northest Land after New Year's Eve

124
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,559
It truly lives up to its reputation

125
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:53,061
The sky lanterns go up at
the quarter hour of the Dog

126
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:53,962
Don't be late

127
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:56,031
I heard that if two people
release a lantern together

128
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:57,299
They can stay together forever

129
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Hurry, let's go

130
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:03,772
When Ah Jiu gets here

131
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,073
I want to go release lanterns with him too

132
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,510
Sister Isatis

133
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,045
Ning'er

134
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,313
You're here selling sky lanterns too

135
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:46,081
Yep

136
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:48,683
Sister Isatis, take a look at my lanterns

137
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:49,217
Come

138
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,606
Sister Isatis

139
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,975
Why didn't Doctor Jiu come with you

140
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,510
He's out on a call, he'll be here soon

141
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,278
I came over first to wait for him

142
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,899
We'll just need him to write
something on it when he arrives

143
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,171
Jiuming

144
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,084
Why isn't Ah Jiu here yet

145
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,253
Could he have run into some danger?
