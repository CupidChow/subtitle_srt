00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 9

3
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:54,143
[What's the point of being an immortal]

4
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,293
Elder, why did you pay

5
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,528
such great respect earlier

6
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,631
Please forgive me for not
recognizing a great man when I see one

7
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:05,932
I was disrespectful to you, Lord

8
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,168
and I hope you can forgive my offense

9
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,170
He turns out to be an important figure

10
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,539
I was showing off my powers in front of him

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,940
Isn't that just asking to be laughed at?

12
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,577
Although I am not acquainted with you, Lord

13
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,713
I could already tell

14
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,514
your talents are extraordinary

15
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,383
You're not just an ordinary human

16
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:25,051
But as for today's matter

17
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:28,955
I hope you can spare our herb fortress

18
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,457
Don't worry, Elder

19
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,360
My sudden visit this time

20
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,061
Is actually for just one thing

21
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,532
What are you doing?

22
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,535
We can talk about it later

23
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,872
What are you doing?

24
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:46,773
Wife

25
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:49,909
What wife?

26
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:50,610
Astragalus

27
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:52,279
Who are you calling wife?

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,247
We are already married

29
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,215
Look

30
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,717
The sun is so nice right now

31
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,687
Let's go consummate our marriage

32
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:01,821
Consummate, consummate, consummate

33
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:02,689
What marriage chamber are you talking about?

34
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,391
Put it on yourself

35
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,127
The Elder was interrupted mid-sentence just now

36
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,628
So the ceremony doesn't count

37
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,529
I declare

38
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,697
our marriage

39
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:11,464
is null and void

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,634
While you're still in your wedding clothes

41
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,569
You'd better find another good match quickly

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,337
Maybe

43
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,772
You'll still get to use that
marriage chamber after all

44
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,076
Little Isatis

45
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:23,977
Come in

46
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:36,856
Little Isatis

47
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,859
Now that you've attained a human form

48
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:40,994
Why

49
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:44,464
haven't you dissolved the spirit bond with this Lord

50
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,599
and delayed it until now?

51
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:48,835
I

52
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:49,669
Elder

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,307
Only by sharing life and injury with Little Isatis

54
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:55,608
Down the mountain

55
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,976
could I ensure her safety

56
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,611
Now that she has returned to the fortress

57
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,612
I can be at ease

58
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:00,647
Little Isatis

59
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,248
Last night

60
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,850
I was wrong

61
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,652
I shouldn't have said those things to you

62
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,154
It's just that the Northest Land is truly dangerous

63
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:09,756
It's safer for you

64
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,690
to stay here in the fortress

65
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,492
Clueless herbalist

66
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,028
Didn't we agree that night

67
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,730
to become each other's family

68
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:18,064
to study medicine together

69
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:18,898
to heal and save people?

70
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,568
Why are you going back on your word now?

71
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,669
Little Isatis

72
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,872
As an Isatis Root with incomplete roots

73
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,074
You've cultivated for a
hundred years without progress

74
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,343
If you miss this marriage with Astragalus

75
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:34,381
You'll lose your chance at immortality in this life

76
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,182
I don't want to cultivate to immortality at all

77
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,052
If I can't have freedom

78
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:39,986
If I can't love

79
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,288
What's the point of being an immortal

80
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,191
And now I've become human

81
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:46,226
What I want to do

82
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:46,993
is to be

83
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:47,794
Little Isatis

84
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,078
Child

85
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,546
Do you realize

86
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,715
what this means

87
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,422
Years ago

88
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,657
Poria fell in love with a man

89
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,393
at first sight in the mountains

90
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,296
and went with him to the human world

91
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,532
To marry and have children

92
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,067
But later on

93
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,136
In order to save himself

94
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,471
The man betrayed Poria

95
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,739
Poria

96
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:37,110
Even though she later escaped
from the Supreme Clarity Division

97
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,512
She lost her immortal root

98
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,449
And became the madwoman she is today

99
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,184
Child

100
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,853
Do you really still want to go to the human world?

101
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,223
In the time I've spent with Ah Jiu

102
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,392
I know he has a pure heart

103
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,393
and the compassion of a healer

104
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:55,228
He was willing to come to

105
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,429
the herb fortress alone for me

106
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,264
And I am willing to live

107
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,933
in the human world for him

108
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:11,678
Ah Jiu

109
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,581
No matter the dangers ahead

110
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,450
I am willing to walk hand in hand with you

111
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:23,623
Elder

112
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:25,792
Little Isatis has such faith in me

113
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,428
I, Ah Jiu, also swear upon my life

114
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,530
I will not betray her trust

115
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,265
I will treat Little Isatis well

116
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,435
And protect her

117
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,671
with all my might

118
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,460
Why hasn't the Immortal Physician Jiu
started seeing patients today?

119
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,494
What's going on?

120
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,229
Will we be able to get medical attention today?

121
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,664
We've been waiting for an hour already

122
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:20,580
Little Isatis

123
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,582
Coming, coming

124
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,287
You're finally awake

125
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,656
Do you feel any better?

126
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,262
Calling yourself the Immortal Physician

127
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,430
and you get this sick

128
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,631
just from a little rain

129
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:45,505
You

130
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,275
What's wrong with you?

131
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,580
I just had a terrible nightmare

132
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,150
It was really scary

133
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:00,486
It's okay

134
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,754
You're awake now

135
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:10,730
Come on

136
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,299
This is the fever-reducing
medicine I specially prepared for you

137
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,301
Hurry up and drink it to calm your nerves

138
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,279
How is it?

139
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,215
What kind of medicine is this?

140
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,184
Colorless and tasteless

141
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,585
So clear and pure

142
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,020
I've never had anything like it before

143
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,289
Just drink it up quickly

144
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,757
I am the spirit of the Isatis Root

145
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,301
That's my bathwater

146
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,702
Naturally, it's a fever-reducing medicine

147
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:52,405
Rest well

148
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,072
Rest well

149
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,674
Today, I'll see patients for you

150
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,012
Doctor

151
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,981
Do you think my throat can be cured

152
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,616
Of course it can

153
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,651
Bai

154
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,452
Bring me my special Cold Spirit medicine

155
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,389
With one bowl of this

156
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,556
The cure follows the medicine

157
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,228
How is it?

158
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,096
Much better

159
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,668
Let me tell you all

160
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,169
Today we have a female herbalist

161
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,770
And this medicine

162
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,338
Really does work wonders

163
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,439
A female herbalist?

164
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,207
That's a first for me

165
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,176
My fellow neighbors

166
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,346
The Immortal Physician Jiu has
been under the weather lately

167
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,615
Therefore, we have invited the
Immortal Physician Little Isatis

168
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,783
to take his place

169
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,618
This Immortal Physician Little Isatis

170
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,020
is as beautiful as a flower, beloved by all

171
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,088
And with our Immortal Physician Jiu

172
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,423
They are a match made in heaven

173
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:44,624
and what a talented pair they are

174
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:45,858
And Immortal Physician Jiu?

175
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,993
I've said too much That's right

176
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,995
our Immortal Physician Little Isatis

177
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,863
is not only skilled in medicine

178
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,498
but also has healing hands

179
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,467
With one bowl of this Cold Spirit medicine

180
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,436
Guaranteed, the cure follows the medicine

181
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:57,036
That amazing, huh?

182
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,137
So

183
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,139
I ask all of our neighbors

184
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,174
To help spread the word

185
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,109
I, Bai, thank you all

186
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,943
Thank you

187
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,079
Herb Hall has produced

188
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,547
another miraculous healer

189
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,382
Isn't that something?

190
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,650
Thank you, everyone, thank you

191
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,619
You're saying Jiuming went
to the Northest Mountain alone

192
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,988
but returned with a girl?

193
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:16,622
Yes

194
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,559
This woman is now practicing at Herb Hall

195
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,727
known as the Immortal Physician Little Isatis

196
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:21,928
One bowl of her Cold Spirit medicine

197
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,995
Can cure all ailments

198
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,064
When Ganoderma escaped

199
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,233
I went to Herb Hall to look for Lord Jiuming

200
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,669
He was bathing with

201
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:32,338
this Immortal Physician Little Isatis at the time

202
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,308
Lord Jiuming also made a point to instruct me

203
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,209
Not to reveal his identity

204
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,377
Thinking back now

205
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,480
It does seem quite peculiar

206
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,984
Now that you mention it

207
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,353
I am indeed quite interested in this

208
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,056
Immortal Physician Little Isatis

209
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:51,958
Prepare the sedan chair

210
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,026
to Herb Hall

211
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:54,994
Yes
