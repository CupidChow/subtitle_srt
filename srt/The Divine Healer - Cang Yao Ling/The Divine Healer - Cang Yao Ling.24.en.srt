00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:51,827
Episode 24

3
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,647
[Let my life be exchanged for her eternal peace!]

4
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:01,367
Bai

5
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,087
This is the wine you loved

6
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,007
when you were alive

7
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,007
I've filled it up for you

8
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:16,127
The energy here is abundant

9
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:18,607
I've buried you here

10
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:20,887
So you can move on faster

11
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:23,087
in your afterlife

12
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:30,327
Physician Jiu

13
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:31,847
I've already explained everything

14
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:33,687
about Jiuming to little Isatis

15
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:35,527
She knows

16
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,007
that you've never personally killed any spirits

17
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:39,567
and knows

18
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,127
it was you who saved me last time

19
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,007
Thanks to you

20
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:44,967
For this time

21
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:46,367
Herb Fortress

22
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,487
was able to regain a glimmer of life

23
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:50,727
But

24
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:52,607
Physician Jiu

25
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:54,646
I must ask you

26
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:56,927
Is your marriage to little Isatis

27
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:59,087
still valid?

28
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,007
Of course

29
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:06,487
Little Isatis and I are inseparable

30
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:08,567
in life and death

31
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,127
If heaven doesn't grant my wish

32
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:14,607
I will

33
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,287
defy heaven itself

34
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,007
We are bound for life or death

35
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:28,447
never to part for all eternity

36
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:51,127
Emperor Jiu

37
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,287
Run quickly

38
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:53,047
Yuhu

39
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:54,607
What exactly happened?

40
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,287
Heavenly Supreme found out you refused his decree

41
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,527
and has sent people to capture you

42
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,007
The heavenly troops will arrive any moment

43
00:02:59,007 --> 00:02:59,887
You must go now

44
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:02,167
Little Isatis

45
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,007
Ah Jiu

46
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:26,207
Little Isatis

47
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:29,047
Little Isatis

48
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,087
Little Isatis

49
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,607
Little Isatis

50
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:42,407
Little Isatis

51
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,767
Emperor Jiu

52
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:55,847
Pick up the sword

53
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:57,847
Kill her

54
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,087
Little Isatis has done nothing wrong

55
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:02,487
Why must you kill her?

56
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,007
She is the reincarnation of the Charm Master

57
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:06,766
Only by killing her

58
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,207
can peace be restored to the three realms

59
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:16,127
Emperor Jiu

60
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:16,687
Hurry

61
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:17,887
Pick up the sword

62
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:19,887
No

63
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,767
I absolutely will not harm little Isatis

64
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:25,927
Emperor Jiu

65
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,247
The Charm Master was supposed
to vanish with Lan Zhen's soul

66
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:30,967
It was you who recklessly bestowed the Celestial Dew

67
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,047
allowing the Charm Master to reincarnate as a spirit

68
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:34,207
Now

69
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,807
only you can eliminate her

70
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:39,127
Are you going to ignore the well-being
of all beings in the three realms?

71
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:40,607
In a past life

72
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,847
it was you who killed her

73
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,207
So what if it was?

74
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,527
She was merely a mortal

75
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:49,807
Her life as dispensable as dust

76
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,127
What's there to regret in her death?

77
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:53,647
Emperor Jiu

78
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,967
Do not repeat your mistake

79
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,647
You are a deity of the heavens

80
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:00,447
You must protect the peace of the three realms

81
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:02,927
Killing the innocent

82
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:04,527
slaughtering other races

83
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:06,167
Is this

84
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,687
your so-called peace for the three realms?

85
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:29,687
Not to save the common people

86
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:32,607
Not to have the person I love

87
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:34,247
Such a deity

88
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,247
I would rather not be

89
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,247
Emperor Jiu

90
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,167
What are you doing?

91
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,847
If I am the only one in this world who can harm her

92
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,807
then let my life

93
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,487
be exchanged for her eternal peace

94
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:33,927
Silly herbalist

95
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,367
Silly herbalist

96
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:48,967
Silly herbalist

97
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,727
Silly herbalist

98
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,487
I don't want you to die

99
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,247
Silly herbalist

100
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:27,487
All deities, heed my command

101
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:30,047
Attack together

102
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:34,287
To kill the one I love

103
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:38,647
I want the heavenly realm

104
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,647
to be buried along with her

105
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,087
Mother, what happened after that?

106
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,406
Afterwards, the Charm Master's spirit dissipated

107
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,406
Heavenly Supreme allowed both of them

108
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,287
to return to the mortal world as humans

109
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:32,967
Then why didn't they come back to be deities?

110
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:34,047
Alright

111
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,127
What's so good

112
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,287
about being a deity?

113
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,367
It's most important for a
family of three to be together

114
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:40,247
Right?

115
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:55,927
Am I right?

116
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:57,687
You're right, Husband

117
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:58,767
Big brother

118
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,327
I've come to gather herbs on the mountain

119
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:03,847
and was hoping to get some water

120
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:08,887
Come

121
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:11,407
Let's see

122
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,127
what good things you've gathered

123
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:15,687
No need to be polite

124
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:16,247
Come on in

125
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:20,047
Quick, quick, let's go

126
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,047
We should be

127
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:23,287
meeting for the first time, right?

128
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:24,607
Come

129
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:25,567
Come

130
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:27,047
Bai

131
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:28,807
This tea was just brewed with morning dew

132
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:29,767
Give it a try

133
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:30,267
Alright

134
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:31,887
Wait

135
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,407
How do you know my surname is Bai?

136
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:34,927
Come

137
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,007
Of course

138
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,127
We've been waiting for you here for hundreds of years

139
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,767
We finally waited for you

140
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,087
But

141
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,647
This young man

142
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,087
is only eighteen this year

143
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:46,647
Your daughter is really cute

144
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,967
Come, little friend

145
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,047
Let me hold you

146
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:51,967
Let me hold you, alright?

147
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:54,327
Come

148
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:01,407
Is it fun?

149
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,167
Come on, catch me

150
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,207
Alright, faster now

151
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,247
Good

152
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:09,927
Is it fast?

153
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:17,247
Run fast
