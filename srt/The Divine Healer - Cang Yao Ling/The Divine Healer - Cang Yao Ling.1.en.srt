Why did you defy the celestial rules and
descend the dew of immortality in secret

3
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,248
causing the Beiming herbs to become sentient?

4
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:33,818
What was your reason?

5
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:38,155
Only to save the life of the one I love

6
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:41,459
Do you not know that immortals
must remain unattached?

7
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,261
If immortals cannot love

8
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:48,399
then I am willing to be mortal forever

Since you have no regrets

18

I will demote you to a mortal

Eliminate all spirits and monsters

Otherwise

21

Because of this

The imperial court has issued
the Medicine Concealment Order

33
