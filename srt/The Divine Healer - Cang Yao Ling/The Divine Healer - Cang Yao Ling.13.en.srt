00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 13

3
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:54,527
[She must have cast a spell on you!]

4
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,447
The injury is so deep

5
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,148
It must hurt a lot

6
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:12,885
I'll heal you now

7
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:37,910
Feeling better?

8
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:44,417
I've long heard that the
Supreme Clarity Division uses despicable tactics

9
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:46,219
I didn't expect them to resort to sneak attacks

10
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,253
They are so

11
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:49,689
Fortunately, you reacted quickly

12
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,324
Otherwise, they would have definitely captured you

13
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,393
But that's not right

14
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,295
How can you, a herbalist

15
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:56,963
be so skilled in martial arts?

16
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:06,572
I grew up

17
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:08,041
in the mountains since childhood

18
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,509
Initially, I learned martial arts

19
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,978
for self-defense

20
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:14,514
When I was twelve

21
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,282
my mother passed away from illness

22
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:17,750
I had no choice but to descend the mountain

23
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,353
One day

24
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:22,722
I saved a woman on the street

25
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,192
And thus, I earned the appreciation of a helpful man

26
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:27,093
Then

27
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:29,429
Was he who taught you martial arts?

28
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,733
Sort of

29
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:36,536
He treated me

30
00:02:36,537 --> 00:02:37,470
Like a brother

31
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,572
He said I had extraordinary talent

32
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:41,174
So he asked a master

33
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:42,675
To enhance my martial arts skill's

34
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,178
This Herb Hall

35
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,613
Was also established with his support

36
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:50,683
What about after that?

37
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,687
You were like brothers

38
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:56,089
Why haven't

39
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,924
I heard you mention him before?

40
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:01,227
He and I

41
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,629
Originally shared the same vision

42
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:05,164
of helping the world and, achieving peace

43
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,367
But gradually, his original intentions faded

44
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,936
And I could no longer understand his actions

45
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:12,739
I could only

46
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,107
Distance myself from him

47
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:19,645
What exactly did he do?

48
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,714
Tell me about it

49
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:34,761
Little Isatis

50
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:37,764
Right now

51
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,967
I can't tell you everything

52
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,270
Give me some time to sort things out

53
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,039
Then I'll explain it to you slowly

54
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:48,241
Okay?

55
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:50,109
I'll wait for you

56
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:52,845
Does it still hurt?

57
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:05,324
Your Highness

58
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,226
I'm just worried

59
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,961
If Lord Jiuming and that spirit conspire together

60
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,164
It could be detrimental to
the Supreme Clarity Division

61
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:13,166
They won't conspire

62
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,468
Jiuming is calm and tolerate

63
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:17,403
and accustomed to handling things on his own

64
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,772
He certainly wouldn't let someone he loves

65
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:20,907
Fall into danger

66
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,242
But that spirit remaining in
the Northest Land is a disaster

67
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:25,044
Your Highness

68
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,246
What do you plan to do?

69
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,427
To capture

70
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:44,230
Sometimes you must let go

71
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:05,084
Shopkeeper

72
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:06,919
I know now that little Isatis is a spirit

73
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:10,056
Look what she's done to you

74
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,159
Bai

75
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:15,094
You've been with me day and night

76
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:17,330
It's natural that you
discovered little Isatis's identity

77
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:18,498
But even so

78
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,365
You should know better

79
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,032
She's not a bad person

80
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:21,834
Whether she's bad or not doesn't matter

81
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:22,535
The point is

82
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:25,838
She's not even human

83
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:27,473
Us ordinary folks can't

84
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:29,041
Fight against the Supreme Clarity Division

85
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:30,776
If you ask me

86
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:31,978
Before anything bad happens

87
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,313
We should send this lady away quickly

88
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,617
What's 'this?

89
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:43,122
Why did you draw a piece of grass on your arm?

90
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:44,490
This is a spirit bond tattoo

91
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:46,926
She and I have formed a spirit bond

92
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:48,194
Together in life and in harm

93
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:50,229
This is the proof

94
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:51,430
Together?

95
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:52,798
Spirit bond?

96
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,235
She must have cast a spell on you

97
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:03,276
Bai

98
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:07,079
A lot has happened these days

99
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:09,282
And something doesn't sit right with me

100
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:10,249
How about

101
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:12,351
I find you a new employer

102
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,153
and you leave the Herb Hall as soon as possible?

103
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:15,121
Shopkeeper

104
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:17,189
Are you trying to drive me away?

105
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,427
There's nowhere else I'll go

106
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:23,496
but the Herb Hall

107
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:29,035
Since you've set your heart on little Isatis

108
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:31,871
Then I am committed to you too

109
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:41,681
I'm not leaving

110
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:47,353
Ah Jiu

111
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:48,120
You're back

112
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:48,754
You're awake

113
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,163
Did you

114
00:06:58,165 --> 00:06:59,332
make this?

115
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,001
I didn't know you could cook

116
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:03,936
Try it

117
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,810
Is it good?

118
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:30,630
Morning dew?

119
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:32,198
Didn't you

120
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,299
pour it all out yesterday?

121
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,467
Where did this come from?

122
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,369
That's because our shopkeeper

123
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,970
Went to the mountain to pick it today

124
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:41,173
He spent over two hours

125
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:42,808
And skipped breakfast

126
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,910
Just to get this small bottle

127
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,579
His own body isn't even fully recovered yet

128
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:47,613
Miss Isatis

129
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:50,116
Our shopkeeper is treating you

130
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,817
Even better than he treats me

131
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:54,153
Bai

132
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:55,955
You talk too much

133
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,690
Alright

134
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,458
I'll go make some chicken soup

135
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,228
To nourish both of you properly

136
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:05,331
I want more

137
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:10,770
By the way

138
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:12,138
You shouldn't

139
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,040
go out to see patients today

140
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:15,408
Leave everything

141
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,109
To me and Bai

142
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:18,411
Why?

143
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,214
After what happened yesterday

144
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:24,917
I think the Supreme Clarity Division

145
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:28,254
Is very likely to trace their way here

146
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,723
If you show yourself now

147
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:32,992
I really can't be at ease

148
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,096
The Northest Mountain has
always been the domain of spirits

149
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,598
The Supreme Clarity Division wouldn't easily step in

150
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:41,734
Unless

151
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:44,270
They were targeting the herb fortress

152
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:48,708
Could it be

153
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,209
They've found a way to break through the barrier?

154
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:55,848
You said

155
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:57,249
That the barrier

156
00:08:57,818 --> 00:08:58,551
Was set by Elder Ginseng

157
00:08:58,552 --> 00:08:59,919
With a thousand years of cultivation

158
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:01,721
Plus, it's so remote

159
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:02,755
Even if ordinary people found it

160
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:03,989
They wouldn't be able to enter

161
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,130
It'll be fine

162
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:18,237
Are those people from the Supreme Clarity Division?

163
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:20,072
Has something big happened?

164
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:33,986
I heard that the Supreme Clarity Division

165
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,155
Scored a complete victory
today at the Northest Mountain

166
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:37,957
All those spirits from the herb fortress

167
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,159
Were captured in one fell swoop

168
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,127
And I also heard

169
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:41,894
Most of them

170
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:44,396
Are rare herb spirits offered to the Emperor

171
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,031
That's a lot of nourishment
