Our Jiu, the Immortal Physician

5
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:00,677
Isn't he elegant and imposing?

6
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:02,212
Yes

00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:03,783
[Herb Hall apprentice, Bai Kangning]

8
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,380
Right?

9
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:05,849
Which girl in the Northest Land

10
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,151
isn't utterly charmed

11
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:08,719
by our Jiu, the Immortal Physician?

12
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:10,954
But you see

13
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:14,324
Our Jiu, the Immortal Physician,
isn't interested in such things

14
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,461
His ambition lies in healing the world

15
00:01:18,463 --> 00:01:20,164
He has no interest in women at all

16
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,131

What's going on here?

19
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:25,169
Why is he carrying someone?

21
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:29,373
Right, who is that woman?

00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:32,142
How dare she embrace our Jiu, the Immortal Physician

The Immortal Physician

26
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:33,877

Who is this now?

34
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,244
I just fell off a cliff

35
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:07,911
Fell

00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:09,012
She saved me

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
Fell off a cliff?

38
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:13,417
Are you alright?

39
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,219
Are you alright?

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,393
Then I'll make some chicken soup
for this young lady to strengthen her

44
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:24,895
No need, Bai

45
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,495
I'll be right there

46
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,129
No need

47
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:36,340
This is bad

48
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,975
Just arrived in the human world
and not yet stable in human form

49
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:39,476
I forgot about this

50
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,378
At the hour of Xu, during the first watch

51
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,814
When the moon is dark and the wind is high

52
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,216
Be careful of spirits

53
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:50,053
These spirits are always full of tricks

54
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,889
What she said to me earlier

55
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,191
What exactly did she mean?

56
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,393
We have formed a spirit bond

I command you

58
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:58,962
Hurry and take me down the mountain

59
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,299
Or should I first take her to
the Supreme Clarity Division

60
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,035
It's not too late to interrogate her slowly later

61
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:07,004
Silly herbalist

62
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,537

Dares to run wild in my Herb Hall

64
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:43,740
What mere spirit?

65
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,042

You want to take me to the Supreme Clarity Division?

77
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,134
I just arrived in the human world today

78
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:12,636
My energy is not stable yet

79
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:14,738
I still need your support for a few more days

84
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,111
Alright, you silly herbalist

85
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:56,646
Let me tell you

86
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:57,381
You and I

87
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,448
Have already formed a spirit bond

88
00:04:58,616 --> 00:04:59,983
I am your spirit master

89
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:02,018
You are my spirit servant

90
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:03,620
Whatever I tell you to do

91
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:04,454
You must do it

92
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:05,489
Understand?

93
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,892
A mere spirit

94
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:10,660
Spouting nonsense

95
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,897
How am I spouting nonsense?

96
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,565
Look at this

97
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,101
This is the mark of a spirit servant

98
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:20,804
Do your duty as a spirit servant

99
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,372
Until my form is fully cultivated

100
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,141
I'll naturally dissolve our bond

101
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:25,375
And let you leave

102
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:30,514
Do you know who I am?

103
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:32,115
To dare get in my bed

104
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,019
Aren't you just a simple herbalist?

105
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,053
Could it be

106
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:38,455
You could eat me up

107
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:40,690
Go ahead

108
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:48,098
If I were

109
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:51,001
really able to?

110
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,103
Then you should give it a try

111
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:01,711
Put a little more strength into it

112
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,680
A little higher up

113
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:08,752
A little higher up

114
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,490
Since I can't resist her when she's awake

115
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:15,959
I'll just play along for tonight

116
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,395
Tomorrow morning, before she wakes

117
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:20,897
I'll have the Supreme Clarity
Division's men take her away

118
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
Don't even think about it

119
00:06:24,402 --> 00:06:24,935
I

120
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:26,403
Know what you're thinking

121
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:27,003
The two of us

122
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:28,538
are now in a spirit bond

123
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,407
Right now, it's life and death together

124
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,676
If anything happens to me

125
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:34,277
You'll be affected too

126
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:35,812
How could there be such a bewitching technique

127
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:37,280
Don't believe me

128
00:06:37,715 --> 00:06:38,815
Try it out for yourself

129
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:48,892
She's full of tricks

130
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,528
Nothing but lies

131
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:52,896
What I'm saying is

132
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:54,598
If anything happens to me

133
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:55,365
You'll suffer the same fate

134
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,900
Your own injuries

135
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,834
What does that have to do with me?

136
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,980
How about that, I didn't deceive you, did I?

137
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:13,416
You, come here and lie down obediently

138
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,651
Once I've absorbed enough energy

139
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:15,952
I will naturally let you go

140
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:18,889
Be good

141
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,090
Listen to me

[Herb Spirit, Elder Ginseng]

144
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,633
This Miss Isatis

145
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,902
Truly followed a mortal man

146
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,537
and left the barrier without permission

147
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:37,007
Speak

148
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:38,842
Yes

149
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:40,510
They've also formed a spirit bond

150
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,412
From now on, it's a shared fate of life and death

151
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:43,780
An order of absolute obedience

152
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:46,249
I am truly worried

153
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:47,851
This man

154
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,620
Being able to enter the barrier with a mortal body

155
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:52,355
His identity

156
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:54,691
must be no ordinary matter

157
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:01,598
Miss Isatis is naturally playful

158
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,635
And the Northest Land is full of
Supreme Clarity Division's people

159
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,539
I'm afraid she might be in danger

Yes

162
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:12,676
Take some men

163
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:14,411
And bring Miss Isatis back

164
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:15,712
Remember

165
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:18,114
To act carefully

166
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:19,983
Yes

167
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:53,116
The scenes in my dream just now

168
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:55,318
Must have been that spirit's doing

169
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:56,886
Now is the perfect opportunity to act

The patients outside have lined up to the city gates

172
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,691
Hurry up and get out of bed

173
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:03,660
Who is it, making all that
noise so early in the morning

174
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:04,561
Alright, I know

175

Who is it, it's so noisy

176
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:08,498
Is there someone in your room?

177
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,899
No one, no one

178
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,534
Is it the girl from yesterday?

179
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,003
No one, how could there be anyone

180
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:14,771
If there's no one inside, then I'm coming in

181
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:15,739
It's fine

182
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,573
Wait a second

Good morning everyone

Only ten spots available

First come, first served

Well done, you

192
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,054
Today it's you, right?

193
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:05,755
It's you, isn't it?
