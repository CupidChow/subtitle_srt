00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 5

3
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:54,577
[I'm sorry]

4
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:58,013
Better to kill by mistake than let a spirit escape

5
00:00:58,415 --> 00:00:59,815
Ganoderma has never harmed anyone

6
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:02,785
Why won't you ever let her go?

7
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,859
Never harmed anyone?

8
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:12,094
Then what's with

9
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:13,662
the bloodstains on you?

10
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:15,331
This is blood I willingly offered

11
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,299
Ganoderma is gravely ill

12
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:19,468
Only this can save her life

13
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:21,170
She has never harmed me

14
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:22,938
On the contrary, she has saved my life many times

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,107
Even that unfamiliar spirit

16
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:26,709
was willing to use magic to heal my wounds

17
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:29,445
Today, no matter what, I will save you

18
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:33,249
That clueless herbalist said Mengzhi

19
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,017
might risk his life

20
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,119
I really can't be at ease

21
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:39,488
You just stay here and focus on getting well

22
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:40,689
Trust me

23
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,825
I will use magic to heal him

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,426
and ensure that nothing happens to him

25
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:55,237
They're really not bad people

26
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,639
They?

27
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:58,741
It seems we've indeed found more than one spirit

28
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:00,809
Take him back

29
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:01,744
for a strict interrogation

30
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:03,045
Hold on

31
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:12,888
I'll go with you

32
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:14,490
Ganoderma

33
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,558
What nonsense are you talking about?

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,961
You've studied hard for ten years

35
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:20,296
and finally started your official career

36
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:21,964
You can't ruin

37
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,499
your future for me

38
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:26,468
Ganoderma

39
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,736
Mengzhi

40
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:29,171
Let go

41
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:33,842
Lord

42
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:36,345
He's just a frail scholar

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,813
bewitched by me

44
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,416
He was just talking nonsense

45
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,251
I hope you can overlook this

46
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:43,419
and spare him

47
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:45,020
I, Ganoderma

48
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,289
am willing to exchange myself

49
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:50,159
for his future

50
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:51,427
Take her away

51
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:57,266
Who dares to come any closer?

52
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,500
No one is allowed to touch her

53
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:01,604
Fire arrows

54
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:27,896
Spirit

55
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:29,765
You lied to me

56
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,268
You never really

57
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:35,304
rebonded with me

58
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,506
I'm sorry

59
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,342
It's too dangerous

60
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,544
I didn't want

61
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,380
you to get hurt

62
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:49,918
Ganoderma

63
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,621
Take the Ganoderma spirit back
to the Supreme Clarity Division

64
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,690
Prince Ye will surely reward you handsomely

65
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:59,361
None of you can take her away

66
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,130
You little fool

67
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,565
Defying me and colluding with spirits

68
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,700
And you dare resist

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,959
Lord Jiuming

70
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,332
We from the Supreme Clarity Division only capture spirits

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,100
We do not harm the common people

72
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:39,201
Yes

73
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:42,104
Lord

74
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:43,806
Your injury

75
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,121
Take Ganoderma away

76
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:04,893
I didn't expect the Supreme Clarity Division

77
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:06,295
to have such formidable experts

78
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:16,105
This is bad

79
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:17,339
That clueless herbalist

80
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:21,543
Herbalist?

81
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,079
Clueless herbalist?

82
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,183
Where are you?

83
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,185
Where did you go?

84
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:32,254
Clueless herbalist?

85
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,156
Even that unfamiliar spirit

86
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:35,491
was willing to use magic to heal my wounds

87
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:36,525
Clueless herbalist

88
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,003
We have no grudges with the Supreme Clarity Division

89
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:49,772
Why do they relentlessly capture us?

90
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:56,278
Little Isatis

91
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,324
Are you alright?

92
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:22,171
I'm to blame

93
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,239
It's all my fault

94
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:26,408
I just wanted to help Sister Ganoderma

95
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,077
but I ran into the Supreme Clarity Division

96
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:32,448
I got injured

97
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:36,118
and now you're involved too

98
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,886
I'm sorry too

99
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,727
Why are you apologizing to me?

100
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:48,163
I thought

101
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,701
Ganoderma would certainly
kill that scholar to prolong her life

102
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,038
Even

103
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:05,747
Don't blame yourself

104
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,017
Mortals have always been
prejudiced against us spirits

105
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:14,356
The Supreme Clarity Division even
vows to eradicate all spirits in the world

106
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,959
Sister Ganoderma

107
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:19,094
If she's been captured

108
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:20,162
No

109
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:21,096
I have to save her

110
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,942
What's wrong with you?

111
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,119
Nothing

112
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:46,622
I just wanted to tell you

113
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:49,057
I saw Ganoderma and her husband

114
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:51,093
on the street just now

115
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:53,328
Ganoderma's complexion

116
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:55,731
has improved a lot

117
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,200
Really?

118
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,104
Sister Ganoderma, she escaped?

119
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:08,243
You're not lying to me?

120
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:27,162
May I be the one to interrogate
this Ganoderma spirit

121
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,666
You usually just capture without questioning

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,568
What's gotten into you today?

123
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,202
Back when we were capturing
spirits at the Northest Mountain

124
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,103
I had my suspicions

125
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,839
Ganoderma fears light and heat

126
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,974
and usually avoids candlelight

127
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:41,143
However, the household where the crime happened

128
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:42,177
was brightly lit

129
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:43,745
It's quite peculiar

130
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:47,683
The Supreme Clarity Division has
always been about capturing spirits

131
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:49,284
The investigation of the case

132
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:51,086
should be handed over to
the Court of Judicial Review

133
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,255
How about this

134
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,123
I'll explain the situation to Zhu Shaoqing

135
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,826
who's in charge of this case

136
00:08:58,227 --> 00:08:59,528
and strive to get to the bottom of it

137
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:01,797
According to the nearby residents

138
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:02,798
that night

139
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,299
they also heard a little girl crying

140
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,134
But after the incident

141
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:07,135
she was nowhere to be found

142
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:08,804
If we could find her first

143
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,240
It's not our place to get involved

144
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:14,810
Investigating cases is not our responsibility

145
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:16,378
Jiuming

146
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,213
You never used to be the meddling type

147
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:20,916
Yes

148
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,017
You must be tired

149
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:23,485
You should go back and rest early

150
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:31,059
What happened to your injury?

151
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:34,429
188:

152
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:36,932
It's just a minor injury

153
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,533
A few days of rest should suffice

154
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:40,769
I heard from Hanye that

155
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,105
you sounded the alarm twice tonight

156
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:44,606
Could it be that some have slipped through the net?

157
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:45,207
Not at all

158
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:49,244
Do you know

159
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:51,346
why a mere Ganoderma

160
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:52,848
could escape from

161
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,282
the tightly guarded

162
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:56,518
Supreme Clarity Division?

163
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:02,491
It was I who instructed Han Ye
to intentionally relax the guard

164
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:03,458
I had hoped to

165
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:04,760
follow the trail to find

166
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,528
the legendary herb fortress

167
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:08,930
and then capture all the spirits at once

168
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:11,066
But unexpectedly

169
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,169
the one who came to the rescue was a feeble scholar

170
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,039
What a pity

171
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:43,965
I know

172
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:45,267
you are not the murderer

173
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:46,802
Today, I'll let you go

174
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:47,769
Don't mention this

175
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:49,371
to anyone

176
00:10:58,181 --> 00:10:59,881
I've been refining pills for over thirty years

177
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,616
Whether it's a herb spirit or not

178
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:02,784
I can tell with just a sniff

179
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,053
This is clearly a common Ganoderma

180
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:07,089
It has nothing to do with the Ganoderma spirit

181
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,056
we captured earlier

182
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:10,759
In my opinion

183
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:11,114
[Supreme Clarity Division, Alchemist]

184
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,861
it's clear that you were negligent in your duties

185
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:14,730
which allowed someone to
pull the wool over your eyes

186
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:15,864
How dare you say I was negligent?

187
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:16,164
Enough!

188
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:16,932
You

189
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:24,239
Do not spread word about the Ganoderma incident

190
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:26,808
In the coming days, increase the patrols

191
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:29,578
from three times a day to five times a day

192
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,247
If you find any spirits

193
00:11:32,248 --> 00:11:33,749
regardless of guilt

194
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:36,318
arrest them immediately
