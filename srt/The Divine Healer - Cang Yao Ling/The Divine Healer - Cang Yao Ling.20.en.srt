1
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:51,880
Episode 20

3
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:54,307
[The original form]

4
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:05,967
Congratulations, Your Highness

5
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:07,087
A complete victory

6
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:08,647
Has the Millennium Ginseng

7
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,367
been sent to Lord Zhu of the Court of Judicial Review?

8
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,207
It has already been dispatched

9
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:14,607
Lord Zhu said

10
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,767
At the early court tomorrow

11
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:18,247
He will submit the case report to His Majesty

12
00:01:18,887 --> 00:01:20,607
Proving the killings were done by spirits

13
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:21,767
And request to lift the seal
on the Supreme Clarity Division

14
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:24,087
After Jiuming left

15
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:25,887
The position of Judicial Officer has remained vacant

16
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:28,527
Lord Hanye

17
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:29,967
What do you think?

18
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:36,087
Thank you, Your Highness

19
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,047
I am at your service

20
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:39,367
And willing to work like your servant

21
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:42,967
Where is the Isatis Root spirit now?

22
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:47,967
She is still locked in the dungeon

23
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:49,887
It's strange though

24
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:52,287
Other spirits revert to their
original form when encountering fire

25
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:54,127
Even the Millennium Ginseng

26
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:55,807
Couldn't withstand Your Highness's
soul-snatching arrow

27
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,007
But this Isatis Root alone

28
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:00,247
Seems not to fear fire

29
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:04,727
Interesting

30
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:18,767
Prince Ye has decreed

31
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:21,047
Whoever captures a precious herb

32
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:22,087
Will be handsomely rewarded

33
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:24,407
Astragalus

34
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:25,207
Little Isatis

35
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:28,327
Elder

36
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:30,607
Little Isatis

37
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,207
You cannot be captured by them

38
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:42,967
Burn

39
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,367
Until she reverts to her original form

40
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,247
Little Isatis

41
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,247
Lord Jiuming

42
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:55,207
Your wound has just been treated

43
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:56,207
It's not advisable to move

44
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:58,687
Please rest back in your room

45
00:03:59,087 --> 00:03:59,927
Where is little Isatis?

46
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:01,847
What have you done to little Isatis?

47
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:02,927
Where is Feiye?

48
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:04,686
I want to see Feiye

49
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:07,727
Prince Ye is currently at the
Supreme Clarity Division handling affairs

50
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,527
He specifically instructed me to take good care of you

51
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:13,047
And to relay a message

52
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:15,727
Abandon darkness for light

53
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,207
The past will not be pursued

54
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:20,447
Bring Feiye to me

55
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:22,007
Bring Feiye to me!

56
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:31,047
I advised once you against this

57
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,727
Never thought it would come to this point

58
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,367
Perhaps the calamity in one's fate

59
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,687
Is inescapable

60
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:41,167
Why?

61
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,527
If this is my calamity

62
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:46,567
Why harm her?

63
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,367
Why destroy the Herb Hall?

64
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,527
The cycle of Heaven

65
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,327
operates on cause and effect

66
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,087
This calamity

67
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:58,607
No one can hide from

68
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,607
What exactly is the cause and effect

69
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,567
you speak of?

70
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,367
You were once the Immortal Physician

71
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,047
Emperor Jiu above the skies

72
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:25,527
Who fell in love with Lan Zhen

73
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,087
the eldest princess of the
Northest Land during your travels

74
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,327
You privately pledged your life to her

75
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:33,967
On the day of your grand wedding

76
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:35,887
Lan Zhen suddenly fell gravely ill

77
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:38,327
To save her life

78
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,607
You unilaterally used magic to bestow Celestial Dew

79
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,247
But this Celestial Dew did not save Lan Zhen's life

80
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:49,967
Instead, it caused the herbs of the Northeast Mountain

81
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:52,727
to gain sentience and become spirits

82
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,047
The heavenly supreme was furious

83
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,847
Immortal Physician, Emperor Jiu

84
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,287
You defied the laws of Heaven and
bestowed Celestial Dew without permission

85
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:06,607
For what reason?

86
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:11,127
To save the life of the one I love

87
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:12,447
Do you not know

88
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,087
Immortals must not possess mortal emotions?

89
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,367
If being an immortal means having no emotions

90
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:21,447
I would rather be mortal forever

91
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,567
Even if you are the Immortal Physician

92
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,287
This life-giving Celestial Dew

93
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,807
Cannot bring her back

94
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:47,967
Loving her

95
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,287
Do you regret it?

96
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,647
Never

97
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,127
Very well

98
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:55,287
Since you have no regrets

99
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:57,087
I will demote you to a mortal

100
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,087
To eliminate the evil outcomes

101
00:06:58,087 --> 00:06:59,207
Your beloved must be slain by your hand

102
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:00,447
Otherwise

103
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:03,607
You will be obliterated, your body
and soul, will never recover

104
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:24,767
Unexpectedly

105
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,127
The heavenly supreme demoted you to the mortal realm

106
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,207
To eliminate spirits

107
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:32,607
But you ended up falling in
love with the spirit little Isatis

108
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,327
But why?

109
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,847
In my dreams

110
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,847
Little Isatis and Lan Zhen look exactly alike

111
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:54,807
Could it be little Isatis is
the reincarnation of Lan Zhen?

112
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,927
When I first saw her, I was also shocked

113
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:58,567
Lan Zhen was just a mortal

114
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,207
She shouldn't have reincarnated as a spirit

115
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,287
Unless

116
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,327
Lan Zhen was not a mere mortal

117
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,967
At this rate of burning, it'll take too long

118
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:16,487
Exactly
