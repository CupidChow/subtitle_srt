1
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,803
[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 6

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,702
[Who are you exactly?]

4
00:00:58,694 --> 00:00:59,493
Here's your number

5
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:01,662
Take it

6
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:04,599
Please wait a moment

7
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,833
Thank you

8
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:07,668
Little charm

9
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:09,136
Is the Immortal Physician Jiu around?

10
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:11,572
Shopkeeper

11
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:12,740
Someone is looking for you

12
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:16,744
Immortal Physician Jiu

13
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:18,613
We're about to move away from the Northest Land

14
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:19,814
Before we leave

15
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:21,349
Ling'er wants to personally thank you

16
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,151
Immortal Physician Jiu

17
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:25,219
Thank you so much

18
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,188
for not discriminating against us as foreigners

19
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,256
and for treating me

20
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:30,224
and also for treating

21
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,425
my husband Meng Zhi's wounds

22
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,460
It was nothing

23
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:33,728
hardly worth mentioning

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,529
If anyone should be thanked

25
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,598
it should be her

26
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:51,012
Sister Ganoderma

27
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:53,381
You look so much better

28
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:54,649
That's wonderful

29
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:57,785
Where are you two

30
00:01:58,253 --> 00:01:59,353
headed for?

31
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:00,688
Little Isatis

32
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,757
We've decided

33
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:03,824
to move away from the Northest Land

34
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,459
So before we leave

35
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:07,194
we wanted to give you a few words of advice

36
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,397
The Northest Land is fraught with danger

37
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,699
The Supreme Clarity Division is everywhere

38
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:13,634
And since you haven't fully stabilized your human form

39
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:15,369
you must be extra cautious

40
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,305
in the future

41
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:18,105
Do you understand?

42
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,208
I understand

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,312
But I don't want you to leave

44
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:25,780
Let me ask you

45
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:27,715
How long have you and the Immortal Physician Jiu

46
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:29,150
been in a spirit bond?

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,953
Just over half a month

48
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:34,488
But my cultivation is still shallow

49
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:37,992
I guess it will take some time to fully become human

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,634
Sister Ganoderma

51
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:47,735
What are you doing?

52
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,936
How can you

53
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:51,105
give me your hundred years of cultivation?

54
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,074
I've already decided

55
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:55,609
to live a mortal life with Meng Zhi

56
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:56,944
This energy

57
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,512
is of no use to me anymore

58
00:02:58,714 --> 00:02:59,513
Besides

59
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:00,915
you and the Immortal Physician Jiu

60
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,783
saved my life

61
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:04,719
Consider this

62
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,354
my way of repaying you

63
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,022
With this

64
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:10,024
your human form will be stable

65
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,693
The Supreme Clarity Division
won't be able to easily track you down

66
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,195
I'll feel more at ease

67
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:17,031
Please

68
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:19,100
Please

69
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,214
Thank you, Immortal Physician Jiu

70
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,182
Ling'er and I

71
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:37,051
owe you our lives

72
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,388
Now that you've passed the exams

73
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:42,890
and you're giving up this great future

74
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,092
do you feel any regrets?

75
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,694
The Immortal Physician Jiu jests

76
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,096
Ling'er means

77
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:50,931
more to me than anything

78
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:54,301
Herbalist

79
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:55,569
help me down quickly

80
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:43,417
Jiudi

81
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,253
You've finally been moved

82
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:05,172
You guys

83
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:06,273
Let me ask you all

84
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:07,141
The herbalist

85
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,909
Has the herbalist mentioned me to you?

86
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:09,944
Yes

87
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:11,879
Yes

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,013
Every day while watering the plants

89
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,415
He really likes you

90
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,216
That's right

91
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:16,317
Ah Jiu is here

92
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:35,436
Ah Jiu

93
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,670
Ah Jiu

94
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,175
In this world, even if you meet

95
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,344
you're destined not to stay together

96
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:44,778
Don't make the same mistake again

97
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:46,113
Ah Jiu

98
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:48,849
Who are you really?

99
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,551
I'm Little Isatis

100
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:54,021
The Isatis Root you've held in your palm every day

101
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:02,796
Ah Jiu

102
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,332
What's wrong, Ah Jiu

103
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:07,535
Ah Jiu

104
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:10,771
What's the matter?

105
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,107
Don't scare me

106
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:17,811
Ah Jiu

107
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:30,357
How is it?

108
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,026
Did you diagnose what the problem is?

109
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:37,898
The pulse is weak

110
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,433
Weak and floating without strength

111
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:40,634
It should be

112
00:06:44,573 --> 00:06:46,574
It should be what? Speak up

113
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,177
Deficiency in energy and blood?

114
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:52,313
Look at the Immortal Physician Jiu's complexion, so pale

115
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,280
and the lips

116
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,717
not rosy enough

117
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:58,752
It must be the excessive loss of vital essence

118
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:00,854
that's causing the dizziness and fainting

119
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,222
Oh no

120
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:04,358
Could it be because I've been absorbing

121
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,492
this clueless herbalist's energy night after night

122
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:06,860
and also because he got injured

123
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,329
last night because of me

124
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:10,864
What should we do now?

125
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,000
It's not a big problem

126
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:14,768
I'll go to the kitchen and make some chicken soup

127
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,370
Add some red dates and goji berries

128
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:17,838
He'll recover after some nourishment

129
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,441
Alright, go quickly

130
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:21,775
Hurry up

131
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:24,612
And put that ginseng in it too, will you?

132
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,713
Understood

133
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:33,220
It turns out that after all this time of
the Immortal Physician Jiu treating others

134
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:35,956
now someone is finally worried about him

135
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,796
Clueless herbalist

136
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:45,132
It's all my fault

137
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,268
I won't absorb your energy anymore

138
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,837
I've already become human now

139
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,072
You must get better

140
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,142
Clueless herbalist

141
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:17,464
Don't go

142
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:18,832
Don't go

143
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:22,336
Little Isatis

144
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:35,549
What's wrong with you?

145
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:42,156
Who's there?

146
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:43,023
Who's hiding there?

147
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:43,991
Come out right now

148
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:46,160
You rest a little longer

149
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:47,594
I'll go check it out

150
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,467
I'll be right back

151
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:57,638
Who's there?

152
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,039
Come out now

153
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,907
Who's there?

154
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:00,941
What's going on?

155
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:01,408
Look

156
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:04,144
I was just about to go into the kitchen to make soup

157
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:05,946
and someone with a kitchen knife hid behind there

158
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:07,247
Look, look, look

159
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:08,182
Right there, right there

160
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:08,849
Who's hiding there?

161
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,650
Go check it out

162
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:10,951
I'm not going

163
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:12,786
My frail body can't handle a kitchen knife

164
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:13,887
You go look

165
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,065
Come out right now

166
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:27,668
Why is it a child?

167
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,436
Whose kid are you?

168
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:29,970
No

169
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:31,939
Where are your parents?

170
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,573
Stop it, Bai

171
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,173
Stealing

172
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,007
Stop it

173
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:39,146
Clueless herbalist

174
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:40,781
Why are you up?

175
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:42,149
I'm fine

176
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:44,418
What's going on here?

177
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:46,520
This stinky kid was stealing from the kitchen

178
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:47,821
I caught her red-handed

179
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:54,428
This isn't a kid

180
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,463
This is clearly a girl

181
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,535
I don't know whose poor child this is

182
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:02,636
Look at her

183
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:04,304
She's so dirty

184
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:05,439
Bai

185
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,874
Heat up some water for her to wash

186
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:10,410
Oh, right

187
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,178
Right, Bai

188
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,280
And make some extra chicken soup

189
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:14,548
And more rice too

190
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,251
Looking at her

191
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:19,253
she must have been hungry for a long time

192
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,466
Sister Little Isatis, I'm scared

193
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:34,301
Will you sleep with me?

194
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:43,811
Clueless herbalist

195
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,013
Clueless herbalist

196
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:48,649
Clueless herbalist

197
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,985
I'm hungry

198
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:55,289
I remember

199
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,158
There should be some leftover
chicken soup in the kitchen that Bai left

200
00:10:58,493 --> 00:10:59,459
Go drink it now

201
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:04,731
I mean I'm hungry

202
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:11,672
I don't care

203
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:14,808
Hurry up

204
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:32,593
What are you guys doing?

205
00:11:35,997 --> 00:11:37,798
This isn't something for children to see

206
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:38,899
Go to sleep now

207
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,111
Why are you sitting outside?

208
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:54,948
Are you troubled by something?

209
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:56,850
You seemed distracted

210
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:58,418
during dinner

211
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:01,288
No

212
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:05,058
You're lying

213
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,261
I'm with you every day

214
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,329
I can tell whether you're happy or not

215
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,100
It's just that seeing Ning'er

216
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:14,635
I felt a bit emotional

217
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:16,837
She's been alone

218
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,772
since she was young

219
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,774
and now she's wandering outside

220
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:23,377
Her path ahead

221
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:25,579
will definitely not be easy

222
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:29,149
You might not know

223
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,251
Parents and relatives

224
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:32,653
are the most precious people

225
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,821
in the world to us

226
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,226
So Ah Jiu

227
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:40,894
what about your parents?

228
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:43,230
I don't think I've ever heard you mention them

229
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:51,571
I've been without parents since I was young

230
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,174
On the ninth day of the ninth month

231
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:55,742
I was found in swaddling clothes

232
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:57,511
taken in by an old woman in the mountains

233
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,780
My foster mother

234
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,382
fell seriously ill when I was young

235
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:05,152
So I had to learn medical skills on my own

236
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,389
But in the end, I was still helpless

237
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,298
You must have been very lonely

238
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,702
We spirits may not have parents

239
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,304
but ever since I was young, I was incomplete

240
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,607
Eyes, ears, nose, body, mind, and intentions

241
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,110
I lacked the body

242
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:33,747
I watched as my fellow spirits

243
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:36,116
one by one transformed into
human form and left the mountain

244
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:39,386
Leaving me, a single blade of grass, all alone

245
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,790
However

246
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:45,826
fortunately, I met you

247
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:51,398
Ah Jiu

248
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,368
A relative is someone close to you

249
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,536
So now we're relatives too

250
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:58,972
I want to be like you

251
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,008
study medical skills, heal the sick, save people

252
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,777
With me around

253
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,746
you'll never be alone again

254
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,068
It's snowing

255
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,609
How beautiful

256
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:37,310
Are you

257
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,180
still hungry?

258
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:18,652
Such a powerful spirit

259
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:20,187
Truly unheard of

260
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:22,022
With her spirit alone

261
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,824
she could match all the spirits in the world

262
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:25,892
Lotus spirit

263
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:27,594
What is she doing here?

264
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:30,864
Jiuming

265
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:32,899
Step aside

266
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:34,468
Those with different paths

267
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:35,769
should not seek the same end

268
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:37,504
Heaven

269
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:39,339
is on my side

270
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,208
Ah Jiu

271
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,743
You were once the person I trusted the most

272
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:45,679
Why?

273
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:49,116
Why would you do this to me?
