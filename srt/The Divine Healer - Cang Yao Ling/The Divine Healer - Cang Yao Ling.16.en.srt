[The Divine Healer]

2
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,902
Episode 16

3
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:54,149
[I do]

4
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:58,971
By the mandate of heaven, the Emperor decrees

5
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:01,840
The Mid-Autumn Festival case is ridden with doubts

6
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,842
The Supreme Clarity Division
cannot shirk its responsibility

7
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:04,876
Therefore

8
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:07,379
The case is now transferred to the
Court of Judicial Review for investigation

9
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,383
During this period, the Supreme Clarity Division
must cooperate with the inquiry

10
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:12,551
and will be temporarily closed

11
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:14,586
Respect this

12
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,889
Prince Ye

13
00:01:18,324 --> 00:01:19,391
By imperial command

14
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:20,559
The case remains unsolved

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,527
Please temporarily avoid at your residence

16
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:24,329
Do not leave without a decree

17
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,155
Miss Isatis

18
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:51,423
Please don't get agitated

19
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:53,592
That dumb doctor, that stupid doctor

20
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,460
He snatched my patient without any reason yesterday

21
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:57,763
And he's still not back at this late hour

22
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,365
To think I followed him down the
mountain without a second thought back then

23
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:02,367
And now?

24
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,635
Grown tired, grown weary

25
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:05,570
You men

26
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:06,638
Not one of you is any good

27
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,041
Be careful not to hurt anyone else

28
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:11,310
Our shopkeeper

29
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,345
Is one of the Northest Land's finest men

30
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:14,246
Once he's back

31
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:15,747
You'll understand everything

32
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,749
Miss Isatis, please don't go

33
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,718
This must be a misunderstanding

34
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,585
Just wait for him

35
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:27,726
Miss Isatis

36
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:31,229
Sister Isatis

37
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,564
My grandmother has fallen

38
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:34,466
Please come quickly and see her

39
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:35,834
Ning'er, don't panic

40
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:37,002
I'll come with you right away

41
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:40,806
Sister Isatis, hurry

42
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:43,875
Sister Isatis, this way

43
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:48,880
Wait, Ning'er

44
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:50,148
I seem to remember

45
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:51,516
That your home

46
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:53,085
Isn't in this direction

47
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:55,921
Where are you going?

48
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,152
Little Isatis

49
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,557
That day

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
I promised you

51
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:37,963
That I would marry you

52
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,399
with great fanfare

53
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,768
In the human world, marriage

54
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:44,803
is about a grand and proper ceremony

55
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:46,505
If you truly wish to marry

56
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:48,940
I will spare no detail

57
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:50,942
And marry you with splendor

58
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:55,280
Now

59
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:57,115
The betrothal letters, the wedding gifts

60
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:58,884
And the dowries

61
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:00,952
I have prepared them all

62
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,756
Little Isatis

63
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,592
Do you like to marry me?

64
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:12,931
Yes, I do

65
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,478
Sister Isatis, here is the betrothal letter

66
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,848
Please this bride-to-be press her
handprint on the marriage document

67
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,560
The marriage agreement is set

68
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:16,261
Next

69
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,396
It's time for the groom to
present the betrothal gifts

70
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:26,104
Sister Ganoderma

71
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,306
What are you doing here?

72
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:29,674
Silly

73
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:30,942
You're getting married

74
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,044
Of course, I have to come
and see you with your dowry

75
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:36,381
Little Isatis

76
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,158
Besides the dowry

77
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:49,261
This is all I have

78
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:52,264
From today on

79
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:54,466
Everything I have

80
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:57,302
Including myself

81
00:05:58,905 --> 00:05:59,871
Belongs to you

82
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,478
Next, we should set the date

83
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,747
In three days, the ninth day of this month

84
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:10,315
is auspicious for a wedding

85
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,183
I wonder if the bride-to-be

86
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:13,952
agrees?

87
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:18,290
Good

88
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:19,391
Everything is good

89
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:28,600
Congratulations

90
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,505
Fireworks

91
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,599
Come here

92
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,882
That year, when I first saw her by the lotus pond

93
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,721
She wore this very dress

94
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:02,961
With just a fleeting glance

95
00:08:03,796 --> 00:08:04,863
I knew

96
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:08,433
What it means to emerge from the mud unsoiled

97
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,269
To cleanse in clear ripples

98
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:12,771
[Spirit Lotus]

99
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:13,772
Without being enchanting

100
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:22,947
I knew she was a spirit

101
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:27,118
I didn't care

102
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,824
But if it wasn't for my fight
for that accursed throne

103
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:36,061
She wouldn't have mistakenly drunk the poison

104
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:40,231
And died in my place

105
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:43,101
Lotus

106
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,637
Someone

107
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:49,507
Someone come

108
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:52,310
Someone

109
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,979
Lotus
