[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,740
Take a look around.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,140
It's facing south here.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,420
The traffic is very convenient.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,340
Most importantly, there's no commission.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,300
That's good.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,220
I live next door.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,660
Tell me if you need anything.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,820
What do you think?

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,460
It's good.

11
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,580
But the rent is a bit expensive.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,380
Kid,

13
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,940
this is the cheapest house

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,380
in Hua City Center.

15
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,260
Next year, the tourism industry will be developed here.

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,460
The rent here will double.

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,220
How about here?

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,740
A little cheaper might work.

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,660
This price is fine too.

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,540
Here.

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,980
One month deposit and three months upfront.

22
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,140
You can sign the contract anytime.

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,700
Okay.

24
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,550
[Day Breaker]

25
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,790
[Episode 11]

26
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,060
How long have you been running a tea house?

27
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,500
Five years.

28
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,620
It's been a long time.

29
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,540
What about before?

30
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,170
What did you do before?

31
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,100
I used to

32
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,940
be a drug dealer.

33
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,460
Do it yourself?

34
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,020
With my friend.

35
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,900
Which friend?

36
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,540
His name is Luo Xiang.

37
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,620
You are Su Qingzhu, right?

38
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,620
Yes.

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,579
I saw you at Pala's place.

40
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,180
You know Pala?

41
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,020
Yes.

42
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,620
When we were young,

43
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,620
we risked our lives several times.

44
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,220
From the mahjong parlor on Jinfo Road

45
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,460
to a bar on Kaoshan Road.

46
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,380
Later, we worked together

47
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,540
to take over the car wash shop at Tun Wuli,

48
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,340
the food stall.

49
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,260
We almost monopolized the entire business in Hua City

50
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,500
with less than three years.

51
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,500
Then we separated.

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,980
What caused it?

53
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,019
I hate drugs.

54
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,020
He dealt with drugs.

55
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,700
You should know

56
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,100
what happened next, right?

57
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,380
You put much effort into your business.

58
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,260
You just quit.

59
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,210
Isn't it a pity?

60
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,940
Actually, there's nothing to regret.

61
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,380
As long as you do the right thing,

62
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,020
good products will also boom.

63
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,740
I not only sell tea,

64
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,340
but also do ecological tourism.

65
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,900
The bus you took today

66
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,140
is the exclusive line of the tea garden development.

67
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,100
I'm guessing

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,620
if your business

69
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,660
is a way to hide the truth?

70
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,700
The tea garden you run,

71
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,380
your tourism industry,

72
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,580
could they be used to transport drugs?

73
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,300
That's a good idea.

74
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,660
Speaking of the bus,

75
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,540
Which line is the guide

76
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,700
on the bus from today?

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,060
Sir,

78
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,620
I've checked everything.

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,460
Thank you for the clues.

80
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,659
Why don't you go in

81
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,740
and check it carefully?

82
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,530
Don't make any more mistakes.

83
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,990
We've checked many times.

84
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,820
There's no problem now.

85
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,540
Mr. Song Cai

86
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,620
Thank you for your cooperation.

87
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,180
Thank you.

88
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,900
Didn't you tell me

89
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,620
you have investigated the people who came,

90
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,700
and they are all right?

91
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,620
Uncle Cai,

92
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,700
I'll be careful next time.

93
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,460
People who have been here know that this place

94
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,540
was used to plant poppies.

95
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,940
I shoveled them all when I came here.

96
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,260
Sometimes when I think about it,

97
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,940
I can't even persuade Pala,

98
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,100
let alone strangers.

99
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,500
All I can do is to do my best

100
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,180
to protect this hard-earned land.

101
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,780
Miss,

102
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,860
you gave up doing drugs business and opened a tea house,

103
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,780
it means we are the same kind of people.

104
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,540
It's getting late.

105
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,980
I'll ask my bro to send you back.

106
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,900
Remember,

107
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,490
if you have any questions about tea,

108
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,660
come to me, OK?

109
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,060
Okay, thank you.

110
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,780
No.

111
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,300
I can't go with you.

112
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,940
My girlfriend is still in their hands.

113
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,330
When she was arrested,

114
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,940
tenant's daughter was also arrested.

115
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,820
Don't worry.

116
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,980
I will try my best to save the hostage.

117
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,780
As long as your clues are true,

118
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,940
they will have a great chance to be saved.

119
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,140
Trust me.

120
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,220
Temporary inspections.

121
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,460
Please open the trunk.

122
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,620
Please show me your ID.

123
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,940
You're Officer Liao.

124
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,980
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,980
Thank you.

126
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,420
Mr. Cai has something to tell you.

127
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,860
Let him go.

128
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,700
Where is the lawyer I asked you to bring?

129
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,700
This is my lawyer ID.

130
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,140
[Lawyer ID]

131
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,100
Who are you?

132
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,300
I didn't hire a lawyer.

133
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,420
Swallow this.

134
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,090
Find a place to go to the bathroom in half an hour,

135
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,540
and fix it in a tighter place.

136
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,260
Don't worry.

137
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,900
It'll be over soon.

138
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,580
This is

139
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,420
Uncle Cai's directive.

140
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,540
I won't say anything.

141
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,140
Since I'm here,

142
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,140
it means it's settled.

143
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,820
Add some water for me.

144
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,940
Can you tell Uncle Cai

145
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,220
to give me another chance?

146
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,370
I...

147
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,300
I want to make a call.

148
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:30,930
Sure.

149
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,580
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

150
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,220
Sorry.

151
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,580
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

152
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,720
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

153
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,060
Think again.

154
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,540
Who else can save you?

155
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,020
The person who can save me is dead.

156
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,740
Back then,

157
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,260
I thought the sculpture was broken

158
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,580
I thought it would help us out.

159
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,980
But in the end,

160
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,700
Director Abu still called me to deal with it.

161
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,500
There are four explosions within a month.

162
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,380
There are seven people died in the food market.

163
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,300
How could I explain to Director Abu?

164
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,090
Yes.

165
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,940
I know you're under a lot of pressure at work.

166
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,260
But it's hard for me too.

167
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,330
Journalists call me every day.

168
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,660
I tried my best to delay and hide

169
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,650
as much as I can.

170
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,340
I didn't want to affect you at work.

171
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,500
But it's nonsense.

172
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,860
How's the progress of this case?

173
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,660
This case

174
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,420
is related to the South Asian Gang.

175
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,060

Officer Liao, you're right.

347
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,060
But those who were taken care of by Officer Liao

348
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,700
are not good people.

349
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,020
For example, Da Hui.

350
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,220
He has your support.

351
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,780
Because you support him,

352
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,780
he regards Hua City as a lawless place.

353
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,060
This is a social tumor.

354
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,530
I embarrassed you, Officer Liao.

355
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,420
What do you mean?

356
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,940
Go on.

357
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,370
And that Li Chi.

358
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,180
is your subordinate, right?

359
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,940
I heard he died.

360
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,380
And he died a little strange.

361
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,100
People who know too many secrets

362
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,260
will die eventually.

363
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,580
People who know too many secrets

364
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,580
will not live long.

365
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,300
Fill his glass.

366
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,620
Officer Liao.

367
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,380
I didn't make it up.

368
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,860
It was Lin Zhanxiong

369
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,740
who was killed by Da Hui

370
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,500
told me himself.

371
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,860
Five years ago,

372
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,620
one of the police escorted him out of the city

373
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,300
was Li Chi.

374
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,020
I don't mean anything else.

375
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,380
I just hope you can

376
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,620
do me some favors in the future.

377
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,380
I'm a diligent person.

378
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,780
I'm not afraid of getting dirty or tired.

379
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,980
As long as Officer Liao

380
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,100
can't come out,

381
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,580
Just leave it to Xiao Long.

382
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,020
Anything that South Asian Gang can do,

383
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,420
I can do it too.

384
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,340
Officer Yu.

385
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,770
Which department should I go to to report

386
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,420
police violations?

387
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,580
The investigation committee.

388
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:28,900
Yes.

389
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,020
If you have evidence,

390
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,100
you're welcome to report us to the police.

391
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,380
Take care, officers.

392
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,370
In your opinion,

393
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,940
who should we give the goods to

394
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,730
to play the best role?

395
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,890
It should have been Liang Long.

396
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,860
The two words should have is used very well.

397
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,220
But Liang Long's behavior

398
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,300
is a typical mistake of being smart.

399
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,740
Without this meal,

400
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,900
the goods

401
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,460
should have been in his hands, right?

402
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,700
I had this idea.

403
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
But after the banquet,

404
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,300
I changed my mind.

405
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Some people

406
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,820
think they can control everything

407
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,020
once they know the game rule.

408
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,180
But he never figured out

409
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,970
who set the rule.

410
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,700
After the dinner,

411
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,100
Liao Yongjia won't hand the drugs

412
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,660
to Liang Long.

413
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,300
But Hao asked around,

414
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,660
he didn't submit the drugs.

415
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,100
We ignored one thing.

416
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,050
Think about it.

417
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,140
Why did Liao Yongjia appear

418
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,180
at the dock five years ago?

419
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,780
Kuntuo,

420
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,570
why did he suddenly change the location?

421
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,580
Why were the four police

422
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,260
Liao Yongjia's men?

423
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,900
The rented warehouse

424
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,140
doesn't mean anything.

425
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,900
If we want to know the truth,

426
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,100
we need to get closer.

427
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,780
Let's let Liang Long to focus on Liao Yongjia.

428
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,180
The most important thing now

429
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,140
is to catch Da Hui.

430
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,720
She is looking for you.

431
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,060
Beauty.

432
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,180
Hey, are you fixing the car?

433
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,460
Why are you here?

434
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,780
My friend.

435
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,220
I need you to do something for me.

436
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,620
Sir,

437
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,380
how much is this GPS?

438
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,860
You are Chen Mo’s friend,

439
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,220
so I will give you a cheaper price.

440
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,540
Why did you buy this?

441
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,420
I want to know all Officer Liao's whereabouts.

442
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,340
He's a veteran cop.

443
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,820
He can find any clues even with a strand of hair.

444
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,100
It's too dangerous for you to follow him.

445
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,260
Liang Long is investigating him.

446
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,700
Just keep an eye on Liang Long for me.

447
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,940
As Liang Long's best bro,

448
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,620
it shouldn't be difficult.

449
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,300
How do you know Liang Long is investigating Officer Liao?

450
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,100
Are you stalking me too?

451
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,940
Sir,

452
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,420
this is on him.

453
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,580
No problem.

454
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,420
Tell us about Li Chi.

455
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,340
Li Chi?

456
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,020
Look who sent him to the detox center.

457
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,580
Liao Yongjia.

458
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,140
I also found out

459
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,580
the last person he saw before he died

460
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,140
was Liao Yongjia.

461
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,500
You suspect that

462
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,380
Liao Yongjia arranged Li Chi

463
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,060
to help South Asian Gang steal drugs?

464
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,700
What's the use of suspecting him?

465
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,700
All the clues we found are dead.

466
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,730
Do you remember Lin Zhanxiong's goods?

467
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,540
Of course.

468
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,700
That guy didn't tell me

469
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,660
where the goods were until he died.

470
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,970
The goods should be seized by the police.

471
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,940
How do you know?

472
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,690
I found out one of his men.

473
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,660
He told me

474
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,300
Liao Yongjia had the goods.

475
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,300
Liao Yongjia didn't hand them over.

476
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,780
Is he hiding the stolen goods for another purpose?

477
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:45,940
If Liao Yongjia

478
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,660
is working for the South Asian Gang,

479
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,780
he will return the goods to Da Hui.

480
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,460
You can leave now.

481
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,300
Officer,

482
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,540
have you found my girlfriend

483
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,500
and that little girl?

484
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,660
Don't worry.

485
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,140
We're working on it.

486
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,860
So you haven't found them yet?

487
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,140
If you don't believe us,

488
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,460
you can find a helper yourself.

489
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,180
How can I find a helper?

490
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,140
Find a helper.

491
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,220
Helper.

492
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,660
Helper.

Do you have anything else to add?

499
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,490
You have to help me.

500
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,980
I can only rely on you now.

501
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,739
This silly boy said he had something urgent.

502
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,860
He insisted on finding you.

503
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,889
Didn't Officer Liao take you away?

504
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,929
Listen to me.

505
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,540
My girlfriend is in Da Hui's hands now.

506
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,090
He said he would trade drugs for her.

507
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,659
But now the drugs are gone.

508
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,380
My girlfriend is in danger.

509
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,130
The police are unreliable.

510
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,739
Doesn't Officer Liao help you?

511
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,340
He is just saying.

512
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,739
Can he trade drugs for someone else?

513
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,620
And a little girl was caught too.

514
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,940
That little girl is innocent, right?

515
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,540
What little girl?

516
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,739
My girlfriend is the landlord.

517
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,620
Her tenant's daughter is sick and hospitalized.

518
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,139
My girlfriend took care of her.

519
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,540
But later...

520
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,260
Wait, wait.

521
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,580
Is your girlfriend

522
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,620
called Zhang Xinyao?

523
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,179
How do you know?

524
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:19,740
Hello.

525
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,260
What about that kid and that woman?

526
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,100
Who are you?

527
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,740
I'm asking if the kid and the woman are dead.

528
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,020
They're still alive.

529
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,940
You want the goods, right?

530
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,020
I heard the goods are in the police's hands.

531
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,900
It's 600 kilograms.

532
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,580
Don't worry about that.

533
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,580
Just wait to get the goods.

534
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,490
I look forward to working with you.

535
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,300
Have you made up your mind?

536
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,540
You want to stop me?

537
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,130
I understand what you're doing now.

538
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,500
Thank you.

539
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,780
Officer Liao,

540
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,580
my daughter was caught by Da Hui.

541
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,220
Tai's drugs

542
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,580
hasn't been submitted yet?

543
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,620
Don't worry.

544
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,060
Trust the police.

545
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,460
They will save her.

546
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,900
I don't trust anyone now.

547
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,020
Only those drugs can save my daughter.

548
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,340
Officer Liao, I beg you.

549
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,100
Can you give me the drugs?

550
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,740
600 kilograms of heroin.

551
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,420
You want me to give it to Da Hui?

552
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,740
You're forcing me to make mistakes with you.

553
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,100
Officer Liao,

554
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,740
you will save my daughter.

555
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,980
I beg you.

556
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,540
You should know what you are doing.

557
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,500
Take the goods with you.

558
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,660
I'll follow you.

559
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,740
I've brought everything you want.

560
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,100
As promised,

561
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,380
Let them go.

562
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,580
You can leave now.

563
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,100
Why aren't you leaving?

564
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,220
Do you think all deals

565
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,460
are simple and direct transaction?

566
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,060
So cliche.

567
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,530
Hui,

568
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,580
don't we need to check the goods?

569
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,890
Mr. Cai has checked it for us.
