86

I had a chance to verify it.

87

Liao Yongjia asked me to take Liang Long to examine the cargo.

88

But when I got to the warehouse,

89
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,660
I found the cargo had been replaced.

90
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,340
That means I'll never have a chance to verify

91
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,060
if the cargo belongs to Kuntuo.

92
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,140
Who did it?

93
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,610
Yu Shenghai.

94
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,100

95
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,580
we should have him under control.

96
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,620
Enough.

97
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,420
What's the point of saying this now?

98
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,810

105

In order to help me get close to Liang Long more easily,

106
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,570
Liao Yongjia got her involved.

107
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Should we tell her the truth?

108
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,540
No.

109
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,500
I can't take the risk.

110
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,940
She's already lost me once.

111
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,300
I can't let it happen again.

112
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,940
You replaced it, right?

113
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,300
Chen Mo is a coward.

114
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,020
In such a dangerous situation,

115
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,660
he didn't give the cargo to Liang Long.

116
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,460
It doesn't make sense.

117
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,940
Yes, I did it.

118
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
As a police officer,

119
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,010
my instinct tells me

120
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,460
I can't give it to drug dealers.

121
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,380
So where is it?

122
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,580
I burned it.

123
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,620
Why didn't you discuss with me first?

124
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,380
Because you burned it,

125
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,740
many people will die.

126
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,900
All I know is that if that thing goes into the market,

127
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,180
more people will die.

128

Let me tell you.

145

We don't have 100 kilograms at all.

146

Are you crazy too?

149
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,140
If I didn't say that,

150
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,220
you wouldn't have focused on taking Liang Long to the warehouse.

151
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,860
You're an informant now.

152
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,250
I can't tell you everything that is

153
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,180

154
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,770
in advance.

155
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,500
Sometimes you need to be flexible.

156
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,450
But I believe in your ability.

157
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,940
And I don't think Liang Long will kill you today.

158
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,980
You think he won't kill me, so he won't do it?

159
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,300
He's a drug user.

160
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,660
He's crazy! Crazy!

161
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,660
A person who can replace Pala as a druglord

162
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,060
must have a ruler in his heart.

163
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,100
And that ruler can measure

164
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,660
everything he does.

165
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,740
Don't look down on him.

166
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,700
His rudeness, impulsion,

167
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,810
cruelty, and irritation

168
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,490
are all faked on purpose.

169
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,420
Indeed,

170
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,260
the cargo is very important to him.

171
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,220
But it's not as important as one thing.

172
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,220
In fact, he needs a trader.

173
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,220
The previous trader was not good.

174
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,460
In the future,

175
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,540
I hope that person will be you.

176
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,940
Every time you give me perfect analyses.

177
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,700
I think you are playing tricks with me.

178

And we've removed Sang Bo.

190
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,540
But there's one more thing

191
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,460
we need to do.

192
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,180
Chen Mo,

193
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,020
now you have to make Liang Long happy

194
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,740
as compensation for the lost cargo.

195
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,820
You have to prove your value to Liang Long.

196
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,340
Do as we say.

197
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,420
Make Liang Long's cargo all over the market in Hua City.

198
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,340
What do you think?

199
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,420
I want Liang Long to capture more market share

200
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,740
and become a threat to Da Hui.

201

I wasn't helping you.

is a police informant.

He chose to cooperate with the police

313
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,860
and gave out the information on the source of our cargo.

319
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,570

320
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,700
before the police can find out anything,

321
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,660
we should transfer the cargo left by Kuntuo

to Mr. Cai as soon as possible.

323

As for how to deal with the cargo,

324
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,780

Yes.

329
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,660

330
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,140
just because of Liang Long.

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,900
-Yes. -Right.

333
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,820

against us,

339
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,420
this really

340
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,740

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,220
and hid them in different places.

349
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,020
Now you all have a card.

350
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,100
Each card

351
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,140
shows a specific location.

352
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,700
I'll give you one day.

353
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,100
Go find the cargo.

354
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,530
I want to see all of it

355
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,700
on this table tomorrow afternoon.

356
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Let me introduce.

357
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,060
Da Hui's man.

358
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,050
Monkey.

359
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,580
A successful drug network

360
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,900
consists of four procedures: collecting, purchasing, transporting and selling.

361
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,140
But your presence gave me new inspiration.

362
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,460
Add another procedure in the middle.

363
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:29,970
Robbing.

364
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,260
You plan to rob them of their cargo?

365
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,530
Long!

366
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,020
Long, put me down!

367
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,380
Long.

368
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,340
Hello, have you decided?

369
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,580
The slaughterhouse.

370
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,180
It's near Dong'an, Lianggong River.

371
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,170
Are you sure?

372
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,900
Yes.

373
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,620
Put me down, Long.

374
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,100
Put me down!

375
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,660
Okay.

376
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,780
In order to get the cargo successfully tomorrow,

377
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,980
I had to do it.

378
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,100
Xiang.

379
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,620
Don't feel too burdened.

380
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,500
This kid must be one of the South Asian Gang.

381
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,740
Manager, you want to see me?

382
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,220
Have a seat.

383
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,820
Here's the thing.

384
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,820
About the new building's

385
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,180
insurance business,

386
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
I think you should put it aside.

387
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,380
I spent a lot of effort

388
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,660
in order to meet Mr. Jiang.

389
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,700
I know

390
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,020
this decision is unfair to you.

391
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,220
But Mr. Jiang said he wants to

392
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,620
talk with Fangfang.

393
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,620
For the sake of the company,

394
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,220
think about it.

395
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,900
Manager,

396
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,460
I really need money.

397
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,060
I really need this order.

398
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,060
I know you've been working hard.

399
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,940
You're the best in the business.

400
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,660
But the most important thing

401
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,740
in the insurance industry

402
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,020
is to gain clients' trust.

403
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,420
You don't spend money on yourself.

404
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,620
Just like Fangfang,

405
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,700
you should spend money on

406
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,780
your appearance and style.

407
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,380
Then you can gain clients' trust.

408
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,660
Come on. Come on.

409
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,580
Fang.

410
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,660
How do you know Mr. Jiang?

411
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,620
Let me ask you something.

412
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,330
Go ahead.

413
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,180
How much did you pay for this bag?

414
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,660
It's not expensive.

415
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,580
Two thousand euros.

416
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,140
Okay, go ahead.

417
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,620
Have some water.

418
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,060
We need to find evidence

419
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,900
of Lin Zhanxiong and Da Hui smuggling drugs tonight.

420
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,420
Officer Liao has arranged a checkpoint to stop them.

421
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,660
Why did Liao Yongjia

422
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,460
ask you to do this?

423
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,260
You're very important to his plan.

424
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,170
He's worried something may happen to you.

425
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,020
We can just follow orders.

426
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,060
What's your relationship with him?

427
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,220
Why are you helping him?

428
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,500
I'm not helping him.

429
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,140
I'm helping you.

430
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,860
Hui.

431
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,900
We can go now.

432
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:29,940
Let's go.

433
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,530
I want to report a car

434
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,820
smuggling pork.

435
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,180
It just passed the PR9 toll station.

436
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,500
The license plate number is 2A0388.

437
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,060
Damn.

438
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,700
No signal.

439
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,140
We need to find a way to inform Officer Liao.

440
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,250
Open the gate.

441
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,300
Please show me your transport license.

442
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,420
Quarantine certificate.

443
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,660
This is your ticket.

444
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,940
Our contact information is on it.

445
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,500
We will confiscate and destroy

446
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,660
the cargo you are transporting.

447
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,460
If you have any objections,

448
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,820
please go to the border quarantine center

449
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,140
and contact my colleagues.

450
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,219
ID.

451
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,140
I'll deliver it to Mr. Cai right away.

452
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,980
No need.

453
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,980
There's nothing inside.

454
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,340
I'm just doing a small experiment.

455
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,020
The real cargo will be sent to him

456
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,140
in the same way as soon as possible.

457
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,580
Got it?

458
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,820
I'll go back

459
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,140
tomorrow morning.

460
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,900
What about your wound?

461
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,460
This is for you.

462
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,340
Keep it.

463
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,820
I can't take this.

464
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,420
I can't take this.

465
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,380
What are you going to do when you go back?

466
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,650
I have something important

467
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,660
to do.

468
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:50,040
[Name: Chen Mo]
