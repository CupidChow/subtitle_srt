20
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,140
It turns out to be Officer Liao.

21
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,860
I suspect you are

22
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,900
doing illegal things on this ship.

Officer Liao.

25
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,900
As we all know,

26
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,180
this is not the sea of Hua City.

27
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,700
So the police of Hua City

28
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,820
has no right to investigate.

29
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,300
If Officer Liao

30
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,020
must fulfill your duty as a police officer,

Why is Da Hui's man here?

34
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,300
I don't know.

35
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,540
There are many reasons

36
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,220
for them to kill someone.

37
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,659
Not one.

38
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,860
It's seven lives.

39
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,740
In the world of drug dealers,

40
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,940
they are only seven tools.

41
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,420
Even if Da Hui doesn't kill them today,

42
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,220
they will end up the same.

43
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,940
I finally understand

44
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,460
why you hate drug dealers so much.

45
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,340
I don't hate them.

46
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,820
Hate means I have feelings for them.

47
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,740
I don't have feelings for them.

48
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,660
Just like cockroaches.

49
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,820
It'd be best if there's no such thing.

50
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,940
I'll go back to Liang Long's

51
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,580
to help you get rid of them.

52
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,140
By the way,

the situation here is the same as five years ago?

62
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,020
Nothing has changed.

63
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,380
You are not comfortable seeing how arrogant those drug dealers are.

64
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,610
Me neither.

65
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,100
Just like us police,

66
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,740
we can do nothing to them.

67
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,460
But we can't act rashly

68
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,060
just because we don't like them.

69
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,740
Did you know it on the ship?

70
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,220
Why didn't you catch Da Hui?

71
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,860
Do you have a lot of bullets?

72
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,060
Or many guns?

73
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,250
Or you want to risk your life?

74
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,060
Did you see

75
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,820
the bullet holes on the cargo of the ship?

76
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,900
Those belong to bullets with 5.6 mm caliber.

77

Assault rifle.

78
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,810
What gun are you holding?

79
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,300
You can shoot the first shot

80
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,500
but you can't shoot the second time.

81
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Are you scared?

82
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,690
Yes, I am.

83
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,820
What I fear the most is to watch the police

84
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,050
die under the gun of the drug dealers.

85
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,700
Then cracking down on drug trafficking became empty talk.

86
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,180
The life of the police counts,

87
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,340
and Lin Zhanxiong and others' lives don't count?

This is a city with cancer.

89
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,420
What we need is to do chemotherapy for it.

90
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,420
If we do the chemotherapy, we can

91
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,540
kill all the cancer cells.

92
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,380
But you need to be prepared.

93
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:40,060

96
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,860
I asked Dai Wei to check the bodies on the beach.

97
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,020
So thick and disgusting.

98
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,539
I know you didn't kill the one.

99
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,179

102
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,460

103
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,020

Lin Zhanxiong confessed to me.

109
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,860
Four policemen were transporting drugs for him.

110
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,300
One of them was addicted to drugs.

That South Asian Gang smuggled the drugs of Kuntuo

113
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,860
must be related to the police.

114
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,620
If we win over the backers of South Asian Gang,

115
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,460
we'll be smooth on both sides.

116

The police and Da Hui are watching us.

117
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,250
We'd better split up

118
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,900
in case we face enemies from both sides.

119

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,620
How can I continue this plan then?

177
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,940
Besides, you said

178
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,300
you wanted to leave for a while.

179
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,740
Now this is the time.

180
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,220
But don't worry.

181
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,260
I will arrange

182
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,580
to send you and your daughter abroad.

183
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,460
Officer Liao,

184
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,860
you're a little strange.

185
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,940
When I wanted to quit,

186
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,140
you forced me to do it.

187
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,940
We've done so many things now.

188
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,420
How can I quit?

189
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,100
What should I do?

190
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,780
Let's cooperate well.

191
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,580
Good luck.

192
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,380
You're discharged today.

193
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,140
I'll make an exception for you to have a sip of cola.

194
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,060
Thank you.

195
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,860
Wait.

196
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,980
Don't leave any evidence to my dad.

197
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,500
Okay.

198
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,220
Actually,

199
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,300
you look sweet when you smile.

200
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,100
You suit my dad.

201
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,900
I have a boyfriend.

202
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,770
[Lin Tai]

203
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,700
Look.

204
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,380
Speaking of him, he is calling.

205
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,340
Hello?

206
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,500
How is it?

207
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
I've figured it out.

208
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,780
I'm not selling it.

209
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,300
In the past, I always thought when I had money,

210
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,940
everything would be solved.

211
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,140
Now I realize

212
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,970
what I've been pursuing

213
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,140
is right in front of me.

214
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,500
What do you mean?

215
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,330
It makes me nervous.

216
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,010
Come home with me this weekend.

217
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,620
You, I and my dad,

218
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,300
have a meal together

219
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
and get closer.

220
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,210
What?

221
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,940
You don't want to?

222
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,140
What about this car?

223
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,060
Isn't the car key in the envelope?

224
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,540
When you meet my dad,

225
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,620
you can just return it in secret.

226
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,380
A gift?

227
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,300
You can think so too.

228
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,780
Tai,

229
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,500
if you really want to get closer with your dad,

230
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,420
just apologize to him.

231
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,210
He will forgive you.

232
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,500
After all, he is the closest to you.

233
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,380
Trust me. I mean it.

234
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,940
Really.

235
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,220
My dad.

236
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,850
Could he find out?

237
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,620
Don't worry. Answer it.

238
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,220
Dad, I have...

239
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,660
This is Hua City Police Department.

240
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,060
I'm sorry to inform you

241
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,300
your father died in an accident.

242
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,740
If you're sure it's your father,

243
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,930
please sign here.

244
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,300
Besides,

245
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,260
no one recognizes the other six bodies.

246
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,780
If you know them,

247
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,460
please inform their family.

248
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,460
Dad.

249
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,220
Why are you so selfish?

250
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
If you go to find Dashun,

251
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,460
what should I do?

252
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,260
What should I do without you?

253
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,140
Please get up

254
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,380
and scold me.

255
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,140
Dad.

256
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,420
According to my sources,

257
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,180
this car appeared at a gas station

258
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,900
of north of No. 73 national highway.

259
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,380
There was nothing in the car.

260
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,260
But the key is the driver.

261
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,020
He may be the only witness

262
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,020
in this case.

263
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,260
Okay.

264
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,210
Tell me if you have any news.

265
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,980
Before your father died,

266
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,970
he was with a group of drug dealers.

267
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,820
The leader is called Luo Xiang.

268
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,940
What’s wrong?

269
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,420
Nothing.

270
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,090
Are you done?

271
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,180
We've read your report.

272
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,220
Since you quit drugs voluntarily,

273
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,940
and you are determined,

274
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,740
we will focus on psychotherapy.

275
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
Cut the crap.

276
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,940
Money is not a problem.

277
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,260
Show me your best plan.

278
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,020
I'm going to say goodbye to drugs

279
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,380
within the shortest time.

280
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,740
I heard that Professor Luo here is very good.

281
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,570
The success rate of rehabilitation is 100%.

282
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,180
We can help you contact him.

283
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,380
If

284
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,820
you can accept his rehabilitation plan,

285
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,620
we'll arrange a consultation for you as soon as possible.

286
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,500
Hurry!

287
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,820
Stop!

288
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,490
What are you doing?

289
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,420
A week ago, there was an activity in the bathhouse.

290
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,580
Top No. 4 Heroin buy one and get one free.

291
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,890
So we invested and gave the money to Liang Long

292
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,100
and got this.

293
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,580
And the goods cannot be delivered.

294
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,740
The bathhouse was closed down.

295
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,980
And now Luo Xiang is missing.

296
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,980
We have no choice but to come here to collect debts.

297
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,220
Liang Long took the money.

298
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,020
Liang Long sent the coupons.

299
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,940
What does it have to do with Luo Xiang?

300
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,260
Everyone outside knows

301
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,180
Luo Xiang is the person in charge.

302
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,260
Got it.

303
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,860
It turns out that you are stupid

304
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,100
and were tricked.

305
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,020
Cut the crap.

306
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,820
Give me Luo Xiang,

307
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,090
or don't blame me for being rude.

308
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,980
Smash it!

309
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,860
Run! Run!

310
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,900
It's not proper for me

311
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,890
to get involved in this matter.

312
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,140
You're the most suitable person to deal with it.

313
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,940
Are you really going to send him away?

314
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,500
It's not me asking him to leave.

315
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,940
I just agreed to his request

316
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,490
at the right time.

317
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,460
What about your action?

318
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,940
I just terminated the contract unilaterally.

319
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,690
The operation of Dark Night Project will continue.

320
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,090
You don’t care about the action,

321
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,500
but Luo Xiang.

322
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,740
Only if the operation continues,

323
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
Chen Mo can continue to play Luo Xiang.

324
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,860
You can find the shadow of yourself

325
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,260
on Chen Mo,

326
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,780
right?

327
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,980
I advise you to get out of the past as soon as possible.

328
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,930
Chen Mo is Chen Mo.

329
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,140
Luo Xiang is Luo Xiang.

330
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,900
Luo Xiang is dead.

331
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,980
Your projecting Luo Xiang to Chen Mo

332
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,180
is unfair to Chen Mo.

333
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,020
It’s also a lot of pressure for yourself.

334
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,900
You are right.

335
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,210
Chen Mo

336
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,370
should have his new life.

337
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,700
Don't worry about the bail.

338
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,500
I've arranged everything.

339
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,500
But our identities

340
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,340
are a little sensitive.

341
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,860
So I can't transfer the money to you directly.

342
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,940
Find someone

343
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,060
according to the address here

344
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,340
to get a black card

345
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,420
and give me the account number.

346
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,060
I'll transfer the money here.

347
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,020
After he comes out,

348

what are you talking about?

407
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,700
He hasn't contacted for days

408
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,820
and you are not worried.

409
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,420
He hasn't contacted us for so many days.

410
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,020
It is abnormal.

411
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,780
But it doesn't mean something happened to him.

412
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,050
Xiang is a steady person.

413
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,540
I believe he'll be fine.

414
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,900
Calm down.

415
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,780
We didn't find him in the tea house or the safe house.

416
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,300
He must be in the bathhouse.

417
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,060
He must be in the bathhouse and so what?

418
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,770
You go to the bathhouse with a gun

419
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,450
and shoot who?

420
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,700
We have to figure something out.

421
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,820
I'm thinking of a way.

422
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,300
Hello?

423
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,980
Yes, I am.

424
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,060
OK.

425
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,180
OK.

426
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,300
Yes, sir.

427
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,860
Well done.

428
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,980
In a few days,

429
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,940
Liang Long and Liao Yongjia

430
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,620

431
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,900
Impressive.

432
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,540
Not at all.

433
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,620
Liang Long is going to retire.

434
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,340
Enough.

435
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,580
I know your style.

436
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,940
The trick you played with Liang Long,

437
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,540
Liao Yongjia doesn't know.

438
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,130
Of course I know.

439
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,740
By the way,

440
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,780
let's get you out of here first.

441
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,860
Liao Yongjia doesn't care about you anymore.

442
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,380
I have to get you out of here.

443
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,060
No need.

444
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,860
Why?

445
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,020
Liao Yongjia is not simple.

446
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,140
I used Lin Zhanxiong's dirty cop case

447
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,020
to test him in the past.

448
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,060
As you can see,

449
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,060
he terminated the Dark Night Project right away.

450
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,900
He's afraid that I would find out something.

451
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,180
Shall we ask Ji

452
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,700
to deploy resources to investigate further?

453
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,020
No need.

454
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,970
The most important thing now

455
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,900
is to find out the drug as soon as possible.

456
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,540
I heard Liao Yongjia is also looking for it.

457
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,940
That's what I'm most worried about.

458
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,660
If Liao Yongjia finds it,

459
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,930
in order to complete the mission,

460
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,380
he will definitely give it to Liang Long.

461
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,380
The amount of this batch of drugs is too big.

462
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,860
We can't let it go into the market.

463
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,460
You locked yourself here

464
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,380
to get away from Liao Yongjia.

465
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,380
But you can't do anything now.

466
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,660
How can you search for it?

467
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,660
Do you remember Captain Ji

468
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,530
gave us an investigation report?

469
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,860
It mentioned Lin Zhanxiong has a son.

470
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,580
I saw the car

471
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,060
in Liang Long's CCTV yesterday.

472
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,380
The one in the car and his son

473
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,500
look very similar.

474
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,020
Lin Tai.

475
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,940
Why did he steal drugs?

476
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,540
Time's up.

477
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,980
You always make trouble.

478
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,540
The password is behind the card.

479
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,660
Can I change the password?

480
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,860
No.

481
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,850
Why not?

482
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,220
Because changing the password

483
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,340
requires the identity card of the original owner.

484
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,220
I can't even find him.

485
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,740
Is it safe for me to save money in it?

486
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,940
No problem.

487
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,860
The owner doesn't even know

488
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,300
he had this card.

489
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,380
Even if he knows

490
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,980
I have the USB key here,

491
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,300
he can't take it out.

492
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,380
What about you?

493
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,500
I...

494
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,570
If I don't know the rules,

495
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,780
how could the government officials and police

496
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,500
not worry and

497
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,740
apply for cards from me?

498
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,580
Don't question me anymore.

499
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,740
In Hua City,

500
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,450
there is no one more professional than me.

501
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,260
Even if you do it elsewhere,

502
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,260
it'll be done by me in the end.

503
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,100
Is the guy you just mentioned

504
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,740
Lin Tai, Lin Zhanxiong's son?

505
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,220
I have a friend

506
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,860
who also lent a lot of money to Lin Tai

507
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,090
and couldn't get it back.

508
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,450
If you can find him,

509
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,900
maybe my friend will give you

510
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,900
a great reward.

511
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,540
Really?

512
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Of course.

513
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,460
I've known my friend for many years.

514
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,220
If you can find him,

515
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,020
you will definitely be rewarded greatly.

516
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,220
Shouldn't you give us some clues?

517
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,740
