Okay.

Don't worry. You go register first.

Name?

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,290
-Chen A'xi. Five years old. -Sorry, Sir. Health insurance will not fully cover the treatment

Hand me your card.

Besides this one,

18
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,580
the patient has been taken imported drugs,

19

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,340
Thank you.

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,660
Doctor, how is she?

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,620
Your child is in serious condition.

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,820
She needs to be hospitalized for observation.

Liao,

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,020
what are you thinking about?

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,980
Do you think in this world,

27
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,940
two people can look exactly the same?

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,700
I remember

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,100
when we met 20 years ago,

30
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,539
you said the same thing to me.

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,620
Really? I did not.

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,900
You don't remember?

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,780
No.

34
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,820
You said

35
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,220
that I looked like your late girlfriend.

36
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,740
So you had to get to know me.

37
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,100
You worried that I would think you were a con man.

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,340
And you insisted that I went home with you to look at her photos.

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,460
I was so scared.

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,820
I thought I met a pervert

41
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,220
and said I was gonna call the police.

42
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,940
And then you showed your ID,

43
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,580
saying you were the police.

44
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,060
Yes, I did.

45
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,180
Then you said that there were good polices and bad polices.

46
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,780
Well, you took 20 years to prove

47
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,500
that you are a good one.

Where are the drugs that were in the car?

51
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,260
I will find another way to give them to him.

52
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,970
Don't do anything stupid.

53
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,650
He is still holding my girlfriend hostage.

54
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,580
Don't worry.

55
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,820
I know people like Da Hui.

56
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,900
No one can leave

57
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,380

58
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,540
How...How about me?

59
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,060
Follow the plan.

60
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,820
I will protect you.

61
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,260

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,820
Okay.

64
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,940
Let's go.

65
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,820
Watch carefully.

66
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,500
As soon as Liao Yongjia shows up,

67
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,100
you record everything for me.

68
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
I've got this, Long.

69
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,580
I've brought all the things you want.

70
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,260
You let them go, as agreed.

71
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,420
You can go now.

72
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,980
Why aren't you going?

73
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,100
Do you think that cash on delivery

74
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,420
works for all deals?

75
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,980
So tedious.

76
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,300
Hui,

77
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,409
we don't need to examine the products?

78
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,820
Mr. Cai has done it for us.

79
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,620
What kind of deal is this?

80
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,140
No one is gonna shoot?

81
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,970
Something fishy is going on.

82
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,610
Fire the gun!

83
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,820
Force Liao Yongjia out!

84
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,580
Who should I shoot?

85
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,420

Get up!

92

You staged an ambush on me, did you?

93
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,780

No products.

107
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,180
You're playing a trick on me, aren't you?

108
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,060
I've got what you want.

109

Why did you get into this mess?

117
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,420
Didn't we agree to grab the foxtail?

118
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,210
They kidnapped my daughter.

119
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,020
How come you have a daughter already?

120
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,900
Can you ask me again after I get her out of here?

121
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,300
Da Hui,

122
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,060
you are dead.

123
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,660
You dare to hurt my brother's people.

124
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,340
That's none of my business.

125
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,540
You're still holding a gun.

126
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,130
I'm filming this. Are you still denying it?

127
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,860
Do you really have the products?

128
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,620
I still can't do this.

129
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,540
What do you mean?

130
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,090
Liang Long's assumptions about me are right.

131
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,570
I do hold some secrets related to the South Asian Gang.

132
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,260
Yeas ago, my subordinates took

133
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,100
bribes from Cai Zhiming,

134
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,180
and gave him that batch of drugs.

135
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,620
I've been helping them to hide it.

136
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,860
They are my brothers who risked their lives with me.

137
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,410
I want to give them a chance,

138
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
but I also don't want to damage the reputation

139
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,420
of the police force by doing this.

140
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,100
Officer Liao, right now

141
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,340
I don't want to listen to your story.

142
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,180
I only want to save my daughter.

143
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,260
Then you must work with me

144
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,610
and use my strategy to save your daughter.

145
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
What is your strategy?

146
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,850
You need to use the identity of Luo Xiang

147
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,500
to prolong the dealing process.

148
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,660
So the police can save the hostages

149
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,060
and arrest Da Hui.

150
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,620

During the chaos, the gas barrel was hit

347
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,820
and exploded.

348
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,340
We jumped into the river and got separated.

349
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,900
Officer Liao,

350
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,340
you're not suspecting me of killing Da Hui, are you?

351
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,980
What do you want to talk about?

352
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,700
This is a bullet from a MSG90 sniper rifle.

353
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,980
It shouldn't be seen in Hua City.

354
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,860
I found it at the crime scene.

355
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,860
You have that rifle now, don't you?

356
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,740
Are you suspecting me?

357
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,260
No, I'm not.

358
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,340
I heard a rumor that some cop

359
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,820
took a bribe when Kuntuo and Pala

360
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,090
were making the deal.

361
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,410
I suspect there is a mole

362
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
in the police force as well.

363
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,300
If there is not,

364
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,580
Kuntuo wouldn't be able to escape

365
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,300
under the circumstances.

366
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,810
He must have gotten some help from the police.

367
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,900
I think Luo Xiang's death

368
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,180
has something to do with this too.

369
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,660
So all the officers at the scene then

370
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,580
are suspects.

371
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,620
That's why I started the Dark Night Project.

372
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,220
Since you distrust me this much,

373
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,020
I'll go back and bring you all the reports.

374
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,410
You handle it yourself, okay?

375
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,940
Your work is finished, right?

376
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,060
But we haven't found the killer.

377
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,420
Maybe it's Liang Long. Maybe it's Tai.

378
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,860
Or it could be anyone related to drugs.

379
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,300
Our goal is to eliminate drugs.

380
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,060
Let other departments figure out

381
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,180
who the killer is.

382
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,740
But there is only one truth.

383
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,900
The person who said that to you

384
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,580
must have never lived in Hua City.

385
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,780
This case is closed.

[Investigations Room]

387
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,700
How's the investigation?

388
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,580
The informant payment you received is from his personal assets.

389
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,860
A policeman who is retiring

390
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,300
can spend 2 million

391
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,780
without even blinking an eye?

392
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,980
Three years ago,

393
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,900
Liao Yongjia sold his house

394
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,460
in order to get treatment for his wife.

395
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,610
It has nothing to do with those four policemen.

396
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,260
So

397
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,980
what he told me is true.

398
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,020
After the abandoned shipyard case,

399
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,500
Liao Yongjia has become very cautious.

400
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,530
He seems to know that someone is investigating him.

401
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,940
I have talked to the superiors

402
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,300
about him.

403
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,530
Ji will send someone

404
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,340
to investigate from some different angles.

405

Lu,

406
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,580
I think the more cautious he gets,

407
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,060
the more complicated this case is.

408
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,540
Unfortunately, Da Hui is dead.

409
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,180
We can't get more clues from this.

410
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,260
What's Tai's situation?

411
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,500
I checked his gun and the bullets.

412
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,100
His alibi is solid.

413
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,860
He's not the killer of Da Hui, most likely.

414
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,410
Hua City Police Department also agrees.

415
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,290
We can't find any clue

416
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,700
from such a big case.

417
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,900
It seems from now on,

418
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,460
we need to start with Song Cai.

419
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,540
Song Cai?

420
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,020
What Da Hui said on the boat

421
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
made me realized Song Cai

is involved in this.

from Pala.

425
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,060
I think after Da Hui died,

426

he will slowly come in sight.
