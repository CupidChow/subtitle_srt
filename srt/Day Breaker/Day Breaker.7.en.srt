it wasn't an ordinary car accident,

He's not a drug dealer,

122
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,980
but he has a deep relationship with drug dealers.

123
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,890
So knowing that he is involved in

124

125

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,620
His name is Chen Mo.

176
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,020
My name is Chen A'xi.

177
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,930
I've been calling him that for years.

178
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,540
You can ask two more questions.

179
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,860
Xi.

180
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,690
What's your mom's name?

181
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,580
I don't have a mother.

182
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,940
Well,

183
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,340
has your dad ever mentioned

184
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,380
your mom at home?

185
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,540
For example, what does she look like?

186
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,250
Where does she live?

187
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,100
She...

188
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,450
Has he?

189
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,580
They're considered as one question.

190
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,540
My dad said she had a sweet smile,

191
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,380
but she usually didn't smile.

192
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,260
Next question.

193
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,940
Xi.

194
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,620
do you think your dad

195
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,460
has been weird recently?

196
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,140
Xi.

197
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,140
Take it out.

198
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,700
This lady bought it for me.

199
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,140
Who are you?

200
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,420
I...

201
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,020
I am...

202
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,740
Xi is different

203
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,490
from other kids in terms of health condition.

204
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,220
If you let her drink Coke,

205
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
the phosphorus content will exceed the standard immediately.

206
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,140
You're not being nice to her,

207
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,140
but harming her.

208
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,420
Don't you know she has just had surgery?

209
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
No, I don't.

210
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,050
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,980
I really didn't know

212
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,180
she had just had surgery.

213
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,780
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,820
Who on earth are you?

215
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,820
I'm a friend of her father's.

216
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,620
I came to see her today.

217
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,700
It seems you need to talk to each other.

218
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,860
I'm leaving.

219
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,820
Bye, Xi.

220
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,300
I made your favorite fish.

221
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,460
Have a taste today to see if it's good.

222
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,940
I've eaten.

223
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,180
This is your favorite fish.

224
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,420
Don't you want to taste it?

225
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,500
That lady bought me food.

226
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,220
I've asked the best fighter to come.

227
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,220
I'll ask David to take the same car with you.

228
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,980
He may look innocent,

229
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,620
but he's more fierce than we used to be.

230
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,460
He's quite strong.

231
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,700
Everything is ready.

232
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,540
We'll destroy

233
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,620
Lin Zhanxiong's den completely.

234
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,460
As long as we get the goods,

235
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,340
we'll have the final say in Hua City's market.

236
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,060
Pick one you like.

237
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,860
This gun has not been used for a long time.

238
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,820
It's rusty.

239
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,340
But it's more than enough to deal with

240
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,620
those several butchers.

241
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,140
Since the gun is rusty,

242
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,820
put it away.

243
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,980
What will I use if I put it away?

244
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,940
Long.

245
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,890
Someone is looking for trouble.

246
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,820
There are some problems.

247
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,860
I'll leave after I finish.

248
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,620
Who is in charge here?

249
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,460
Me!

250
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,220
It's me.

251
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,380
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,420
It's him.

253
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,260
What is it?

254
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,500
Here's the thing.

255
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,900
Someone called us

256
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,820
and said he got allergic

257
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,060
after taking a bath here.

258
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,740
So I was assigned by the Resource Protection Department

259
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,580
to check the water quality here.

260
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,580
Did his brain get allergic?

261
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,060
Over there.

262
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,460
I checked it.

263
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,060
The ammonia content is slightly higher.

264
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,100
But it's normal.

265
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,980
It's okay.

266
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,620
It's the same with other bathhouses.

267
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,140
Apart from the high ammonia content,

268
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,580
is there any other problem?

269
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,580
The bacterial index isn't good, either.

270
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,180
What bacteria? What index?

271
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,890
Speak louder.

272
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,940
The bacteria index you mentioned doesn't meet the standard.

273
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,660
What exactly is the problem?

274
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,540
It's mainly about the filter.

275
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,579
I've just bought it.

276
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,420
What's the problem?

277
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,460
How about this?

278
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,780
Check it again.

279
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
If there is a problem,

280
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
we'll change it right away.

281
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,210
Okay.

282
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,020
I'll check it in another way.

283
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,140
How is it?

284
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,140
As you've used a new filter,

285
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,100
the water is more alkaline,

286
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,020
which influences the disinfection effect of

287
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,860
chlorine disinfectant.

288
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,460
I think you need to close down for some days.

289
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,380
Leave this here.

290
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,900
Okay. Okay.

291
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,540
You reported it?

292
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,300
Why are you ruining

293
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,260
our business like this?

294
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,900
You'll know later.

295
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,180
I want to know now.

296
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:12,910
[Notice of Closing]

297
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,220
Basically, they all meet the standard,

298
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,460
except for the slight excess of ammonia content.

299
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,140
But that's normal.

300
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,810
Can we think like this?

301
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,900
It's not our problem.

302
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,020
It's caused by the customer because of other reasons.

303
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,100
Could it be a coincidence?

304
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,020
Because similar cases happened before.

305
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,140
Many customers

306
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,620
met the same problem simultaneously this time.

307
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,700
I don't think it's a coincidence.

308
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,770
I heard you also have

309
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,420
an unregistered farm, right?

310
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,460
Don't hesitate.

311
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,260
If you have, say yes.

312
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,260
If you don't, say no.

313
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,100
We do have one.

314
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,340
It's newly built.

315
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,660
It hasn't been used yet.

316
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,420
The information is being examined for approval by the Resource Protection Department.

317
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,740
Please take us to have a look there.

318
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,220
Sure.

319
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,660
Let's go.

320
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,260
Sure.

321
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,460
It's not open yet,

322
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,420
but the electricity has been used a lot.

323
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,580
Electricity, right?

324
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,180
It seems to have nothing to do

325
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,220
with the food hygiene.

326
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,210
Right.

327
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,980
Then why are you nervous?

328
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,380
It's too hot.

329
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,260
Look.

330
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,660
I'm sweating.

331
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,460
What's inside?

332
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,380
Inside?

333
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,420
Fodder.

334
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,500
Show me.

335
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
I've finished checking.

336
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,380
Everything meets the standard.

337
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,860
Thank you for your cooperation.

338
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,740
It's what I should do.

339
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,620
We can go now.

340
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,740
Sorry to have disturbed you.

341
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,890
It's what I should do.

342
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,660
Bye.

343
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,580
Okay, take care.

344
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,700
Thank you for your cooperation.

345
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,620
Take care.

346
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,020
Xiong.

347
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,020

00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,940
Didn't you look for her?

519
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,100
What's the use of looking for her?

520
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,300
Everyone has his own life.

521
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,620
She must have her own reasons

522
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,500
for not seeing us.

523
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
In terms of life,

524
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,580
we have to move on, right?

525
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,140
Being entangled

526
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,060
is also a burden.

527
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,620
I'll go check on Know-it-all Zhao.

528
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,180
Do you suspect

529
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,380
Chen Mo is the undercover agent Luo Xiang?

530
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,420
Yes. I did suspect him.

531
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,460
When he was a taxi driver,

532
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,820
he had long hair.

533
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,060
He looked very different from Luo Xiang.

534
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,620
Lately, I've seen him wear Luo Xiang’s clothes

535
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,980
and have Luo Xiang's tattoo.

536
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,940
I suddenly feel

537
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,100
it seems something

538
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,500
has come back to life in him.

539
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,660
Besides,

540
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,700
he can always overcome whatever danger he meets.

541
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
He can master

542
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,540
the things we've taught him at once.

543
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:28,660
To be honest,

544
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,460
I've never seen anyone who learns so fast.

545
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,330
Is this your psychological effect?

546
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,500
I investigated him for a whole year.

547
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,020
Whether he's in public or in private,

548
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,540
I think he's just an ordinary driver,

549
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,540
but he's quite smart.

550
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,740
No.

551
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,580
The fingerprints.

552
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,540
How could two people

553
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,180
have the same fingerprints?

554
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,500
Did you go to the archive room this morning to investigate him?

555
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,140
Sorry.

556
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,020
I should have

557
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,020
reported this to you.

558
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,740
I understand.

559
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,530
I know Luo Xiang

560
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,260
has always been a scar in your heart.

561
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,020
No.

562
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,570
Don't you think...

563
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,140
Why did he

564
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,540
come back in this way?

565
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,450
Have you ever thought that

566
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,060
the fingerprints of the car accident seven years ago

567
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,940
may be Chen Mo's.

568
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,940
Before I started the Dark Night Project,

569
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,780
I had replaced Luo Xiang’s fingerprints

570
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,020
with Chen Mo’s fingerprints.

571
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,420
I did this

572
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,820
to prevent someone from investigating.

573
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,930
I didn't expect it would make you misunderstand.

574
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,940
Let's talk in the car.

575
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,340
You're injured.

576
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,100
Don't take part in today's operation.

577
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,660
Is this your idea

578
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,460
or Officer Liao's?

579
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,500
My idea.

580
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,220
Sign it.

581
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,500
What is this?

582
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,820
[Informant Agreement]

583
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,580
Informant Agreement.

584
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,300
You can be Officer Liao's informant.

585
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,100
Why can't you be my informant?

586
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,860
You mean

587
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,740
I work two jobs?

588
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,740
It's like taking a private job, isn't it?

589
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
There's no difference in the work content anyway.

590
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,300
Officer Liao won't tell me

591
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,340
about your work content.

592
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,740
I can only count on you.

593
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,620
I saved your life.

594
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,060
You said you wanted to repay me.

595
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,170
Now is the chance.

596
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,380
Let's make a deal first.

597
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,420
First,

598
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,699
for what I ask you to do for me,

599
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,659
as long as you can do it,

600
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,540
you must help me.

601
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,820
Second,

602
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,980
you can't tell anyone

603
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,260
what I do,

604
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,300
including Officer Liao.

605
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,179
Third...

606
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,219
I haven't decided yet.

607
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,340
I'll tell you after I decide.

608
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,620
Officer Su,

609
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:35,940
do you still

610
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,860
want to take revenge for Officer Luo?

611
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,139
One more thing.

612
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,780
Don't ask anything you shouldn't ask.

613
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,820
What benefit can I get?

614
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,739
One day,

615
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,010
you'll want to escape from the swamp.

616
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,180
I'll do my best to help you

617
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,820
so that you and Xi live a normal life.

618
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,660
What about you, Officer Su?

619
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,540
When can you get away?

620
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,180
Your phone number.

621
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,200
[Create a New Contact]

622
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,150
[Create a New Contact, Chen Mo]

623
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,300
That means

624
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,300
the drugs are hidden in Lin Zhanxiong's place.

625
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,100
And they're very likely to be taken away tonight.

626
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,780
I've seen several refrigerator trucks.

627
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,810
It's only a matter of time to transport them away.

628
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,540
Will Officer Liao participate in tonight's operation?

629
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,620
Yes.

630
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,300
We'll be split into two squads.

631
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,580
Officer Liao will be in charge of tailing Da Hui,

632
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,940
and prepare to arrest him at any time.

633
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,220
What about you?

634
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,100
My mission is simple.

635
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,020
I just need to keep an eye on Lin Zhanxiong.

636
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,220
Boss, everything is ready.

637
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,580
Let's go.

638
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,780
Target vehicle approaching.

639
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,620
Get ready to block it.

640
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,180
Hello.

641
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,700
Please get off the car for a check.

642
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,540
Get off for a check.

643
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,620
No.

644
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,780
Officer Liao, it's not in the car.

645
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,060
Stand by.

646
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,220
No wonder things have always gone wrong lately.

647
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,140
It turns out that Officer Liao has been keeping an eye on us.

648
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,500
Mr. Chen.

649
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,860
Hello.

650
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,740
Are you here alone?

651
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,340
Why isn't your colleague here?

652
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,140
I'm glad you're here.

653
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,820
How did you know I was coming?

654
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,220
Because people like you

655
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,980
won't let us off easily.

656
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,940
I should have recognized you earlier.

657
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
Seven years ago,

658
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,940
you coveted the drugs of the South Asian Gang,

659
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,300
and robbed our truck by pretending to be a cop.

660
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,180
You even killed my son Dashun.

661
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,700
You're playing the same trick again today.

662
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,290
You're targeting us again.

663
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,940
Am I right?

664
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,420
Luo Xiang.

665
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,980
Why are you here?

666
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,420
To help you.

667
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,140
It's none of your business.

668
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,020
You go first.

669
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,060
Xiangxiang.

670
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,300
You are too kind.

671
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,820
In Hua City,

672
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,130
those who are related to drugs

673
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,180
will need this.

674
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,020
If you can solve it with force,

675
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,860
try not to use your brain.

676
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,810
OK?

677
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,490
I'll go out first to check.
