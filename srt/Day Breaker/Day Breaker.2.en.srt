00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,220
Most markets in Hua City

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,540
are occupied by the South Asian Gang.

The leader, Cai Zhiming,

00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,460
kept hiding behind the scenes.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,580

on every link there are people who run errands.

12

There's no way they'll have leapfrog communications.

13
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,860
So even if the police break one link,

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,659
it won't affect

15
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,580
on their whole production line.

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,780
But if we don't

19
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,300
cut off their supply chain,

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,180
just combat the consumption,

Instead of fighting them head-on,

and not getting good results,

26
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,220
I might as well change another direction

27
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,460
to make the drug dealers fight their own kind.

His daughter has uremia.

He doesn't have that much money.

So half a month ago,

to buy life insurance from me.

389
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,740
So,

390

do you think he would commit suicide for his daughter?

391
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,100

insurance fraud is illegal.

Well...

401
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,580
He's too poor to do anything.

00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,700
Actually, I don't know much about him.

We're even now.

696
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,900
Where did you get so much money?

697
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,620
Did you really commit insurance fraud?

698
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,580
Date?

699
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,900
May 3rd.

00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,780
How do you know I can help you?

701
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,580
You live next door.

More or less

703
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,260
I know about you.

704
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,540
You investigated me?

705
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,660
Don't worry.

706
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,740
I won't tell anyone.

707
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,100
I'm going out for a few days.

708
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,220
Take care of Xi for me.

709
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,740
Rest assured.

710
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,100
All right.

711
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,780
Here's the medical record you asked for.

712
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,900
Thanks.

713
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,660
One note is not enough.

714
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,260
Why?

715
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,090
Because no one else in Hua City

716
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,660
can help you.

717
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,130
This is my name card.

718
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,810
Call me if you need anything.

719
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,220
Come in.

720
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,260
Did Dr. Wang inform you?

721
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,620
The documents you asked for the year are all here.

If we haven't found the truth,

724
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,250
we have to extend the illusion.

725

One day,

726
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,180
the truth will relax

727
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,660
and give itself away.
