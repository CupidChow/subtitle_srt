4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,820
I went back to my hometown secretly last month.

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,580
On my way back,

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,060
I also went to

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,220
the Fudong Village you mentioned.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,500
The village was not big and there were not many people.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,180
I asked some old people.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,500
The Luo Xiang I heard from them

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,100

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,940
You investigated me?

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,890
Guess what else I found.

I've prepared a gift.

23
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,940
It's a tattoo artist.

24
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,260
No matter what pattern you choose,

25
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,020
he'll tattoo it on you immediately on the spot.

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,980
Come on, blow out the candles first.

27

[Hua City]

33
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,220
When I was young

34
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,820
and had just became a policeman,

35
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,500
for my first task,

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,460
my supervisor dispatched me to be an undercover agent.

37
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,340
The target was the owner of a car wash shop.

38
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,250
He was suspected of drug trafficking.

39
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,140
I followed him for two years.

40
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,260
Cleaning cars, washing cars,

41
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,540
waxing cars and polishing cars.

42
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,810
I learned everything.

43
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,740
I followed and watched him closely,

44
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,460
but I found nothing.

45
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,380
After some time,

46
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,900
I thought there might be something wrong with the information,

47
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,380
so I asked my supervisor to terminate the mission.

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,900
It was approved soon.

49
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,770
On the night when I left the car wash shop,

50
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,340
I saw my supervisor's car

51
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,380
at the door of the car wash shop.

52
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,660
It was strange to me.

53
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,300
I had the feeling that something was wrong.

54
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,980
When I opened the door of the car,

55
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,940
my supervisor's body was lying there.

56
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,300
His throat was cut open,

57
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,580
and his head was hanging on his neck.

58
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,970
The murder weapon was that polishing machine.

59
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,339
Since then, I've been so altered as if I had four eyes.

60
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,900
I've been observing this city for every moment.

61
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,300
-Bye bye. -Bye bye.

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,660
Okay.

63
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,700
Take care.

64
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,250
Please come again.

65
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
Buddy, buy some ice cream.

66
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,260
Here you are, buddy.

67
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,580
Take the ice cream.

68
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,020
Thank you.

69
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,530
Okay.

70
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,500
Sometimes, the Hua City you see

71
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,220
is different from the real Hua City.

72
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,500
Got it.

73
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,820
How is it?

74
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,100
It's a little thick.

75
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,860
I'm used to eating Wagyu Beef.

76
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,420
Cook for some more time if it's thick.

77
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,940
If the soup base is bad, replace it with a new one.

78
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Add some seasoning if the sauce is bad.

79
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,340
If the soy sauce is bad, change another one.

80
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,900
That's the advantage of hot pot.

81
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,330
You can choose every step.

82
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,210
You can start over every step.

83
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,700
Actually, this hot-pot meal is for you as a farewell dinner.

84
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,180
Have a safe trip.

85
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,180
What do you mean?

86
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,580
There was an emergency last night.

87
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,580
Liang Long took Sang Bo's bar away.

88
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,420
I guess

89
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,860
Sang Bo will go to Liang Long for revenge.

90
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,340
When he sees you,

91
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,980
Liang Long will easily

92
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,580
learn from Sang Bo that

93
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,180
Luo Xiang is still alive.

94
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,060
It will be a big problem for you

95
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,810
to get close to Liang Long.

96
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,860
So I've decided

97
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,260
to advance the time for you to meet Liang Long.

98
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,060
Are you ready?

99
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,580
No.

100
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,370
It's a little sudden.

101
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,820
But if you follow

102
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,740
the plan made by Officer Yu and me,

103
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,300
I don't think it's a problem.

104
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,620
But

105
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,740
how do you know

106
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,420
Sang Bo won't find Liang Long

107
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,650
before you do?

108
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,780
Because I'm the one who prepared the hot pot.

109
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,100
The stall is closed.

110
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,820
I've never seen you before.

111
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,860
I've come under Fu's recommendation.

112
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,820
Wait a minute.

113
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,540
Once upon a time, there was a country.

114
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,220
Everyone was a thief there.

115
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,980
In the evening,

116
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,810
every family would go out to steal.

117
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,460
The stolen things could always

118
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,100
be found in the neighbors' homes and be replenished.

119
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,540
So the supplies remained balanced all the time,

120
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,850
until one day,

121
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,740
an honest man who never stole

122
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,740
came here to settle down.

123
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,140
Even if he did nothing every day,

124
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,940
and just stayed at home,

125
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,100
as a result,

126
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,380
there would be a family that got no food on the next day.

127
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,140
So this honest man

128
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,220
became a sinner despised by people.

129
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,060
He had no choice

130
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,500
but to go out at dusk every day and let others steal things.

131
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,659
As he didn't steal,

132
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,539
in less than a week,

133
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,860
he became utterly destitute.

134
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,900
If you were that honest man,

135
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,500
would you steal?

136
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,780
It's too complicated.

137
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,020
I don't understand.

138
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,340
Officer Yu, are you hypnotizing me?

139
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,300
Officer Yu,

140
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,060
let's get down to business, okay?

141
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,580
Someone blew up my bar.

142
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,900
I'm the victim.

143
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,180
You arrested both my men and me.

144
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
It doesn't make sense.

145
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,580
I'm trying to talk to you sensibly.

146
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,580
Look.

147
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,170
There was such a big explosion.

148
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,850
You didn't call the police.

149
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,340
Are you afraid that we'll find out something?

150
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,700
Are you hiding drugs or corpses in the bar?

151
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,740
Officer Yu,

152
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,140
don't talk nonsense without evidence.

153
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,180
It's decent business.

154
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,820
If you say that,

155
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,100
I can't do business properly anymore.

156
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,500
OK.

157
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,420
Let me put it another way.

158
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,180
This

159
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,780
was found at the crime scene of the latest explosion.

160
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,980
This

161
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,100
was found at the crime scene of the explosion

162
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,380
which happened a week ago in the bar.

163
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,780
After comparison,

164
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,740
the proportion of these two explosives

165
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,900
are almost the same.

166
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,980
So I suspect that these two cases

167
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,220
were done by the same person.

168
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,020
If you have some clues, go investigate them.

169
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,300
Just find this man.

170
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,650
Does it have anything to do with me?

171
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,540
Why don't you let me go

172
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,170
and I'll catch him for you, okay?

173
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,500
Calm down. Calm down.

174
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,180
We have 32 hours

175
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,140
to collect the evidence.

176
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,860
If it has nothing to do with you,

177
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,460
that's great.

178
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,420
I'll let you go right away.

179
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,900
If you have any clues,

180
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,380
are you interested in telling me something?

181
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,620
Long.

182
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,780
Why are you shouting?

183
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,410
Long.

184
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,300
The goods are gone.

185
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,100
So is the car.

186
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Who did it?

187
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,420
I don't know.

188
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,780
What is our goal?

189
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,860
Our goal is

190
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,860
to do...

191
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,580
do one thing well.

192
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,570
I told you

193
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,460
if you want to sell drugs, focus on it.

194
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,300
If you want to run a dessert shop, focus on it.

195
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,860
You insisted on selling drugs

196
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,100
running a dessert shop at the same time.

197
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,340
You also made your dessert shop famous on the Internet.

198
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,580
No wonder your shop was targeted.

199
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,220
Long, it's my fault.

200
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,500
Long.

201
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,300
Give me another chance.

202
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,660
I'll get all the goods back.

203
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,580
I'll get all the goods back.

204
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,100
Please.

205
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,140
We can rule out two possibilities.

206
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,620
You said it's impossible that it was done by other gangsters.

207
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,380
In our industry,

208
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,660
people kill others without blinking.

209
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,060
But you could come to the bathhouse

210
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,170
safely to see me.

211
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,220
You said it was done by cops.

212
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,860
That's even more impossible.

213
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,180
If it was done by cops,

214
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,780
they would have come to arrest me with the evidence.

215
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,140
Even if they had no evidence,

216
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,940
they would have tried to find it from you.

217
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,460
So there's only one possibility left.

218
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,980
Long.

219
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,780
Long, you suspect me?

220
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,260
Long, I didn't do it.

221
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,620
I... I really didn't.

222
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,780
I...

223
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,620
I robbed the goods from Sang Bo yesterday,

224
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,500
and today you told me me they were gone.

225
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,740
Long.

226
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,740
I was robbed.

227
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,500
I don't know what was going on.

228
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,980
Long, you...

229
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,300
Please trust me.

230
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,180
Please trust me, Long.

231
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,500
I trust you.

232
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,650
Come on.

233
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,820
Have a lemon.

234
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,250
Eat.

235
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,660
Okay. I'll eat it.

236
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,130
I believe you work for Sang Bo.

237
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,420
He's in this hotel.

238
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,820
Find him.

239
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,500
He went up.

240
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,970
Let's go.

241
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,490
Xiang.

242
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
It's true you're still alive.

243
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,650
This is not the way to the bathhouse.

244
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,620
Aren't they going to see Liang Long?

245
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,900
Whatever.

246
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,460
Follow them.

247
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,980
Xiang, please get off.

248
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,780
Do you have his goods?

249
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,820
Who did it?

250
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,820
To be honest,

251
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,820
I don't want to follow that crazy Liang Long anymore.

252
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,500
He killed Tian

253
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,860
just because of a little suspicion.

254
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,260
His body was even made into explosives after he died.

255
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,860
Almost nothing was left after the explosion.

256
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,020
And this.

257
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,170
He was with me for less than three months.

258
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,380
He sold ice stream.

259
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,980
He didn't know what was going on,

260
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,900
but he was beaten to death by Liang Long and buried here.

261
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,500
If he gets high after taking drugs in the future,

262
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,140
I might be the next to die.

263
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,820
Xiang.

264
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,300
Besides,

265
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,700
now he wants to compete with the South Asian Gang.

266
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,620
Who does he think he is?

267
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,900
The Liang Long from five years ago?

268
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,940
He's not like that now.

269
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,300
He has nothing,

270
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,780
and all he can do is bluffing.

271
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,730
The drugs he sold are not as many as the ones taken by him.

272
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,300
His subordinates have long been dissatisfied with him.

273
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,900
Why should I work for him?

274
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,100
Fu,

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,460

You surround the back.

278
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,420
I'll go save him first.

Wait.

Wait?

281
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,170
If he dies,

282
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,579
my effort of this year will be in vain.

283
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,980
What if it's a trap set up by Liang Long?

284
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,660
He will be exposed if we go there.

285
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,420
So we have to trust him.

286
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,210
He will overcome the difficulties.

287
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,540

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,900
if you kill me,

without money or goods,

290
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,780
Liang Long won't let you get off.

Xiang.

292

Do you know what I plan to do?

293
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,530
I want to take this opportunity

Don't worry.

You're a border bride?

369

If one is lucky enough,

370
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,820
she might be sold to the city and give birth to lots of kids.

371
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,540
That would be all for her entire life.

372

If one is unlucky,

373
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,580
she might be sold to drug dealers in the Golden Triangle.

374
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,940
They would force us to swallow drugs

375
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,900
and transport drugs for them at the border.

376

and rolled off the cliff.

384

Weren't you hungry?

If I was too hungry, I would chew the roots

and leaves of trees.

390

The other is that you can get off immediately

00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,170
Su Qingzhu. Miss Su.

517
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,500
That's her.

518
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,060
Sorry for not welcoming you.

519
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,580
It looks like you're not here to play billiards.

520
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,900
The tea house's business has not been good recently?

521
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,420
It's not bad.

522
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,699
But your men hit my men.

523
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,420
That fool swallowed the money himself.

524
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,060
Shut up.

525
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,900
Miss Su, go on.

526
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,860
I'll give you two choices.

527
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,300
First,

528
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
I'll take him away.

529
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,100
Second,

530
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,370
ask him to swallow these,

531
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,980
and promise me

532
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,420
not to mess with my people again.

533
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,820
That's too much.

534
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:57,860
Your men

535
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,940
bullied my men again and again.

536
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,020
I just want an explanation.

537
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,940
Is everyone in the South Asian Gang

538
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,420
so unruly now?

539
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,370
Haven't you heard of it, Miss Su?

540
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,540
Wherever the the South Asian Gang is , it represents the rule.

541
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,090
Although you are a woman,

542
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,700
it doesn't mean I dare not offend you.

543
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,500
What's going on?

544
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,500
Was the circuit breaker tripped?

545
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,220
Now it's not about who has a larger number of fighters.

546
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,980
But if you insist on doing this,

547
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,300
I'll do it with you.

548
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,250
Miss Su,

549
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,380
tell Luo Xiang that

550
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,620
anyone who works with the police

551
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,580
will not live a peaceful life.

552
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,780
Luo Xiang.

553
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,980
It seems that Miss Su doesn't know it.

554
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,900
Forget what I said.

555
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,980
Make it clear.

556
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,580
Last night,

557
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,620
he and Liang Long ruined my men's turf.

558
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,380
Are you clear now?

559
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,660
Uncle,

560
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,380
I'm in trouble.

561
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,690
What took you so long?

562
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,140
Hui sent me here to ask you

563
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,370
what you had told the police.

564
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,460
Nothing.

565
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,060
Where are the goods Hui gave you?

566
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,300
It's hidden in the same place.

567
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
Why do you have so many questions?

568
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,380
Wait.

569
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,340
I left something behind.

570
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,860
Wait for me.

571
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,860
Long.

572
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,380
Have I told you many times

573
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,770
not to let me take so many drugs?

574
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,450
Yes, Long.

575
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,260
Then why did you let me take so many?

576
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,220
I'm hallucinating now.

577
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,820
Bro.

578
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,140
I'm sorry.

579
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,300
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.

580
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,620
I took too many drugs.

581
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,020
How about this?

582
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,620
I'll burn more incense for you later.

583
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,570
Just Stay in the Nether World.

584
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,060
Long.

585
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,180
Are you sober now?

586
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,610
You're not dead.

587
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,420
Have you come back for revenge on me?

588
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,340
I've told you many times in front of your tombstone.

589
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,140
I couldn't even protect myself.

590
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,620
I've come back to help you resume your position.

591
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,940
It looks like him, right?

592
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,300
But the one in the photo is not Luo Xiang.

593
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,180
Hello, honey.

594
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,180
I'm fine.

595
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,540
OK, Long?

596
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,580
No.

597
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,100
Next.

598
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,500
Honey, have you eaten yet?

599
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,420
I'm fine.

600
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,500
The situation has been a bit intense lately.

601
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,580
I'll go back home in a few days.

602
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,820
Emotion.

603
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,410
Can you talk with some emotion?

604
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,660
Next.

605
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,020
Honey.

606
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,940
Have you eaten yet?

607
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,060
Al-alright.

608
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,220
Thank you.

609
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,460
Can't someone imitate it well?

610
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,020
This is not a solution.

611
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,940
It's been several days.

612
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,460
There's news about it all over outside.

613
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,100
We can't hide it for long.

614
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,060
Come here.

615
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,540
Come here.

616
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,860
Repeat what they said just now.

617
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,260
Me?

618
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,500
Hello, honey.

619
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,780
Have you eaten yet?

620
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,340
The situation is intense outside.

621
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,140
I'll come back after hiding for some more time.

622
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,140
Did he sound like him?

623
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,220
Did he?

624
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,980
Did he sound a bit like Xiang?

625
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,580
Yes.

626
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,620
I support you.

627
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,300
Make the call.

628
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,450
On my way here,

629
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,460
I heard of almost the whole story.

630
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,330
No matter how much he sounded like Xiang,

631
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,460
I could still tell.

632
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,100
Qingzhu,

633
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,740
actually, I didn't want to hide it from you.

634
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,940
I was just afraid you couldn't stand the shock.

635
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:00,620
[Su Qingzhu, Former Undercover Agent]

636
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,380
Xiang was your husband after all.

637
00:43:59,050 --> 00:43:59,620
Just tell me.

638
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,220
Kuntuo changed the location for the dealing at the last minute.

639
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,620
We were not prepared for it.

640
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,300
Xiang was inspecting the goods.

641
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,930
But the police rushed over.

642
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,660
He was on the shore and I was on the boat.

643
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,340
I couldn't save him.

644
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,700
Who killed him?

645
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,100
We're still investigating.

646
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,900
Where is the body?

647
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,660
I haven't found it yet.

648
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,100
Qingzhu.

649
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Although Xiang is not here,

650
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,340
if you need any help in the future,

651
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,100
just let me know.

652
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,180
I'll help you if I can.

653
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,900
Here's my plan.

654
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,860
Now the situation is intense outside.

655
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,860
After this period,

656
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,410
I'll take over from Pala.

657
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,020
I'll gather my men to make a comeback.

658
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,100
I'll also give Xiang a share.

659
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,020
If there's profit, his share will be yours.

660
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,420
That's kind of a comfort to Xiang's soul.

661
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,850
Make a comeback?

662
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,580
In what way can you make a comeback?

663
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,500
Kuntuo said this before he left.

664
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,540
He will cooperate with whoever occupies

665
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,140
the market of the Hua City.

666
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,220
It's been five years.

667
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,900
I've already let it go.

668
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,810
Who is in the photo?

669
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,700
His name is Chen Mo.

670
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,180
He's my informant.

671
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,060
I plan to arrange him to work for Liang Long

672
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,530
so that I can collect Kuntuo's information.

673
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,380
He's really a perfect candidate.

674
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,900
Do you want to cooperate with me?

675
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,580
I've quit being a cop for many years.

676
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,180
I don't know what I can do for you.

677
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,620
There is still a gap

678
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,540
between Chen Mo and Luo Xiang.

679
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,740
You are the one who can make up for it.

680
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,380
After all,

681
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,380
you're the one who knows Luo Xiang the best in the world.

682
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,500
Let me think about it.

683
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:13,820
Hello?

684
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,100
Sang Bo ran away.

685
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,060
Sorry.

686
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:24,980
My negligence.

687
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,420
Have you found Sang Bo?

688
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,660
I was knocked out.

689
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,900
I kept looking for him after I woke up.

690
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,220
Later, according to Sang Bo's latest phone location,

691
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,060
I got the surveillance video from the traffic department.

692
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,900
I've heard from my buddy that

693
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,900
Sang Bo has the source of goods owned by Kuntuo.

694
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,410
I don't know

695
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,860
where he got these goods.

696
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,740
I only know the market response is very good.

697
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,900
They'll sell well.

698
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,660
Think about it.

699
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,060
Whose turf is it next to Sang Bo's turf?

700
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:04,970
Mine.

701
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,340
So I'll take away what Sang Bo has.

702
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,020
I will gather my

703
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,740
manpower, financial and material resources during this time.

704
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,660
Then I will expand my business to the north in one year,

705
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,420
and occupy Da Hui's transport line.

706
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,620
In the next year, I can...

707
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,210
If you do that,

708
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,620
it'll take too long.

709
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,660
How fast do you want?

710
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:26,860
Five years?

711
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,500
Five months.

712
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,980
Do you think it's possible?

713
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,420
The government is promoting the development of tourism.

714
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,100
What's the most important thing to develop tourism?

715
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,180
It's stability.

716
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:44,940
If you want stability,

717
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,180
you must control the crime rate.

718
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,140
If you control the crime rate,

719
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,740
the drug business will be affected.

720
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,900
What we need to do is to maintain stability.

721
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,740
Only when we are stable

722
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,900
will our competitors lose their momentum.

723
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,140
Do you know why I didn't come to see you

724
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,660
until the five years had passed?

725
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,180
Because this is the best time now.

726
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,700
It's also a good opportunity for us to realize our ambition.

727
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,700
So you stole my goods?

728
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,500
Are you out of your mind from taking drugs?

729
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,420
Can't you tell who the traitor is?

730
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:32,740
You mean Doma?

731
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,900
What about Fu?

732
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,700
You know he grew up with me,

733
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,340
and followed me for 12 years.

734
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,340
He was the most loyal man in the gang.

735
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,340
How could you blow him up cruelly like that?

736
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,020
To be honest,

737
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,420
I don't want to follow that crazy Liang Long anymore.

738
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,300
He killed Tian

739
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,660
just because of a little suspicion.

740
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,060
After he died,

741
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,660
his body was even made into explosives.

742
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,140
Almost nothing was left after the explosion.

743
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,060
And this.

744
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,060
He was with me for less than three months.

745
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,140
He sold ice stream.

746
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,620
He didn't know what was going on,

747
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,700
but he was beaten to death by Liang Long and buried here.

748
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,130
If he gets high after taking drugs in the future,

749
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,900
I might be the next to die.

750
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,130
It's good you killed him.

751
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,180
I haven't seen you for five years.

752
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,940
You gave me two big gifts today.

753
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,780
Good buddy.

754
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,940
But I've also received another big gift.

755
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,260
Someone told me

756
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,340
you're an informant.
