If I knew the car was there,

104

If someone finds out about me now,

110
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,620
all my efforts will be in vain, right?

111
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,140
What kind of logic is that?

112
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,620

113

seven villagers including Lin Zhanxiong

133
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,940
were taken away last night.

134
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,420
We've been to the bathhouse and Liang Long's house,

135
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,940
but didn't find any clues.

136
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,580
There is no information about the informant

137

on the transmitter.

138
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,420
Strangely,

139
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,260
the family members of these villagers didn't call the police.

140
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,820
They must be afraid to call the police

141
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,860
because of the South Asian Gang.

142
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,210
This farm has a quite remote location.

143
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,060
Not many people should know about it.

144
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,860
So I think there are only two possibilities.

145
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,260
Either Da Hui asked someone to do it,

146
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,380
or Lin Zhanxiong stole it.

147
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,860
But the police

148
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,460
have been watching him.

149
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,940
It's not very likely that

150
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,980
Da Hui asked someone to steal his own cargo.

151
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,620
Any information from the colleagues with Da Hui?

152
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,820
Da Hui has crossed the border.

and find Lin Zhanxiong as soon as possible

Kuntuo fled from Hua City by boat

No one can find this place.

There were military stations at that time.

168

There were also guns and bombs.

Dashun drove that car away,

Let's go.

348
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,180
Dai Wei and the others have checked

349
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,580
all the surveillance videos near the farm.

350
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,900
And they found this from the surveillance video of the gas station.

351
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,730
Do you know these two people?

352
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,660
Look at them.

353
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,940
Do they look like someone I know?

354
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,420
They are rookies.

355
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,300
Go back now.

356
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,900
Find these two people first.

357
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,900
Okay.

358
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,340
I'll deal with the things here first.

359
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,780
This car hasn't been frequently used.

360
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,860
Something is wrong with the lights.

361
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,700
Nothing is wrong.

362
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,100
This is also a problem.

363
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,980
It's really solid.

364
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,620
Bro.

365
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,660
We can negotiate about the price again.

366
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,140
But you can't just think about the function of this car.

367
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,460
You should also think about its fuel consumption

368
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,220
and its power.

369
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,140
This is not an ordinary truck.

370
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,900
No matter what you say,

371
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,340
it's just a fridge to me.

372
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,460
It's a fridge

373
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,420
with a speed of 200 miles per hour.

374
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,650
Sorry.

375
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,620
I can't do this business.

376
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,460
I'll have the four wheels at most.

377
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,460
This...

378
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,860
Without the four wheels,

379
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,340
it will truly become a refrigerator.

380
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,460
Hello.

381
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,180
Is the car fixed?

382
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,100
Yes.

383
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,740
Done?

384
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,420
Stop!

385
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,700
Stop!

386
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,900
Stop!

387
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,540
Headquarters.

388
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,460
I have a situation here.

389
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,940
Eat. Sit down.

390
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,460
Any information about Zhanxiong?

391
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,900
No.

392
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,980
We've been waiting for him all day.

393
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,140
Still can't get in touch with him.

394
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,620
Zhanxiong has always been cautious.

395
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,500
We should trust him.

396
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,700
Just wait.

397
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,100
Maybe after the meal,

398
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,330
he'll be here and deliver the cargo to us.

399
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,380
Do you believe what I said?

400
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,060
Yes.

401
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,620
You do? But I don't believe it.

402
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,660
We don't believe it.

403
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,500
Go find him if you don't believe it.

404
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,180
On it.

405
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,140
Mr. Cai.

406
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,220
Is the signal covered?

407
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,020
Officer Liao.

408
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,500
The condition is limited.

409
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,900
We only have one minute.

410
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,740
How did it go over there?

411
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,020
There are nine people here.

412
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,660
Liang Long will take action tonight.

413
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,740
Okay.

414
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Here's the thing.

415
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,380
There's a shallow beach in the southeast.

416
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,100
I'll arrange a boat to pick you up.

417
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,820
Is it just the two of you?

418
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,620
If there are too many people, the enemies will notice us.

419
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,820
Once Liang Long finds out, the plan will be cancelled.

420
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,449
Do you hear me?

421
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,580
There is a secret tunnel in the base.

422
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,620
I'll lead them out through the tunnel at 1:00 a.m.

423
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,540
Hello?

424
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,219
Ask Officer Yu to meet us.

425
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,219
The signal is not clear.

426
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,620
It flew out of the signal range.

427
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,179
Officer Liao.

428
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,980
Hello, can you hear me?

429
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,739
Say something.

430
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:25,860
He hung up.

431
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,260
We'll leave at 11:00 p.m.

432
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,380
Hurry.

433
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,780
Go.

434
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,420
Officer Yu.

435
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,300
You should have told me about the situation here.

436
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,420
I have an idea.

437
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,540
I have a way to blow it up.

438
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,540
The foundation on your side can't support it.

439
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,780
If anything goes wrong,

440
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,140
you'll all be buried here.

441
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,260
I learned about detonation.

442
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,180
Give me the explosives.

443
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,700
Okay.

444
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,220
Officer Yu,

445
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,420
our lives are in your hands.

446
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,220
Back off!

447
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,410
Hurry.

448
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,180
Please.

449
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,700
If I can't get out,

450
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,420
give this to my son Tai.

451
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,380
Don't worry.

452
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,220
Thank you.

453
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,740
But if

454
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,700
it really came to this point,

455
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,380
if he really died,

456
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,860
our plan would be put off.

457
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,010
If the higher-ups find out,

458
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,260
I'll either be demoted

459
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,740
or

460
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,140
investigated.

461
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,500
It's not something we can control.

462
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,050
However,

463
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,900
if it came to this point,

464
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,380
you would be doomed, too.

465
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,540
Thank you.

466
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:13,940
I advise you

467
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,620
to stop investigating that case.

468
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,100
It's not worth taking the risk.

469
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,620
Why?

470
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,180
Hurry.

471
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,340
It's the police.

472
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,500
I was able to successfully

473
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,260
transport the drugs that day

474
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,450
because of the help of the police of Hua City.

475
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,500
It's like they had

476
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,700
talked with the South Asian Gang.

477
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,940
The police appeared

478
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,540
when the drugs were in place.

479
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,040
And the places where they should meet.

480
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,300
It's all part of their plan.

481
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,380
Besides,

482
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,490
on the dock,

483
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,100
I saw a few policemen

484
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,890
transport drugs into my car.

485
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,340
Now you understand

486
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,020
why I'm afraid of the South Asian Gang.

487
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,580
I want to call the police, too.

488
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,820
I want to disclose their crimes too.

489
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,460
But

490
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,940
I don't know who the good guys are

491
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,220
or who the bad guys are?

492
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,540
Do you think I'm a good person or a bad person?

493
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,780
You are a good person.

494
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,660
Thank you.

495
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,020
Xiong.

496
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,220
Sit.

497
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,380
Is everybody alright?

498
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,340
-Yes. Yes. -Yes.

499
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,220
Don't worry.

500
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,460
Mr. Lin.
