These people are too cautious.

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,140
They could have solved it by making a call.

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,460
Why do they have to send a note?

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,580
It will be easier to leave a trace to the police, will it not?

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,820
What time?

Come, you do it.

19
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,540
Go.

20
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,380
Tell me,

21
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,220
what's going on inside?

22
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,300
The informant has been exposed.

23
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,780
Why?

24
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,220
He ran away

25
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,340
during the trial of Sang Bo today.

26
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,380
He ran into Liang Long's bathroom.

27
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,780
He knew Chen Mo was an informant.

28
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,500
Why should Liang Long trust him?

29
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,660
Do you know what kind of person Liang Long is?

30
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,980
In Liang Long's eyes,

31
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,660
Luo Xiang is his brother.

32
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,500
In Liang Long's eyes,

33
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,740
whoever has the goods is his brother.

34
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,329
Then why didn't you save him?

35
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,010
If we go in like this,

36
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,740
Sang Bo's suspicion will be confirmed.

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,260
Our long-awaited informant plan

38
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,010
will be in vain.

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,260
What is your plan?

40
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,140
You're afraid of being killed by your uncle Da Hui,

41
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,460
so you want to evacuate here.

42
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,460
I agreed.

43
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,820
Because of Luo Xing, you were targeted by the police,

44
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,500
I took it out on him.

45
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,820
Can you tell me

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,060
where the goods are?

47
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,220
I know you, Liang Long,

48
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,260
are a loyal person.

49
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,540
But the goods are now my life.

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,010
If I tell you,

51
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,460
will I be worthless?

52
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,540
If you don't tell me and keep it a secret,

53
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,620
it's more worthless.

54
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,340
Show some sincerity.

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,140
Fine, what do you want?

56
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,769
Kill him.

57
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,460
If I kill him,

58
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
will you cooperate with me?

59
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,940
Liang Long.

60
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,090
I'm here. What are you afraid of?

61
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,020
If you kill him,

62
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,020
we'll get the goods back.

63
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,540
You trust him,

64
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,100
but do not trust me?

65
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,980
Of course I trust that you are not a informant.

66
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,820
But where is the evidence?

67
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,930
What about his evidence?

68
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,380
He knows I have 100 kilograms of goods.

69
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,540
And the police know.

70
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,770
Isn't that enough to prove that he's the informant?

71
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,660
Think about it.

72
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,540
Bro.

73
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,100
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,780
Those goods are really important to me.

75
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,820
Wait.

76
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,900
I...

77
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,450
Tell me,

78
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,420
where have you been

79
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,540
for the past five years?

80
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,900
Actually...

81
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,300
Tell me.

82
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,020
Stop fighting.

83
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,380
It breaks my heart.

84
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,780
Why don't you be straightforward?

85
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,700
Why are you here

86
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,540
in this bathhouse?

87
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,380
I just want to see

88
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,660
how fragile

89
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,660
your brotherhood is.

90
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,730
I know what you want.

91
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,300
Even if you kill Luo Xiang,

92
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,420
you won’t get what you want.

93
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,740
He hasn't told you, has he?

94
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,420
Do you know why?

95
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,100
Because he knows nothing.

96
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,300
What's wrong with this woman?

97
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,060
Have you found Liang Long?

98
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,540
No.

99
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,500
You know Liang Long's situation.

100
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,740
I'm afraid he can't take 100 kilograms of goods.

101
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,140
100 kilograms?

102
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,610
Kuntuo's goods.

103
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,740
No, that's not right.

104
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,460
Shush.

105
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,500
He asked me to remind you

106
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,220
Anyone who has worked with the police

107
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,300
won't end well.

108
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,780
Did he really say that?

109
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,020
Of course.

110
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,940

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420

114
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,100
No.

115
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,420
I'm only interested in money.

116
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,780
Also,

117
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,340
I have seen Da Hui before.

118
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,940
No.

119
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,140
I said that at the police station.

120
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,380
At the police station?

121
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,300
No wonder

122
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,540
even your uncle wanted to kill you.

123
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,860
So you are the informant.

124
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
I'll kill you.

125
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,419
How could I be an informant?

126
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,500
If I were,

127
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,299
why would I hide here?

128
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,460
Think about it.

129
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,299
It makes sense.

130
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,580
I'll give you a chance to prove

131
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
you are not an informant.

132
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Tell me where the goods are.

133
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,500
Can you guarantee you won't kill me if I tell you?

134
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,860
You have your own version now.

135
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,740
I really don't know who to trust.

136
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,980
In one word,

137

who can tell me where the goods are

138
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,610
can walk out alive.

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,180
go towards 500 meters east, there is a small forest.

141

And then go 200 meters south, there is a bridge.

143

and steal my goods.

How could I kill you?

161
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,250
Right?

162
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,020
Come.

163

I'll take you to have fun.

164

Is the tea house still open?

167
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,420
Yes.

168
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,900
Let's have a meal

169

Did you keep the notes I gave you before?

you can ask her. She will teach you.

418
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,530
If there was a cargo

419

bought in 2009.

420
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,820
It has 27 traffic violations in total.

421
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,140
But none of them have been handled.

422
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,180
It hasn't been registered in Vehicle Administration.

423
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,540
And it has not been inspected.

424
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,300
The only thing is that it was insured once

425
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,420
but not renewed.

426
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,900
As for this cargo,

427
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,100
how will such a professional insurance agency like you are working in

428
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,020
identify it?

429
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,380
This may be a car without its owner.

430
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,820

What's wrong with him?

519
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
What are you trying to say?

520
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,020
Who is it?

521
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,380
Go ahead.

522
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,380
He’s a friend of Luo Xiang.

523
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,820
His head got injured in the case

524
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,740
five years ago,

525
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,900
and ended up like this.

526
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,380
I took him in

527
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,540
to work in the teahouse.

528
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,780
Xiang.

529
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,780
Attention!

530
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,380
Say hello.

531
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,860
Hello, Xiang.

532
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,740
Liang Long, what are you doing?

533
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,260
You've just come back.

534
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,900
I have to show them in a formality.

535
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,500
It's not that I don't trust you.

536
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,260
It's just that you came back a little too suddenly.

537
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,220
Please understand me.

538
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,380
Wait for me.

539
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,090
It's been half an hour.

540
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,220
They are almost here.

541
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,450
Have you put the drugs in place?

542
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,220
Yes.

543
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,340
Coming.

544
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:13,900
Bro.

545
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,890
I'm looking forward to it.

546
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,300
Wait for me here.

547
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,920
[Timing]

548
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,820
Go take a look.

549
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,940
[Timing]

550
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,320
[Timing]

551
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,740
You're indeed a good friend.

552
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,060
You didn't let me down at all.

553
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:22,900
What's that smell?
