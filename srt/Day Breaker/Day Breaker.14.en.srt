Why do you want to cooperate with me?

The reason why you dare not show up

is not that you're afraid of the police,

Thank you.

177
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,020
I've passed the security check.

178
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,060
I'll wait for you at the destination.

179
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,740
By transporting the goods in this way,

180
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,540
I can avoid other people's surveillance.

181
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,700
If we do as you say, will it work?

182
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,660
No problem.

183
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,090
Divide it into three times.

184
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,810
Call Dai Wei

185
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100

186
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,020
Have you arrived?

187
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,820
I'll cast it over now.

188
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,020
Did you receive it?

189
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,940
Yes.

190
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,570
Yes.

191
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,140
I'll continue to cast it.

192
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,260
No one answered.

193
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,540
What are you doing?

194
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,020
Come down.

195
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,700
Come down.

196
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,740
Let me see.

197
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,860
Why did you climb so high

198
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,220
in broad daylight?

199
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,980
Officers,

200
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,300
I got lost.

201
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,890
So I climbed up to see

202
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,060
if there was any way out nearby.

203
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,740
It's isn't illegal to climb trees, is it?

204
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,380
Do you have your ID card with you?

205
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,700
I'm a tour guide.

206
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,940
I've just arrived today. I'm here to take a look.

207
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,900
OK. You got lost, right?

208
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,660
Alright. Come with us.

209
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,530
Okay, thank you.

210
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:11,970
Let's go.

211
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,060
Found the suspect.

212
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,260
Are you going in first?

213
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,540
Which of you is Xi's parent?

214
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,300
She is.

215
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,380
The competition between children

216
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,420
relates to the comprehensive quality of parents

217
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,060
and their dedication to the education.

218
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,620
Ma'am.

219
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,660
Are you listening to me?

220
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,700
I know, Ma'am.

221
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,380
A child of this age

222
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
needs parents' company very much.

223
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,220
Xi told me

224
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,980
her parents often stayed out for several says

225
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,460
because of work

226
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,860
without informing her first.

227
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,540
This will affect Xi's personality

228
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,260
and her life greatly.

229
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,020
She will become rebellious

230
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,260
and unsociable.

231
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,940
Officer Yu,

232
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,300
you're living a good life.

233
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,660
Uncle Cai asked me to remind you

234
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,860
not to forget your promise to him.

235
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,860
Mom.

236
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,420
Goodbye, Miss.

238
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,740
Don't be sad.

239
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,220
Let's make up for the homework

240
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,620
after we go home, and it'll be fine.

241
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,380
What makes me sad is

242
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,700
that my dad is so calm.

243
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,450
You didn't do your homework because you wanted to see your dad.

244
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,420
He disappeared for two months.

245
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,260
As soon as he got home,

246
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,540
he went out again before he could give me a hug.

247
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,460
If you were me, could you stand it?

248
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,020
Officer Yu.

249
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,210
Notify the policemen in the nearby vital traffic lines

250
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,300
to stay more alert.

251
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,420
Report to me if anything happens.

252
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,540
Yes.

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,060
We lost one kilogram before the deal.

254
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,660
It's too difficult to do business.

255
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,170

Long! Long!

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,180
How did you get here?

259
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,380
I came from the forest.

260
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,340
It's not easy to be chased here,

261
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,740
but we can't avoid those roads

262
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,780
and checkpoints.

263
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,690
Thank you.

264
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,620

347
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,610
It doesn't matter if I remember it or not.

348
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,090
It's important that you remember it.

349
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,380
Thank you.

350
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,140
Miss Zhang,

351
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,740
I'm not late this time.

352
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,540
Sit down. Let's order.

353
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,260
Waiter.

354
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,900
No need.

355
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,740
Miss Zhang,

356
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,340
I didn't mean this last time.

357
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,100
I just wanted to tell you...

358
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,290
Miss Zhang,

359
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,260
do you really not want to think about it again?

360
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,860
All the readers and I

361
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,540
are looking forward to your serialization very much.

362
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,980
Do you want to know

363
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,940
the follow-up of my stories?

364
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,780
Of course.

365
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,460
Next, we're going to collaborate with the radio station

366
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,540
to create a radio drama for this story.

367
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,580
Let me tell you.

368
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,940
If I go on serializing this story,

369
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,740
you'll appear in the story.

370
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,660
Goodbye.

371
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,540
Does the tea farmer in the story really exist?

372
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,180
Uncle Cai.

373
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,100
Let's start.

374
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,980
OK.

375
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,860
[Liang Long]

376
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,100
Happy birthday to Chen Xi.

377
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,060
I think Dad is back.

378
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,780
Officer Yu,

379
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,460
this is the report of previous activities.

380
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,700
Get familiar with it first.

381
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,140
Actually, I think

382
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,380
anyone can do this work.

383
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,140
I don't know why

384
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,820
Officer Liao asked you to do it.

385
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,940
I think it's a waste of talent.

386
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,740
You should go now.

387
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,220
Officer Yu.

388
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,940
We just received a report from a civilian.

389
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,300
It seems there's drug trafficking

390
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,540
around the junction between Hua City and Xian City.

391
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,020
Got it.

392
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,340
Get ready to go.

393
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:30,900
Okay.

394
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,540
Let's go.

395
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,460
[Police]

396
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,440
[Police]

397
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,260
Mobile phone.

398
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,210
Song Cai only needs to deliver the goods

399
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,100
within the specified time.

400
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,100
Let's go.

401
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,100
Hello, are you Officer Yu?

402
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,340
Who are you?

403
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,820
I'm a chief of Xian City's police.

404
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,820
We came here as soon as we received the report.

405
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:49,860
We've deployed

406
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,660
people to all the main passageways

407
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,780
and checkpoints of Xian City.

408
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,660
No suspect vehicles have been found so far.

409
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,820
I heard that you are very familiar

410
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,700
about the situation here.

411
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
Please help to instruct the work at the scene, Officer Yu.

412
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,020
Get me a map.

413
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,420
Okay.

414
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,020
One bag is enough to support us for one year.

415
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,219
Two bags for two years.

416
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,219
Stop calculating it.

417
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,860
You'll have plenty of chances to calculate it.

418
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,300
Not just me, but all of us.

419
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,100
Go that way.

420
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,220
Wait. Wait.

421
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,570
Xiangxiang.

422
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,100
For safety,

423
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,140
let's split up.

424
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,460
Give it to me.

425
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,860
Each of us has half of it.

426
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,060
See you at the gate at 4.

427
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,980
Okay.

428
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,260
You go this way. We go that way.

429
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,540
Four o'clock.

430
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,700
No suspicious people were found nearby.

431
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,140
I asked the villagers around.

432
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,660
They didn't find anything unusual, either.

433
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,770
They must have gone into the mountain.

434
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,420
It's hard to find them if there's no direction.

435
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,020
Here.

436
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,260
You know the route of their drug trafficking?

437
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,340
I got the information yesterday.

438
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,500
I heard that someone would sell

439
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,780
drugs from Hua City to Xian City.

440
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,140
There are many vital traffic routes between Hua City and Xian City.

441
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,500
I deliberately drove out one of the drug dealers

442
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,020
and led him to find the secret passage in the mountain.

443
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,260
So,

444
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,860
this is not an arrest,

445
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,980
but an entrapment operation.

446
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,620
Xi.

447
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,540
Come and eat.

448
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,140
I made a lot of delicious food for you.

449
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,460
Just see which one you like.

450
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,140
Come on. Sit down.

451
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,540
Think about

452
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,730
which dish you want to eat first.

453
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,100
I'll get you a rib first, okay?

454
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:35,860
Try it.

455
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,140
It's okay, Xi.

456
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,620
Your dad said he would come back to see you.

457
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,060
He will definitely do so.

458
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,660
He'll buy you a gift then.

459
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,540
Are you happy?

460
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,050
Just eat.

461
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,500
Let me peel a shrimp for you, okay?

462
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,340
Officer Yu.

463
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,180
Officer Yu.

464
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,020
Please get ready for the ambush

465
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,290
at the trading location.

466
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,340
Roger.

467
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,340
Long.

468
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,460
Why did you choose this road?

469
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
It's a shortcut.

470
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,060
Xiang has to walk a long distance through that road.

471
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,020
So we can arrive earlier than him.

472
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,540
So you're the boss.

473
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,500
Attention, all units.

474
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,940
Three minutes are left before the transaction time.

475
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,980
Long.

476
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,820
Xiang is inside.

477
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,700
Long.

478
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,580
Why did Xiang arrive earlier than us?
