Jin.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,180
Let's go.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,940
Do you know the rules here?

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,900
What rules?

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,620
People who are not from our union

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,460
are not allowed to attract customers here.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,300
I'm just passing by.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,580
You can't even pass by.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,220
How can I become a member of your union?

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,900
You have to pay the membership fee every month.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,420
How much?

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,420
500 yuan a month.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,420
Everyone has to pay.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,730
If you pay, you're one of us.

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,260
We can care for each other later.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,900
No, I won't pay.

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,620
You have your principles.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,460
What's your name?

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,450
His name is Chen Mo.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,820
You are Chen Mo?

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,020
You just got your driver license last year.

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,220
You work by fits and starts

24
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,420
and spend the rest of your time in the casino.

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,260
You have a daughter, right?

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,420
How do you know?

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,780
This is the power of our union.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,100
It's easy for us

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,100
to investigate someone.

30
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,660
Listen to me.

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,700
Stop being a taxi driver.

32
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,140
You're not suitable for this job.

33
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,180
Go back to accompany your daughter.

34
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,820
Let's go for a drink.

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,660
Pull over.

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,020
Pull over.

37
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,220
Open the door.

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,500
Please show me your driver license.

39
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,860
We're investigating drunk driving.

40
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,820
Lower the window.

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,060
Open the door!

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,220
Open the door and get off.

43
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,020
-Sir. -Open the door.

44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,820
Sir.

45
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:58,700
Sorry.

46
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,860
He's my friend.

47
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,420
He did drink a bit.

48
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,780
Just a sip.

49
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,460
Your friend is suspected of drunk driving.

50
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,700
We have to take him away according to the law.

51
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,460
Sir, cut him some slack.

52
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,460
Cut him some slack.

53
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,780
Remember, don't do it again.

54
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,060
Sure, of course.

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,780
Go.

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,820
Thank you.

[Episode 10]

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,890
Hello.

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,660
Two requests.

61
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,380
Change the color of the bumper into white

62
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,980
and get a new plate.

63
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,700
The plate number is 78TNS3.

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,900
TNS3.

65
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,740
When do you want it?

66
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,460
As soon as possible.

67
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,300
I'll wait here.

68
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,610
You killed my dad.

69
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,860
You found me

70
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,620
much later than I expected.

71
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,860
What do you mean?

72
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,780
You think you've found

73
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,250
many clues about me.

74
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,210
They were actually provided by me.

75
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,420
I wanted you to come here.

76
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,700
Lin Tai.

77
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,940
In other words,

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,300
Lin Zhanxiong's youngest son.

79
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,260
You're not a drug dealer.

80
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,860
I just want that truck.

81
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,460
You're not a drug dealer. Why do you want that truck?

82
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,860
Why do you want those drugs?

83
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,730
Trust me.

84
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,060
Give me that truck.

85
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,380
I'll give you an explanation for your father's death.

86
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,900
Before I know the real cause of my dad's death,

87
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,180
no one can drive that truck away.

88
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,660
I remember you have a brother.

89
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,930
He had a car accident

90
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,020
seven years ago.

91
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,740
Who are you?

92
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,380
I killed your father.

93
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,300
What did you say?

94
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,420
Not only your father,

95
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,580
but also your brother.

96
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,900
What he transported was not seafood

97
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,300
but drugs.

98
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,220
No way.

99
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,420
In order to stop your father from making more mistakes,

100
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,770
your brother drove that car away.

101
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,060
But I took the car halfway

102
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,060
and killed him.

103
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,300
Are you telling the truth?

104
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,060
If what I said was true,

105
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,980
would you dare to shoot?

106
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,620
You still can't do it.

107
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,620
Give me that truck.

108
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,380
You shouldn't have stepped into this trap.

109
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,620
I'm already in this trap.

110
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,500
You don't even have the courage to shoot me.

111
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,380
How can you survive here?

112
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,420
Your father taught you

113
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,420
how to tie this knot, right?

114
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,020
This is a shepherd's knot for cattle and sheep.

115
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,580
Normally people don't use this kind of knot.

116
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,820
You grew up in the farm.

117
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,780
You are very familiar with this knot.

118
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,820
I think your father

119
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,420
taught you everything he had learned.

120
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,500
This is a knot between you and your father.

121
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,620
You're wrong.

122
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,900
My dad always looked down on me.

123
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,090
He didn't allow me to follow him.

124
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,700
I know him

125
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,460
even less than you.

126
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,260
That's because he wanted to protect you.

127
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
He didn't want you to become the second Dashun.

128
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm also a father.

129
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,980
I understand how he feels.

130
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,700
He told me

131
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,100
you were his greatest pride.

132
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,540
I'm his pride?

133
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,340
I have a job offer letter for you.

134
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,980
Do you want to have a look?

135
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,620
He showed me this job offer letter.

136
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,450
The look in his eyes

137
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,810
was like the first time I saw my daughter

138
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,940
learning to walk.

139
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,020
It's fake.

140
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,340
He paid someone to hire me

141
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,980
because he didn't want me to stay by his side.

142
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,580
He submitted your resume.

143
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,660
But you got the job

144
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,460
on your own.

145
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,980
He told me that.

146
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,860
Did he really tell you that?

147
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,100
Hello, everyone.

148
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,580
I'm your psychologist today.

149
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,620
You can call me Mr. Wang.

150
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,580
Let's get to know each other.

151
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,980
How about we play a game today?

152
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,180
Have you ever played the game

153
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,900
"pass the parcel" in your life?

154
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,700
This toy bear

155
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,380
is like

156
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,420
the parcel in the game.

157
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,460
When I wind up the bear,

158
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,140
it will start playing the drum.

159
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,500
Whoever gets the bear

160
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,700
when it stops playing the drum

161
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,620
will lose

162
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,500
and get punished today.

163
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,980
The main purpose of this game

164
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,180
is to focus your attention,

165
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,140
so that it will reduce

166
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,340
your dependency on drugs subconsciously.

167
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,220
Mr. Liang.

168
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,860
Please turn over your head.

169
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,580
Let's play a game, okay?

170
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,300
Hello, Mr. Liang.

171
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,460
How about we start with you?

172
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,220
Here.

173
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,780
Take your hand.

174
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,610
It's obviously going against me.

175
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Mr. Liang.

176
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,100
It is only a game.

177
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,340
Why are you so serious?

178
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,380
I know.

179
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,460
How do you want to punish me?

180
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,780
The punishments are all in this box.

181
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,890
Whatever you draw will be your punishment.

182
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,220
25.

183
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,900
26.

184
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
27.

185
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,580
Get lost.

[Loh Wichai]

187
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,420
Hello, Professor Loh.

188
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,460
Mr. Liang.

189
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,380
I want to talk to you alone

190
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,100
about your rehabilitation therapy in detail.

191
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,780
Okay.

192
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,540
Sister.

193
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,980
I'm scared. I want to go home.

194
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,500
It's all my fault.

195
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,690
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

196
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,740
If your dad finds out,

197
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,620
I'll be docked.

198
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,300
This is between us.

199
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,100
It has nothing to do with my dad.

200
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,140
If you feel bad,

201
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,900
you can offset that with the rent.

202
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,970
Since you're talking about this,

203
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,220
I must find a way to get you out of here.

204
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,620
Sister.

205
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,900
Who are they?

206
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,010
Why did they lock us up here?

207
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,460
Based on my observations,

208
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,460
they must be drug dealers.

209
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,740
There must be drugs

210
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,460
in the truck they are looking for.

211
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,250
Which magazine is this story from?

212
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,700
It's not a story.

213
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,140
We need to be prepared for the worst.

214
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,620
Why didn't you tell them

215
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,180
where the truck went?

216
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,140
If I tell them,

217
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,900
we'll lose our value to them.

218
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,860
Get up.

219
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,460
Get up!

220
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,090
-Let go of my sister. -Don't touch her.

221
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,900
Don't touch her!

222
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:19,980
Get out!

223
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,700
You remembered anything?

224
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,460
Wait.

225
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,450
-Sister. -Wait.

226
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,580
I understand how you feel.

227
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,660
You are the owner.

228
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,220
Everything you do is right.

229
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,210
I felt bad for losing an electric motorcycle before.

230
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,940
Let alone what you lost is a refrigerated truck.

231
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,780
Am I right?

232
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,540
Where is the truck?

233
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,370
I have a question.

234
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,930
Is there something very important in the truck?

235
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,900
Yes.

236
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,020
If I tell you,

237
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,420
will I die?

238
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,380
You are overthinking.

239
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,260
Help!

240
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,420
-Help! -Sister.

241
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,220
Boss.

242
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,940
I found it.

243
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,620
That truck is downstairs.

244
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,420
Boss.

245
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,380
Get in the car!

246
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,580
Bro.

247
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,050
-There's nothing in the truck. -Nothing?

248
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,500
Look over there.

249
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,980
Don't move.

250
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,900
What do you want?

251
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,700
Tell me what happened on the island that day.

252
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,780
Why did you kill Lin Zhanxiong?

253
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,210
What's your relationship with him?

254
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,020
None of your business.

255
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,180
It's fine to me

256
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,020
as long as you're not my enemy.

257
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,099
Without the goods,

258
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,260
there should be no reason to kill Lin Zhanxiong.

259
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,700
So,

260
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,060
you must have been instigated.

261
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,579
Was he a cop?

262
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,220
Did he tell you

263
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,940
where Lin Zhanxiong was?

264
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,859
There are rules out there.

265
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,579
News comes and goes.

266
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,220
If I had asked about everything,

267
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,380
I wouldn't have lived to this day.

268
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,660
Is there anything

269
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,610
more important than your life?

270
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,740
Yes.

271
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
You lured me downstairs with this truck.

272
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,300
You must know what I want the most.

273
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,500
That's why you should

274
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,620
answer my question.

275
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,580
Are they related?

276
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,460
Of course.

277
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,700
If the person who informed you was a cop,

278
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,020
then it's likely you may not be able to see the goods.

279
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,060
Why?

280
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,570
Because killing Lin Zhanxiong is to destroy the evidence.

281
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,260
Destroying drugs is also destroying the evidence.

282
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,810
If I'm guessing right,

283
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,820
the goods were left by Kuntuo

284
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,020
five years ago.

285
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,620
Without the police's help,

286
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,940
you couldn't take it away.

287
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,860
What else do you know?

288
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,260
As far as I know,

289
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,700
that cop

290
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,580
is targeting Lin Zhanxiong's son, Tai.

291
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,020
His son has it?

292
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,580
Where is his son?

293
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,500
That's all I can tell you.

294
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:35,900
Okay.

295
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,100
If you want the answer,

296
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,900
find me what I want first.

297
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,210
Maybe we can be friends.

298
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,980
You're smart.

299
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,690
I'm a businessman.

300
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,620
I think our cooperation

301
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,540
will have a bright future.

302
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,340
Right?

303

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,580

Help me find him.

Of course I'll help you.

Who are you?

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,900
I have your girlfriend

Remember to drive your white truck

We've found them.

323
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,220
Tai, listen to me.

324

You can't go there.

You'll die if you go.

326

Calm down.

327
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,460
Untie the rope for me.

328
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,620
I'll definitely help you.

329

Untie me.

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,100
Besides teaching me how to tie a shepherd's knot,

334
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,660
my father also taught me to tie a wooden knot.

335
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,530
Try to untie it.

336
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,980

What do you think she's doing here?

Let's wait and see.

Don't expose yourself.

Not really.

386

are very important.

Normally, the humidity around 18 degrees

396
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,940
is more suitable for the fermentation of pu-erh tea.
