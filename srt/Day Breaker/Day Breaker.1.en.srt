Bro,

177
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,460
you hit me so hard.

178
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,780
You almost crippled me.

179
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,860
I needed to make it look real.

180
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,370
Did he tell everything?

181

The drugs are in Liang Long's bar.

182

Cool.

183

There are only two exits in this bar.

After our men enter through the front door,

208
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,300
where do you think they will run from?

209
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,860
The front door or the back door?

210

Thank you.

211

You're giving me money.

Pick one quickly.

214

It must be the front door.

215
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,580
The front door is at the main road.

216

The back door is at a small path.

217
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,220
If it was me, I would run from the back door.

218
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,380
The front door is the closest to the wine cellar.

219
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,580
The drugs are in the cellar.

220

The back door is only to a path.

221
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,780
If you were the drug dealer,

222
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,380
would you get out through the back door

223
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,380
and race with the police?

224
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,460
I'll definitely choose the front door.

225
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,420
Once I come out,

226

00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,460
You are a wise man who plays the fool.

347
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,860
I'll get enough money soon.

348
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,420
Good for you.

349
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,580
It feels so good.

350
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,820
Bro,

351
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,540
someone cheated here.

352
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,700
Someone told me you cheated.

353
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,900
Someone cheated here.

354
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,860
No, it's not mine.

355
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,620
What are you doing?

356
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,500
You cheated?

357
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,100
Get lost!

358
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,540
It's him.

359
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,380
Captain Liao.

360
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,500
Here are the materials you asked for.

361
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,260
Chen Mo is a taxi driver.

362
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,810
Her daughter has a kidney disease

363
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,380
and is awaiting a kidney transplant in hospital.

364
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
Poor guy.

365
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,620
This engine

366
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,020
is worn out.

367
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,820
I'll deduct 10,000 yuan.

368
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,100
I'm not lying.

369
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,460
It's worn out.

370
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,380
My friend,

371
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,460
your bumper looks so fake.

372
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
It falls off when you touch it.

373
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,020
And this window.

374
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,220
It's so cheap.

375
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,010
You can't even raise it up.

376
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,700
Alright.

377
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,780
Just tell me how much you would like to pay.

378
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,460
Since we are friends,

379
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,180
I'll give you

380
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,420
450,000.

381
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,500
So little?

382
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,780
You think it's too little?

383
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,420
I asked you to sell it last year but you didn't sell it.

384
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,220
Last year it could be 650,000.

385
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,460
I offered this price because you're my friend.

386
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Alright, give me the money.

387
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,060
Don't rush.

388
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,850
This is a serious deal.

389
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,620
You need to review the contract first

390
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,020
and sign it.

391
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,420
Then I'll give you the money.

392
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,660
Mr. Yang.

393
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,260
We had an appointment yesterday.

394
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,620
Yes.

395
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,940
Call me when you're done.

396
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,220
No problem.

397
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,180
Remember to write the receipt.

398
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,740
The receipt?

399
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,380
Yes.

400
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,380
You didn't tell me to issue the receipt on the phone yesterday.

401
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,500
Then how should I explain to the insurance company

402
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:02,380
to raise a claim?

403
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,210
I know you want a claim.

404
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,860
But the price you offered

405
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,260
is not the price for a receipt.

406
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,460
Anyway,

407
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,450
you must give me a receipt.

408
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,620
Mr. Yang.

409
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,970
You know it's not easy

410
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,900
to do a business for us.

411
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,380
If I give you a receipt,

412
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,420
I'll make a loss.

413
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,500
It's not easy for me either.

414
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,500
I don't care.

415
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,060
Come on.

416
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,540
I don't care.

417
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,100
Let me tell you something.

418
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,170
Don't worry, okay?

419
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,580
You're sweating.

420
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,300
I don't care.

421
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,500
Don't worry.

422
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,940
Just add a bit more.

423
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,140
The government wants to develop tourism.

424
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,380
But Mr. Sun,

425
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,420
as an immigrant,

426
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,220
you need to be aware of the situation here first.

427
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,260
Yes.

428
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,540
Mr. Sun, I'm not trying to scare you.

429
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,580
This kind of accident

430
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,860
occurs often

431
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,300
in a drug city like Hua City.

432
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,780
You can have no car or house here,

433
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,460
but you can't live without insurance.

434
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:44,970
I...

435
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,010
Hello?

436
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,740
Hello?

437
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,780
No wonder I didn't get the deal.

438
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,659
It's you, the jinx,

439
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,659
affecting me.

440
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,300
Miss Zhang, what a coincidence. Are you here to grab some food?

441
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,580
Sit down.

442
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,940
Rent.

443
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,739
I don't have money.

444
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,260
It's been months.

445
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,300
Miss Zhang,

446
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,730
calm down.

447
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,300
I can introduce a business to you.

448
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,060
What business?

449
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,180
I want to buy an insurance.

450
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,500
Can you tell me

451
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,140
how I can get the biggest compensation?

452
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,490
What do you want?

453
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,420
I need money.

454
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,100
Look.

455
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,620
Is my car suitable?

456
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,900
Your poor car

457
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,780
is not worth much even if you drive it to the sea.

458
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,460
You should count in your poor life.

459
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,260
Why didn't I think of that?

460
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,210
Good for you.

461
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,580
You know how to tamper with the brake.

462
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,020
But so far as I know,

463
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,890
you did this

464
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,620
to speed up the damage of tires.

465
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,060
Anyway, it looks like

466
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,540
a deliberate car accident.

467
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,540
Even if I hadn't stopped you

468
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540
and had let you get the compensation,

469
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,620
after they inspect the situation

470
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,740
and send you the money,

471
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,540
I'm afraid your daughter...

472
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,380
Who are you?

473
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,580
Your name is Chen Mo.

474
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,980
You are a gambler.

475
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,260
You risked your life

476
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,060
for two million?

477
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,410
Who are you?

478
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,610
If I tell you

479
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,980
I can save your daughter,

480
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,100
would you like to bet with me?

481
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,220
You don't look like someone

482
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,900
who can give me two million at once.

483
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,300
Fine.

484
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,820
I bet.

485
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,500
Don't be happy too soon.

486
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,580
You can only get the money when you win.

487
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,300
What do you want to bet on?

488
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,900
I bet you are another person.

489
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,940
You're not Chen Mo.

490
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,020
Then who am I?

491
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,010
Luo Xiang.

492
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,570
Don't overthink.

493
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,100
It's not that complicated.

494
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,380
You're just Liang Long's follower.

495
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,980
It's called the Dark Night Project.

496
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,900
It's my personal act to make you my informant.

497
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,260
I'm sorry.

498
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,020
I can't help you with this.

499
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
Are you afraid of death?

500
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,180
Didn't you die once a minute ago?

501
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,220
I know about your daughter.

502
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,180
Don't you want to see her grow up happily?

503
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,700
If you hesitate for one more minute,

504
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,740
you'll miss

505
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,940
a minute for her to live.

506
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,780
Do you think

507
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,010
she can wait until the next kidney transplant?

508
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,340
But those drug criminals are so scary.

509
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,060
If they know my daughter,

510
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,420
she will lose her life.

511
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,980
Don't worry about that.

512
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,250
We will have a seamless plan

513
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,620
to protect our informants

514
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,180
and their family members.

515
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,020
How can you guarantee

516
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,100
that you can protect them?

517
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,300
There are so many drug criminals in Hua City.

turn Hua City into a tourist city

It's hard to create a good social environment

So at this time,

that Hua City needs a symbol.

You are the ambassador of the police force

and also a pioneer of the anti-drug police.

I believe your presence

571

you'll be a role model to your colleagues.
