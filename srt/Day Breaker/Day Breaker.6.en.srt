176
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,860
and left.

177
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,540
About what time did he leave?

178
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,500
What time?

179
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,420
Why do you ask?

180
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,540
Nothing.

181
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,980
It's just I think there are

182
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,140
many doubts about this old case.

183
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,020
I need to go through it again.

184
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,100
Take a look.

185
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,340
If Kuntuo's cargo ship

186
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,500
is the anchor,

187
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,420
you were chasing him

188
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,780
on this street.

189
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,170
But Officer Liao was supposed to

190
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,180
get off the car at this spot.

191
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,420
Where is the lighthouse?

192
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,700
It's here.

193
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,460
Stop what you're doing now.

194
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,300
And come to me.

195
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,180
I'll be right there.

196
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,820
Find a way to get the two cars away

197
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,620
so that people of Da Hui and Liang Long won't suspect us.

198
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,100
Two lives.

199
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,260
We just don't report it to the station

200
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,980
and pretend that nothing happened?

201
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,700
In Hua City,

202
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,100
is it a big issue that two drug dealers die?

203
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,140
Would you report it

204
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
if the dead are not drug dealers?

205
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,540
Actually, I want to tell you something.

206
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,780
So you suspected

207
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,420
I killed the undercover cop a long time ago.

208
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
If I submit

209
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,700
your investigation report,

210
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,420
if they investigate a little bit,

211
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,740
I think they will suspect you in the end.

212
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,530
So I've made some adjustments.

213
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,620
Since I'm the leader of the action team,

214
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,940
I can definitely prove your track.

215
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,100
Then why did you help me?

216
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,220
You're a good cop.

217
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,850
I don't want to ruin your future

218
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,180
in this way.

219
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,180
If it were me,

220
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,900
I would have done the same.

221
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,380
But if the higher-ups find out,

222
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,700
you'll be responsible for violating the rules of police.

223
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,420
Drug dealers don't follow the rules.

224
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,460
Why should I?

225
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,500
Rules are dead and people are alive.

226
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,780
I saved you

227
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,410
out of habit and instinct.

228
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,500
I'll buy you a bottle of water.

229
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,860
Since I got this disease,

230
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,650
I haven't had cola and tasted this flavor

231
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,100
for two years.

232
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,180
Why doesn't it have the sound of gas?

233
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,020
What is this?

234
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,060
Cola.

235
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,220
This is not cola.

236
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,290
This is obviously a bottle of syrup with water.

237
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,500
You just said

238
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,420
you haven't had cola for two years.

239
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,500
How do you know what cola tastes like?

240
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,900
When my dad is away,

241
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,260
I had some in secret.

242
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,140
But this cola doesn't even have bubbles.

243
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,940
It's too fake.

244
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,940
There they are.

245
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,020
But no matter how much you shake it,

246
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,140
it's still a bottle of water with syrup.

247
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,700
OK, I admit

248
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,380
I made this cola myself.

249
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,500
But look at this bottle.

250
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,620
When you saw it,

251
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,410
was the expectation and joy

252
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,090
real?

253
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,820
As long as you don't drink it,

254
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,380
your expectation and joy

255
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,780
will remain.

256
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,940
So,

257
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,700
does it matter

258
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,690
whether it's real cola or not?

259
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,500
It's so delicious.

260
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,140
Why is it so good?

261
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,180
Look.

262
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,020
At this moment,

263
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,460
do I seem to be drinking real cola?

264
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,700
Then at this moment,

265
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,780
it's real.

266
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,100
Then I'll take it as real.

267
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,460
Why did you come here to buy water?

268
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,260
Come back quickly.

269
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,630
[Coupon]

270
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,620
Line up.

271
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,500
Be careful.

272
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,340
Looking for me?

273
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,580
Come on.

274
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,340
Have a seat.

275
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,700
Sign this.

276
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,980
What?

277
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,610
From now on,

278
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,540
you're officially a member.

279
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,380
To show my compensation,

280
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,140
I'll transfer this bathhouse to you unconditionally.

281
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,370
That's a lot.

282
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,820
Is it necessary?

283
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,300
Yes.

284
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,700
You are my brother.

285
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,500
Who else can I give it to?

286
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,380
Besides,

287
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,620
this bathhouse was left to you by Pala.

288
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,220
I just kept it for you.

289
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,380
Now that you're back,

290
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,020
I need to return it to its owner.

291
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,260
Take it.

292
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:05,940
Here.

293
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,020
From now on,

294
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,060
you're in charge of this bathhouse.

295
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,300
Need to make it clear first.

296
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,010
You have to be responsible

297
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,050
for us brothers.

298
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,100
Also,

299
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,940
you have to be responsible

300
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,060
for those who try to squeeze in with money.

301
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,740
Those people waiting outside

302
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,020
are not here to take a shower, are they?

303
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,700
You're indeed my best friend.

304
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,740
I can't hide it from you.

305
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,900
I had a big promotion.

306
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,300
50% off for heroin.

307
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,140
Buy one and get one free.

308
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,860
Charge first and pick up the goods later.

309
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,780
Now you are under pressure.

310
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,900
If you are not capable

311
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,620
to get the goods from Da Hui,

312
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,740
if anything happens, they will only come for you.

313
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,020
Bro,

314
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,940
you can make it.

315
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,820
Didn't you tell me

316
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,100
you've been following him all day

317
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,940
and found out that Da Hui has a batch of goods

318
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,340
in Lin Zhanxiong's trade market that needs to be transferred?

319
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,580
You've seen a lot of news

320
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,740
about the Internet loan platforms, right?

321
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,260
A group of people protested with banners.

322
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,340
The person in charge was beaten

323
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,860
by investors so fiercely.

324
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,700
The people outside are more ruthless.

325
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,380
If the drug addiction recurs,

326
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,500
they can do anything.

327
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,260
I'm afraid just thinking about it.

328
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,620
Liang Long.

329
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,020
We are really good brothers.

330
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,260
Feel it.

331
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,140
I'll go out first.

332
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,820
Officer Yu,

333
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,300
as soon as you return to Hua City,

334
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,420
there is a big case for us.

335
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,420
It's not a big case.

336
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,060
It's just an ordinary robbery.

337
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,220
An ordinary case?

338
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,340
You can come to us for an ordinary case?

339
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,140
Tell me. How can I help you?

340
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,780
This refrigerated truck

341
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,420
was found this afternoon.

342
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,180
When I arrived,

343
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,700
there were no goods in the car.

344
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,500
According to the clues at the scene,

345
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,340
this should be a robbery.

346
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,820
But the owner and the robbers disappeared at the same time.

347
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,340
It's understandable that the robbers disappeared.

348
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,500
But it's weird that the owner

349
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,010
left his car alone.

350
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,020
So I suspect the car were carrying drugs.

351
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,860
So you want me to find the owner for you?

352
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,300
No.

353
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,660
After investigation,

354
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,780
we have already had clues for the robbers.

355
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,100
What you need to do now

356
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,130
is to collect fingerprints on this car

357
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,540
and find the fingerprints

358
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,740
in your department's database

359
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,260
and give me a result of comparison.

360
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,820
By the way, dad,

361
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,620
I received this,

362
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,100
a letter of appointment of Digital Technology Company

363
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,980
of Malaysia.

364
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,060
Not bad.

365
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,940
A listed company.

366
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,050
What position?

367
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,060
Data analysis director.

368
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,820
How is the treatment?

369
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,700
Haven't talked about it yet.

370
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,980
But I asked my friend.

371
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,700
The position belongs to management cadres,

372
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,220
and there are dividends of shares every year.

373
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,940
What do you think?

374
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,850
Dad,

375
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,860
I've been studying outside for so many years.

376
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,340
I finally graduated and don't go home often.

377
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,500
I want to stay with you this time.

378
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,660
You want to stay?

379
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,100
Stay in Hua City?

380
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,420
And live a carefree life?

381
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,060
I'm working.

382
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,900
I just can't make much money for the time being.

383
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,980
Your current position is quite good.

384
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,340
At least you have a normal income every month.

385
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,340
Tai.

386
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:34,900
Here's the thing.

387
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,180
I hope you can experience more outside

388
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,140
and learn more skills.

389
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,980
I want to prove myself

390
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,380
through my own ability.

391
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,250
It's already proved.

392
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,860
I didn't even submit my resume.

393
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,180
Who gave this letter of appointment to me?

394
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,610
You colluded with them to send me a letter of appointment,

395
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,300
right?

396
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,780
I know what I'm capable of.

397
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,740
Although I have some experience,

398
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,380
I wouldn't have

399
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,580
got such a position.

400
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,100
How much did you spend this time?

401
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,540
Did you pay my salary?

402
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,570
Son,

403
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,940
you think too much.

404
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,970
Don't lie to me.

405
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,820
You did so much just to send me away.

406
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,500
Do you think I've caused you trouble?

407
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,650
Have you regarded me as normal for so many years?

408
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,060
You just think I'm a loser.

409
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,530
If I were the one who died,

410
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,260
you wouldn't have had so much trouble, right?

411
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,140
What do you know?

412
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,100
I know.

413
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,460
He's always right in your heart.

414
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,500
Anything is good from him.

415
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,860
I can't compare to him in my whole life.

416
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,780
But don't worry. I'll do it.

417
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,460
Shut up!

418
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,610
Get out!

419
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,220
Ticket.

420
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,220
Aren't you coming with me?

421
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,220
Even if we catch Pala and Kuntuo,

422
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,460
it's not over yet.

423
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,930
There is much follow-up work

424
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,900
I need to do.

425
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,580
And you? What's your plan?

426
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
You really don't want to be a cop?

427
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,900
I like drinking tea like this.

428
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,420
Maybe I'll open a tea house.

429
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,060
It's good to open a tea house.

430
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,060
I will have tea at your place some time.

431
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,460
Sure.

432
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,700
You need to pay me.

433
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,700
Let's not talk about money as we are so close.

434
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,810
After this mission,

435
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,580
we won't have any bonds.

436
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,260
You're back.

437
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:40,940
Come here.

438
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,460
Let me change your medicine.

439
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,060
Luo Xiang.

440
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,780
Say something.

441
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,500
You're back.

442
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,030

Everything has past.

465
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
You should let it go.

466
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,250
It's been five years.

467
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,260
Is that all Luo Xiang wants to tell me?

468
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,420
It's been five years.

469
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,460
You should move on.

470
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,900
Okay.

471
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,900
Officer Yu,

472
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,580
the result is out.

473
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,700
Go ahead.

474
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,140
The fingerprints match perfectly.

475
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,260
Got it.
