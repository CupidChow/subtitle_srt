00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,130
please thank them for me.

177
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,900
By the way, sister-in-law,

178
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,300
I have to go.

Hello, Mr. Song Cai.

Hello, Officer Yu.

185
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,180
Look how cute that little fatty is.

186
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,860
Twelve years old.

187
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,380
Blood type O.

188
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,420
A fifth grader at Hua City Primary School.

189
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,260
I heard he's good at math.

190
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,420
His father is Wu Ming.

191
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,460
He died in duty a few years ago.

192
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,020
An only twelve-year-old child

193
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
lost his father.

194
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,020
What do you want?

195
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,940
I want to make friends with Officer Yu.

196
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,020
I'm just a cop.

197
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,580
I don't deserve to be your friend.

198
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,860
Don't worry.

199
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,970
You are on the posters all over the street.

200
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,980
Everyone knows

201
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,100
that you'll be the backbone of the police station.

202
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,780
But I'm sorry.

203
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,780
I don't like making friends.

204
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,260
If anything happens

205
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,940
to the little fatty,

206
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,140
you will definitely be upset.

207
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,860
Don't you dare touch him.

208
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,300
You think too much.

209
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,660
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

210
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,420
But who do you think

211
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,540
dares to say they will be safe and sound for their whole life?

212
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,380
For example, car accident,

213
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,300
or robbery.

214
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,420
Those who have no experience

215
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,940
always think they can do anything

216
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,420
Can you protect people around you?

217
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,580
You may not even be able to protect yourself.

218
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,500
Will a straw

219
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,780
be able to scare away crows in crops?

220
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,100
I have an idea.

221
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,020
It's called Scarecrow Project.

222
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,260
I'll give you everything you want.

223
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,700
I'll give you all my resources.

224
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,100
When you are strong enough,

225
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,500
let's

226
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,700
protect our crops.

227
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,700
You want me to be your backer?

228
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,380
I need brothers in the police station.

229
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,340
Let me put it this way.

230
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,860
We use each other.

231
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,220
Besides, what I asked you to do

232
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,020
is what the police do.

233
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,740
Not only will it not break the law,

234
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,100
but also you will be promoted.

235
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,420
Don't rush to answer me.

236
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,260
I'll wait for your decision.

237
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,020
I hereby announce

begins now.

240
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,020
Have you read all the action reports?

241
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,740
Did they remind you of anything?

[POLICE Wu Leong Chee]

244
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,300
OK, let me tell you my question.

245
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,620
Everyone here does appear

246
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,220
at a very reasonable time and place.

247
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,700
Officer Liao's signature was on it.

248
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,780
Then Officer Liao

249
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,140
only appeared in one place.

250
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,490
How did he confirm

251
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,860
the authenticity of each report?

252
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,140
So beautiful.

253
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,580
Are you happy?

254
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,940
Lend me 100 yuan.

255
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,900
Why do you need money?

256
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,060
I heard my dad will be back soon.

257
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,540
I can't stay with you all day.

258
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,980
I was afraid you might forget me.

259
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,060
So you borrow money from you.

260
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,260
The one who owes money will always be targeted by others.

261
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,060
Who taught you that?

262

You're so smart.

264
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,340
Let me think about it.

265
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,900
OK.

He was with me every day.

276
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,140
Where did he get the time?

277
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,300
Could it be that she's not Xiang's daughter?

278
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,700
Her daughter is fake.

279

No.

280

Not for no reason.

346

Officer Liao said

349
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,780
he would beat anyone who has taken drugs.

350
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,180
That shouldn't be the reason why he hit you.

351
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,020
Is it a personal grudge?

352

[Real estate index declines for eight consecutive quarters]

353
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,260
That's bullying.

354
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,260
You won't believe him, will you?

355
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,140
Officer Liao.

356
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,180
Don't we know

357
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,380
what kind of person he is?

358
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,540
But what will reporters write?

359
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,380
Will it affect the public's perception of us?

360
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,100
That's the key.

361
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,820
You were impatient

362
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,940
and fell into their trap.

363
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,100
I understand.

364
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,820
But he deliberately made a fuss

365
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,460
to get himself a trump card.

366
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,340
Even if he is guilty in the future,

367
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,250
investigate him again.

368
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,260
The reporters

369
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,060
will come up

370
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,260
like sharks.

371
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,060
Even if he's really a drug dealer,

372
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,660
they will report it a frame-up

373
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,340
for personal revenge.

374
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,340
I can't control what they report.

375
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,820
How about this, Officer Liao?

376
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,940
Go back and rest for a while.

377
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,730
Let's wait until

378
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,660
this public opinion turmoil passes.

What are you doing here?

385
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,650
Xiang is released today.

386
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,540
I miss him.

387
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,420
I need to talk to him.

can you play with me?

390
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,420
Xi,

391
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,220
listen to me.

392
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,220
Go play alone.

393
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,260
I'll come to you later.

394
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,540
Go.

395
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,780
Tell me what you want to tell him.

396
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,740
I'll tell him.

397
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,980
Okay.

398
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,380
Here's the thing.

399
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,130
Since Xiang appeared,

400
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,380
I've made a lot of money.

401
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,460
But I didn't touch any drugs.

402
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,860
I am a well-known drug criminal, though.

403
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,380
Even if I go now to the police station

404
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,100
and turn myself in

405
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,460
the police won't believe me.

406
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,340
They don't believe me.

407
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,100
He has done a lot for you.

408
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,660
He hasn't come out yet.

409
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,900
What else do you want?

410
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,980
This thing has been on the market recently.

411
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,660
It sells very well.

412
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,740
The point is its low cost due to artificial synthesis

413
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,540
and it's easy to get addicted.

414
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,260
It'll make a lot of money.

415
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,340
I have to count Xiang in.

416
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,130
We're not interested in this.

417
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,140
But it's a big profit.

418
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,700
Let's talk outside.

How dare you!

Your machines have been tampered.

428
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,940
I can't take anything out.

429
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,380
Then take your time.

431

Not bad.

Using this trick to sell drugs?

436
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,650
Isn't Da Hui arrested recently?

437
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,100
The police are watching us closely.

438
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,780
We can't be so bold.

439
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,300
Besides,

440
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,700
I won't let him in even if he's not my friend.

441
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,700
What if he can't get it?

442
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,220
You're bullying him.

443
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,610
Let's all depend on our abilities.

444
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,300
Whose?

445
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,370
I don't know.

446
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,180
I really don't know.

447
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,020
Someone asked me to sell it.

448
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,500
We split the profit in half.

449
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,860
This new type is very popular these days.

450
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,460
I guess the rumors I heard in prison are true.

451
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,820
What rumor?

452
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,490
Big Hui's boss has taken action.

453
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,100
His name is Song Cai.

454
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,340
He manages the warehouse for Cai Zhiming.

455
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,340
Looks like he's also doing his own business.

456
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,020
Why don't we talk to him?

457
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,330
Xi.

458
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,210
Think about what else you want to bring.

459
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,820
It's enough to have you.

460
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,500
Have you brought enough books?

461
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,340
Be good.

462
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,700
Put it on.

463
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,780
It's windy outside.

464
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,860
It's a little cold at night.

465
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,220
Here, this sleeve.

466
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,620
It's my turn to take care of Xi.

467
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,740
Where are you taking her?

468
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,020
I can't explain to you right now.

469
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,620
I'll call her dad directly.

470
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,220
I'm the landlord here.

471
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,780
Take her away from here.

472
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,420
Who will take responsibility if anything happens to her?

473
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,500
I understand your concerns.

474
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,060
But if Xi stays here,

475
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,260
she might be in danger.

476
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
What danger?

477
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,860
Dad.

478
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,100
How can you

479
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,540
entrust Xi to an outsider?

480
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,140
Aren't you afraid something might happen again?

481
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,380
It's not her fault for what happened to Da Hui.

482
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,100
Xi is much safer

483
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,340
with her than staying with me.

484
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,020
Don't worry.

485
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,970
Let's go.

486
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,060
I have a lot to discuss with you.

487
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,060
Officer Liao hopes we can find evidence

488
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,540
of Song Cai's involvement in drug trafficking during this visit.

489
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,980
He is very cautious.

490
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,260
I talked to him.

491
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,020
He refused to admit that he had drugs.

492
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,380
To get such a big drug lord

493
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,700
to admit that he's selling drugs,

494
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,540
it's not that simple.

495
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,380
I'll try later.

496
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,780
I'll talk to him.

497
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,210
Excuse me

498
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,620
for keeping you waiting.

499
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,340
Mr. Song Cai has

500
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,380
a very important meeting

501
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,500
to attend.

502
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,500
So,

503
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,660
he may not be able to receive you today.

504
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,020
It's okay.

505
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,060
We can wait for him.

506
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,970
I'll be frank then.

507
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,740
We don't want to

508
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,340
have any contact

509
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,540
with people like you.

510
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,260
What's wrong with people like us?

511
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,860
As far as I know,

512
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,460
you were released from prison

513
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,540
and you're involved with the drug dealers.

514
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,410
If you appear next to Mr. Song Cai,

515
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,700
it is bound to have

516
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,100
a very bad effect on us.

517
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,980
So I'm sorry.

518
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,810
I have to force Song Cai to come to me

519
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,340

Write down everyone you know.

523

On the streets of Hua City,

all those who sell the goods of Song Cai

525

That's all I have.

529
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,820
It's Officer Yu.

530
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,820
Let me talk to him for a second.

531
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,620
What can I do for you?

532
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,940
I went to see Wu Ming's family.

533
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,780
How are they?

534
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,460
You didn't seem to care about them.

535
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,100
How do you know that?

536
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,500
I have family too.

537
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,780
Maybe I know more about how to care about people.

538
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,500
I know

539
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,100
you can't let it go.

540
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,260
I suggest you forget it.

541
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,180
Forget?

542
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,260
Tell me how to forget.

543
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,060
You don't feel guilty at all

544
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,050
about Wu Ming's death, do you?

545
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,660
Let me tell you.

546
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,260
From the moment he put on his police uniform,

547
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,820
he knew this day would come.

548
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,860
Don't you think so?

549
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,340
If not,

550
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,620
would you have listened to me then

551
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,860
with that gun?

552
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,620
If something happens to me one day,

553
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,620
will you take care of his family for me?

554
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,940
As long as it's within my ability,

555
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,460
I will do it.

556
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,020
What shall we do next

557
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,180
with the Dark Night Project?

558
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,460
Pause for now.

But I have another thing

560
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,020
for you.

561
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,300
The Education Bureau will arrange a speech next Monday.

562
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,810
I need someone to do it.

563
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,700
I recommend you to be the speaker.

564
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,420
Get ready.

565
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,740
I see.

566
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,740
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

567
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,900
Has Officer Yu been called back?

568
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,100
Yes.

569
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,660
I called him back.

570
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,340
I still need his cooperation.

571
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
In that case,

572
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,700
just let him do it.

573
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,500
It's not the time yet.

574
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,260
He's still too young.

575
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,740
There are some things I still

576
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,460
need to keep an eye on myself.

577
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,060
You're still the same.

578
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,340
You lack trust in anyone.

579
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,700
What do you think I should do?

580
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,900
You always push the problem to others.

581
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,780
You have an answer in your heart,

582
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,699
but you still want someone to say it for you.

583
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,620
You know me best.

four, five.

587
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,420
Five times six equals thirty.

588
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,100
Six times six equals thirty-six.

589

One is missing.

Let's go.

Where are you going?

595
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,180
To save them.

596
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,620
They are all dead.

597
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,700
I know they are dead.

598
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,700
But they are my comrades.

Even if I'm dying,

I'll bring their remains back.

I never thought I'd survive.

to transport drugs.

Only hiding here can no one find out.

621

This is the safest way to transport drugs.
