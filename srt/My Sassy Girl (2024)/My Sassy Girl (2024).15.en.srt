00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,240
I can't see now.

195
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
And you can't speak.

196
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,040
What should we do?

197
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,160
Why does the floor smell like rosin?

198
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,320
Are there

199
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,920
candles on the floor?

200
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,160
Yes.

201
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,600
Then it would be easy to catch fire.

202
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,320
Where?

203
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,560
How can I

204
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
get there?

205
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,440
Mr. Lu.

206
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,440
Mr. Lu.

207
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,040
Mr. Lin is in danger in Wuyi Town.

208
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,680
Please send reinforcements.

209
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,000
Let's go, right now.

210
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,920
Okay.

211
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,000
Zhou.

212
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,720
Prepare the horse.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes.

214
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,760
Miss Wen.

215
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
It's not a good time.

216
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,840
Please go home.

218
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,640
Mr. Lu is going to catch the bad guys.

219
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,640
I want to see it.

220
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,240
He'll be awesome.

221
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,800
I'm going, too.

222
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,800
If Nanyi can make it here,

223
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,000
we'll be able to untie each other.

224
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,440
But if she knocks over the candle,

225
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,200
we'll both go up in flames.

226
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,160
But the placement of the candles...

227
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,320
It should work

228
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,640
if we do it that way.

229
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,800
One, two. Forward.

230
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,280
Three, four. Jump.

231
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,560
One, two.

232
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,040
Forward.

233
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,240
Three, four.

234
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,480
Jump.

235
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,880
I got it!

236
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,660
One, two. Forward.

237
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,320
One, two.

238
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,600
Forward.

239
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,520
One.

240
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,800
Two.

241
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,440
Forward.

242
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,600
Three, four.

243
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,800
Jump.

244
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,600
Three.

245
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
Four.

246
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,960
Jump.

247
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,400
Nanyi.

248
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,280
Don't be afraid.

249
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,160
Is there a fire?

250
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,880
It's OK.

251
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh.

252
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Five, six.

253
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,520
Sideways.

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,800
Five.

255
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,840
Six.

256
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,600
Sideways.

257
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,160
Seven.

258
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,440
Eight.

259
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,320
Seven, eight.

260
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,840
Big step.

261
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,160
Big step.

262
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,360
Fire!

263
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,040
Fire?

264
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,100
Where?

265
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,200
Squat down.

266
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,960
Squat down.

267
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,800
Squat down?

268
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,800
Yes.

269
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,920
Nine.

270
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,080
Ten.

271
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,680
Turn around.

272
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,740
Nine, ten.

273
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,140
Turn around.

274
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,400
I found you, Lin Qingqiu.

275
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,520
Get me out of this.

276
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,920
It's really dangerous here.

277
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,600
We need to get out of here

278
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,880
and signal them

279
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,680
to come get us.

280
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,120
Let's go.

281
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,720
What a perfect couple.

282
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Where are you going

283
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,000
in such a hurry?

284
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,880
Who are you?

285
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,840
Bad guys.

286
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,320
We have no grudge against you.

287
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,800
Why did you kidnap us?

288
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,080
You can break my trap so well.

289
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,320
You two must be lovers.

290
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,560
And unfortunately,

291
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,840
what I hate the most

292
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,560
is lovers in pairs.

293
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,600
So, one of you

294
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,560
must die today.

295
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,080
If you dare to commit murder,

296
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,840
I will not spare you.

297
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,560
Right.

298
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,200
You're standing in front

299
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,360
of the prefect of Jinzhou.

300
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,880
Killing a court official

301
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,320
will face a death sentence.

302
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,440
The prefect of Jinzhou?

303
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,480
A court official?

304
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,520
Death sentence?

305
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,680
Don't.

306
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,520
Don't.

307
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,040
Don't be so funny, OK?

308
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,640
I'm wearing a mask.

309
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,520
Who will recognize me?

310
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,880
One of you must die today.

311
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,920
From now on, Wuyi Town

312
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,320
will give birth

313
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,960
to another poignant love story.

314
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,200
He likes stories?

315
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,000
Just thinking about it
brings me to tears.

316
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,080
The fireworks have gone off.

317
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,520
Lu Bai and his men
should be on their way.

318
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,520
I have to find a way to stall.

319
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,880
What a pity.

320
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,720
Pity for what?

321
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,360
Pity her, Miss Lu.

322
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,440
She's had a life of fame.

323
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,160
But,

324
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,280
Who'd have thought

325
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
she'd end up here?

326
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,520
In the future,

327
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,800
who will write those

328
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,080
heartbreakingly beautiful

329
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,320
love stories

330
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,440
to the people?

331
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,480
Right.

332
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,520
I'm Daling's best storyteller,

333
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,600
Lu Nanyi.

334
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm good at telling
all kinds of stories,

335
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,680
especially love stories.

336
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
If you let us go,

337
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,760
I will

338
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,280
tell you the best stories.

339
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,360
Each time, a new one.

340
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,760
I love stories.

341
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,920
Especially poignant love stories.

342
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,360
Tell me one.

343
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,000
If you tell well,

344
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
I'll let you go.

345
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,080
If you don't,

346
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,440
I'll kill you.

347
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,000
Once upon a time,

348
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,360
there was a

349
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,360
Garden State.

350
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
In the Garden State,

351
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,760
there is a beautiful princess.

352
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,480
Her stepmother tricked her
into eating a poisoned apple

353
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,800
because she was jealous of her beauty.

354
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,240
The cruel stepmother

355
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,000
poisoned the princess in the forest.

356
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,000
She's dead?

357
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,160
That was a good ending.

358
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,320
But your story
has nothing to do with love.

359
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,400
It doesn't work.

360
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,240
At that moment,

361
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,800
there appeared

362
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
a young prince

363
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,560
with an extraordinary demeanor.

364
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,600
Oh?

365
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,120
The young prince saw his beloved dead.

366
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
He decided

367
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,600
to die

368
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,560
with the princess.

369
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,280
How can you stalled by this?

370
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,200
Why is she alive again?

371
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,440
That's because

372
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the young prince touched the heaven

373
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,640
and the heaven

374
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,280
brought the princess back to life.

375
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,580
Ehh...

376
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,600
So,

377
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
And so she came to life.

378
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,240
And then?

379
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,080
Then...

380
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,200
Then

381
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,880
the young prince took the princess

382
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,560
out of the forest

383
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,560
and lived happily

384
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,320
ever after with her.

385
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,520
No.

386
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,360
That's a happy ending.

387
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,560
I don't like it.

388
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,420
