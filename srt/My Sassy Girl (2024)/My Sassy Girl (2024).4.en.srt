But unexpectedly, on the wedding night,

192
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Young Master Sun saw with his own eyes

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
that his wife jumped into the pond,

194
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,560
turned into a carp, and soared away.

195
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
The people who went
to the banquet at that time

196
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,040
also saw the carp leaping
out of the water.

197
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,680
I was there, too.

198
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
I was stunned.

199

Don't go, my lady.

200
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't go, my lady.

from the Jiang family in Licheng?

232

What's wrong with her?

235

Miss Jiang's body was found dead
in a wine jar.

In her mouth,

237
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,120
there is a gold finger ring
with your name.

I met her wedding procession.

I had no choice but to say yes.

313

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,360
and very precious.

380
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,920
Rumor has it

381
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,640
that it was accidentally bought
by the master of the Jiang family.

382
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,160
He treated it as a treasure.

383
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
It's raining.

384
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,280
Be quick.

385
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,560
Go over there and take shelter.

386
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,600
No way.

387
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,800
Sir.

388
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,240
Please have a try.

389
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Just print 20 copies.

390
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,560
No.

391
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,560
Only ten.

392
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,080
Trust me.

393
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,280
This must be an exciting story.

394
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,520
Ten copies?

395
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,080
Even one is no good.

396
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,200
You are a girl.

397
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,200
It is not easy to make money outside.

398
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,480
You should find a good family to marry.

399
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,880
Who says the only way out
for a woman is to marry?

400
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,480
You look so poor.

401
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Why don't you mortgage
this bracelet to me?

402
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,560
I can print ten copies for you.

403
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
This is my ancestral gold
and jade bracelet.

404
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,280
It's priceless.

405
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,200
Alright.

406
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,520
Please get out of here.

407
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,920
Go away.

408
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,400
Oh my.

409
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,320
Lu.

410
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
What are you doing here?

411
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,760
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

412
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,800
So

413
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,400
should I pawn my bracelet?

414
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,120
No.

415
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Let's use the last ten liang of silver

416
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,440
to make a fortune.

417
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Eat a sweet potato

418
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,400
and you'll have good luck.

419
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,360
Come on.

420
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,640
Give me the payment for the goods.

421
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,920
Otherwise,

422
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,680
we'll take your things.

423
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,080
There is still half a year
to pay for the goods.

424
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,520
What are you doing here now?

425
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,480
Come on.

426
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,120
Take away whatever is valuable here.

427
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,640
How dare you?

428
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
What are you doing?

429
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,280
Lu.

430
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,800
They know Mr. Fu is in jail.

431
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
They wanted us to hand over the leather.

432
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,640
But the delivery date

433
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,120
is still half a year away.

434
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,200
Half a year?

435
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
If he is beheaded,

436
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,040
who would give us the goods?

437
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,520
Give me the deposit

438
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,880
or give me the goods.

439
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,920
The case is not settled yet.

440
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,080
You're looting a burning house.

441
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,960
No.

442
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,640
I am a small merchant.

443
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,240
I just know to make money.

444
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,480
Come on.

445
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,120
Take everything valuable here.

446
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,800
Yes.

447
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,600
You can't.

448
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,400
You can't do this.

449
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,560
You can't take them.

450
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,720
Mr. Fu hasn't come back yet.

451
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,520
You can't do this.

452
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,190
Get out of the way.

453
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,200
You can't do this.

454
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,680
Stop.

455
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,080
I'll pay

456
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,840
for Fu Wenyuan's debt.

457
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,760
Lu.

458
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,720
Lu.

459
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,360
That's all the money.

460
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,820
Give me that.

461
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,280
Seriously?

462
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,840
That's too little.

463
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,280
This is
my ancestral gold and jade bracelet.

464
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,520
It's priceless.

465
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,520
Good.

466
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,000
Mr. Fu is really lucky

467
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,400
to have you as his lover.

468
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,960
Alright.

469
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,760
Go.

470
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,920
Lu.

471
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,760
Are you all right?

472
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,640
What am I supposed to do?

473
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,080
How can I help Fu Wenyuan?

474
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,920
Don't worry.

475
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,280
It happened half a year ago.

476
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,280
Lots of evidence

477
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,560
can't be found out exactly.

478
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,000
You have to be patient.

479
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,800
We can find out for sure.

480
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,920
Let me see him.

481
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,560
He trusts me.

482
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,560
He will tell me something.

483
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,960
OK.

484
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,400
[Prison]

485
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,440
Lu.

486
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,400
You have no fear at all.

487
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
What are you doing here?

488
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,640
Now all the evidence is against you.

489
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,880
Although it's clearly a frame-up,

490
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,440
the evidence is overwhelming.

491
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,760
You can't argue.

492
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,440
Tell me honestly.

493
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,840
Do you know Jiang Mengyu?

494
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,520
I swear.

495
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,720
If I tell a lie,

496
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,120
I will be cursed.

497
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Then think about it.

498
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,480
Has anyone else been able to prove

499
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,600
the white fish jade pendant
was given to you by Jiang Mengyu?

500
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,840
I remember she had a maid.

501
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,400
She's called

502
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,680
Yu.

503
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,880
When the bandits robbed,

504
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,200
she was scared.

505
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,870
I don't know if she remembers.

506
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,320
Yu.

507
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,840
Yes.

508
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,000
All right.

509
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,080
Let's not talk about it.

510
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,520
Come on.

511
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,080
You will have good luck
if you eat sweet potatoes.

512
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,160
In this world,

513
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,600
only you believe me unconditionally.

514
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,120
That's for sure.

515
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,720
We have gone
through hard times together.

516
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,000
Lu.

517
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,200
Wait till I get out.

518
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,800
Let's set off fireworks together.

519
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,120
