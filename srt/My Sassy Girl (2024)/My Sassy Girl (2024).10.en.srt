[Episode 10]

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,240
Don't touch it!

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,440
Are you alright?

14
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,360
I'm fine.

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,920
Take down the painting and put it away.

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,960
Yes.

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,280
Sorry for my rudeness earlier.

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,360
What's wrong with this painting?

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
Why are you all so afraid of it?

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,520
This painting is haunted.

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,000
You must not look at it directly.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
I'm certain it's what killed Mr. Qian.

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,080
I've heard there's been a lot of trouble
in your household lately.

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,040
It all started

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
when Mr. Qian got this painting.

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,160
That day,

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,640
Mr. Qian acquired a peculiar painting

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,720
that everyone said

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,840
harbored a vicious female ghost.

30
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,240
But he insisted

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,160
that it held magical powers.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,640
He hired a traveling Taoist priest

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,320
to perform an exorcism.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,400
The priest took the money
and performed an elaborate ritual,

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
claiming the female ghost
had been banished

36
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,400
and all was safe.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Mr. Qian delightedly
took his word for it.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,960
From then on,

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,320
he couldn't stop
thinking about the painting.

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,240
After enshrining it for three days
as instructed by the priest,

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
he eagerly unrolled it.

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,240
Since then,

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
strange occurrences
have plagued the house.

44
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,560
"Confucius speaks not
of the supernatural."

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,320
In my opinion,

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,600
the so-called priest was just a fraud
who used ghost stories

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
to scam money.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
If it was about money,

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,240
why resort to murder?

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,320
Lin Qingqiu,

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
would it kill you not to contradict me?

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,160
Mr. Lu,

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
would it kill you to stay quiet?

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,320
It was the female ghost!

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,360
Jiu,

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,400
mind your manners.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,880
Please forgive the servants

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,360
for their lack of discipline.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,400
It's alright.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,560
Tell us

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,920
what you saw.

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,880
When the painting first arrived,

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,560
I was the one
who stored it for Mr. Qian.

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
One night, I stole a peek at it

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,240
and saw a beautiful woman

66
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,440
step out of it,

67
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,680
but

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
when I reached out,

69
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,320
she vanished.

70
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,040
Ms. Zhu,

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,680
do you think Mr. Qian

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,720
was bewitched?

73
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,760
Ever since he got the painting,

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,440
strange things have indeed
been happening around the house.

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,640
Exactly!

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,560
Every night,

77
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,160
we heard weird laughs

78
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,600
coming from Mr. Qian's chamber.

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
So

80
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,520
it was all because of this painting?

81
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,280
This painting is haunted.

82
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,680
Please think twice before you unroll it.

83
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,480
This is my evidence.

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
I can't let irrelevant people see it.

85
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,600
Mr. Lu,

86
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,280
be careful when you unroll it at night.

87
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
The woman in the painting

88
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,440
might just walk out toward you.

89
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:50,960
You...!

90
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,440
Lin Qingqiu,

91
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
there's a limit to my patience!

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm just concerned for you.

93
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,720
I've told you

94
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,960
everything I know, sirs.

95
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
Please find a way

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,160
to bring peace back to our household.

97
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,680
- I...
- Please rise.

98
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,120
I will do everything I can

99
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,080
to uncover the truth.

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,760
Thank you, sir.

101
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,000
Flowers!

102
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,080
Clay oven rolls!!

103
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,680
Lin the Troublemaker,

104
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,760
you've meddled enough in my case.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Isn't it time you left?

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,640
Mr. Lu,

107
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,880
where do you plan
to start investigating?

108
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,920
Mr. Qian's body was charred like coal.

109
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,640
I'll have my coroner examine it first.

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,200
This is definitely not
a simple murder-for-money case.

111
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,240
The killer must have other motives.

112
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,600
Flowers!

113
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,360
Oh?

114
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,400
You sound confident.

115
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,800
Do you

116
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,440
already have leads?

117
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,280
To find leads,

118
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,200
we need to investigate further.

119
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
This is the capital,

120
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,640
not your jurisdiction.

121
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,040
You have no authority
to investigate here.

122
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,080
Mr. Lu,

123
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
care to make a bet?

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,420
I've got no money

125
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,360
for bets.

126
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,200
You don't dare to bet?

127
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,800
Are you afraid I'll steal your thunder?

128
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,800
Fine, let's bet.

129
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,920
I'm not afraid of you.

130
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,000
In fact,

131
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,200
let's make it big.

132
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,200
Mr. Lu,

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
hold your horses.

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
Qingqiu always wins his bets.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,200
He's never lost.

136
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
That's because he hasn't faced me.

137
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,400
Fine.

138
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
Let's make a bet

139
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
and see who can solve the case first.

140
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,480
If you win,

141
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,040
I'll resign.

142
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,520
But

143
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
if you lose,

144
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,920
just give me a pass to the archive.

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,120
The stakes are too high!

146
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,320
Mr. Lu can't afford to lose.

147
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,360
Who says I can't afford to lose?

148
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,120
The bet is on.

149
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
I'll authorize you
to assist in the investigation.

150
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,400
If I lose,

151
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,120
not only will I give you a pass,

152
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,480
but I'll also resign,
go back to my hometown,

153
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,880
and never become an official again.

154
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,680
Lin Qingqiu,

155
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,840
prepare to resign

156
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,960
and return to a life of frivolity.

157
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,440
Once I win, everyone in the capital
will idolize me.

158
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,440
Then, I'll magnanimously spare you.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,800
Good idea.

160
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,880
Great idea!

161
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I'll have my coroner perform an autopsy
in the coffin home now.

162
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,200
Just you wait!

163
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,880
No need.

164
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,760
My coroner is already there.

165
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,520
What?

166
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,480
When did they go?

167
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,320
It's Yin. She lives nearby.

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Let's go, Nanyi.

169
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,880
Hey!

170
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,200
Miss Gong, I've heard a lot about you.

171
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,440
It's such an honor

172
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
to perform an autopsy with you today.

173
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,960
Oh,

174
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,480
you are too kind.

175
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,480
You are too kind.

176
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,320
Gosh,

177
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,360
the skin is peeling right off.

178
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,120
How burnt is the body?

179
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,320
No,

180
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,720
this is not a layer of skin.

181
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,520
It's fabric.

182
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,600
Fabric?

183
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,520
Yes,

184
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,520
the deceased

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,120
had on many layers of clothing.

186
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,040
Many, many layers.

187
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,160
That's odd.

188
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,240
The coldest winter days are long past.

189
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,960
Why did he put on so many layers?

190
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
What's this?

191
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
He was in a fierce fire.

192
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,640
This must be ash.

193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
Inhaling ash

194
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,720
can cause suffocation

195
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,400
even if the flames don't kill you.

196
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
That's not it.

197
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
The texture is different.

198
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
Look, the black ash

199
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,560
is mixed with blue powder.

200
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,480
I've never seen this

201
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
in burnt bodies before.

202
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,080
Well,

203
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,880
can you identify what it is?

204
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,480
The blue powder

205
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
has been contaminated by the black ash.

206
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,720
It's impossible
to separate them for analysis.

207
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,520
Oh,

208
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,960
by the way, Yin,

209
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,480
why isn't Miss Lu here?

210
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,920
Didn't she say

211
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
she wanted to observe your autopsies

212
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
to help with her storybook writing?

213
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,600
Nanyi hurt her back

214
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,360
at the Qian Residence today,

215
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,120
so she couldn't come.

216
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,200
Careful.

217
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,080
Don't do that.

218
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,160
Ouch.

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,800
It hurts!

220
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Stay still.

221
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,640
I told you

222
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,160
you should let Yin handle my back.

223
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
She only likes dealing with corpses.

224
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,080
Speaking of which,

225
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,560
Mr. Qian died a bizarre death.

226
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,920
How do you think Yin's autopsy is going?

227
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,760
Listen,

228
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,560
just focus on getting better.

229
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,680
Don't worry about other things.

230
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
No way.

231
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,000
I still need to go around the streets.

232
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,760
Now that I'm in the capital,

233
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,080
I should open a bookstore here.

234
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,920
I, Miss Lu,

235
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,480
mustn't let down my readers here.

236
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,440
Ow!

237
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,960
Why are you here?

238
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,320
No particular reason.

239
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,480
I just wanted to watch

240
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,600
and learn.

241
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,920
Get out!

242
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,360
Yes, sir.

243
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,640
Good luck, sir!

244
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,080
Why did you push me away?

245
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,360
Shouldn't we pick up

246
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,960
where we left off?

247
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,920
Lin Qingqiu,

248
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,640
have you broken
off your engagement with Miss Wen yet?

249
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,800
How dare you...?

250
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,720
Shame on you!

251
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,320
Get off my bed!

252
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,400
Why are you still here?

253
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,200
I need to sleep now.

[The Murder Case of Qian Yu]

255
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,880
Mr. Qian was famously wealthy

256
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,040
and had no children.

257
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,920
He was indeed

258
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,000
an easy target.

259
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,800
This case
is under your jurisdiction, sir.

260
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,000
With The Lord Mayor absent,

261
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,640
solving it before Lin Qingqiu

262
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,680
will demonstrate
your ability even better!

263
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,760
Here, everyone follows your lead.

264
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,240
Even if Lin Qingqiu
wants to beat you to solve the case,

265
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
he needs help to do it.

266
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,640
Isn't that right?

267
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,160
Tomorrow, notify everyone
in the Jingzhao Office

268
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,600
that we must find the Taoist priest

269
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,760
even if it means
turning the capital upside down.

270
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,440
Understood.

271
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
On my turf,

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,080
there's no way he can solve the case
faster than I can.

273
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,080
Stop wasting your time.

274
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,120
If that Taoist priest

275
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,200
approached Mr. Qian
with an ulterior motive,

276
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
he must have faked his identity

277
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
and covered his tracks.

278
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,200
Who let you in?

279
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,000
And

280
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,320
who gave you permission to eavesdrop?

281
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,160
I was just passing by.

282
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,440
I'm offering some advice

283
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,440
because

284
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
I don't want an easy win.

285
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,320
That

286
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,280
would be boring.

287
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,800
When betting with you,

288
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
there should always be an extra wager:

289
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,880
the loser must stay quiet forever.

290
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,840
Sure.

291
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,280
Since the outcome is still undecided,

292
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,160
feel free to raise the stakes anytime.

293
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
I'm all in.

294
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,200
Fine!

295
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,760
We must not interfere
with each other's investigation,

296
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,400
and the loser must be paraded
through the streets.

297
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,760
Deal?

298
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,960
A gentleman's word...

299
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,040
Is his bond!

On the day of your parade,

301
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,240
I'll open a cask of fine spirit

302
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,200
to celebrate.

it won't be you

Five cash each.

You're welcome.

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,640
would you like a copy

318
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,040

Not bad.

Miss Lu.

327
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,240
The two of you must have invited me over

328
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,280
because you have
a lot to say to me, right?

Go ahead.

for grace and poise.

339
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,760
You flatter me, Miss Lu.

kind to commoners like you.

344
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,720
There's no need to feel nervous.

345
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,400
Nervous?

346
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,720
Why would I feel nervous?

347
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,920

and even mistresses.

370
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,840
I've heard of some official wives

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,840
who, out of jealousy,

372
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,280
throw fits and cause a scene.

373
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
A married woman should obey her husband.

374
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,760
Such behavior is just unbecoming.

375
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,240
The official wife

376
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,880
should have the dignity and grace

377
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,320
fitting her status.

378
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,120
Stop.

379
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,720
What are you doing?

380
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,120
Interesting...

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,000
Very interesting.

382
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
Miss Wen,

383
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,200
I've never heard

384
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,280
such shameless remarks.

385
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,720
I must write them down

386
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,320
for my storybooks.

387
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,120
What...?

388
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,240
What did you say?

389
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,320
I said

390
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
you were shameless.

391
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,080
You call women crazy for love

392
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,520
fools.

393
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,220
Yet you show

394
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,520
understanding and forgiveness to those

395
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,880
who break their vows.

396
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,560
In my opinion,

397
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,080
instead of being the daughter
of the grand chancellor,

398
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,400
you should

399
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,900
go and run a cathouse.

400
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,640
I'll rip your mouth off!

401
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,760
Yunxi,

402
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,320
don't be rude.

403
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,960
What is a cathouse?

404
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,360
Oh dear,

405
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,520
you are truly sheltered

406
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,320
and ignorant of the world outside.

407
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,600
Miss Lu,

408
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,640
it seems you are unfit
to be my head maid.

409
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,920
You tend to make

410
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,120
inappropriate remarks.

411
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,200
Gosh!

412
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,080
Miss Wen,

413
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,920
even after such an insult,

414
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,600
all you can say

415
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
is "inappropriate"?

416
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,000
If you truly want to be with him,

417
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,240
I have a duty
to teach you proper etiquette.

418
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,920
You don't need to feel anxious

419
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,520
or uneasy.

420
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,880
Just stop feeling inferior

421
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,600
and start learning

422
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,520
how to serve your husband properly.

423
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,040
Wake up to reality, Miss Wen.

424
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,920
Lin Qingqiu

425
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
has no feelings for you.

426
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,320
And it seems

427
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,080
you are not into him either.

428
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,440
Our parents

429
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,160
want us together.

430
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,920
True love

431
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,080
only exists in storybooks.

432
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,400
The so-called "feelings"

433
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,240
mean nothing.

434
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,440
Right.

435
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,800
Miss Wen,

436
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,080
I sincerely hope

437
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
you can have a romantic encounter.

438
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,280
The more dramatic it is,

439
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,320
the better.

440
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,400
It'd be best

441
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,160
if a man falls from the sky
right into your arms

442
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,040
and becomes your husband.

443
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,120
Don't look at me like that.

444
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,560
One day,

445
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,920
when you meet someone
who makes your heart race,

446
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,120
you'll understand

447
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,480
what I just said.

448
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,760
Miss Lu,

449
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,800
I am really confused,

450
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,040
but the future Princess of Anding

451
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,440
can only be me.

452
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,480
Miss Wen,

453
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,600
when Lin Qingqiu and I get married,

454
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,160
don't cry.

455
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,160
Remember to always maintain

456
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
the dignity and elegance

457
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,880
that fit your status.

458
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,480
