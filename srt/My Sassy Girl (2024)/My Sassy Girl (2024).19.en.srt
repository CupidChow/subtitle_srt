He sees me as a rival.

192

Even if I try to be kind,

193

what I say will be taken as snide words.

194
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,280
Actually, Lu Bai is a good man.

195
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,720
He's just

196
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,400
kind of stubborn.

197
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,600
He's a smart guy.

198
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,160
He'll get over it.

199
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,040
Okay.

Come on.

203

It's too fat.

Alright.

Try this.

208
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Too lean.

209
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
I'm going to puke, Mr. Lei.

210

I know you two are close,

211
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,960

make others envious.

212
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,160
Alas.

213

how tense the vibe here is these days.

because of Mr. Zhou.

Why do you ask us

218
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,880
to come here today?

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,880

Okay.

225
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
I've been in the capital for a while.

226
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,040
I can't help much
with the investigation.

227

why is it so sudden?

are together, so...

in private?

Mr. Fu.

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,520
I didn't know what love was.

242
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,520
But once I've had a taste,

243
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I realize

244
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,680
that all the good things in this world

245
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,160
are just like that.

246
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,240
Once you've tasted the sweetness,

247
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,960
how can you let it go?

248
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,640
Right?

249
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
I can do nothing about it.

250
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,320
It's no relief

251
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,200
to be stuck with it.

Okay, what is it?

255
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
Nanyi doesn't love the jewelry, flowers,

256
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,400
and fancy clothing.

257
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,000
She just likes to watch
evanescent fireworks.

258
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,760
I've got a whole wagon
full of fireworks.

259

Now,

260
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,040
it'll just have to be her wedding gift.

261
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,360
Then why don't you tell her yourself?

262
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,840
There are things

263
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,160
you don't have to say.

264
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,360
She understands it.

265
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,880
I'd like you to give her

266
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,840
these fireworks.

267
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,880
I'm sure

268
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,440
it'll be very beautiful

269
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,960
on her wedding night.

270
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Even if you're leaving,

271
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,480
you should tell Nanyi.

272
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,360
After all, you really liked her.

273
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,920
Besides,

274
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,720
she'll feel even more guilty

275
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
if you leave without saying goodbye.

276
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,520
Right.

277
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,760
The order in which people appear
is really important.

278
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,440
If I hadn't

279
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,200
seen those two go through so much

280
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,000
to get to where they are today,

281
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,280
I'd really hope you'd get what you want.

282
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Come on. Mr. Fu.

283
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,680
Best wishes.

284
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,920
Can't sleep?

285
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,680
What are you sitting here for?

286
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,200
It's quiet here.

287
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,600
I've asked Lei Yu to retrieve

288
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,120
all the case files
of Grand Preceptor Ji's daughter's tomb.

289
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,880
Back then, Ji was a powerful man

290
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,920
and loved his only daughter very much.

291
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,880
Ji Xia died young.

292
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,960
So

293
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,960
Ji gathered all the treasures
in the country

294
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,200
and put them in his daughter's crypt,

295
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,880
leaving the best for her.

296
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,320
But he didn't realize

297
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,080
how much trouble it would cause.

298
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,040
Yes.

299
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,000
Less than two years
after Ji Xia's death,

300
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,560
Grand Preceptor Ji was also executed

301
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,400
for cliquing.

302
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,800
When they raided his house,

303
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,080
they only found 20,000 taels of silver
at the bottom of the lake.

304
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,800
And all the other treasures

305
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,800
were missing.

306
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,320
That's why the rumor was growing.

307
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,520
It's said

308
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,200
that Grand Preceptor Ji
hid his life's wealth

309
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,600
in his daughter's tomb,

310
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,160
inviting countless thieves.

311
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,800
The people the murderer killed
were all tomb robbers.

312
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,040
That means

313
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Grand Preceptor Ji's daughter

314
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,880
must have a special relationship

315
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,920
with the murderer.

316
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,200
But

317
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,120
who would take revenge for a young lady?

318
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Did the killer

319
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,240
have an affair

320
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,200
with Ji Xia?

321
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,080
I'm getting more confused now.

322
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,240
Then forget about it for now.

323
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,440
Think of something else.

324
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,320

to look after the business
of my book club.

What's this?

351
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,520
When we first met,

352
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,920
we were all broke.

353
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,080
You invested your
only ten taels of silver

354
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
in my storybook business.

355
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,680
Now these ten taels

356
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
have become a hundred,

357
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,760
a thousand,

358
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,800
and ten thousand taels.

359
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
Now I'm returning the ten taels to you.

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,920

363
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
only gave me ten taels.

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,960
You're so stingy.
