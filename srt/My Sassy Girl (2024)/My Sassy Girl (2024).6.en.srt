00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,100
[Episode 6]

12
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,280
How...?

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,600
My Lord,

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,320
we brought Lei back!

15
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,240
Let go of me!

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Let me fly!

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,580
Let me take off!

18
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,040
Boss!

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,080
Lei ran around Jinzhou

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,840
like a madman

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
without breaking a sweat.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,400
Then

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,320
he said he wanted
to move Elixir Tavern to the yamen

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,480
because Ms. Gong loved that place.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,560
Look,

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,600
he brought back its plaque.

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm flying away!

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
And you actually let him do it?

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,240
Yin,

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
you're here!

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,240
Let go of me!

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
I'm going to Elixir Tavern

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,560
and bringing the cook to Yin!

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,560
What are you looking at?

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,840
Carry him away!

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,540
Yes.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,200
[Elixir Tavern]
Lord Lin,

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,520
I shall take my leave now.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,160
Go.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,760
If I'm not mistaken,

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
it was also

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,680
the Five-Color Powder
that made the carps in the Sun Residence

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,760
leap out of the water and die.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,960
That's why their bones
turned black and purple.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
I planned to identify the poison

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,960
by boiling the bones,

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,680
but

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,920
that idiot tested it on himself.

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,860
So Lei was poisoned
by the Five-Color Powder?

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,760
Yes.

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
The Five-Color Powder numbs the nerves

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,800
and causes extreme excitement

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
and hallucinations.

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,280
I suspect

55
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
Sun Ren suffered from the same poison.

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,120
If that's the case,

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,480
then Sun Ren's vision

58
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,280
of Jiang Mengyu riding a carp
and turning into a fairy

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,480
was also a hallucination.

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,120
The poison of the Five-Color Powder

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
isn't lethal to humans.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,640
Perhaps

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,200
the killer poisoned Sun Ren first

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
and then disposed
of the remaining poison

65
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,960
in the fish pond to destroy evidence.

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,480
This poison

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,520
is deadly to fish.

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,560
That's why

69
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,600
the carps

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,120
leaped out of the water and died.

71
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,560
So it was all an illusion?

72
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,160
Yin,

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,520
will Lei

74
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,160
be alright?

75
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,920
Should we get Mr. Yu to check on him?

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,280
No need.

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I will cure him.

78
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,720
Slow down.

79
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,280
Why are you so jolly?

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,200
Well,

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,080
of course, I am.

82
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
We've found out
the fairy transformation is an illusion,

83
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,560
and we now know the reason
for the anomaly in the pond.

84
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,440
We're getting closer to the truth.

85
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,600
How could I not be happy?

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
Don't celebrate just yet.

87
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
As I said before,

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,400
this is an unusual case.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,560
Moreover,

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,800
the killer's motive is still unknown.

91
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
Future investigation

92
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,960
will be even trickier.

93
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
As far as I know,

94
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,200
nothing

95
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,000
can stump you, Lord Lin.

96
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,280
As far as I know,

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,480
you're getting better at flattery.

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm going to check on Fu Wenyuan.

99
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
He tends to overthink

100
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
when he's alone.

101
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,640
Don't go.

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
I tend to overthink too

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,320
when I'm alone in the yamen.

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,480
Lin Qingqiu,

105
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,360
you've been acting

106
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,880
stranger and stranger lately.

107
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,400
What do you think

108
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
is strange about me?

109
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
You've become

110
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,120
just as childish as before!

111
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
Wow.

112
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,120
These look incredible!

113
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,640
Next time, I'll teach you
how to make them.

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,440
Great.

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,280
How's Lei Yu doing?

116
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,680
Don't worry.

117
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,920
With me around,

118
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
he's not going to die.

119
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
But I think

120
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,240
his good days are numbered.

121
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,600
By the way,

122
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,520
are you alright?

123
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,360
It's rare to see you in the kitchen.

124
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,480
I can't believe you turned
a sweet potato into such fancy dim sum.

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,120
And you did this all for Fu Wenyuan?

126
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,680
Sweet potatoes are his favorite,

127
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,160
so I made some to bring to him
in prison.

128
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm worried he's not
used to the food there.

129
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,840
I really miss the old days.

130
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,320
Now,

131
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,760
my biggest wish

132
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,200
is for him to be released soon.

133
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
So

134
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,440
do you know how he feels about you?

135
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,160
Yes,

136
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,480
I know.

137
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Are you

138
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,400
going to say yes to him?

139
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,880
No,

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,000
that's impossible.

141
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,360
To me,

142
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,640
he's just a good friend.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,480
No,

144
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
a good buddy.

145
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,040
But

146
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
with him being
wrongfully imprisoned now,

147
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
he can't take another blow.

148
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,600
Once he's cleared of charges
and released,

149
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll talk to him

150
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
and make things clear.

151
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,200
Looks like my cousin
needs to work harder.

152
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,440
The sooner he acquits Fu Wenyuan,

153
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,620
the sooner you can turn Fu Wenyuan down.

154
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,400
Playing with sweet potato buns
even at a time like this?

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
Have you given up?

156
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,840
Well, well,

157
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,640
I smell jealousy.

158
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,840
Of course, I haven't given up.

159
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
If I died,

160
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,960
Lu would be devastated.

161
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,520
Do you have any of these?

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,400
With all the evidence and witnesses,

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720
you're doomed.

164
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,920
Who on earth framed me?

165
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,400
You should ask yourself

166
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
who you've offended.

167
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,280
I've offended plenty,

168
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,000
but the one
who hates me the most should be...

169
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
If I wanted you dead,

170
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
I wouldn't need to go to such lengths.

171
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,920
Sun Qinjiu has already appealed.

172
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,920
I can't guarantee

173
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
whether you'll return home safely
or be beheaded

174
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,520
in two days.

175
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,000
Lin Qingqiu,

176
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,760
if death is my fate,

177
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,760
promise me you'll clear Lu's name

178
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,120
and protect her.

179
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
Of course,

180
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,080
I'll keep Lu safe.

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,600
And please,

182
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,400
don't bother her again.

183
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,600
Though she seems carefree,

184
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,600
what happened between you two

185
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,320
has always troubled her.

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,840
Being with you

187
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,600
will only bring her misery.

188
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
Are you saying

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,160
that even if you died,

190
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,520
you wouldn't let Lu be with me?

191
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
That's one way to put it.

192
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,960
It took her over a year

193
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,280
to finally move on.

194
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,880
Don't break her heart again.

195
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,480
I'll spend my life
making up for all the pain

196
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
she's endured this past year.

197
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,760
So

198
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,520
I can't

199
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,120
grant your dying wish.

200
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,160
You...!

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,160
I've sent someone to find Yu.

202
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,520
Only she can prove your innocence now.

203
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
Hot...

204
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,160
You... I... You...

205
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't bother covering yourself.

206
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,200
I've seen plenty of corpses.

207
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,000
There's nothing special about your body.

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
Why am I here?

209
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,560
You were poisoned
by the Five-Color Powder.

210
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,720
I'm steaming out the toxins for you
with a medicinal bath.

211
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,440
Stay put if you don't want to die.

212
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,120
I see.

213
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,960
But this poison

214
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,960
brought me no pain at all.

215
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,520
I even had a nice dream.

216
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
What did you dream about?

217
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,960
Tell me.

218
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,920
What did you dream about?

219
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
I dreamed

220
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,360
that I brought the Elixir Tavern plaque

221
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,520
to you.

222
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
I also dreamed...

223
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,040
that I kissed you.

224
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,960
Is that so?

225
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,080
What you think about during the day
is what you will dream of at night.

226
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
How dare you, Lei Yu?

227
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
How dare you fantasize about me?

228
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,440
Lei Yu!

229
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,480
Let me explain!

230
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,360
Don't hit me!

231
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,240
Listen!

232
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:37,960
I...

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,600
Let go!

234
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,560
I didn't mean to...

235
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,520
You fool!

236
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,880
My Lord,

237
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
[Yu, Jiang Mengyu's maid]
we were robbed on the way to the wedding.

238
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,040
It was Master Fu who saved us.

239
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
To thank him,

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,680
Ms. Jiang gave him
the white fish jade pendant.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,280
It wasn't a love token as rumored.

242
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,880
Every word I've said is true.

243
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,200
On the night of the wedding,

244
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,240
you stayed by Ms. Jiang's side.

245
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,600
Did you notice anything unusual?

246
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,440
Everything at the banquet was fine,

247
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
but after she entered the bridechamber,

248
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
Ms. Jiang suddenly asked me
to fetch Master Jiang.

249
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,880
Did she say why?

250
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,120
Thank you.

251
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,360
You may leave now.

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes.

253
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,980
[Jinzhou Yamen]

254
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,120
Mr. Sun,

255
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,760
what brings you here?

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Ms. Lu,

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,040
I'm here

258
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,080
to see Lord Lin

259
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,040
and retrieve something
that belonged to my daughter-in-law.

260
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,080
The white fish jade pendant?

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,800
Exactly.

262
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,240
Now that the murderer has been caught,

263
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,520
it should be returned
to its rightful owner.

264
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,360
In that case,

265
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,080
it should go back to the Jiang family.

266
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,920
You don't understand.

267
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,120
Since she's married

268
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,520
into our family,

269
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,400
everything she had belongs to us!

270
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,680
Ms. Jiang hasn't even been buried,

271
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,200
and the real culprit hasn't been caught.

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,160
Mr. Sun,

273
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,880
why are you so eager to get her dowry?

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,720
Please forgive me, Ms. Lu.

275
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm just worried about my son.

276
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,920
He's fallen ill
from grieving for his wife.

277
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,920
I just want to get the pendant back

278
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
so he can have something
to remember her by.

279
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
But

280
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,320
we visited Sun Ren yesterday.

281
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,800
Why didn't he ask us for it himself?

282
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Well...

283
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,440
Something's off.

284
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,200
As soon as
Jiang Mengyu's body was found,

285
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,120
you demanded

286
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,440
that Lord Lin execute Fu Wenyuan.

287
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,280
And now, you're here for her pendant.

288
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,720
Her husband hasn't even asked for it.

289
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,360
Why are you, her father-in-law,

290
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,880
so eager

291
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
to have it?

292
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,760
Is there something

293
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,400
you're not telling us?

294
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,280
Nonsense!

295
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,240
I don't need to explain myself to you!

296
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,080
I'll speak to Lord Lin!

297
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,800
Stop.

298
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,240
That is evidence.

299
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
Lord Lin won't give it to you.

300
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,480
Regardless,

301
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,480
it's certain that Fu Wenyuan

302
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,960
killed my daughter-in-law.

303
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,240
There's nothing wrong with me

304
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,680
reclaiming her belongings!

305
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,800
Sooner or later,

306
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,360
you'll have to return
that pendant to me!

307
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Hmph!

308
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,280
Lu,

309
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
where were you?

310
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,160
The Evidence Room.

311
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,560
I have something to tell you.

312
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,720
Hold on.

313
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,960
Let me guess

314
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,320
if we're thinking the same thing.

315
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,240
Sun Qinjiu is hiding something.

316
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,920
Did you go to the Evidence Room

317
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,760
to find it?

318
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,200
Yes.

319
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,080
I already found it suspicious
when Sun Qinjiu was eager

320
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,520
to have Fu Wenyuan executed.

321
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,920
Now, he's desperately trying
to get the dowry.

322
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,240
I suspect

323
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,400
he is actually after this jade pendant.

324
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,720
Jiang Mengyu's maid, Yu,

325
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,000
confirmed she had no affair
with Fu Wenyuan.

326
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,000
But Sun Qinjiu

327
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,520
insisted they did,

328
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,560
using this jade pendant as the evidence.

329
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,520
Thinking back,

330
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,200
I realize he was trying
to give Fu Wenyuan

331
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,160
a plausible motive for murder.

332
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,000
By the way,

333
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,040
I was just about
to go to the Evidence Room,

334
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,840
but you already brought what I wanted.

335
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,080
We really are

336
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,360
becoming more and more in sync.

337
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,280
I was asking

338
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,960
for the pendant.

339
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,960
You should've been clearer.

340
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,560
What do you think?

341
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
This pendant is by no means ordinary.

342
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
It was a national treasure
of the ancient Loulan Kingdom.

343
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,520
Loulan Kingdom?

344
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,040
Yes.

345
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,760
This pendant is part of a pair.

346
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,120
The other one is black.

347
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,360
This white one is made
of Tian Shan's snow jade,

348
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,680
and the black one

349
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,680
is made of Dragon Cave jade.

350
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,200
Many years ago,

351
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,280
as a friendly gesture,
the Western kingdom of Loulan

352
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,960
gave the black fish jade pendant
to our country.

353
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,640
The late emperor

354
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,920
then gave it to Grand Tutor Ji.

355
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,800
Who is Grand Tutor Ji?

356
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
A corrupt official
who was later dismissed.

357
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,600
Then this pendant

358
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,320
must be valuable.

359
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,080
It's more than valuable.

360
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,600
It's priceless.

361
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,080
Legend has it that when the two pendants
are put together,

362
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,840
a hidden treasure will be revealed,

363
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,560
and the owner of this treasure

364
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,640
could

365
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,200
change the balance of power
among nations.

366
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,360
Oh,

367
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,600
I see.

368
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,640
By the way,

369
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,960
there was something else peculiar.

370
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,960
Yu mentioned

371
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,480
that on the wedding night,

372
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,040
Jiang Mengyu repeatedly urged her

373
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,000
to fetch Sun Ren from the banquet.

374
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,800
Why did she do that?

375
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,080
That night,

376
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,760
she must have discovered something.

377
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,320
It seems

378
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,040
we need to visit the Sun Residence.

379
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,600
Yes.

380
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,000
I haven't changed anything

381
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,160
in this room.

382
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
These are Mengyu's dowry items.

383
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,320
Master Sun,

384
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,040
do you recognize this?

385
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,080
But

386
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,600
my father has a black one

387
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,840
that looks very similar.

388
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,040
All my wife's belongings are here.

389
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,480
Feel free to look around.

390
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,200
Look,

391
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,520
this is a double-sided mirror,
a specialty of Licheng.

392
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,920
It has two sides.

393
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,440
Ms. Lu,

394
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,960
you are really knowledgeable.

395
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,400
I've been to Licheng.

396
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,680
Even the Empress

397
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,360
uses a double-sided mirror.

398
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,920
Made with quenched bronze

399
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,520
and black powdered tin,

400
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,920
and polished with white felt,

401
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,240
it shows superb craftsmanship,

402
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,560
especially this double-sided design.

403
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,680
Look,

404
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,320
press this bronze button,

405
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
and it flips to the other side.

406
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,440
Look!

407
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,760
[Sun Qinjiu and Bao Sheng]

408
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,160
[want the white fish jade pendant.]
"Sun Qinjiu and Bao Sheng..."

409
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,820
[I fear for my life.]

410
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,520
Su Qinjiu really had something to do

411
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,640
with Jiang Mengyu's death.

412
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,000
What are you doing?

413
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,600
You...

414
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Mengyu,

415
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
now that you're married into my family,

416
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,640
hand over

417
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,200
the jade pendant.

418
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,240
I...

419
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,360
I told you

420
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,880
I didn't have the pendant.

421
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,800
Stop playing dumb with me!

422
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,680
Give me

423
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,600
the pendant.

424
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,400
It really isn't with me!

425
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,400
Hand it over!

426
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,760
Or I'll beat you to death!

427
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Give it to me!

428
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,000
Hand over the pendant!

429
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,840
Or I'll beat you to death!

430
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,760
Do you hear me?

431
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,040
Hand it over!

432
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,880
Hand it over now!

433
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,840
Give it to me!

434
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,000
Give it to me!

435
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,400
I really don't have it!

436
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,920
Give it up!

437
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,640
Jiang Mengyu probably left this note

438
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,760
to inform Sun Ren of the secret.

439
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,840
But

440
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,600
wasn't Bao Sheng

441
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,160
a teahouse owner?

442
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,480
Why was he so close to Sun Qinjiu?

443
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
I still have many doubts

444
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,920
about Bao Sheng's case.

445
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,040
Who went through all the trouble

446
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
to put him in a coffin

447
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,880
and frame the murder on you

448
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,160
remains unknown.

449
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
The priority now

450
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,200
is to find Sun Qinjiu immediately.

451
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,000
