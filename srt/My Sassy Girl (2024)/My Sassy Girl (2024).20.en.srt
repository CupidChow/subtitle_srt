[Episode 20]

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,680
What are you doing?

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,760
I've thought it through.

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,880
I was too reckless

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
in the last few days.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,520
To find the culprit,

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,480
I carried out careless investigations.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,800
I was full of myself

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,680
and arrogant.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,080
I caused trouble
for the people of the capital.

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,320
You didn't bring the branches
of a chaste tree?

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,400
Mr. Zhou might have done
many evil things,

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,760
but he treated me well.

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Whether it's for public
or personal gain,

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,200
I also hope the case
can be solved soon.

please join me in the investigation

29

You...

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,200
All right.

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,120
Oh,

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
I remember one thing.

39
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,000
What is it?

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,880
That day,

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,080
when we were holding
a farewell banquet for Mr. Zhou,

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,840
he told me something.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,480
Now that I think about it,

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,440
it sounded cryptic.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
What did he say?

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
He said karma was real.

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,040
What went around came around.

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
He told me
if something happened to him one day,

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,800
he hoped I wouldn't investigate it.

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,520
He knew

That's good.

and add a vivid description
of the incident back then,

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
Where are you going?

192
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,120
Go to sleep.

193
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,000
How can you protect me

194
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,280
when you're so far away?

195
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
Tonight,

196
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,800
I'll protect you here.

197
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,360
This red string

198
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,600
will bind us together.

199
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,920
Even if monsters come here,

200
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,320
I will also be with you

201
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
and protect you.

202
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
Since we are tied together,

203
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,160
I will also protect you.

204
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,680
It's a promise.

205
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,640
It's a promise.

206
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,280
Pinky promise.

207
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,430
Pinky promise.

208
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,240
The promise of a century.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,640
Nanyi!

210
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,760
Nanyi!

211
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,960
Nanyi!

212
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,640
What's wrong?

213
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,440
Where's Miss Lu?

214
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,640
Nanyi is gone.

215
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,640
She's gone?

216
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,360
Qingqiu.

217
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,080
Sir.

218
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,680
Sleeping Incense?

219
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
Qingqiu, are you all right?

220
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,760
No wonder.

221
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,720
No wonder I was sound asleep.

222
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,240
What's that?

223
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,720
Limestone powder I put on Nanyi.

224
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,800
Lei Yu,

225
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,080
open it.

226
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,320
Yes.

227
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,360
This is...

228
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,450
Let me go!

229
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,640
Ji Xia?

230
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,920
It seems like

231
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,720
you know the incident back then

232
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,080
quite well.

233
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,080
Mr. Yu?

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's you?

235
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,600
Hmph.

236
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,760
Hmph.

237
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,240
Miss Lu,

238
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
there's no need to be surprised.

239
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,400
This is

240
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,480
just a disguise.

241
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,040
This...

242
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,220
Is this the Frozen Coffin?

243
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,920
Yes.

244
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,760
This is the Frozen Coffin.

245
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,960
It protects Xia's body

246
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,040
from rotting.

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,640
I want her to see

248
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,800
how I killed the people
who caused her death.

249
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,800
Tell me.

250
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,040
Who is the fifth tomb robber?

251
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,240
What?

252
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,360
Are you planning to kill again?

253
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,880
Shouldn't I?

254
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,240
They killed the person I love.

255
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,600
Am I wrong to get them
to pay with their lives?

256
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,680
Mr. Yu,

257
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,000
you are a physician

258
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,320
who saves countless people.

259
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,400
How did you end up
becoming a cruel murderer?

260
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,880
Their crimes

261
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,520
will be punished by the yamen.

262
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,240
Punished by the yamen?

263
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,120
Hahaha!

264
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,520
Miss Lu,

265
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,280
you are too naive.

266
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,720
The yamen couldn't even
solve the murders I committed.

267
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,880
How would they care about a case
of the daughter of a criminal

268
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,680
who has been dead for years?

269
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,240
Tell me.

270
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,560
Who is

271
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,040
the fifth tomb robber?

272
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,640
Actually,

273
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,640
this person doesn't exist.

274
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,920
I created

275
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,880
the fifth person.

276
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,080
I did it

277
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,840
to lure you.

278
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,880
This is the pouch
containing the limestone powder.

279
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,040
It seems like the culprit
found the pouch

280
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,120
and left it here.

281
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,600
Miss Lu,

282
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,680
we are acquaintances.

283
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
I want to hear an honest answer.

284
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,640
What you witnessed back then,

285
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,640
was it true?

286
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,760
I was young.

287
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,800
I went to play on the hills one day

288
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,730
and accidentally
found the tomb's entrance.

289
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,840
I went inside to explore it
out of curiosity.

290
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,520
I saw

291
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,920
Shi Kaiyang and the rest

292
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,120
stuff Ji Xia inside the coffin
and suffocate her to death

293
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,080
with my own eyes.

294
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,480
She was suffocated to death?

295
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,880
Xia,

296
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,960
it's all my fault
for letting you suffer this fate

297
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,000
because I was late.

298
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,920
But there's no need to worry.

299
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,760
The four people who harmed you

300
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,320
were killed by me.

301
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,800
I avenged you.

302
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
In the future,

303
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,560
no one can harm you again.

304
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,480
Mr. Yu,

305
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
I've told you the truth.

306
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,920
Can you

307
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,400
also tell me the truth?

308
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,440
What happened between you
and Ji Xia back then?

309
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,840
Why haven't you gotten over it

310
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,280
after getting revenge for 10 years?

311
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,360
I was a wandering physician.

312
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,760
When I passed by the capital,

313
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,600
I treated Grand Preceptor Ji

314
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,880
from the Snow Cold Spider Poison
of the Snow Spirit Painting.

315
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,280
After that,
I was treated as an esteemed guest.

316
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,760
Later,

317
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,880
I met Ji Xia who caught a cold

318
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,200
by coincidence.

319
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,080
I treated her.

320
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,640
We fell in love
with each other at first sight.

321
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,280
So,

322
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
we got engaged in secret.

323
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,920
However, I was poor.

324
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,560
I couldn't marry into her family.

325
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,320
Grand Preceptor Ji found out

326
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,680
and got angry.

327
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Immediately,

328
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,640
he married Xia

329
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,480
to a noble family.

330
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,440
We didn't want to separate

331
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,120
and decided to elope.

332
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,120
So, Xia ingested
the Breathless Pill I created.

333
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,760
She would be in a fake death state

334
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,280
for 20 hours.

335
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,400
I guided the Grand Preceptor with words

336
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,320
and persuaded him
to bury Xia as quickly as possible.

337
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,920
Soon,

338
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
the Grand Preceptor

339
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,520
buried Xia.

340
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,440
Everything

341
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,040
was going according to my plan.

342
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,480
After she was buried,

343
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,200
I would rescue her.

344
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,280
Unexpectedly,

345
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,440
the tomb robbers

346
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,280
went ahead of me.

347
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,960
We've made a fortune this time!

348
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,120
Yes!

349
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,200
This is great.

350
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,080
Who are all of you?

351
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,160
Suppress her!

352
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,080
Let me go!

353
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,200
Let me go!

354
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,000
Don't let her escape!

355
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,360
Close the coffin lid!

356
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,880
No!

357
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,440
Let go of me!

358
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,960
Let go!

359
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,600
Let me out!

360
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,280
Let me out!

361
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
Let me out!

362
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,720
I could be together

363
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
with Xia

364
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,840
until we were old,

365
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,830
but the robbers

366
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,280
caused us to be separated
into two worlds.

367
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,120
Tell me.

368
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,880
Didn't they deserve to die?

369
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,360
This is Nanyi's handkerchief.

370
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,920
Mr. Yu,

371
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,400
did you steal the two-fish jade pendant?

372
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,760
It's better

373
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,440
for you to not know everything.

374
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,120
In Jinzhou,

375
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,480
I was influenced by
the murder method of your storybook.

376
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,880
So,

377
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,440
I murdered by imitating your storybook.

378
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
You were the one
who amended the storybook?

379
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,730
[It was a dark night at the hour of Zi
on the sixteenth day of the fifth month]

380
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,730
[Nimbly sneaked into Tianyi Teahouse]

381
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,730
