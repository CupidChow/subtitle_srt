00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,520
You tease.

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
A year ago you almost
ruined my sister's marriage,

195
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,640
and here you are again.

196
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,240
I see you really

197
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,680
haunt Lord Lin.

198
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,200
Miss.

199
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,260
It's not what you think.

200
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
Lu's been in Jinzhou all along.

201
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,400
Watch your mouth.

202
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,600
You don't get to say anything

203
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,600
about me and Lin Qingqiu.

204
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
You tease.

205
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,560
Look at yourself.

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,440
You don't have the looks of a goddess,

207
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,080
nor do you come from
a distinguished family.

208
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
You have nothing.

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Who are you to compete with my sister?

210
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
What are you talking about?

211
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,160
What?

212
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm telling the truth.

213
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,440
Beside,

214
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,400
I thought you were with us.

215
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,240
Are you enchanted by this tease?

216
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
A daughter of a lowly merchant like her

217
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,800
should be matched with a lowly man.

218
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,960
You've gone too far!

219
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,400
You are

220
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,720
just a daughter
of a concubine in the Wen family.

221
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
You got where you are
by flattering your elder sister.

222
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,720
Does your father know

223
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,800
you're such a bully out there.

224
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,160
You...

225
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,720
The lowly merchant's daughter
has business to do.

226
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,000
Bye.

227
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,120
You...

228
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,520
Alas.

229
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,680
What a bad day.

230
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,520
A crazy dog out of nowhere,

231
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,560
biting everywhere.

232
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,200
What are you waiting for?

233
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,500
Get my package off.

234
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,220
Is this

235
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,020
Lord Lin's fiancee's sister?

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,080
What a rude girl.

237
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,160
That's weird.

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,160
Yuechu said that

239
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,920
Qingqiu has sent
a lot of marriage withdrawals

240
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,200
to the Wen's house over the past year.

241
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Why did Wen Yunxi come here anyway?

242
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,080
I have a bad feeling.

243
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,880
Qingqiu.

244
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,440
Wen Yunxi.

245
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
What brings you here?

246
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,240
Wen Ruoxi is my sister.

247
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,560
I should visit

248
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,160
her husband for her.

249
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,320
I know

250
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,480
you'll be very surprised

251
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,020
to see me, my lord.

252
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,600
You must have missed my sister a lot.

253
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,240
She has felt the same way.

254
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,440
See.

255
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,400
She asked me

256
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,400
to bring you her handmade tea

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,800
and jujube cake.

258
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,800
Over the past month,

259
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,560
I've asked Yuechu

260
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,200
to send several letters to Ruoxi.

261
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,560
Did she receive them?

262
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,720
Letters...

263
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,360
Letters...

264
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh right.

265
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
I remember it.

266
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
These days

267
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,040
she doesn't feel well,

268
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,320
so I didn't let her read those words.

269
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,840
You have worked so hard on the cases.

270
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,180
You must want to return to the capital

271
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,440
to talk to my sister face to face.

272
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,640
Wen Yunxi.

273
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,880
How about you

274
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,960
get some rest?

275
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,000
My lord.

276
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,920
My...

277
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,360
Yuechu?

278
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,440
What's wrong with you guys?

279
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,240
Why are you all

280
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,600
so surprised to see me?

281
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm sure you're overjoyed

282
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
to have me here.

283
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,020
My lord.

284
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,680
What...

285
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,320
What's she doing here?

286
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,360
Why did you look so panicked?

287
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,080
Oh.

288
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,600
My lord.

289
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,320
Bad news

290
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,040
Something bad happens.

291
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,520
What could be worse

292
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,800
than this?

293
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,480
Almost the same.

294
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,080
Tell me.

295
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,480
I hear there's a feast
at Lu's Book Club tonight.

296
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,480
And it's free for all.

297
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
Fu Wenyuan came back from the dead.

298
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,560
It's only right

299
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,440
to celebrate.

300
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,480
No.

301
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,720
He plans to propose to Ms. Lu in public.

302
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,560
What?

303
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,040
Lu.

304
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,360
When the sea is blue, I see whales.

305
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
When I wake up, I see you.

306
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,160
But...

307
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,040
When the forest is deep, the fog rises.

308
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
When the sea is blue, the waves swell.

309
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,840
When I wake up, the night stays.

310
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,180
I can't see whales.

311
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,280
And I can't see you either.

312
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,920
How deep is the deep love?

313
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,360
Like deep mountain sunset
and deep autumn rain.

314
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,960
Lu.

315
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,040
Over the past year,

316
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,080
you and I have went through together

317
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,160
from nothing to now.

318
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,400
I'm deeply in love with you.

319
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,800
Lu.

320
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,440
Would you marry me?

321
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,040
Nice!

322
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,040
Say yes!

323
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,000
Say yes!

324
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,080
Sir.

325
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
That was a very good speech.

326
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,300
Lu will definitely say yes.

327
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,180
Oh.

328
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,280
I just picked Lu's favorite flower.

329
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,620
We got everything ready

330
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,720
for her to be here.

331
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,140
[Lu's Book Club]

332
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,880
Fu Wenyuan.

333
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,760
What is he doing?

334
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
Hold.

335
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,480
Lu.

336
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,280
Come with me.

337
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,600
What?

338
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,720
Sir.

339
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,960
Sir.

340
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,400
Sir.

341
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,600
What happened?

342
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,560
Go see yourself.

343
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:34,760
Go.

344
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,960
Sir.

345
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,960
What should we do?

346
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,880
Let's go back.

347
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,360
What do you want?

348
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,920
Let me go.

349
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,880
What are you doing?

350
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,920
How dare a magistrate

351
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,680
kidnap a woman?

352
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,520
I know what Fu Wenyuan is up to.

353
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
I won't let you say yes to him.

354
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,920
I got all this for you.

355
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
What are you talking about?

356
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,160
I like you.

357
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,080
I really like you.

358
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,040
I like you more than him,

359
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,720
more than anyone else in the world.

360
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,440
I've been looking for you

361
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,320
all this time.

362
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,400
I never stopped.

363
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,040
When you left,

364
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,440
my heart was empty.

365
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,960
I never envied anyone

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
when you were by my side.

367
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,520
But

368
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,240
when I found out

369
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,680
you've been with Fu Wenyuan this year.

370
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm so jealous.

371
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,120
And I'm scared

372
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,640
that you'll really say yes to him.

373
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,400
I'm scared

374
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,360
that you'll leave me.

375
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,360
I'm scared

376
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
that I'll lose the one I love.

377
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,800
Lu.

378
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,760
I can't live without you.

379
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,000
But what's the point of

380
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,760
talking about this now?

381
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,960
You have a fiancee.

382
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,960
No.

383
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,920
My mother

384
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,560
arranged that marriage on her own.

385
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,640
I never agreed to it.

386
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,160
I've written

387
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,680
withdrawal letters many times.

388
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,240
I can't imagine

389
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,440
my wedding day

390
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,240
without you as the bride.

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,600
Lu.

392
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,880
Forgive me.

393
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,600
But I saw you two having an affair.

394
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,280
And the farewell letter.

395
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,960
It is indeed your handwriting.

396
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,240
I really didn't write that thing.

397
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,800
There must be someone behind it.

398
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,080
Hurry.

399
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,680
Qingqiu.

400
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,360
Qingqiu.

401
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,240
I found out the truth.

402
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,640
Yin.

403
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,800
I finally found you guys.

404
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,280
It's Wen Yunxi.

405
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,920
What do you mean?

406
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,520
All of this

407
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
is a misunderstanding.

408
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,680
It's all because of Wen Yunxi.

409
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
[Lin Qingqiu]
So, a year ago,

410
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,200
you were supposed to meet
at the Lake Pavilion.

411
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,680
But this message was known

412
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,040
to Wen Yunxi.

413
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,140
She snuck into Qingqiu's study

414
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,880
and got the letters

415
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,060
you two wrote to each other.

416
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,880
Then she had your handwriting imitated

417
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,660
and forged two farewell letters.

418
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,360
At your appointed time,

419
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,680
she first sent a letter

420
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,960
[Lu Nanyi]
to distract Qingqiu.

421
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,480
Then she asked someone

422
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,920
to send you a farewell letter.

423
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,000
Her purpose was

424
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,160
to make you believe

425
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,800
Qingqiu was a heartless man

426
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,240
who abandoned you.

427
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,500
Miss.

428
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,540
[Farewell Letter]

429
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,720
You know what I mean?

430
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,880
Yes.

431
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,640
Then,

432
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,060
She tricked you

433
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,560
in the same way.

434
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,080
You two

435
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,880
were really fooled

436
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,300
by her poor trickery.

437
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,860
But what about the Lake Island?

438
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,880
That day

439
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,360
I saw you

440
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,920
meeting Wen Ruoxi on the island.

441
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,000
After I received the farewell letter,

442
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,120
I was full of doubts

443
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,240
and wanted to ask you.

444
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
Someone told me

445
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,420
you were at the Lake Island,

446
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,760
so I went to the appointment.

447
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,200
It was still the work of Wen Yunxi.

448
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't believe

449
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
we were fooled

450
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,680
by her such tricks.

451
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,400
You two

452
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,080
are both very smart.

453
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,200
Why are you all so dumb

454
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,920
when it comes to relationships?

455
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,080
But don't worry.

456
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,440
She's been taught a lesson

457
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,080
by Lei Yu and I.

458
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,800
She will not

459
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
dare to do such things.

460
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,760
Please.

461
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,080
I've written my confession

462
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,280
and stamped my fingerprints.

463
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,120
When will you give me the antidote?

464
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,040
Miss Wen.

465
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,600
Let me tell you.

466
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,920
You shouldn't have got involved

467
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,240
in Lord Lin and Miss Lu's business.

468
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,160
I...

469
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,880
I must stop them.

470
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,480
Had Lord Lin
eloped with a merchant's daughter,

471
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,680
everyone would

472
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,800
[Confession]
laugh at my sister.

473
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
I couldn't let that

474
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,440
happen.

475
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,520
You were ruining their relationships.

476
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,200
Listen.

477
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,240
If you ever try anything stupid,

478
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,440
[Confession]
I'll give this

479
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,080
to your father, Lord Wen.

480
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,800
Lord Wen has always been honest.

481
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,440
If he knew

482
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,080
all these things you've done,

483
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,800
he'd kick you out of the house.

484
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,440
Alright.

485
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,280
I'm sorry, okay?

486
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,200
Just give me the antidote.

487
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,920
Don't worry.

488
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,880
It's just Boneless Powder.

489
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,200
It'll wear off

490
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,160
after a while.

491
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,520
Yin.

492
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,920
Thank you.

493
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,160
Well.

494
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
Such a beautiful scenery.

495
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,720
I'll leave you two alone.

496
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,400
