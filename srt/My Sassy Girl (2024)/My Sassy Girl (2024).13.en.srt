00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,600
There is nothing to be upset about.

194
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,680
Me and Miss Wen

195
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,240
are just like mud and clouds.

196
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

197
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,000
You don't have to compete with her.

198
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,160
You sure have a way with words.

199
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,640
Let's get back to the case.

200
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,200
Any progress?

201
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,880
It is almost certain

202
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
that Luo Hanshui bears prejudice
against merchants.

203
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,920
There must be something behind it.

204
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,280
Anything else?

205
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,880
And

206
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,800
his arms won't be this strong

207
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,880
just by painting.

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,640
He must be a man of martial arts.

209
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,600
I agree.

210
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,760
Luo Hanshui seems strange to me as well.

211
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,200
Let's take roles from storybooks
for example.

212
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,240
As a painter,

213
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,320
Luo Hanshui never draws animals.

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
His works are all about beauty.

215
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,320
He definitely is a pervert.

216
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,000
Maybe

217
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,720
he is the killer.

218
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,800
And it was for love.

219
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,400
What a typical deduction

220
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,560
by Lu Nanyi.

221
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,760
Anyway,

222
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,640
we won't figure it out now.

223
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
How about we get back to it tomorrow?

224
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,640
Okay.

225
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,500
[Little Wonton for Marriage]

226

Nanyi.

227
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,720
There.

228
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,640
After all these years,

229
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,440
this restaurant is still open.

230
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,000
I've been craving
for their fried wontons for so long.

231
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,920
Come on!

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,640
Qingqiu.

233
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,720
Sir.

234
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,040
Yes.

235
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,720
Two bowls of wontons.

236
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,280
OK!

237
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,880
Everything here is the same as before.

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,960
I remember

239
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,320
that back in the day,

240
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
you always took me here for wontons

241
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,400
whenever your parents scolded you.

242
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,400
People drink their sorrows away
with spirit.

243
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,400
But you

244
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,400
drank my wonton soup.

245
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,160
How could you say that?

246
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,200
You know that I don't like vinegar,

247
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,800
and you always added it on purpose.

248
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,200
Here you go.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,880

I haven't seen you for so many years.

256
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,400
Mr. Wu,

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,320
your wonton is as popular as before.

258
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,880
Well.

259
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,560
Not bad.

260
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,920
Since we haven't met in many years,

261
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,360
these wontons are on the house.

262
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,760
No way.

263
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,920
Please take it.

264
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,920
It's on me.

265
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,160
Please don't, Mr. Wu.

266
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,800
Come on.

267
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,360
Take it.

268
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,160
I can't.

269
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,680
Mr. Wu.

270
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,840
Just take it.

271
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,160
Well,

I hope you two

have a lovely baby soon.

Just tell me if you want more.

276

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,760

279
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,240

283
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,680
The Miracle Physician Yu is here.

284
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,720
I wonder which dignitary is indisposed.

285
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,920
Ms. Zhu from the Qian Residence
has recently been poisoned.

286
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,560
The physicians in the capital
can't do anything about it.

287
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
The Lord Mayor is kind-hearted,

288
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,160
inviting a famous physician
to diagnose her.

289
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,880
Well,

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,040
it is the Miracle Physician Yu.

291
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
I don't know if he can cure her.

292
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,080
Absolutely he can.

293
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,800

294
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,440
I've been practicing for years.

295
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,200
And I've always kept a low profile.

296
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,520
Such flamboyant display

297
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,100
might attract criticism.

298
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,160
Mr. Yu.

299
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
It's the order of Mr. Lin.

300
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,440

Lin Qingqiu,

304
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
you are still in the mood for tea now?

305
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,480
So what else should I do?

306
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,560
Wandering around like you?

307
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,440
You...!

308
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,680
Sir,

309
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,980
are you feeling better now?

310
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,680
I'm well.

311
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,880
Mr. Yu is truly

312
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
the Miracle Physician.

313
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,760
I can't believe you're cured in no time.

314
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,080
You're the one who tried out the poison.

315
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
You're the one looking for the killer.

316
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,880
And you drew everyone's attention
by getting Ms. Zhu a physician.

317
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,020
What's on your mind honestly?

318
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,080
Mr. Lei,

319
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
you're making better tea now.

320
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,200
Thank you, Sir.

321
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
Explain it clearly!

322
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,280
Don't be so hasty.

323
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,320
I arranged a big palanquin

324
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
for Mr. Yu

325
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,400
and had you spread the word.

326
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,880
For what?

327
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,840
To tempt the killer.

328
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,600
Lure him out?

329
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,440
Correct.

330
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,280
Mr. Yu.

331
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,440
How is it?

332
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,240
Alas.

333
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,160
The poison Mr. Lin took

334
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,120
is called Snow Cold Spider.

335
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,340
You'll be poisoned when touching it.

336
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,320

337
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
and illusion.

338
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,120
Occasionally touching it is fine.

339
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,840
But there will be toxic sediment

340
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,560
when touching it frequently.

341
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,840
Even if the Great Physician Hua Tuo

342
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,720
can't help him much.

343
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But luckily,

344
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,000
he is a mild case.

345
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,040
And he's young and strong.

346
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,960
He'll be fine.

347
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,600
Mr. Yu,

348
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,080
the illusions they have,

349
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,040
are they different?

350
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,920
I've been infected once

351
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,680
and what I saw was different

352
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
from what Mr. Qian and Jiu did.

353
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
Well...

354
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,120
I don't know for sure.

355
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,400
The Grand Tutor Ji

356
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,480
was also poisoned once.

357
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,600
And I cured him.

358
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,200
I heard

359
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,680
that only the Paint Saint
and his apprentice have the antidote.

360
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,080
Then why did the rumors say

361
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,800
that it was his daughter
hiding inside the painting?

362
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,560
They are all fallacies.

363
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,400
His daughter

364
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,640
was born weak and vulnerable.

365
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,520
Her death
had nothing to do with the painting.

366
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,240
Her soul would not hide in the painting.

367
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,000
Alas.

368
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
May the dead rest in peace.

369
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,840
Mr. Yu,

370
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
please make a prescription quickly.

371
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,800
Sure.

372
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,680
So when you were poisoned,

373
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,240
did you see the ghost in the painting?

374
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,680
Are you all right?

375
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,760
Mr. Lin,

376
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,560
are you still feeling cold now?

377
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,240
Is it mildly cold

378
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,880
or freezing cold?

379
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,960
When you're poisoned,

380
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,120
if you show slight coldness,
you'll be fear of cold.

381
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,080
If you feel freezing cold,
your body will shiver

382
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,200
and find it difficult to breathe.

383
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,880
If it's the former,

384
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,160
drink half of the medicine.

385
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,360
If it's the latter,

386
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,440
you have to drink it up.

387
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,960
If it's neither the former

388
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,880
nor the latter,

389
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,360
you have to drink two bowls of medicine.

390
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,760
Mr. Lin,

391
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,400
say something.

392
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,000
Mr. Lin?

393
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,680
Are you cold?

394
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,220
Mr. Lin?

395
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Mr. Lin!

396
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,240
You're shivering.

397
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,120
Here.

398
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
You should drink it now.

399
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
If you do want to find it out,

400
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,000
you can go and try it yourself.

401
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,960
Lei Yu.

402
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,360
What time is it?

403
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,640
It's the hour of Hai.

404
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
It's time to move.

405
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,360
Zhu,

406
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,320
it's me.

407
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,480
Here is the antidote.

408
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,160
Take it quickly.

409
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,320
Don't move.

410
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,880
Zhu.

411
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,600
Luo!

412
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,880
Why?

413
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,960
It's you indeed.

414
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
Are you sure about this, Lin Qingqiu?

415
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,640
The renowned Master Luo of the capital.

416
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,480
How could he be the killer?

417
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,480
Zhu has nothing to do with this.

418
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,180
Kneel down!

419
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,040
So

420
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,380
Zhu is safe.

421
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,580
Yes.

422
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,920
You've gone to a lot of trouble, huh?

423
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,780
If I'm not mistaken,

424
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,400
you suspect me because of the painting,

425
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,700
right?

426
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,960
Do you still remember

427
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,000
that I visited
