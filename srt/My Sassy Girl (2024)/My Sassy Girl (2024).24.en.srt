My mother said
you shouldn't lick your fingers.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,500
You'll get sick.

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,040
But there's sugar on my finger.

50
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
Oh.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,320
Take this one.

52
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,360
Thank you.

56
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,280
Eat it while it's hot.

57
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,720
Wait.

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,440

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,640
Am I overthinking?

63
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,320
How could you eat barehanded?

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,480

Why are my feet itching?

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,040
Did he do something to the pancake?

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,360
Lin Qingqiu,

70
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,760
you ate the pancake, too.

71
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,280
The pancake itself

72
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,320
is perfectly fine.

73
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,680
But

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
I did put some itching powder

75
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,560
on the parchment paper you took.

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,720

77
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,400

78
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,560

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,280

won't give me the antidote?

87

It's so itchy!

88
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,760

89
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,200

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,520
