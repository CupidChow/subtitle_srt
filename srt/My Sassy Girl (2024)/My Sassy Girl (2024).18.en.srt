[My Sassy Girl]

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,080
[Episode 18]

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,880
Back then,

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,280
we arranged a marriage

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,560
for them.

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,840
Now that I think about it,

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,440
the decision

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,800
was a little too rash perhaps.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes! It was a rash one.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,200
I mean that our children

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,240
have their own blessings.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
We should allow them

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,840
to make decisions
about their own marriages.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,680
As their parents,

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,040
isn't it better to enjoy our lives?

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,520
There's no need to trouble ourselves

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,800
and split them up.

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,160
You are right.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,040
Mrs. Wen,

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
look at Qingqiu.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,880
He is already in his twenties

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
but he still hasn't achieved anything
in literature or military affairs.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,920
He is not worthy of marrying Ruoxi.

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,960
Your Majesty,
what are you talking about?

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,200
His Highness
has been solving mysterious cases.

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,710
Well...

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,280
Everyone calls him a genius.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,600
Even if someone's not worthy,

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,280
it's Ruoxi who is unworthy to marry him.

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,200
Not at all.

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Our Qingqiu is unworthy.

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,160
Your Majesty,

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Ruoxi is unworthy.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,480
Then,

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,760
in that case,

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,680
regarding the marriage
we arranged back then,

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,200
let's...

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,840
Let's cancel it.

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,360
Great.

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
Great.

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,200
Let me make a toast to you
with tea instead of wine.

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,720
Sure.

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,320
This tea is not bad.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,040
Why are you alone?

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,280
Where's Yin?

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,800
It's so early in the morning.

56
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,280
What are you doing here
with my Tanghulu?

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,240
What's going on?

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,520
I heard them say this morning

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,440
that he wanted to confess to Miss Yin

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,720
but he made the confession
feel like a funeral.

61
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,760
It would be weird
if she agreed to be with him.

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,760
Moreover,

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,920
your description

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,880
was saying that she was wearing
coquettish makeup

65
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,640
on her big face.

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,880
No ordinary girl
would be happy to hear that.

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,200
You have always been smart.

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
Why did you act like a fool

69
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,000
when it came to this?

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,720
Tell me.

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,160
What should I do?

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,360
I can't afford to offend Yin
with that temper of hers.

73
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,920
I can't help you.

74
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,800
Figure it out yourself.

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,240
Let's go, Tanghulu.

76
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,000
We'll leave this fool here.

77
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,600
Hey!

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,000
Sir,

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,320
do you feel cold?

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,440
No.

81
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,480
Sir,

82
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,920
do you feel hot?

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,680
No.

84
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,720
Oh.

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,680
Sir,

86
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
let me pour it for you.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,440
Here you go.

88
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,520
Sir.

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,160
What are you trying to do?

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
It's nothing.

91
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,080
Nothing.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,000
Sir.

93
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,840
Well...

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,800
Not long ago, you and Miss Lu
were acting like enemies.

95
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
You argued every day.

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,200
How did

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,480
your relationship with her
progress so quickly recently?

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,040
Nanyi and I

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,760
like each other.

100
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
After we cleared our misunderstandings,

101
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,920
we became a sweet couple again.

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,680
I remember your relationship

103
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,960
started improving
since the Spirit Painting Case.

104
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,240
Back then...

105
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
It was because of that painting.

106
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,080
You can't say

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,920
that the painting had no effect at all.

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,880
Are you telling me

109
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
to poison Yin with a painting?

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,920
Sir!

111
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm not that kind of person.

112
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,800
My feelings for Yin are sincere.

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,600
I didn't expect you
to think of me like that.

114
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,200
Farewell.

115
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,800
Hmph.

116
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,720
Tanghulu.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,920
Are you hungry?

118
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,360
Let me find you some food.

119
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,360
Wait for me.

120
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,240
Hey!

121
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,000
You...

122
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,320
Yin,

123
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,680
sorry.

124
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,040
I didn't mean what I said

125
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,160
this morning.

126
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,800
These are gifts for you.

127
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,520
I hope

128
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
you will like them.

129
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,960
Sounds good.

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,760
Yin.

131
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,440
Yin,

132
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,920
I came here to apologize.

133
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,080
I hope

134
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,160
you don't take what I said
this morning to heart.

135
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,480
From the bottom of my heart,

136
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,320
I think

137
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,240
you are very pretty.

138
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
Right now,

139
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,240
I feel embarrassed.

140
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,160
I want to tell you
I'm here to apologize with these gifts.

141
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,920
So, I bought you
some very sharp scalpels.

142
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,720
I don't know if you...

143
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,440
I hope

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,640
you can accept my apology.

145
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,880
I...

146
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,280
Sir,

147
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,520
you are really handsome.

148
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,800
I...

149
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,440
Yin.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,640
Can you not joke around?

151
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,800
I...

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,960
I know you are testing me

153
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
but I, Lei Yu, am not this kind of man.

154
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,120
Your body

155
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,800
is very fit too.

156
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,400
I...

157
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,680
I...

158
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,840
Yin.

159
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,400
I...

160
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,600
You...

161
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,720
What's wrong with you, Yin?

162
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,120
I feel cold.

163
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,400
Yin,

164
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,320
you...

165
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,240
You...

166
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,960
Calm down, Yin.

167
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,360
Yin!

168
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,840
Look at me.

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,120
Yin.

170
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,560
Yin,

171
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,440
are you

172
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,000
all right now?

173
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,160
Yin,

174
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,360
I...

175
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,960
I didn't do anything just now.

176
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,520
Don't worry.

177
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,360
I won't tell anyone

178
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,640
about what happened today.

179
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,480
I'll forget this ever happened.

180
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,880
What?

181
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,840
You'll forget this ever happened?

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Are you not going
to take responsibility?

183
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm not.

184
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
Anyway,

185
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,320
they say

186
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,120
people who got poisoned by this
can see the person they love.

187
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,120
There are many women in this world,

188
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,040
but you are

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,240
the only one for me.

190
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,880
Yin,

191
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
can you marry me?

192
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,960
Since the person I saw was you,

193
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
you can't run away now.

194
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,480
What?

195
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,560
Yin,

196
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,280
have you accepted me?

197
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,640
Great!

198
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,320
Yin.

199
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,640
You fool.

200
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,760
What did you buy for me?

201
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,400
I bought you many things.

202
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,320
There are rouge and dresses.

203
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't think about it!

204
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,240
Suppress her!

205
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,360
Let me go!

206
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Go in!

207
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,240
Let me go!

208
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
Let me go!

209
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,600
Let me go!

210
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,360
Let me go!

211
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,840
Everything's fine.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,600
It's all right.

213
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,400
Don't be afraid.

214
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,400
I'm here.

215
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
Did you have that nightmare again?

216
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,840
For some reason,

217
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,240
I've been

218
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
having the same nightmare recently.

219
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,440
Since you accidentally
fell down the cliff

220
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
when you were eight years old,

221
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,320
you've been haunted by this nightmare.

222
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,880
I remember

223
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,880
we were playing hide-and-seek.

224
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,160
Then...

225
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Stop running.

226
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,200
I caught you.

227
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,640
I'm still not done hiding.

228
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,840
What's the rush?

229
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,920
Hurry up.

230
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm coming for you after I count to ten.

231
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,160
One.

232
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,120
Two.

233
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,120
Three.

234
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,160
Four.

235
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,200
Five.

236
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,280
Six.

237
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,320
Seven.

238
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,480
Eight.

239
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Nine.

240
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,280
Ten.

241
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
I'm coming for you.

242
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,160
Let's see how you find me.

243
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,280
A lot of us

244
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,480
went looking for you.

245
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,480
In the end, we found out

246
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,920
that you slipped accidentally
and fell down the cliff.

247
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,560
Miss Lu!

248
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,520
Miss Lu!

249
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,040
Miss Lu!

250
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,960
Nanyi!

251
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
Where are you?

252
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,320
Miss Lu!

253
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,640
Nanyi!

254
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,200
She's over there!

255
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,840
Nanyi!

256
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,640
Are you all right?

257
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,040
Nanyi,

258
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,200
wake up!

259
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,520
Nanyi, wake up!

260
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,200
Nanyi!

261
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
But I remember there was a cave.

262
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
There was a stone tablet
outside the cave.

263
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,200
Something was written
on the stone tablet,

264
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,640
but why can't I...

265
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,040
I can't remember.

266
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,800
All right.

267
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,920
Perhaps it's a sequela

268
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,130
caused by your head injury.

269
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,080
Be nice.

270
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,960
Don't think about it anymore.

271
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
I've asked Mr. Yu

272
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,600
to prescribe you some calming medicine.

273
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,280
Remember to drink it on time every day.

274
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,880
Then, you won't have
those nightmares anymore.

275
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
If that doesn't work,

276
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,800
I will

277
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,320
protect you every night

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
and tell you stories every day.

279
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,280
Do you think I'm a child?

280
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
Do you think telling me stories
can make me happy?

281
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,280
What else can I do?

282
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,280
You need to buy me a stick of Tanghulu.

283
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,160
Qingqiu.

284
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,120
Qingqiu.

285
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,200
Sir.

286
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,520
How's the investigation going

287
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,560
regarding the tomb robber, Gu Shan?

288
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
We've looked through everything
in the archive

289
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,400
but we can't find
someone called Gu Shan.

290
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,160
Moreover, there hasn't been a person
in the capital

291
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,640
who knows bone shrinking
in the last ten years.

292
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,560
Mr. Zhou is leaving tomorrow night.

293
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,120
Let's send him off together.

294
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,920
Sure.

295
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,640
Zhou!

296
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,120
I'll miss you!

297
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,520
After you leave,

298
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,080
what should I do in the capital alone?

299
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,120
Sigh,

300
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,200
I feel so sad deep down.

301
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,800
If Mr. Zhou

302
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,080
wasn't sitting here,

303
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,840
I'd think
that you were mourning for him.

304
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,400
You're just going to leave

305
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,000
without caring about our relationship.

306
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,400
Sir,

307
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,360
as the saying goes,

308
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,800
all good things come to an end.

309
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,600
Sir,

310
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,440
you don't need to miss me.

311
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,640
You should marry Miss Ruoxi.

312
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,640
I don't want her.

313
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,000
I just want you, Zhou.

314
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
Sir,

315
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,120
I beg you.

316
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,760
This is...

317
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,360
Sir.

318
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,560
Sir.

319
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,840
Enough.

320
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,680
We're almost done with drinking.

321
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,360
It's time to end this banquet.

322
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,800
Zhou!

323
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,800
Mr. Zhou,

324
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,600
take care.

325
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,800
Zhou!

326
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,400
Zhou!

327
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,440
Zhou!

328
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,240
Mr. Lin,

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,880
take care.

330
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,960
Zhou.

331
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,640
Zhou.

332
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,040
Zhou.

333
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,520
There's no choice.

334
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
From now on,

335
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,000
you'll become my adviser.

336
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,360
Lei Yu.

337
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,760
Yes.

338
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm going to see Nanyi.

339
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,040
Look after him.

340
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,360
Don't let him die here.

341
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,040
Yes.

342
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
Everyone left.

343
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,640
Yu!

344
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,320
Let me tell you!

345
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,480
Drink.

346
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,320
All right.

347
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,680
No one cares about me anymore!

348
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
Miss Gong.

349
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,200
I...

350
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,080
I...

351
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,320
I can still drink!

352
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,560
Give me the wine!

353
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,000
Are you sure you can still drink?

354
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
You are drunk after drinking one jar.

355
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,200
You!

356
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,400
Serve your master well!

357
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,960
Give me the wine!

358
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,480
You are drunk.

359
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Also,

360
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,800
you are not my master.

361
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,920
What master?

362
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,360
I'm a fairy.

363
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,920
Look.

364
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,280
Do you see the moon?

365
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,920
I am...

366
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,480
I am Chang'e's incarnation here.

367
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I want to fly!

368
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,040
Who are there?

369
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,120
You can fly.

370
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
Two drunkards.

371
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,760
I also want to learn how to fly.

372
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,480
I'll fly!

373
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,840
I'll fly!

374
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
I want to fly!

375
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,160
You want to fly?

376
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,920
I'll teach you.

377
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,360
Come and learn from me.

378
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
Great!

379
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,480
I want to fly too!

380
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,160
Stop flying!

381
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,360
That man is a thief!

382
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,520
He stole the two-fish jade pendant!

383
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,240
Stop flying, Nanyi!

384
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,600
Nanyi.

385
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,800
Nanyi.

386
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,040
Nanyi!

387
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,130
Nanyi!

388
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,640
Nanyi!

389
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:40,880
Nanyi!

390
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,880
Bad news!

391
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,640
Bad news, Mr. Lin.

392
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,040
Yan Canghai is missing!

393
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,510
[Daughter Ji Xia's grave,
erected by Ji Yun]

394
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,320
Catch her!

395
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,400
Save me!

396
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,520
Let me go!

397
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,200
Get inside!

398
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,240
Let go!

399
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,200
Let me go!

400
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,960
Hurry.

401
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,520
Cover the coffin.

402
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,360
No!

403
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,080
Nanyi,

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,760
are you having a nightmare again?

405
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,960
That wasn't a dream.

406
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,920
It was real.

407
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,480
That was my lost memory.

408
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,280
What do you mean?

409
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,080
When I fell down the cliff,

410
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,730
I saw four people digging

411
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
the grave
of the Grand Preceptor's daughter.

412
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,560
They put a woman

413
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,280
into the coffin alive
to suffocate her to death.

414
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,920
It looked the same as Sun Qinjiu
and Bao Sheng who died in coffins.

415
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,400
I witnessed the incident.

416
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,240
That was why they went after me

417
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,480
and caused me to fall down the cliff.

418
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,000
Nanyi, are you saying

419
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,520
that the story

420
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,160
in your storybook was not imagination

421
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,120
but your memory
of an incident that did happen.

422
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:35,880
Then,

423
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,600
the four men were

424
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,360
Shi Kaiyang,

425
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,640
Bao Sheng,

426
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,600
Sun Qinjiu,

427
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,280
and Gu Shan?

428
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,520
Yes.

429
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,840
I think so.

430
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,000
Do you still remember

431
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,320
what Gu Shan looked like?

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,800
They were masked

433
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,160
and I was in a hurry to escape.

434
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,720
However,

435
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,400
the look in one of their eyes

436
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,440
looked familiar to me.
