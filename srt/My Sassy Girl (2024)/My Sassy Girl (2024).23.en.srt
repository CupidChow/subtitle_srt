and no criteria.

193
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
It's obvious he's trying
to make things difficult for you.

194
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,840
It looks like

195
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,880
Mr. Lu and Mrs. Lu

196
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,240
aren't going to let you win.

197
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,560
No.

198
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,360
We can't just sit here.

199
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,840
Why don't you two elope?

200
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
Far away from here.

201
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,360
You can do whatever you want.

202
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,600
If you ask me,

203
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,760
I'll ask some of my men
to rush into the house,

204
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,040
get Miss Lu out.

205
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
You two get married first,

206
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,520
and then we ask for forgiveness
from the elders.

207
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,360
That's not very decent.

208
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,560
Why don't you

209
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,640
write a lawsuit

210
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,760
to my Jingzhao Office?

211
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,880
I'll pronounce you legally married.

212
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,960
Thank all of you

213
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,360
for your kindness.

214
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,120
All of my history with Nanyi was

215
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,040
due to a lack of trust in each other.

216
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,740
All these trials are a test

217
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,280
of our relationship.

218
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,800
[Lu's Book Club]

219
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,960
Today's test is about love,
and the topic is:

220
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,760
What is true love?

221
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,600
I'll give you one hour.

222
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,720
Okay.

223
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,480
You may start.

224
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
Where is

225
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,680
Mr. Huang?

226
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,320
Why isn't Mr. Huang here yet?

227
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,860
Maybe soon.

228
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,040
Sir.

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,760
My lady.

230
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,840
Here's your tea.

231
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,400
Did you deliver Nanyi's food?

232
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,720
She seems to be angry.

233
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,360
I knocked on the door,
but there was no answer.

234
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,000
So I left the food on her doorstep.

235
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,920
She is so spoiled.

236
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
From now on,

237
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,160
you will wear it every day

238
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
to keep you safe.

239
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,680
Wait!

240
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,120
This red string.

241
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,560
What is he doing?

242
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Where did you get it?

243
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,360
I...

244
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,560
I picked this up in front of her room.

245
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,480
I wore it because it looked good.

246
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,880
If I've offended you,

247
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,080
I'll return it.

Lin Qingqiu.

If you don't want to compete,

251
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,920

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
Nanyi may be in danger.

254
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,240
She is in the house.

255
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,520
How can she be in danger?

256
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,800
I think

257
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,280
it's because you can't write.

258
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,720
No.

259

If you step out of this door,

262
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
you'll be considered a quitter.

263
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,720
And you'll never set foot
in our residence again.

264
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,040
Why is he gone?

265
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,600

Sir.

271
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,520
I've searched all the places you said,

272
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,240
but I didn't find her.

273
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
Keep searching.

274
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,080
Yes.

275
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,560
You're awake.

276
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,000
What do you want?

277
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,320
From

278
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,680
what your parents told me earlier,

279
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,600
I thought you

280
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,880
must be an amazing girl.

281
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,800
Indeed.

282
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,600
They were right.

283
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
I came to the capital

284

And your house is choosing a son-in-law.

286
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,000
But then I thought,

287
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't have to compete
with Lin Qingqiu for you

288

289
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,360

are childhood sweethearts

292
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,160
and we love each other.

293
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,200
You saved my parents.

294
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,360
If you want a gift,

295
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,440
you can tell me.

296
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,760
I don't want any gifts.

297
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,160
I just want you.

298
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,120
I told you before,

299
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,200
I said

300
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,400
I'd be with you,

301
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,280
but you still pushed me away.

302

Love can't be forced.

303
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,920
Can't be forced?

304
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
Okay, then.

305
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,760
Great.

306
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,920

writing that ridiculous answer.

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,600

Yes.

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,880
Sir.

324
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,080
It's almost time.

325
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,840
People are waiting.

326
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,200
How about we...

327
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,280
Alas.

328
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,040
Why isn't he coming?

329
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Hold on.

330
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,440
He's back.

331
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,840
He's finally back.

332
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,120
Yes.

333
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,380
He's back.

334
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,040
Sir, my lady.

335
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,400
Sorry, I've been delayed.

336
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,680
Can you

337
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,240
give me some more time?

338
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,440
Mr. Lin.

339
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,200
Let me ask you,

340
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,560
Will the examiner

341
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,740
give you more time

342
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,920
in the Imperial Examination?

343
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,180
Right.

344
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,240
True.

345
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,920
Mother.

346
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,200
If he hadn't shown up in time,

347
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,960
you wouldn't have seen me now.

348
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,640
Okay.

349
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,000
Anyway,

350
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,080
two tests are over.

351
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,120
The real question of today is not here.

352
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,320
The test of true love is

353
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,480
whether or not he is attentive,

354
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
what difficulties he will overcome,

355
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
and what actions he will take

356
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,920
for the sake of true love.

357
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,360
You've done

358
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,840
all these things.

359
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,640
In this Contest
for Choosing a Son-in-Law,

360
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,420
I can see

361
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,560
that you're sincere about Nanyi.

362
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
We're very pleased.

363
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
But after all,

364
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,760
you're a Prince.

365
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,920
How can we, as commoners,

366
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,520
afford to climb up to you?

367
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,160
Sir.

368
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm sorry

369
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,960
for what I've done to Nanyi.

370
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm always ashamed of it.

371
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,880
Yet it's only during this time apart

372
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,640
that I've come
to understand my real feelings.

373
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,600
I promise

374
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,480
I'll love her,

375
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,480
protect her,

376
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,280
trust her,

377
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,720
and never let her down.

378
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,600
The royal family is different
from the common people.

379
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,840
There are lots of singers and dancers.

380
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Taking concubines is very common.

381
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,720
Although our Nanyi

382
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,080
has a humble background,

383
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,580
she can't take a little bit of that.

384
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,360
I, Lin Qingqiu, swear that

385
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,720
I will only marry Lu Nanyi

386
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,440
and will never fall in love
with anyone else.

387
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,160
That's what you said.

388
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,480
But there's a difference
between families.

389
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,600
How can we, a merchant's family

390
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,800
compare to a royal one?

391
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,660
Unless...

392
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,880

393
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,360
I mean it to her.

394
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,940
Unless you give up your noble position,

396
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,460

- Father, mother.

What are you talking about?

399
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,080
He's at least a hereditary Prince.

400
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,480
It's a title given by the Emperor.

401
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,900
If you talk any more nonsense,

402
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,640

She's next to you,

409
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,280
so you're pretending to be pitiful?

410
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,840
Right?

411
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,000

I'm actually an actor.

419
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,080
This is the actor I found in Jiangnan.

420
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,200
It's to see

421
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,700
if Lin Qingqiu is true to you.

422
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,520
Right.

if you have to marry that Lin Qingqiu.

426
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Of course.

431
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Since you're so insistent,

432
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,560
we can't stop you any longer.

433
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800

there's no such person as Huang Zhenyun.

445
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,760
There is.

Mr. Huang is not interested in love.

the richest here, likes to watch operas.

Mr. Ye invited me to be there.
