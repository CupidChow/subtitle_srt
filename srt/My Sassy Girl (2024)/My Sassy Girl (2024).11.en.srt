[Episode 11]

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,680
The yard is totally renewed.

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,240
It has only been two days.

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,080
Those craftsmen do know their stuff.

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,920
Not yet.

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,360
They just revamped the obvious parts.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,720
Yin.

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,160
What happened to your face?

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,400
You almost scared me to death.

20
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,560
It costs a lot to renovate the yard.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,800
So I need to get a part-time job.

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,080
And return you the money
as soon as I can.

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,280
Then, what's that on your face?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,160
This is a burial makeup.

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,040
I've always been interested

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,400
in making up the deceased.

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,240
I can make it my part-time job.

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,320
It's just

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,440
that my skills are not that good yet.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,640
I see.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,080
Maybe the lipstick is too pale.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,120
It seems a bit bleak.

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
It looks better now.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
Something just occurred to me.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,920
If you'll excuse me.

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
Lei Yu, where do you think you're going?

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
I promise not to kill you!

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,240
We've checked
every registered fortune teller.

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,280
Still not a single clue.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,880
So it's another afternoon wasted.

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,280
Sir.

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
You don't have to be worried.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,360
I've got my eyes on Mr. Lin.

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,040
He has stayed in the room all day long.

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,200
Miss Lu went out and didn't return yet.

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,520
And Miss Gong is nowhere to be found.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,920
I'd say

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,920
they might not have
made any progress either.

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,960
Zhou.

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,440
Yes.

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,680
Go make me a pot of Longjing tea.

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,760
I want to refresh myself.

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,000
Sure.

54
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,760
Go!

55
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Sir.

56
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
Those best Longjing teas you stored...

57
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,640
Mr. Lin drank them all.

58
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,840
What?

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,960
A greedy man for a small profit.

60
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,200
Fine.

61
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,360
I don't care.

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,840
Then let's have some chrysanthemum tea.

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,120
Ah...

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,800
Chrysanthemum tea it is!

65
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,840
Sir.

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
Your chrysanthemum...

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,760
Miss Gong picked them to make pastries.

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,320
Humph.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,200
Humph.

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,800
They're going too far.

71
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm going to pay Lin Residence a visit.

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
What do they mean

73
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,720
by putting that prick at my house?

74
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm...!

75
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,920
You'd better stay.

76
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,080
Mrs. Lin just arrived at our house.

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,840
I'd say

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,320
she doesn't come in peace.

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,840
Humph.

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
She'll teach Lin Qingqiu a good lesson.

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,960
Yes.

82
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,520
I'll go and see it.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,160
Okay.

84
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,720
Qiu.

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,520
Mother.

86
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,080
Mother.

87
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
What brings you here?

88
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,760
You, of course.

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,000
After returning to the capital,

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,720
you didn't go back home.

91
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,000
Yuechu.

92
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,840
Make some tea.

93
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,640
Oh, yes.

94
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,680
Have a seat.

95
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,960
What are you reading?

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,480
It's The Story of the Capital.

97
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,000
OK.

98
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
Miss Lu may be back soon.

99
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
She must not be back at this time.

100
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,140
Yuechu.

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
What took you so long?

102
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
Mrs. Lin is thirsty.

103
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,640
Right away.

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,480
Mr. Lu!

105
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,640
Help!

106
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,800
Oh?

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,120
Go ahead.

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
What's the problem

109
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,880
that Lin Qingqiu can't solve

110
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240
and must need my help?

111
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,360
Nothing big actually.

112
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,480
Please stay here and wait for Miss Lu.

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,120
And tell her
she must stay out for a while.

114
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,440
Please.

115
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,240
Urgh!

116
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,040
What a prick

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,800
to play both sides.

118
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,160
Shameless!

119
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
Mr. Lu.

120
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,440
Um...

121
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,080
Miss Lu.

122
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,040
You see.

123
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
I never meddle
in other people's business.

124
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,360
Nor am I an apathetic person.

125
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
A word of suggestion.

126
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,840
Just go out and hide for a while.

127
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,160
What?

128
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
If you don't leave soon,

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm afraid

130
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,000
there's going to be trouble.

131
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Trouble?

132
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Oh.

133
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,000
I need to go check.

134
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,800
Wait.

135
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,520
Seeing that you're happy,

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,400
I'll be glad too.

137
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,400
Qingqiu, you look so haggard.

138
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,080
Is that because of the case?

139
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,240
It's a tricky one this time.

140
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,240
And I can get nowhere with it.

141
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,800
I see.

142
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,840
Why do you stop me from getting in?

143
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,240
It's nothing big.

144
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,020
What is it?

145
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
Just let me in.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,240
You'd better stay outside.

147
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
Stop holding me back.

148
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
- Let me in.
- Get us a pasty.

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,280
Yes.

150
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
Let me in.

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,480
Lin Qingqiu made you guard the door?

152
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,200
There must be something important.

153
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,320
I need to check it.

154
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
- Cracking the case is not easy.
- Just leave.

155
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
But your health matters too.

156
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,320
Just listen to me.

157
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,840
Don't worry, Mother.

158
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,640
No way.

159
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,560
Let me in quickly.

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,360
What's that noise?

161
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,800
Oh.

162
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,560
It's nothing.

163
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,760
Just a dog in the yard.

164
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,840
It likes to bump the door for fun.

165
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,680
Mother.

166
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,080
What?

167
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,640
We haven't met for over a month.

168
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,160
Is everything good at home?

169
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
Says a son

170
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
who wrote little to his family.

171
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
But I've heard

172
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,360
that you've written quite a lot
to Wen Ruoxi.

173
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,280
As your mother,

174
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,920
I'm relieved to see you two

175
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,920
being so affectionate.

176
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,200
Mother.

177
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,440
I need to tell you something.

178
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
About the marriage...

179
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,880
It's arranged by parents'
and matchmakers' words.

180
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
Your opinion is irrelevant.

181
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,120
It's what I say it is.

182
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,680
But I've made up my mind.

183
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,520
Let me go inside.

184
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,640
Just stay out.

185
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,720
Just a peek.

186
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,520
It's really nothing.

187
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,240
Mother.

188
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,120
Mother.

189
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,400
Open the door.

190
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,360
To tell you the truth,

191
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,880
there is nothing to see.

192
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,320
Open it!

193
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,160
What's going on exactly?

194
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:12,960
No.

195
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,680
I must go in.

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,480
Please don't.

197
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,800
Mr. Lu.

198
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,360
Who are you talking with?

199
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,040
No one.

200
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,160
Just working out.

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,960
I see.

202
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,440
Mother.

203
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,120
Let's get in for some tea.

204
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,640
Yeah.

205
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,240
Sir!

206
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,440
Sir.

207
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,400
These are freshly picked teas this year.

208
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,520
Hey!

209
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,320
Miss Lu.

210
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,640
Playing hide and seek here?

211
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Well.

212
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
I'm going to have some tea
with Mr. Zhou.

213
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,480
Have some tea.

214
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,200
Let's go.

215
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,920
Go.

216
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,600
Mother.

217
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,080
Nanyi has nothing to do with it.

218
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,560
Your Majesty.

219
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,040
I...

220
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,680
Yuechu.

221
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,640
Yes.

222
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,240
I'll leave.

223
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,560
Yes.

224
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,960
Qingqiu.

225
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
So your mother really has you grounded.

226
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,000
Leave me here.

227
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,960
Don't worry about it.

228
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,680
No way.

229
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,280
Wait here.

230
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,080
I'll go talk with her
and look for chances.

231
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh, my lady.

232
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,000
I just bought this teacup.

233
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,120
My lady.

234
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,840
Please don't.

235
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,960
Not this one.

236
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,240
This is an imperial-bestowed
Panlong purple clay teapot.

237
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,240
Stop, my lady.

238
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,880
Auntie...

239
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,400
My lady...

240
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,920
Yin, you're here.

241
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,320
Hi, Yin.

242
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,200
Have a seat.

243
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,840
Yin.

244
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,840
How long have you been back?

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
For a while.

246
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,560
Qingqiu forgets this home.

247
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,360
I see you learned it well.

248
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,920
You've been back for so many days.

249
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,520
Why did you never come to see us?

250
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,800
Sooner or later,

251
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,200
the two of you will drive me crazy.

252
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,880
Stay calm, my lady.

253
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,800
Qingqiu and Yin

254
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
are back for business,

255
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,520
not for visiting the family.

256
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,720
They should put work first.

257
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,440
But you stay at home all day long.

258
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,400
Why hasn't the court dismissed you yet?

259
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,600
I've long been in the circle.

260
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,200
I have my own way to keep my post.

261
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,280
Yin.

262
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,920
I know

263
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,680
you're here

264
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,880
for Qingqiu.

265
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,120
Perfect timing.

266
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,760
Here's an invitation.

267
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
Help me hand it to Lu Nanyi.

268
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
And tell her

269
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,280
I'll meet her

270
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,680
at Elixir Tavern tomorrow.

271
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,920
Auntie,

272
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,800
I can't do it for you.

273
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,240
What if you

274
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
force her to leave Qingqiu?

275
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,600
Then I'll be the accomplice.

276
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,760
What Qingqiu was worried about was me

277
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,960
standing between him and Lu Nanyi.

278
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,440
But after tomorrow,

279
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
he'll realize it's not me

280
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,440
who tries to stop them.

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,600
Take it.

282
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,700
[Invitation]

283
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,880
Mrs. Lin invited me to Elixir Tavern.

284
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,520
Is she planning to eat me alive?

285
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,120
It's obviously a trap.

286
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,880
You'd be like a fish

287
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,560
and Mrs. Lin is the butcher.

288
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,280
Yin.

289
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,840
Please show me a way.

290
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,280
What should I do?

291
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,240
I think you could say

292
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,400
you're not feeling well.

293
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,560
In that case,

294
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,360
will Mrs. Lin

295
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
misunderstand me even more?

296
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,000
When you're covered with lice,

297
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,960
you don't itch.

298
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,480
When you eloped with Qingqiu,

299
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,800
you two have already driven her crazy.

300
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,520
It's nothing to her this time.

301
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,520
Fine.

302
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,200
[Invitation]
If Mrs. Lin tries to drive me away

303
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,840
with tons of gold

304
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,360
thrown in my face,

305
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,240
I'd take Lin Qingqiu with me
and run again.

306
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,760
But my auntie has been
in charge of the mansion for years.

307
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,640
She's very careful with money.

308
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,920
It would be more likely

309
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,920
that she throws wastewater at you.

310
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,240
I shall face it

311
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
whatever it will be.

312
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
Even if it's a trap,

313
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,600
it'd be a trap with delicious food.

314
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Oh my...

315
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,840
Alas.

316
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,240
Qiu.

317
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,240
Father.

318
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,400
You've been kneeling for a whole night.

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,040
Wrapped your head around it yet?

320
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,280
I'm clearer than ever before.

321
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
I'll marry no one other than Lu Nanyi.

322
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,080
My son.

323
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,360
Don't challenge your mother on purpose.

324
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,080
It's my fault

325
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,560
to make her worry.

326
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,720
But Father,

327
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,440
life is long.

328
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,240
If I can't grow old with the one I love,

329
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,360
I will die with regret.

330
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,600
I totally understand

331
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,360
what is in your mind.

332
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,760
But does Miss Lu

333
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,240
share the same thoughts with you?

334
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,400
Have you ever thought about it?

335
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,600
I'd say

336
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
you should apologize

337
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,440
to your mother.

338
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,800
Admit your mistake.

339
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,480
As for other matters,

340
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,640
let's discuss them later.

341
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,400
I've failed Nanyi for so long.

342
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,240
This time,

343
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,840
I must show her my resolution.

344
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,640
Foolish.

345
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,560
Let me tell you the truth.

346
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,720
Your mother

347
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,320
has invited Miss Lu for a meeting.

348
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,520
No.

349
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,320
Nanyi must not see my mother.

350
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,360
Halt it!

351
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,000
You're going nowhere!

352
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,000
Your mother asked me to watch you.

353
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,200
I won't marry anyone but Lu Nanyi.

354
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,160
Please let me go.

355
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,920
Father.

356
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
I can't help you.

357
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,280
Back in my day,

358
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
I galloped across battlefields,

359
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,360
slew countless enemies,

360
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,440
and achieved great military feats.

361
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,480
The Emperor himself bestowed upon me
the title of Prince of Anding.

362
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
But what good did it do?

363
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,680
At home,

364
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,200
I still have to listen to your mother.

365
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,840
However,

366
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,440
after I leave,

367
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,400
whatever happens here

368
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,200
cannot be blamed on me.

369
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,640
Thanks for your help, Father.

370
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,620
[Elixir Tavern]

371
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,480
Mrs. Lin, you are the one
who maintains yourself well,

372
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
looking bright and beautiful.

373
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,120
I like your nice words the most.

374
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,080
Madam,

375
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,920
Miss Lu is here.

376
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,600
Here you are.

377
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,760
Greetings, Mrs. Lin.

378
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,960
Have a seat.

379
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,520
I heard that the desserts
are excellent here.

380
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,400
So today,

381
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I specially invited Miss Lu

382
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,200
and Ruoxi to try them with me.

383
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,320
Here.

384
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,840
Try some peach blossom pastry.

385
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,920
Make yourself at home.

386
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,240
How do you like it?

387
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,640
Sweet and chewy.

388
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,520
Yummy.

389
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,720
Oh.

390
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,560
Ruoxi.

391
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,000
Try some too.

392
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,000
After you.

393
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,320
Ruoxi.

394
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,400
What do you think?

395
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,480
The kind of pastry

396
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,960
should be made
with the freshest blossoms from March,

397
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,440
ground into juice,

398
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,760
and then mixed with lard,

399
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,720
flour,

400
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,840
and sweet bean paste to create.

401
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,080
But the pastry here

402
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,000
uses dried flowers past their season,

403
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
thus lacking a bit of freshness.

404
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,080
Mrs. Lin, if you like
peach blossom pastry,

405
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,480
I'll personally make some another day

406
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,480
and deliver them to your residence.

407
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,320
Great.

408
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,280
General Li's wife

409
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,720
and Minister Liu's wife

410
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,440
told me

411
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,520
that Ruoxi makes
the best peach blossom pastry.

412
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,920
Then I'll expect to taste it.

413
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,920
It's my honor

414
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,600
to make you the pastry.

415
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,720
Oh.

416
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,520
Mrs. Lin,

417
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,680
the fifth day of next month

418
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,400
is the birthday of General Li's wife.

419
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,640
She believes I'm a reliable woman,

420
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,080
so she lets me organize it.

421
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,600
Madams' preferences and taboos

422
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,160
are already remembered by me.

423
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,200
General Li is good at fighting

424
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,440
and is deeply trusted by the Emperor.

425
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
Father was recently

426
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,580
playing cuju with General Li

427
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,580
and Minister Liu.

428
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,020
It's good for our families

429
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,840
to interact more often.

430
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,360
You're really thoughtful.

431
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,040
A woman from a prestigious family

432
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
should be like you,

433
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
skillful

434
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,880
and dignified.

435
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,240
Well.

436
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,760
I'm lucky to have you
as my daughter-in-law.

437
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
Mrs. Lin.

438
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,600
No dish

439
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,840
suits all tastes.

440
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,260
No matter how tasty

441
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,400
the delicate pasties are,

442
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,520
some people

443
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,800
just prefer street food

444
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,360
like a cheap bowl of small wonton.

445
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,700
That would suffice.

446
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,040
Miss Lu.

447
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,880
You strike me

448
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,800
as a straight girl.

449
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,640
Then I'll be straight with you.

450
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,760
Qingqiu has his own identity.

451
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,080
Neither could you be a nice wife

452
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,960
nor could you help him in his career.

453
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,080
But to Ruoxi,

454
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,040
it's as easy as breath.

455
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,520
So,

456
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,240
she

457
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,080
is the perfect match

458
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,280
for Qingqiu.
