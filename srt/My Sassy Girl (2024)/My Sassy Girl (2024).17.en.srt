00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,640
Oh.

193
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
You are Miss Lu.

194
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,080
It's really Miss Lu.

195
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,200
What?

196
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,800
You're Miss Lu.

197
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,880
Oh.

198
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I've been writing some words
in my spare time.

199
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,520
Miss Lu is my pen name.

200
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
Alas.

201
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,760
What a coincidence.

202
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,680
Mrs. Lin.

203
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
So you're talking about Miss Lu.

204
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,560
Her storybooks can teach people
to be good.

205
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,640
We all think highly of her.

206
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,280
She...

207
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,280
Yes.

208
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,640
Love's Betrayal.

209
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,880
That's the hottest storybook out there.

210
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,200
I didn't expect the author

211
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,480
to be so young

212
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,600
and so pretty.

213
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,920
This is the most talented girl
in the capital.

214
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,080
You are flattering me.

215
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
No, I'm not.

216
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,320
Wait.

217
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,520
I've heard

218
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,800
that when you were writing
the Love's Betrayal series,

219
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,760
you inspired the young prince
to crack many unsolved cases in Jinzhou

220
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,640
and brought peace to the people.

221
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
If you look around the capital,

222
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,160
there's no one more

223
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,960
worthy of this name than you.

224
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,920
Hahaha...

225
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,160
It's so good to see you today.

226
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,160
Miss Lu.

227
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,480
Please give me a stamp on my storybook.

228
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,320
You're carrying them?

229
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,040
For sure.

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,720
On my hand.

231
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,480
On my hand.

232
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,080
Is this okay?

233
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
Give me first.

234
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,440
I thought the most talented girl

235
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,480
in the capital was Wen Ruoxi.

236
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,800
We're always here for you.

237
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,640
I'm here for you.

238
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,400
- Right.
- We're here for you.

239
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,600
Thanks, my lady.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,560
Mrs. Lin.

241
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,200
We're going to show Mrs. Chen.

242
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,800
Right.

243
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,400
Let's go.

244
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,400
Show it to Mrs. Chen.

245
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:27,880
Let's go.

246
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,640
Thank you.

247
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,240
My lady.

248
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,520
You...

249
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,480
Miss Lu.

250
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,840
If you're not busy,

251
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,200
could you

252
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
come to my house?

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,680
Okay.

254
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,560
Three.

255
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,520
Two.

256
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,240
One.

257
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,400
Go.

258
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,940
[I Love You, Yin]

259
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,040
Good.

260
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,040
Go on.

261
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,600
Gently.

262
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,920
Gently.

263
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,560
Mr. Zhou.

264
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,280
Is this

265
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,360
really going to work?

266
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,120
I can guarantee you with my honor.

267
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,600
You'll get what you want.

268
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,800
Let's do it again.

269
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,480
Good.

270
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,320
Go.

271
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,200
Go on.

272
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,700
[Jingzhao Office, I Love You, Yin]

273
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,840
Very good.

274
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,520
Nice.

275
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,920
Great.

276
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,040
Mr. Zhou.

277
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
How's my hair?

278
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,200
Good.

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,000
Is my collar right?

280
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,960
Yes.

281
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,800
Come on.

282
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,440
Yes.

283

[I Love You, Yin]

284
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,040
What are you playing at today?

285
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,040
Yin.

286
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,120
I'm here today to confess.

287
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,400
Go.

288
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,560
Why are they all holding chrysanthemums?

289
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,960
Yes.

290
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,280
Life is only about 70 years long.

291
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,720
Take away ten years of childhood,

292
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,560
ten years of old age

293
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,440
and you've only got 50 years left.

294
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,480
During that, you eat and drink,

295
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
work and rest,

296
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
run around,

297
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
and lose a lot of time.

298
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,880
But

299
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,320
there's very little time left

300
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,120
to spend with your loved ones.

301
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,480
It's kind of touching.

302
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,380
That's nice.

303
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,640
Good words.

304
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,480
Nice.

311
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,480
I like you.

312
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,440
Your red lips

313
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,600
are so soft

314
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,120
that I can't get enough of them.

315
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,240
Your silver-plated face

316
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,760
is so beautiful.

317
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,320
I want to be entangled with you

318
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,600
until I die.

Wait.

Don't go, Yin.

328

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't push.

330

Everyone can get it.

331
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,960
I didn't realize

332
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,360
your storybooks would be so popular.

333
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,920
If you like it,

334
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,720
I'll

335
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,120
send you a complete set of
Love's Betrayal.

336
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,320
You're

337
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,560
a very frank girl.

338
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,000
Now

339
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,920
I understand

340
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,920
why Qingqiu likes you.

341
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,880
Now

342
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,080
I just hope you like me too.

343
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,720
I did everything I could
to stop you from being together.

344
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,760
Don't you

345
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,800

346
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,480
You are his mother.

347
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,080
You have your own position.

348
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,680
I can understand that.

349
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Sounds like

350
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm the one who is not generous.

351
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,400
I love him,

352
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,520
so I can tell.

353
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,560
You love him too.

354
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,440
But after all,

355
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,520
children are not
the continuation of their parents.

356
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,280
You should let him make his own choices.

357
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,680
Am I right?

358
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,360
Like the swallows on this beam,

359
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,160
they must learn to fly on their own,

360
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,840
even if

361
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,880
it's difficult and dangerous.

362
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,720
You

363
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,440
are a good writer, aren't you?

364
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,240
You can draw on metaphors

365
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
and speak eloquently.

366
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,760
It's still early.

367
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's have dinner

368
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,040
at the house.

369
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,280
Sure.

370
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,600

371
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,400
You've really made up your mind?

372
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,640
Yes.

373
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,360
But Mr. Lu

374
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,640
doesn't look very smart.

375
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,240
His tastes

376
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
are poor too.

377
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,200
Nonsense.

378
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,400
Mr. Lu is the Scholar

379
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,200
of the imperial court.

380
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,080
He's a gentle

381
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,800
and brave man.

382
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,960
He's not like what you said.

383
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,760
Besides,

384
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,920
it's pretty.

385
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,800
That's a tough one.

386
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,480
Since you like Mr. Lu,

387
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,800
what about the engagement
to the young prince?

388
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,640
I have my own plans.

389
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,520
Emm?

390
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,040
Help!

391
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,520
Ruoxi hanged herself.

392
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,360
Ruoxi.

393
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,840
Oh no.

394
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,760
Ruoxi.

395
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Leave me alone.

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,840
Let me go.

397
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,920
What's this for?

398
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,840
Leave me alone.

399
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,920
Somebody help.

400
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,560
Let me go.

401
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,440
Ruoxi.

402
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,640
Oh no, my sweetheart.

403
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,640
Why are you doing this?

404
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,080
Tell me why.

405
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,920
Mother.

406
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,800
I...

407
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
I don't want to live anymore.

408
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,360
Don't scare me.

409
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,840
What happened to you?

410
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,720
Tell me.

411
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll promise you anything.

412
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,440
Mother.

413
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
Life is short.

414
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,880
If I can't be with the one I love

415
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,480
for the rest of my life,

416
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,240
what's the point of living?

417
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,280
I see.

418
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,120
Even a royal family

419
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,320
can't easily change a fixed marriage.

420
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,800
I'll tell your father later

421
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,920
to go to the Mansion of Prince of Anding

422
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,680
as soon as possible.

423
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,480
We'll set the date for your marriage
to the young prince.

424
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,400
Then I'm not going to live.

425
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,360
Ruoxi.

426
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,080
Mother.

427
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,480
Can't you see

428
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,480
that she is in love with someone?

429
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,920
Isn't it the young prince?

430
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,720
You are talking about that voluptuary?

431
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,320
Mother.

432
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,200
Don't listen to her.

433
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,640
He's not a voluptuary.

434
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,880
He's...

435
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,080
He's Mr. Lu of the Jingzhao Office.

436
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,040
Lu Bai?

437
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,680
Yes.

438
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,080
Oh.

439
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,600
I've met him once before.

440
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
He looks charming.

441
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,080
And he's young and talented.

442
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,040
But he's from a poor background.

443
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,800
He's no match for the young prince.

444
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
Then I'm not going to live.

445
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:35,960
No no no.

446
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
Mother.

447
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,360
Ruoxi really likes that Mr. Lu.

448
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,240
Alas.

449
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Fine.

450
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,680
Then don't do this again.

451
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,040
I'll find a way

452
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,920
to get you out of this marriage.

453
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,760
[Elixir Tavern]

454
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,280
Have some tea.

455
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,680
Okay.

456
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,640
- Mrs. Wen.
- Mrs. Lin.

457
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,120
These days

458
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,960
I read a storybook called

459
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,640
Love's Betrayal: The Carp Fairy.

460
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
The love story in this book

461
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,840
is really touching.

462
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,240
That's a coincidence.

463
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,320
Ruoxi has been reading the same book.

464
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,520
I've also gone through the book

465
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,520
and it is indeed well written.

466
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,720
Is that so?

467
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,560
What a coincidence.

468
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,160
Has she heard some rumors?

469
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,520
Does she know it too?

470
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
What does she mean by that?

471
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,880
Did she finally recognize Nanyi?

472
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,400
That's great.

473
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,740
Right.

474
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,240
After reading this story,

475
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,000
I realized

476
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,680
that you can't force

477
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,080
a relationship.

478
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,160
Ah.

479
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,320
Please don't misunderstand me.

480
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm just

481
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,560
talking about my feelings.

482
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,280
I know how you feel.

483
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,240
Really?

484
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,560
You two...

485
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
