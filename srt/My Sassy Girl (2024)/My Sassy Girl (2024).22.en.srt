Cheers!

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm so glad

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,640
things have finally settled

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,640
for the three of us.

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,920
By the way,

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,400
why don't

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,480
the three of us get married
on the same day?

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah,

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,420
it'll be just like in the storybooks.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,440
We weren't born on the same day,

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,840
but we can marry on the same day!

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
Exactly!

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,280
Nanyi,

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,240
when do you and Qingqiu

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,640
plan to get married?

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,960
Ruoxi and I
will get prepared accordingly.

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,440
Yeah.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,600
We haven't decided yet.

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,440
My parents haven't returned.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
Wait.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,600
Do your parents even know

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,160
about your engagement

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,640
to the young Prince of Anding?

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Nope.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,080
They don't even know

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,800
Lin Qingqiu and I are together again.

38
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,080
What?

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,920
I don't even know
their exact whereabouts.

40
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,160
But no worries.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,120
They should be back soon.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,720
How can you not worry?

43
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,760
What if...

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
they don't agree

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,720
to your marriage to the young prince?

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,960
Why wouldn't they?

47
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,480
It's entirely possible.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,880
Didn't you run away from home

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,000
for over a year because of Qingqiu?

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,320
I heard

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,760
that when Qingqiu

52
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,700
was looking for you,

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,320
he went to see your parents,

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,320
but he

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,480
was stopped at the gate

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,920
and couldn't even get in.

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,160
Really?

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,800
So

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
your parents

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
might be bearing a grudge
against the young prince, right?

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,680
Would they

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,560
disapprove of your marriage

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,840
because of that?

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,080
Right!

65
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,160
It's hard to say.

66
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,320
What kind of person do they like?

67
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,600
I'm not sure,

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,440
but

69
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,200
during their travels
in the Jiangnan area,

70
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
they spoke highly

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,680
of a certain swordsman.

72
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,680
Oh,

73
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
I can't stay up anymore.

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm dozing off.

75
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,240
I need to go to bed.

76
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,000
Come here.

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,480
Aren't you going to bed?

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,880
- Don't worry about us.
- You go to sleep first.

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
We'll go to bed soon.

80
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,380
Fine.

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,440

The little rascal

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,640
finally wrote me a letter.

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,080
What does it say?

89
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,400
"Dear Nanyi,

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,800
I hope this letter finds you well.

91
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,080
A while back, Father, Mother, and I

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,600
were abducted by a group of bandits

93
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,880
in Loulan Kingdom
in the Western Regions.

94
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,920
Amazingly, we were rescued

95
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,640
by the same swordsman
who saved Father and Mother

96
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,080
in Jiangnan three years ago.

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Father and Mother said

98
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,900
it was fate

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,040
and praised him for..."

100
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,640
"And praised him for his heroism

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
and poise.

102
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
They think you two
will be kindred spirits,

103
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,040
so they've proposed
a marriage between you two.

104
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,380
Now,

105
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,440
we're just waiting
for my future brother-in-law's response.

Mother, Father, and I

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,280
will be returning to the capital soon.

108
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,960
You should get prepared, too.

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,240

A swordsman

112
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,560
sounds like

113
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,640
a good match for a storyteller.

114
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,160
Nanyi,

115
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,760
what are you going to do?

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,320
What else can I do?

117
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,560
If the worst comes to the worst,

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,640
I'll marry him.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,640
What?

120
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,760
I'm kidding!

121
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,320
As long as I don't agree,

122
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,840
my parents can't force me.

123
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,800
Every parent's

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,840
greatest wish

125
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,600
is for their children

126
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,280
to be happy

127
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,160
and carefree.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,040
You were once

129
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
heartbroken because of me.

130
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,720
They will not

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
forgive me so easily.

132
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
I will find a way

133
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,080
to earn their approval

134
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,440
so that they will

135
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,000
consent to our marriage.

136
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,240
Trust me.

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,360
Okay.

138
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,800
Come in!

139
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,480
This way, please.

140
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,080
This way.

141
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,080
Come on.

142
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,400
Sir!

143
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,760
Yes?

144
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,680
A pot of Huadiao wine,

145
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,480
an order
of eight treasure duck,

146
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,620
and a few side dishes.

147
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,240
Got it.

148
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,320
Serve some side dishes.

149
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,720
Every time we return to the capital,

150
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,280
I must have a bite of
the Elixir Tavern's eight treasure duck

151
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
before going home.

152
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,880
It's my favorite!

153
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,800
I wonder when Nanyi will be back.

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,360
I brought her the most popular toy
from the Western Regions.

155
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Father, Mother, look!

156
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
It even glows in the dark!

157
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,920
Oh my.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
There are so many

159
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,460
curiosities in the Western Regions.

160
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
They're a bit expensive though.

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,160
This one cost quite a bit of money.

162
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,360
Here you go.

163
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,560
Huadiao wine

164
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,800
and eight treasure duck.

165
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,080
Aren't you

166
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,640
the owner of that wonton shop?

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,840
That's me.

168
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,280
By keeping margins low and sales high,

169
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
I've grown it into a chain.

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Oh,

171
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,960
nice.

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
Sir.

173
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,440
What are you...?

174
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm paying for my meal and their meal.

175
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,520
Go on.

176
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,680
Who is this gentleman?

177
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,480
Thank you!

178
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,840
Greetings.

179
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,040
Thank you so much.

180
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,600
Hello, sir.

181
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,200
However,

182
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,220
we didn't ask you to pay for us.

183
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,680
Don't worry about it.

184
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
It's just a friendly gesture.

185
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,240
My name is Fu Wenyuan.

186
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,360
Young man,

187
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,720
you've got a lovely toy there.

188
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,040
Are you also from the capital, sir?

189
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,640
I'm a merchant from Jinzhou.

190
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,920
I came here to visit the capital's
wealthiest family, the Ye family.

191
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,760
Oh, the Ye family?

192
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,320
To be honest,

193
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
the business run by us, the Lu family,

194
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,000
is also among the top in the capital.

195
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,640
We can exchange ideas sometime.

196
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,200
Which "Lu"?

197
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,920
It means "deer". The animal
that can run and leap,

198
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,840
like this one.

199
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,920
I see.

200
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,400
Mr. Lu

201
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,120
and Mrs. Lu,

202
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,320
I have some matters to attend to,

203
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,320
so I must take my leave.

204
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,960
I will visit you some other day.

205
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
Take care, Mr. Fu.

206
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,200
Take care.

207
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,020
Father,

208
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,200
he's a wealthy merchant from Jinzhou.

209
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,720
Why were you so quiet?

210
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,880
He's neither from Jinzhou

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,140
nor a merchant.

212
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,060
Who is he then?

213
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,280
A noble from Loulan Kingdom
in the Western Regions.

214
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,040
How did you know?

215
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,560
Isn't Loulan Kingdom

216
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,640
already...

217
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
destroyed?

218
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,400
Oh, my silly boy,

219
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
you need to learn

220
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,920
how to judge people better.

221
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,900
Alright. Sit down.

222
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,080
- Come and sit down, sweetie.
- Let's dig in.

223
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,280
You must be hungry.

224
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,000
Sit down

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,560
and eat.

226
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,360
Let's have some wine.

227
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,680
Yin,

228
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,280
I searched everywhere

229
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,920
but couldn't find a suitable couple.

230
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,880
Let's just

231
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
pick two people at random.

232
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,760
That won't do!

233
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,120
We must find a suitable couple now

234
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,800
and let them pretend
to be Mr. and Mrs. Lu

235
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,400
so Qingqiu can rehearse.

236
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
What if Mr. Lin gets mad at us?

237
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,840
Who cares if he gets mad?

238
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,880
This is also Auntie's idea.

239
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,720
Now that we're full,

240
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,640
let's have a walk.

241
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,840
Okay.

242
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,600
Hey,

243
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,760
look,

244
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
how about those three over there?

245
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,240
This is beautiful, Mother.

246
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,880
Let's take a look.

247
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,140
- Do you like it?
- Let's go.

248
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,720
Yes,

249
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,080
I do!

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,480
Hands off, sweetie. We're not buying it.

251
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,400
We have stuff like this already.

252
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,080
May I have your names?

253
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,560
Names don't matter.

254
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,520
Here are ten taels of silver.

255
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,320
We want you to help us put on a show.

256
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,240
Are you in?

257
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Anyway, just do as we say.

258
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,760
You'll be generously paid.

259
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,880
Your cousin

260
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,840
must be quite a big name, huh?

261
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,360
Humph,

262
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,220
ever heard of the serial murders

263
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,080
in Jinzhou?

264
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,920
Did he commit those crimes?

265
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,400
He killed the killer.

266
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,480
How?

267
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
With two slashes,

268
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,880
he split him into four pieces.

269
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,240
Wow!

270
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
Ever heard

271
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,160
of the infamous ghost painting murder
that shook Daling and went unsolved

272
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,040
for ten years?

273
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,560
Was he the ghost?

274
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,240
No,

275
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,320
he was the ghostbuster.

276
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,200
No demon or spirit

277
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,400
could escape him.

278
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,240
So is he human or a ghost?

279
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,680
Anyway,

280
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,200
that doesn't matter.

281
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,320
All you need to do

282
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,120
is act

283
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
like two strict parents-in-law

284
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,400
and challenge him

285
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,680
as much as you can.

286
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,560
Got it?

287
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,360
Yeah,

288
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,200
that's right.

289
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,120
Don't be timid and scared.

290
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,280
Just act

291
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,040
like you really are Mr. and Mrs. Lu.

292
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,240
Mr. and Mrs. Lu?

293
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,320
That's us!

294
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,480
Exactly!

295
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,840
That's the spirit!

296
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,160
You're doing great!

297
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,840
Qingqiu.

298
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Oh, sir,

299
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,880
you're here just in time.
I hired them to help you practice.

300
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,880
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,

301
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,600
please have a seat.

302
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,600
Not bad!

303
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,120
But you forgot the tea.

304
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,280
When meeting your in-laws
for the first time,

305
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,720
you should serve them tea.

306
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,400
Yin is right, sir.

307
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,840
Mr. Lu, please have some tea.

308
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
Thanks.

309
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,000
Mrs. Lu.

310
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,360
Just put it down.

311
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,560
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,800
Good.

313
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
I, Lin Qingqiu...

314
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,400
Stop!

315
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,160
Sir,

316
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,880
you should start by stating

317
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,400
that you're the young Prince of Anding.

318
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,920
In this way,

319
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,080
you can highlight your identity.

320
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,960
Got it?

321
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,920
Lei Yu,

322
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,040
this is Mr. Lu,

323
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,840
Mrs. Lu, and Lu Nan'er.

324
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,000
I know.

325
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,000
I hired them.

326
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,600
But sir,

327
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,120
you're really getting
into character quickly.

328
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,880
Mr. Lei,

329
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,800
shouldn't you be patrolling now?

330
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
This isn't Jinzhou.

331
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,160
Why would I be patrolling?

332
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,920
Father!

333
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,920
Mother!

334
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,960
Nanyi?

335
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,480
Come here!

336
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,520
Nanyi!

337
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,360
Nanyi!

338
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
You little rascal,

339
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,760
it's been so long!

340
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,440
Great acting!

341
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,880
Come here!

342
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,960
How have you been?

343
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,360
Come.

344
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,240
Come here.

345
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,920
Father, Mother,

346
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,840
I've missed you so much!

347
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,640
I've missed you, too!

348
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,960
- Did Ruoxi tell Nanyi...
- Let me take a look at you.

349
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,920
About our plan?

350
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,880
I've been well.

351
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,280
Looks like it.

352
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,360
Guys, great job!

353
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,960
Amazing acting.

354
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,440
I even want to take lessons from you.

355
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,920
What acting?

356
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,320
Father, Mother,

357
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,480
what is he talking about?

358
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,560
I'm confused.

359
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,200
Nanyi,

360
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,080
let me tell you.

361
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,880
Someone offered us ten taels

362
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
to help them put on a show

363
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,280
so they could practice

364
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,760
how to fool their in-laws.

365
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,840
The money is indeed

366
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,200
easy to earn,

367
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
but we don't have the mood

368
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
to have it!

369
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,

370
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,200
I...!

371
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,000
Nanyi,

372
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,120
come home with us.

373
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,280
But...

374
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,080
Mother,

375
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,080
Qingqiu had nothing to do with this!

376
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,880
Mother!

377
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,500
[Contest for Choosing a Son-in-Law]

378
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,460
Slow down.

379
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Be careful.

380
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,840
Hey, you two, move that table over here.

381
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,600
Hurry!

382
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,240
Yes.

383
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,440
Sir!

384
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,120
