[Episode 14]

12
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,000
Master Luo, do you recall

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,880
when I visited you
at the Yunshan Painting Gallery?

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,200
That day,

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,440
I noticed a painting in your backroom

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,560
[The summer of the Year of Guisi,]
of a woman wearing

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,600
[Yunshan Painting Gallery by Luo Hanshui]
a simple yet special wooden hairpin.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
I remembered

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,240
that Zhu also wore a plain hairpin,

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,320
which was unbefitting of her status
as Mr. Qian's concubine

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,480
yet identical to the one

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,160
in your painting.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
This led me to suspect a connection
between the two of you,

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,480
so I sent someone to investigate
in your hometown.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,880
As it turned out,
you two grew up together

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,760
and shared mutual affection.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,680
However, six months ago,

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,400
Zhu was brought away by Mr. Qian,

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,720
which explains your resentment

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
toward merchants like him.

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Also, it's impossible

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,320
that a mere painter

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,360
can have such strong hands.

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,200
You're obviously trained
in martial arts.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,720
Thus,

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,960
I suspected you were the murderer.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,120
However,

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,800
if you hadn't attempted
to steal the painting that night,

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
we wouldn't have suspected
there was anything wrong with it.

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,440
When Nanyi

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,360
accidentally touched
the blue pigment on the painting,

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,120
she became dazed

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,120
and hallucinated,

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
so I suspected even more
that the painting was the issue.

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
I then tested it on myself

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,160
and discovered

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,880
that the Snow Spirit Painting
killed Mr. Qian

48
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
because its blue pigment

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,000
contained the Snow Cold Spider Poison.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,800
This painting
was created by your master Ye Qingshan,

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,260
but you were well aware
of the deadly poison it contained,

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,640
so you found a way

53
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,560
to let Mr. Qian have the painting.

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,040
All this was merely our speculation

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,640
until you came to give Zhu the antidote,

56
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,760
which confirmed

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,280
that all our suspicions were correct.

58
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,920
How could you be so reckless?

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,680
That Qian was a lecherous scoundrel.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,820
When he learned
about the magical Snow Spirit Painting,

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,480
which depicted a beautiful woman
who could step out of the canvas,

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,160
he became obsessed with it.

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,840
He ignored the ominous rumors
surrounding it

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,480
and began searching for it.

65
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,080
That's when I knew

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,400
my chance had come.

67
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,560
Although the painting
was crafted by my master,

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,520
it had been circulating in the world
for over a decade.

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
After much inquiry,

70
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,880
I finally acquired it
at the Ghost Market in Wuyi Town

71
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,920
and promptly sold it to Qian.

Master Luo,

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,440
did you realize that breaking
into the yamen to steal the painting

76
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,080
would increase your chance
of getting caught?

77
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,200
I knew that if the authorities
discovered the origin of the painting,

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,400
I would become a suspect,

79
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,960
so

80
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,200
I had no choice but to break
into the yamen

81
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
to steal it back.

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,920
But despite my careful planning,

Well, it is what it is.

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,040

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,240
It has no master anyway.

190
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,640
If you can give it a home,

191
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
you'll be doing a great deed.

192
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

193
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,400
So

194
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,720
what should we name it?

195
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,560
How about

196
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
Tanghulu?
[*candied fruit]

197
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,120
Sure.

198
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,120
- Tanghulu!
- Tanghulu!

199
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,560
- Tanghulu!
- Tanghulu!

200
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,160
Do I really have to resign?

201
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,720
Tell me to stay, Zhou!

202
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,720
Alas!

203
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,400
What is he waiting for?

204
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,580
Alas.

205
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,800
Sir,

206
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,880
please reconsider.

207
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,720
Once you resign,

208
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,360
you'll never be an official again!

209
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,120
Mr. Lin was just joking with you.

210
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,600
Why take it so seriously?

211
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,160
Joking with me?

212
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
I, Lu Bai, never joke!

213
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,680
I lost the bet.

214
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,560
I'll honor it!

215
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,280
Good!

216
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,000
I wrote my resignation letter
last night,

217
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,000
and I will submit it
to the Emperor tomorrow.

218
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Mr. Lu, you're indeed a man of honor.

219
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,560
You stick to your word!

220
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,160
Of course.

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,440
I also need to be paraded, right?

222
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,500
No problem!

223
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,280
I'll go right now!

224
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,080
I...

225
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,880
I'll go...

226
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,520
Oh,

227
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,920
what a lovely dog!

228
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,160
Zhou...!

229
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Zhou!

230
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Gosh.

231
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,280
- How adorable.
- Mr. Lu certainly

232
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,160
keeps his word.

233
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,360
Alas,

234
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,800
Mr. Lu

235
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,440
is a man of principle and integrity.

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,440
We must respect his decision.

237
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,960
Isn't that right, Tanghulu?

238
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,560
This can't happen!

239
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,000
A public parade is beneath your dignity!

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,880
Exactly!

241
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,520
Yeah!

242
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,080
You have to do it.

243
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
I've never seen an imperial official
paraded before.

244
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,320
This is a first!

245
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,680
I must include it

246
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,660
in my storybook!

247
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,320
Lu

248
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,560
Bai,

249
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,800
when you resign and get paraded
through the streets, cover your face

250
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
so you don't disgrace
the other scholars.

251
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,320
Don't worry.

252
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,320
I'll book a great window seat

253
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
at the Elixir Tavern
to watch your parade.

254
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,680
You are really adding insult to injury.

255
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
Fine!

256
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll give you a show to remember!

257
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,720
I...!

258
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,200
- Sir!
- In our original bet,

259
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,640
I merely requested
an archive pass if you lost

260
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
which was to aid in my investigation
of the serial murders in Jinzhou.

261
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,480
The resignation and public parade
were your own ideas.

262
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,520
They don't count.

263
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,320
The people of the capital need you
to maintain justice for them.

264
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,720
You can't just resign

265
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,440
and abandon
your responsibilities, right?

266
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,880
Fine.

267
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,680
I was going to resign,

268
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,980
but since you insist that I stay,

269
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,900
I'll grant your wish.

270
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,200
I'll stay at the Capital Office.

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,240
That was close.

272
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,560
Here it is.

273
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,960
Come on.

274
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,760
Dig in!

275
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,680
Wow.

276
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,920
These look delicious!

277
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,440
How is it?

278
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,280
Do you like it?

279
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,560
Yes,

280
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,400
it tastes great!

281
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,920
Of course.

282
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,600
I personally made it for you.

283
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,880
You are skilled

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
in so many areas.

285
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,000
Why did you settle

286
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,160
for being a mere head constable?

287
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,680
Yin,

288
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,680
you're finally interested in my past.

289
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,280
I just hate to see you

290
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,840
wasting your potential

291
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,800
and being idle.

292
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,440
Here.

293
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,240
Try this.

294
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,680
Where did you get

295
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,480
all those scars?

296
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,720
I got them

297
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,760
when I was in the army,
fighting bandits.

298
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,520
They were brutal,

299
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,360
and I nearly lost my life.

300
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,480
Those comrades of mine who died

301
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,160
were all brave and respectable men

302
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,640
when they were alive.

303
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,760
But after they died,

304
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,640
they became unclaimed bodies

305
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,320
without even a solitary grave.

306
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,680
Every man aspires to make his mark,

307
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,120
and I am no exception.

308
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,200
But we only get to live once.

309
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,960
I didn't want to die silently

310
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,280
like them.

311
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,560
No one would've cared about
or mourned me.

312
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,880
Yin,

313
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,360
why are you crying?

314
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,040
I'm not crying.

315
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,840
It's the chili.

316
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,480
Oh,

317
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,840
then don't eat this.

318
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,360
Hey.

319
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,400
Here.

320
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,240
Try this one.

321
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,880
It's delicious too.

322
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,440
But, to be honest,

323
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
back then, I didn't see

324
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,920
the point of glory and success

325
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,960
because no one would've been proud of me

326
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,400
or left a light on for me
on a cold night.

327
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,360
But...

328
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,280
it all changed when I met you.

329
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh,

330
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,720
I know you think I'm lazy and dumb.

331
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,080
Once this case is solved,

332
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,080
I'll go achieve something great.

333
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,640
But

334
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,720
are you willing to wait for me?

335
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,720
You're not going anywhere.

336
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,840
If you leave,

337
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
who will cook for me?

338
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,360
Yin,

339
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,560
are you saying...?

340
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,560
Yin,

341
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,600
could you say that again?

342
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,320
Eat your food.

343
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,500
[Capital Office]

344
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,760
Oh, Sir,

345
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,080
is this Longjing tea?

346
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,360
Yes.

347
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
It cost me two taels.

348
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,560
Sir,

349
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,760
if you want tea,

350
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,680
just tell me to buy it.

351
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,680
Why did you go yourself?

352
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,760
It's not for me.

353
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,960
It's a gift.

354
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,360
A gift?

355
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
I must have misheard.

356
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,920
Everyone knows you're

357
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,120
one of the stingiest people
in the capital.

358
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,480
What?

359
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,160
I mean

360
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,480
you're incorruptible,

361
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,760
honest, and upright.

362
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,840
You never exploit the people.

363
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,160
That's more like it.

364
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,400
Sir,

365
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
who is this tea for?

366
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,840
Well,

367
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,500
Lin Qingqiu.

368
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,560
Lin Qingqiu?

369
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,800
But you two have never got along.

370
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,200
You're not planning to poison it,
are you?

371
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,620
Sir,

372
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,460
it's a capital crime
to harm a fellow official!

373
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,080
- Please don't do it!
- What are you talking about, Zhou?

374
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
I'll tell you the truth.

375
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,560
Lin Qingqiu helped me solve
the murder case at the Qian Residence,

376
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,600
so I want to express my gratitude.

377
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,640
I'm not a petty person.

378
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,760
I'll let

379
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
bygones be bygones.

380
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,480
From now on,

381
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,040
any grudge against him

382
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
is erased.

383
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,680
Sir,

384
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,280
you are truly magnanimous!

385
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,920
Mr. Lu!

386
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,200
Sir,

387
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,480
there are people at the gate.

388
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,480
They've brought a plaque
to express their gratitude.

389
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,760
See,

390
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,840
Zhou?

391
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,720
My good name is finally spreading
in the capital.

392
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,640
I may even be remembered after I die.

393
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,280
Let's go

394
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,040
and take a look.

395
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,080
Where is he?

396
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,580
[Sleuth Extraordinaire]

397
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,980
Why hasn't he come out yet?

398
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
[Sleuth Extraordinaire]
When will he come out?

399
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
Greetings,

400
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,320
everyone.

401
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,400
Thank you for your gift.

402
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,520
I humbly accept it.

403
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,800
From now on,

404
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
I will work even harder

405
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,160
to ensure security and justice

406
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,440
for the people of the capital!

407
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,400
Well said!

408
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,600
Where is he?

409
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,940
Where is Mr. Lin?

410
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,400
Mr. Lu.

411
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,800
Mr. Lu?

412
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
Is Mr. Lin here?

413
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,000
Lin Qingqiu?

414
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,040
Yes.

415
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,400
He's in the backyard.

416
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,400
Why?

417
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,280
Do you need him?

418
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,000
Well,

419
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,240
we came to thank Mr. Lin.

420
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
He helped us recover the debts
owed by the Qian family.

421
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,040
Right.

422
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,600
Mrs. Qian was kind enough

423
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,160
to repay the money.

424
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,200
That haunted painting harmed

425
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,840
so many innocent people over the decade.

426
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,880
Now, thanks to Mr. Lin,

427
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,080
the truth has finally been revealed.

428
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,640
We are deeply grateful to him.

429
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,580
Yes,

430
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,960
we came specifically to thank Mr. Lin.

431
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,960
What an upright official.

432
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,840
Indeed.

433
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,000
Mr. Lin

434
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,620
is busy with official duties.

435
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,040
Please come back

436
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,520
another day.

437
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,960
Now go!

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
We'll do this another time.

441
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,280
Let's go.

442
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,240
From now on,

443
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,700
Lin Qingqiu and I

444
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,760
will be irreconcilable!

445
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Irreconcilable!

446
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,560
Master Luo,

447
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,120
how have you been?

448
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm alright, thanks to you.

449
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
With me in prison,

450
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,160
how is Zhu doing?

451
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,200
I will look after her.

452
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,800
But

453
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,440
I need you to answer a few questions.

454
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,320
Since Zhu is well,

455
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,040
I...

456
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,040
I've been sentenced to exile by Mr. Lu.

457
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,560
Before I leave here,

458
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,360
I'll answer any questions you have.

459
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,040
I will keep my word too.

460
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,080
I trust you.

461
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,760
Please, ask away.

462
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,320
Have you heard

463
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,000
of the black fish jade pendant?

464
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,640
The black fish jade pendant?

465
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,040
It sounds familiar.

466
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,520
Like the Snow Spirit Painting,

467
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,040
it came from the tomb
of the Grand Tutor's daughter.

468
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,080
It was likely stolen
by the same group of robbers.

469
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,320
Do you know

470
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
who stole it?

471
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,840
That I don't know.

472
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,880
But in Wuyi Town's Ghost Market,

473
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,120
all sorts of rare treasures
of unknown origin are sold.

474
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,200
Many tomb robbers

475
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,080
trade there in secret.

476
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,520
So you

477
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
might find useful clues there.

478
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,360
Okay,

479
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,480
I see.

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Sir,

481
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,400
the Ghost Market is perilous.

482
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,800
You can't just go there.

483
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,920
What do you mean?

484
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,400
Here's the thing.

485
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,560
[Capital Office]

486
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,320
What?

487
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,800
We have to go like that?

488
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,000
That's really strange.

489
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,240
Are you sure he wasn't lying?

490
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,320
We'll find out when we get there.

491
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,040
But this

492
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,280
might make an interesting plot
in my storybook.

493
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,760
Indeed.

494
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,000
I've never heard
of something like this before.

495
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,360
We need to confirm this with someone

496
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,320
who knows the capital well.

497
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,080
Mr. Lin,

498
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,600
you won the bet.

499
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,160
Mr. Lu asked me to give you
this badge of authority.

500
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,040
You can now access the archive.

501
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,040
Mr. Zhou, please have a seat.

502
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,800
Mr. Zhou, you are a local here, right?

503
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,280
Have you heard

504
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,200
of the Ghost Market in Wuyi Town

505
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,040
on the capital's outskirts?

506
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,960
Well...

507
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,840
Why are you suddenly interested

508
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,740
in that, Mr. Lin?

509
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,120
It's for the investigation.

510
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,560
Please, tell us what you know.

511
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,520
If it weren't for your investigation,

512
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,840
I'd rather not discuss it.

513
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,520
But yes,

514
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,040
I have heard of the Ghost Market
in Wuyi Town.

515
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,680
Rumor has it that the market

516
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,000
operates from dusk

517
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,440
till dawn,

518
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,000
with buyers and sellers all in masks.

519
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,440
Even the world's rarest treasures

520
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,200
can be found there.

521
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,440
It sounds like

522
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,120
this Ghost Market

523
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,280
is quite intriguing.

524
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,320
Mr. Lin,

525
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,760
it is more perilous than intriguing!

526
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,080
I advise you

527
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,640
to stay away from it

528
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,960
lest you get into trouble.

529
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Let's check
