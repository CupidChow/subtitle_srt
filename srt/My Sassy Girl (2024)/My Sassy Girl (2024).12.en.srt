[Episode 12]

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,480
So,

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,080
she

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,960
is the perfect match

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,120
for Qingqiu.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,160
Miss Lu,

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,320
don't be disheartened.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
As I told you a few days ago,

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,800
after I marry Mr. Lin,

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,520
I'll personally see to it

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
that you're brought into the mansion.

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,040
Then,

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,040
the two of us will...

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,880
Mrs. Lin,

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,080
as the noble Princess of Anding,

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,160
are you only concerned

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,120
about Lin Qingqiu's career prospects?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,240
Do you not care

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,160
if he's happy?

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,480
You...!

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,640
I've said all I needed to.

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,360
Goodbye.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,360
How disgraceful!

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,720
What poor manners!

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,040
Nanyi!

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,760
Enjoy your drink!

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,180
A table for two upstairs!

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,440
Mrs. Lin,

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,440
don't be upset.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,600
Miss Lu does have

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,520
a bit of a rebellious streak,

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,200
but don't worry,

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,240
I'll make sure
to discipline her well in the future.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm glad

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,320
that you are so mature.

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,040
Ruoxi,

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,480
as parents, we know you two
are the perfect match.

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,880
I know exactly what kind of person

49
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,400
Qingqiu is.

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,640
He's been

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
obedient and sensible
since he was a child.

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,200
His obsession with her will fade away.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,200
Since I scolded him yesterday,

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,360
he's been reflecting on himself at home.

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,360
Mother!

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
Qiu?

57
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,920
What are you doing?

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,460
I don't know what you said to Nanyi,

59
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,900
but my attitude remains unchanged:

60
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,960
I will marry no one but Lu Nanyi!

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,440
I shall take my leave.

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,000
Qiu,

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,840
stop!

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
Come back here.

65
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,560
Qiu...

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,220
My heart belongs to someone else.

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,320
You and I are not a good match.

68
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,000
Miss Wen,

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,600
please tell Mr. Wen to cancel
our engagement as soon as possible.

70
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,040
Nonsense!

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,280
Qingqiu!

72
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,040
I heard

73
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,720
that right in front of Auntie
and Wen Ruoxi,

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,000
Qingqiu

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,920
said,

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,560
"I will marry no one but Lu Nanyi!"

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,560
You should've seen

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,880
Wen Ruoxi's face right then.

79
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,920
It immediately paled!

80
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
I wish I had been there

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,120
to see it myself.

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,640
I don't know if her face paled,

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,880
but I'm definitely blushing
with embarrassment.

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,640
That's not the point!

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Nanyi,

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,600
you must have faith in Qingqiu.

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,320
His heart

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,400
has always belonged to you.

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Of course, I trust

90
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,640
the man I chose.

91
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,480
Oh, there's somewhere else

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
I need to be.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,780
I should get going.

94
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,920
I'll let you two talk.

95
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,760
Good night.

96
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,440
Good night.

97
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,280
Nanyi,

98
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
are you upset?

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,480
Why would I be upset?

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
I got to enjoy

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,800
the best royal pastries

102
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,200
without spending cash.

103
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
What's there to be upset about?

104
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,280
I promise

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,040
I will break off the engagement
with Miss Wen.

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
You are the only one

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,080
I will marry.

108
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,040
Don't worry.

109
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,680
Miss Wen actually came up
with a great idea.

110
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,920
She said

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,640
that after she married you,

112
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
she'd personally arrange for me
to become your concubine.

113
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,320
What?

114
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,200
Quiet.

115
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Someone's on the roof.

116
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,160
Help!

117
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,000
Someone broke in!

118
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,260
Hurry!

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,640
Freeze!

120
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,560
Stop!

121
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,880
Go after him!

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,840
The man came to steal the painting.

123
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
He must be connected
with Mr. Qian's case.

124
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,040
He could have run away.

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
Why take a risk
to come and steal the painting?

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,440
It can only mean one thing.

127
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,640
The killer's identity
is tied to the painting.

128
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,240
Seal off the entire street

129
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
and search every house!

130
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,400
Understood!

131
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,640
Hurry!

132
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,360
Stop!

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,880
Freeze!

134
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
"When shall we meet again,
and get to know each other well?

135
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,320
Tonight, by the emotions
I am overwhelmed."

136
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,480
Ruoxi,

137
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
it's late.

138
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,040
Let's return to our rooms and rest.

139
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,920
I can't sleep.

140
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,760
Today,

141
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,720
I felt really embarrassed.

142
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,760
Don't worry, Ruoxi.

143
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,320
There were no more than five people
in the reception hall.

144
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
No one will say anything about it.

145
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,080
Have a walk with me.

146
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,200
Sure.

147
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,280
Stop!

148
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,720
Watch out!

149
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,440
Could it be

150
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,960
that Lu Nanyi's curse is coming true?

151
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
Did the love of my life

152
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,600
fall from the sky?

153
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
If I say

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,400
I didn't do it on purpose,

155
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,640
will you believe me?

156
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,560
Even though it wasn't on purpose,

157
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,480
I'm so glad it happened!

158
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,880
How dare you!

159
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,100
I...

160
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
Where did this scoundrel come from?

161
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
How dare you
harass a lady in the capital!

162
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,200
Beat him up!

163
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,720
Stop it!

164
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,140
It's a misunderstanding!

165
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,440
Is there

166
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,200
something wrong with the painting?

167
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't know why,

168
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,320
but this painting

169
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,440
looks oddly familiar.

170
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,080
Don't touch and sniff it like that.

171
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,080
It might be dangerous.

172
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,360
You're overreacting.

173
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,000
It's just a painting.

174
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
Don't worry.

175
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,120
I feel so cold.

176
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,000
But you don't have a fever.

177
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,040
I feel so cold.

178
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,800
Nanyi...

179
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,840
Are you insane?

180
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,040
It was you

181
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,560
who came on to...

182
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,600
Nonsense!

183
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
You were clearly trying
to take advantage of me!

184
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,800
Ruoxi!

185
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Why are you here?

186
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,240
Ruoxi,

187
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,560
what were you doing?

188
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,120
It's time for breakfast.

189
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,800
I don't know

190
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,440
what's got into me lately,

191
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,280
but the sight of Bai

192
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,800
makes my heart race

193
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,120
and my chest tight

194
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,000
like I'm out of breath.

195
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,680
Oh,

196
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,480
I see.

197
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,560
Seeing Bai injured

198
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,600
makes you worried.

199
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,640
You're always so kind-hearted, Ruoxi.

200
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,440
Is that it?

201
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,240
Of course.

202
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,000
But

203
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,920
why is my face so hot?

204
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,000
How infuriating!

205
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,200
I can't believe

206
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,660
we didn't catch
that man in black last night.

207
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,800
Everyone's efforts were wasted!

208
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,560
I thought you getting beaten up

209
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
might have at least
led to some progress.

210
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,440
Aren't you the pot
calling the kettle black?

211
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,200
You didn't find anything either.

212
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,120
We found out

213
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,840
that the Snow Spirit Painting
is poisonous.

214
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,840
It was that poison that made Mr. Qian

215
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,000
act so strangely.

216
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
The painting is poisonous?

217
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,840
Sir,

218
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
here are your favorite qingtuan.
[*Qingtuan refers to green rice balls.]

219
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,320
The raised blue pigment on the painting

220
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,720
can cause mental disturbances.

221
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,600
Mr. Lu, it's best

222
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,720
if you stay away from it.

223
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You don't want to get poisoned.

224
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,480
How did you two

225
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,080
figure that out?

226
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,120
Mr. Lu,

227
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,240
are you prying into my investigation?

228
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,960
If you want to admit defeat,
there's still time.

229
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,920
Who said anything
about admitting defeat?

230
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm just saying

231
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,240
that since the painting is poisonous,

232
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,800
it definitely didn't fall
into Mr. Qian's hands

233
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,840
by coincidence.

234
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,080
Moreover,

235
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,560
it's likely that the strange occurrences

236
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,400
at the Qian Residence were also planned.

237
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,360
First, the disturbances
at the Qian Residence

238
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,800
led to ghost rumors.

239
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,720
Then, Mr. Qian went mad.

240
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,960
And last night,

241
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,320
a man in black broke
into the Capital Office

242
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,800
and then vanished without a trace.

243
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,960
This case

244
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,600
is indeed complicated.

245
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,000
Mr. Lu,

246
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,760
what do you plan to look into next?

247
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,120
What?

248
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,280
Are you prying too?

249
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,120
Mr. Lin,

250
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,840
remember that we have a bet.

251
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,920
We agreed not to interfere
with each other's investigations.

252
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,720
Don't make me lose respect for you.

253
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,480
Sir,

254
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,680
where are you going?

255
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,600
I'm...

256
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,960
I'm going to investigate.

257
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,360
Yes, investigate.

258
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,560
Eat something

259
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,960
before you go and investigate!

260
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,680
Sir.

261
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,000
Sir!

262
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,680
Try this.

263
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,920
I'm Lu Bai from the Capital Office!

264
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,680
Stop the beating!

265
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,440
Pretending to be an imperial official?

266
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,200
That's an additional crime!

267
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,440
Beat him harder!

268
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,360
Stop it!

269
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,920
How can you beat someone like this?

270
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,160
This is outrageous!

271
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,540
Mr. Lu,

272
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,960
are you alright?

273
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
It's just a minor injury.

274
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,920
It's nothing to worry about.

275
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,040
Ouch.

276
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,160
Is this

277
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,960
your jade pendant, Miss?

278
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,520
Yes, but it's broken.

279
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,160
It must be something you treasure.

280
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm truly sorry

281
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,760
it broke because of me.

282
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,120
If you don't mind,

283
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,080
I'll have it repaired

284
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
and return it to you.

285
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,920
Mr. Lu,

286
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,920
did you ask for me?

287
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,040
Miss Lu.

288
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Um...

289
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,640
Oh, right.

290
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
I wanted to ask you

291
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,800
how you and Lin Qingqiu

292
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,080
found out last night

293
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,040
that the painting was poisonous

294
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,880
and could cause hallucinations?

295
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,480
Well,

296
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,200
last night,

297
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,160
I accidentally got affected by it.

298
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,120
What?

299
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,400
You got poisoned?

300
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,520
It was nothing serious though.

301
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,640
Last night,

302
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
when you were chasing that man in black,

303
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,720
Qingqiu and I thought

304
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,120
that if he was willing to take
such a big risk to steal the painting,

305
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,960
there must be something wrong with it,

306
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,400
so

307
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,260
we examined the painting.

308
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,920
I touched

309
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,040
the blue pigment on it

310
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,080
and sniffed it,

311
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,840
and then I started feeling strange.

312
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
So

313
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,720
one can get poisoned

314
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,200
just by touching the blue pigment?

315
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,360
Yes.

316
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,680
What symptoms did you have?

317
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,600
Well...

318
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,960
At that time, I...

319
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,720
Mr. Lu,

320
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,320
didn't we agree on fair competition?

321
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,640
How can you

322
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,000
extract information

323
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,200
from my people behind my back?

324
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,120
Isn't this cheating?

325
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,480
How...

326
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,000
How can you call this cheating?

327
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,080
I am in charge of this case.

328
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,080
It's only natural
that I inquire about all leads.

329
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,920
Then please adhere

330
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,240
to our agreement, Mr. Lu.

331
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,920
Of course, I will.

332
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,280
What are you looking into next?

333
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,120
The killer

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
went to great lengths
to get the painting,

335
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,680
so there must be
something significant about it.

336
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,760
Therefore,

337
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
we should start by investigating
the painting's origin.

338
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,240
