[Episode 3]

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,440
Ji Xinshi.

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
Let me guess.

14
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,360
You packed this medicine?

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,840
Exactly.

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,800
Lord Lin.

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
What's wrong with it?

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,920
My Lord.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,120
Familiar with it?

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,080
This is the red silk knot
used to hang Ji Fanghai.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,320
It is a rare chevron knot.

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
You tied the knot the same way

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,440
you wrapped the medicine.

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,960
Do you want to confess it?

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,000
Lord Lin.

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,560
With just one knot,

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,280
can you convict me of the crime?

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,000
Of course not.

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
For the scar on your palm,

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,880
how do you explain it?

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,320
I got hurt when crushing the medicine
two days ago.

32
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,040
Workers in Virtue Hall

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,680
can prove it.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
When you killed Bao Sheng,

35
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,280
Bao Sheng resisted

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,960
and scratched your palm.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,400
So you intentionally hurt your palm

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,240
to cover up the scratches.

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,000
Am I right?

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,040
Lord Lin.

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,440
Without evidence,

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,920
you cannot convict me of a crime
with deduction.

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,120
You are trampling on human lives.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,120
I don't buy it.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,480
Let's talk about the murder weapon.

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,720
Bao Sheng and Ji Fanghai

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
were killed with the same
curiously shaped blade.

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,960
After inspection,

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
The closest thing to the shape of it

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,960
is a physician's lancet.

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,160
Lei.

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,560
Go check Ji Xinshi's medicine box.

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,320
Yes.

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,520
My Lord.

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,760
No lancet.

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
Lord Lin.

57
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,080
You have no evidence.

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,240
You can't wrong a good man.

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
That is weird.

60
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,960
I've interrogated
all the physicians in Jinzhou.

61
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,880
None of their lancets

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,520
fit the wound of the deceased.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,560
And at this time,

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,480
you lost yours.

65
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,840
Tell me.

66
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,400
Did you kill someone

67
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,360
and hide the lancet on purpose?

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,920
I didn't.

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,800
Where is the lancet?

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,360
I threw it.

71
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,640
Where and when?

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,400
I threw it at...

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,240
At...

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,680
In the well in the backyard.

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
I knew it.

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,640
This adopted son

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
must have some problem.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,280
I used the murder weapon as a lure

79
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,280
to make the suspect show up.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,120
Then I saw a man sneak around

81
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,840
and throw a lancet

82
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,200
into the backyard well.

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
Thanks to Fu Wenyuan,

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,480
he took a lot of effort

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,440
to get it out.

86
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Its size must match the victim's wound.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
Ji Xinshi.

88
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,080
Your statement
is full of inconsistencies and loopholes.

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,200
Now there are both witnesses
and physical evidence,

90
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,560
what else do you want to say?

91
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,880
Come on.

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Arrest him.

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,240
Yes.

94
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,680
What's wrong?

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
What happened?

96
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,100
Lord Lin.

97
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,040
What's up?

98
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,160
Ouch.

99
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,660
Don't move.

100
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,300
Ji Xinshi.

101
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,640
Don't come over.

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,360
Don't come over.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,160
Actually, I don't want

104
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,240
to get anyone else involved in this.

105
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,720
But you guys push me
over and over again.

106
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,720
Calm down.

107
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,920
Let Mr. Yu go.

108
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Get me a fast horse.

109
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,640
When I arrived in the countryside,

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,280
I would let this old man go.

111
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,040
Otherwise,

112
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
I will kill him right now.

113
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,640

114
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
Ji Xinshi.

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,640
Ji Fanghai is your adoptive father
who brought you up,

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,760
why did you kill him?

117
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,160
Adoptive father?

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,560
I was raised by my adoptive mother.

119
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,440
He...

120
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,480
He is nothing.

121
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,040
When I was seven years old,

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,400
both my parents passed away.

123
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,200
I didn't have the money to bury them.

124
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,280
I had to sell myself.

125
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
Ji Fanghai's wife

126
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,160
was good by nature.

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,920
Seeing me helpless,
she took me as an adopted son.

128
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,640
But the good times didn't last forever.

129
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,720
My adoptive mother
soon became terminally ill.

130
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,240
Ji Fanghai took my adoptive mother
as a burden.

131
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,480
After my adoptive mother
had her last breath,

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
she was about to be buried.

133
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,840
Ji Fanghai discovered

134
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
she still had a breath.

135
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,680
He...

136
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,380
[Funeral]

137
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,280
He was unwilling to take care of her

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,760
and strangled her to death.

139
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,400
She was strangled to death!

140
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,520
Ji Fanghai is a hypocrite.
He deserved it.

141
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,280
He shouldn't be respected.

142
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Did you change my story book?

143
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
You've written so many story books.

144
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
People say that good and evil
will have their outcomes.

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
But I have waited so long,

146
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,280
and it never comes.

147
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,940
But killing someone
in imitation of your story books

148
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,200
is a good way to confuse the public.

149
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,540
I wrote the story books

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,060
to tell people to believe in justice.

151
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
If you don't believe it, it's fine.

152
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
But why did you set me up?

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
Ms. Lu.

154
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,640
In fact, there is no difference
between you and me.

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,560
The only difference is

156
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,840
that I kill with a knife,

157
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,820
and you kill with a pen.

158
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,280
Don't talk nonsense.

159
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,260
Plead your guilty now.

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,720
You killed Ji Fanghai
to avenge your adoptive mother.

161
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,000
Then why did you kill Bao Sheng?

162
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,920
He said he saw me kill Ji Fanghai

163
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,720
and asked me
to hand over the estate of Virtue Hall.

164
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,000
I was so angry

165
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,040
and I killed him.

166
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,400
Then why did you stuff him in a coffin
and suffocate him to death?

167
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,740
That's cruel.

168
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,080
I just...

169
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,600
I just stabbed him with a knife.

170
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,360
I didn't stuff him into a coffin.

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,720
The evidence is overwhelming.

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,880
Just admit it.

173
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,200
Forget it.

174
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,360
You don't believe me, anyway.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,820
I am glad to know

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
that Bao Sheng

177
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,280
was tortured to death.

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,920
I will take my responsibility.

Can the case be closed?

184
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,800
Put him in jail first.

185
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,000
Interrogate him another day.

186
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,760
Yes.

192
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,860
[Confession]
This is Ji Xinshi's confession.

193
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,940
Since the people heard
that the real murderer was arrested,

194
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,320
they've been relieved.

195
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,880
I'll put up a notice as you say.

196
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,480
Disclose the facts of the two murders

197
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,400
to calm the people down.

198
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes.

199
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,020
[Confession]

200
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,640
Ji Xinshi said

201
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
he didn't stuff Bao Sheng in the coffin.

202
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,000
If it's true,
then who would have done it?

203
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,560
My Lord.

204
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,960
My Lord.

205
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,800
No good.

206
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
Ji Xinshi

207
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
committed suicide.

208
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
What?

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,320
As soon as he was in prison,

210
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,600
he hit the wall and died.

211
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,360
We haven't finished the trial yet,

212
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,960
but he committed suicide.

213
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
Could it be

214
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,160
he wanted to cover up

215
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,640
for somebody?

216
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
Just in court,

217
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,800
I thought it was doubtful.

218
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,960
It looks like

219
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,080
Ji Xinshi

220
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,400
had another helper.

221
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,680
It seems

222
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,400
the murderers who imitate the story book

223
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,120
are more than one.

224
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
This is the medicine
I specially prepared.

225
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,800
It can ease your pain.

226
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,440
Thanks.

227
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,000
Since

228
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,400
I've cleared myself of suspicion,

229
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,000
there's no need for me to stay here.

230
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
From now on,

231
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,880
let's part ways.

232
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,960
We don't owe each other.

233
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,040
You left without saying goodbye
more than a year ago.

234
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,720
You haven't given me an explanation.

235
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,040
Explanation?

236
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,800
You broke your promise

237
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,080
by sending me a farewell letter.

238
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,160
You wanted to be with Wen Ruoxi.

239
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,440
How do you explain that?

240
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
I was the one who received
a farewell letter.

241
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,880
You make it wrong.

242
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,560
I didn't.

243
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,520
Lu.

244
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,600

245
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
I have to pick up Lu.

246
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,000
You hurt Lu so much.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,040
Don't pester her anymore.

248
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
She has her own choice.

249
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,560
Let's go.

250

251

Lu.

252
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,680
Let's go home.

253
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,600
Yes.

254
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
The case is closed.

255
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,000
Why do you still look upset?

256
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
He was my childhood sweetheart
for more than ten years.

257
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,960
But we have no good ending.

258
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,000
Isn't it worth a sigh?

259
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,360
Forget the ungrateful man.

260
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,560
He's not worth your sorrow.

261
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,000
Why don't you

262
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,560
think about

263
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,400
the future for us?

264
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,520
The future for us?

265
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Yeah, in the future,

266
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,560
if you want to write any story book,

267
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,640
this story would be a great one.

268
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,320
I used to write them

269
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
as a means of earning a living.

270
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
I didn't expect

271
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,180
it can be used as a tool to kill.

272
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,480
As the saying goes,

273
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,760
Writings are for conveying truth.

274
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
Maybe there is no point

275
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,200
for me to write the story.

276
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,080
Once people have an obsession,
they will sink deeper and deeper.

277
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,320
The reason Ji Xinshi killed people

278
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,680
was not because of your story books,

279
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,840
but because he has too much hatred.

280
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,960
I figured it out.

281
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,680
From now on,

282
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,960
I'll never write
those murder stories again.

283
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,840
All right.

284
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,040

287
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,040

292
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,520
We're still the best partners.

293
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,280
For Mr. Sun's Wedding day,

382
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
I'm on the spot.

383
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,780
His wife turned into a carp fairy.

384
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,040
Her tail was golden.

385
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,000
It's true.

386
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,560
At that time, many people saw it.

387
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,340
Right?

388
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,400
- It's my turn.
- It's my turn.

389
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,180
Come on.

390
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,780
Thanks.

391
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,200
Please let me.

392
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Let me.

393
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,100
Wait a minute.

394
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,080
Don't worry.

395
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,940
I'll go first.

396
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,920
Wait a minute.

397
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,800
Do you know

398
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,200
why the bride could become immortal?

399
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,440
Why?

400
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,800
That's because

401
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,040
she took

402
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,560
the immortal pill

403
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,280
that I made.

404
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,120
For the pill,

405
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,960
it just needs

406
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,360
two liang of broken silver.

407
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,080
You can take it for two months.

408
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,240
Thank you.

409
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,680
Give him the money.

410
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,840
Here.

411
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,200
It's real.

412
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,840
It's real.

413
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,560
Next one.

414
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,340
Me.

415
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,240
This one.

416
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,280
Listen to me.

417
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,200
What they say

418
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,320
is not true.

419
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,400
There's no such thing

420
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,840
as a living person becoming immortal.

421
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,520
The bride was missing.

422
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,760
Maybe

423
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,640
she was dead.

424
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,080
What you said

425
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,760
is a good subject for a murder story.

426
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,960
But

427
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,480
I don't write
that kind of story book anymore.

428
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,400
What?

429
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,140
Why don't you write?

430
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,240
I thought

431
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,560
you only wrote this kind of story book.

432
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,640
For those stories,

433
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,060
they all came true.

434
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,900
Go off.

435
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,260
You really are

436
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,680
an evil person.

437
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,840
Why don't you get out of Jinzhou?

438

Go home.

439
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,420
- Go away.
- Today,

440
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,260
I will eliminate the evil for the people

441

of Jinzhou.

442
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,360
- Awesome.
- Bravo.

443

Bravo.

444

447

Bravo.

448
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,320
Thank you all for your support.

449
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,120
If you don't have anything else to do,

450
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,280
you can dismiss.

451
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,320
Ms. Gong.

452
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,040
I thought you always hated me.

453
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,600
Today,

454
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
why did you stand up for me?

455
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,600
I've always hated you.

456
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,920
But I didn't expect you to be so brave
to save Mr. Yu that day.

457
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,640
For that,

458
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,280
it surprised me.

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,480
If you are all right, I will go first.

460
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,200
Ms. Gong.

461
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,800
The peach blossom brew
in Lu's Book Club is great.

462
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,200
Would you like to have a taste?

464
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,440
Fine.

Lord Lin.

467
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Such a rare guest.

468
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,960
Where's Ms. Lu?

469
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,360
Lord Lin.

470
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,440
If you are here to drink
and watch a play,

471
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,560
then go ahead.

472
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,960
But if you want to cause Lu trouble,

473
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,880
please go away.

474

Of course,

I am here to drink and watch a play.

00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,520
I am wondering

477
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,400
if Mr. Fu could drink with me?

478
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
Mr. Fu, are you good

479
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,040
at drinking?

480
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,920
Just so-so.

How dare you seduce my wife?

Hey.

at playing the finger-guessing game.

I'll see you off.

495

I was playful when I was young.

496
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,840
I ran up the hill and got hurt.

497
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
There I met Lu.

498
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,800
She carried me back.

And since then we've been playmates.

500

But due to family status,

501
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
I could only sneak out to play with her.

he is the son of a noble family.

506

I thought

507
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,960
we could go on like that.

508
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,840
But when he was 20 years old,

509
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,640
his mother made him an engagement.

510
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,020
Do you mean

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,400
won't see you.

572
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,600
Then I got a serious illness

573
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,040
and missed the Imperial Examination.

574
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,840
Then

575
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,960
I heard Ms. Lu's story books.

576
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,680
I guessed it might be her.

577
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,240
So

578
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,760
I asked the emperor
to give me an official position.

579
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,480
Then I am here in Jinzhou.

580
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,840
But it feels like

581
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,960
there is some misunderstanding
between you.

582
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,680
If only it were really
a misunderstanding.

583
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,160
It makes me sad.

584
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,400
Forget it.

585
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,960
Come on.

586
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,280
Let's drink.

587
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,760
Let's get drunk tonight.

588
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,640
Tonight,

589
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm going to soar into the sky.

590
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,360
This sound

591
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,280
is so familiar.

592
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,280
Go check it out.

593
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,040
Yes.

594
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,120
What's she doing up there?

595
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,800
What's going on?

596
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,700
[Lu's Book Club]

597
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
It's too dangerous.

598
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,840
You're drunk.

599
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
You can't fly.

600
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,840
I'm not drunk.

601
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,280
You're drunk.

602
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,760
That's dangerous.

603
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,400
It's too dangerous.

604
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,560
Don't you believe it?

605
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,400
I'll show you.

606
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,880
Lu.

607
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,560
That's close.

608
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,840
