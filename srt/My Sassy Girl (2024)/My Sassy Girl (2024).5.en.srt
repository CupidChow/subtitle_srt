Obviously, it hasn't had enough time.

I thought you didn't drink that day.

194
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,040
Since I came here to investigate,

195
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,600
I have to prepare for it.

196
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,200
Sun's well-known Ice Spring Wines

197
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,680
are all stored here.

198
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,480
By convention,

199
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,560
the wine jars are sealed

200
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,160
every summer solstice.

201
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,600
No one is allowed to enter here.

202
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,280
You cannot open the wine

203
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,040
until the first month of the lunar year.

204
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,560
That is to say

that the one with Jiang Mengyu inside

206
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,560
has not lasted for enough time.

207
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,880
It was brought here
after the wine was sealed.

208
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,480
Yes.

209
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,840
The suspect was able
to enter and exit the ice cellar.

210
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Presumably,

211
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,960
the suspect should be someone
in the Sun Residence.

212
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,920
Right.

213
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,880
It seems

214
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
there is someone who doesn't want us
to find out the truth.

we're going to die here?

What Dongling Stone?

This kind of stone

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
can also spark.

the body has been kept

the reason why the fish

on the 16th day of the eighth month,

add yeast on the 13th or 14th day.

the winemaker did not notice
anything unusual then.

Jiang Mengyu must have been killed
on the wedding night.

If we shorten the period,

00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,880
it should be the four hours
