[Episode 21]

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,240
But

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,120
you were late

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
when the tomb was robbed.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,440
And how did you find the tomb robber

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,880
who had escaped?

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,960
When a man gets stolen goods,

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,680
he has to sell them.

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,760
Not long after Xia's death,

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,120
there was an emerald phoenix bracelet

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,520
in the capital.

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,740
It was the dowry

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,840
she wore on her wedding day.

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,080
So,

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,960
as a buyer,

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,620
I found one of the tomb robbers,

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,900
Shi Kaiyang, who made his living
in the capital making coffins.

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
Ten years.

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,680
I've been waiting for ten years.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,600
Finally, the funerary objects appeared.

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,320
Bao Sheng

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,380
was broke.

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,960
He had to pawn
the stolen funerary objects.

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,920
That was my opportunity.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,300
Could I not seize it?

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,880
Tracks and smells are all gone here.

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,600
Nanyi must be nearby.

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,640

Are you okay?

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,560
Mr. Yu.

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,160
It's you.

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,720
Mr. Lin, I thought you're perspective.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,520
It turns out you're no better than that.

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
I've been by your side for so long

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,820
and you haven't even noticed.

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,700
I thought you were a kind physician,

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,080
but I didn't expect you
to be so vicious.

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,040
Mr. Yu,

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
you and Ji Xia

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,720
were connected by medicine.

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,280
What she loved was
your generosity and kindness.

54
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,600
What you've done

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
is a disgrace to your medical skills.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,040
How can you face Ji Xia?

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,000
A kind physician.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,360
A vicious killer.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,920
So Ji Xia should be smothered to death

60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,280
in a coffin?

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,760
You have to pay for what you've done.

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,640
I just did what I had to do.

63
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,440
There is nothing wrong with it.

64
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,840
Why am I afraid to face it?

65
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
You should go.

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,640

They embraced each other

81

with this sword to rescue you two,

92
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,640

Your name is really hard to write.

to fix this place up

120
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,280
for over a year.

121
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,720
Then why don't you

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,280
do it yourself?

123
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,240
This year,

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,320
I've been looking for you all the time.

125

Well.

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,240

But the cause

was only from love.

136
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,520
Love causes sorrow.

137
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,280
And love causes hatred.

So

155
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,120
what if I hadn't gone to Jinzhou?

156
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,200
Instead, I had gone to a place

378
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,080
I...

379
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,080
think

380
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,000
it's more imposing to come like this.

381
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,360
How are you?

382
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,720
Don't worry.

383
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,040
I'm all good.

384
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,400
When the real killer is caught,

385
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,760
I'll be able to get out of here.

386
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,040
Are you really okay?

387
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,480
I heard you were sick.

388
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,880
Did Lin Qingqiu give you a hard time?

389
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,960
Tell me.

390
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,840
I'll kick his ass.

391
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,520
Wait.

392
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,040
Calm down.

393
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,800
Lin Qingqiu is not that kind of person.

394
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,400
You go home

395
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,560
and stay out of this,

396
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,400
you hear me?

397
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,240
I can't believe you're defending him.

398
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,560
You still like him, do you?

399
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm worried about the danger
of you getting involved.

400
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,640
Do you know how dangerous this case is?

401
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,640
Alright.

402
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,420
Go back.

403
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,000
It wouldn't be good to get caught.

404
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,440
Go.

405
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,440
Wait.

406
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,520
I don't like him.

407
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,560
Hey.

408
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,720
Sir.

409
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,640
Why did you come out

410
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,920
from this door?

411
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:23,940
[Mini Story of Gong Beiyin and Lei Yu]

412
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,640
Yin.

413
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,320
What are you doing?

414
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,920
You're just in time.

415
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,640
Sit down.

416
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,160
What's going on?

417
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,440
Don't move.

418
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,800
Yin.

419
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,000
What...

420
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,560
What are you doing?

421
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,280
There's a poor man

422
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,240
who died a horrible death
in the coffin home.

423
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
He's been alone all his life.

424
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,080
He should leave the world
with some dignity.

425
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,160
So

426
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,320
I'm working on

427
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,080
how to make him look good.

428
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,840
Oh.

429
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,800
I see.

430
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,200
You're practicing on me.

431
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,280
Don't move.

432
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,740
Dead people don't move.

433
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,680
Then

434
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,640
give me a pretty one.

435
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,720
I know.

436
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,460
Keep still.

437
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,240
Yin.

438
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,080
Do you know

439
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,880
there's a feeling

440
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,360
that's soft

441
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,680
and warm?

442
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,520
Yes.

443
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,760
You want to try it?

444
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,640
I...

445
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,000
It's...

446
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,320
It's...

447
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,280
It's...

448
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,920
It's too fast.

449
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,640
Well.

450
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,600
It's nothing.

451
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,640
Here.

452
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,640
Give me your hand.

453
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,160
My hand?

454
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,600
Yes.

455
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,640
Close your eyes.

456
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,200
I'm ready then.

457
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,960
How is it?

458
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,360
Is it

459
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
soft

460
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,440
and warm?

461
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,320
Ah.

462
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,700
What did you just pout for?

463
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,520
Isn't this right?

464
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
Uhh.

465
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,960
Ha ha.

466
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,760
It is soft

467
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,720
and warm.

468
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
