Hello.

196
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,280
Are you seeing a physician

197
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,440
or getting medicine?

198
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,300
We are...

[Jinzhou's Judicial Office]

200
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,720
From

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,520
Jinzhou's Judicial Office.

202
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,480
We are here

203
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,400
to bring justice for your Mr. Ji.

204
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,120
It's okay.

205
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,560
We're just here to ask a few questions.

206
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,600
Please, My Lord.

207
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
Mr. Ji

208
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
has been a physician for years.

209
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,400
Did he have any enemies?

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
My foster father was a good man.

211
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,160
He had never offended anyone,

212
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,320
let alone any enemies.

213
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,000
Foster father?

214
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,920
Yes.

215
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,120
I was deserted by my parents as a child.

216
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,600
My foster parents took me in,

217
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,360
raised me,

218
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,760
and taught me medicine.

219
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,760
How could someone do this cruel thing

220
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,200
to my good foster father?

221
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,440
Mr. Ji,

222
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,520

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,640
Here.

224

once helped these people.

to tribute to him.

232
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,000
I thought he was gone.

233
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,120
Why can this clinic

234
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,880
still receive patients?

235
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,280

Mr. Yu wants to stay here.

237
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,320
Are you talking

238
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
about Yu Huaigu, that Miracle Physician?

239
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,880
Yes.

240
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,640
It's him.

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,960

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He's there treating someone.

243
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,400
Let me pay a visit.

244
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
Hide somewhere.

245
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,160
Go.

246
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,080
Go inside.

It's obvious.

253
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,160

my appointment

270

Master,

282
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,400
you don't have to work hard for life.

283
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,600
So there won't be any callus

284
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,720
in your hand or foot.

285
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,920
There is one!

286
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,480
If you can't remove it,

287
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,360
that means you are not skillful.

Please, Mr. Yu.

289

294
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
Do it.

295
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,280
Hold on a second.

296
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,960
Okay.

297
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,240

Don't...

302
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,880
Don't move.

303
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,040
Yes...

304
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920

Mouse!

309
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,400
Are you okay?

310
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,420
I'm fine.

311
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,360
Mr. Yu.

312
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,040
Help...

313
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Patch me up.

314
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,880
It's bleeding.

315
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,320
This is the best trauma medicine
from Mr. Yu.

316
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,800
Remember to put it on regularly.

317
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,600
Okay.

318
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm OK, Lu.

319
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,440
Do keep an eye on Lin Qingqiu.

320
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,440
He

321
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,640
is a bad boy.

322
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,840
Mr. Fu.

323
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,000
Get some rest.

324
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,920
Don't move around

325
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,480
or talk too much.

326
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,520
Be careful.

327
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,580
Lu.

328
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,600
Why are you out by yourself?

329
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Do you know how worried I was?

330
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,600
Want some wontons?

331
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,200
My treat.

332
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,400
Sir.

333
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,440
Two bowls of wonton.

334
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,320
Large ones.

335
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,320
That's too much for me.

336
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
Get yourself full.

337
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,760
So you can solve the case.

338
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,520
You were out on the case by yourself.

339
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,440
Do you get any clues?

340
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,120
I haven't found anything
on the killer yet.

341
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,360
How about you?

342
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,080
Did you get anything?

343
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,520
The weapon.

344
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,160
The weapon used on Bao Sheng
is small and thin.

345
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,040
It doesn't look like a regular blade.

346
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,760
I think

347
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,080
it's for a special purpose.

348
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
Like butchers

349
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
use a scythe.

350
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,880
Headsmen

351
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,880
use a jackknife.

352
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,440
Once we know the weapon,

353
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,960
we can trace it down

354
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,560
and lock the murderer's identity.

355
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,840
Here's your wontons.

356
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,560
Anything else?

357
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,040
Tell me more.

358
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,640
No more for now.

359
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,760
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

360
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,280
What's on your mind?

361
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,520
I'd say

362
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,960
that stories come from life.

363
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,840
We only focused on his method,

364
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,880
but not his motive of killing.

365
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,360
Tell me about it.

366
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,920
If Mr. Ji didn't have any enemies,

367
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,880
why couldn't it be a family member?

368
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,760
Solving a case

369
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,240
is more about evidence.

370
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,320
It's not like writing a story book.

371
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,920
You can't rely on your imagination.

372
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,120
I wasn't just imagining things.

373
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,760
When I wrote story books,

374
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,120
I'd first design
killers' methods and motives.

375
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,040
Step by step.

376
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,560
Logically and rigorously.

377
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,160
Your stories are not real.

378
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,320
They can't be compared to reality.

379
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,280
Trust my instincts.

380
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
Ji Xinshi is the most likely suspect.

381
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
An adopted son
killed his adopted father.

382
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,760
I think you've gone too far.

383
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,240
You don't have a clue now anyway.

384
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,440
Is that the murder suspect,

385
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,560
Ms. Lu?

386
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,720
I thought she was in jail.

387
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,960
Why did they let her out?

388
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,120
You tell me.

389
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,600
Who knows...

Why do you put Ms. Lu's story books

To tell you the truth,

583
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,960
I was going to use it for firewood.

I'll take them all.

591
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,760
One day her books will be hot again,

592
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,520
and then the price will double.
