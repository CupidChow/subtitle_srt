380
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,160
is Bao Sheng's time of death determined?

381
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,120
My Lord,

382
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,040
the local coroner lacks skill

383
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
and has not determined
the exact time of death.

384
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,320
I will arrange for a skilled coroner
to come to Jinzhou.

385
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,040

386
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,960
Yes.

387
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,840
It seems I must
personally examine the bodies

388
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,240
if I want to clear
Lu Nanyi's name quickly.

389
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,560
Ji Fanghai, the physician of the clinic,

390
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
was strangled to death

391
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,440
on the night of the temple fair.

392
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
Bao Sheng, the owner of Tianyi Teahouse,

393
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,880
wounded in the chest,

394
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,680
was found dead in a coffin.

395
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,440
His tongue is not protruding.

396
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,160
This means he died before falling.

397
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,880
This

398
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,000
is what he died from.

399
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,280
The wound shapes are identical,

400
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,280
so they were probably
inflicted by the same weapon.

401
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,160
We can investigate
the two cases together.

402
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
The killer murdered Ji Fanghai

403
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
and then staged
the gruesome hanging scene.

404
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,840
As for Bao Sheng,

405
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,480
he wasn't stabbed to death.

406
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,120
He was placed in the coffin,

407
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,240
where he bled to death.

408
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,520
I suspect

409
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,920
Bao Sheng did not die at Zi hour.

410
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,480
The killer

411
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,240
likely acted

412
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,200
before Shen hour.

413
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,360
So

414
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
Lu Nanyi is really not the murderer.
