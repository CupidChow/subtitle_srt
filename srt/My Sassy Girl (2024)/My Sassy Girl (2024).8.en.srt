00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,160
I'll bring you home.

192
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,680
I never said I wanted
to go home with you.

193
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,160
Well, I don't have much to do lately.

194
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,080
A trip to the capital

195
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
might not be a bad idea.

196
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,360
Don't get the wrong idea.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,840
I'm not going there for you.

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,040
Well,

199
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,680
it's been a year since I left home.

200
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,040
I should go back and visit.

201
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Besides,

202
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,600
these cases are linked to my stories.

203
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,160
I do need closure.

204
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,440
Indeed.

205
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
Miss Lu

206
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,440
is a prominent storybook writer.

207
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,680
Her talent should be known

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,040
to the people of the capital.

209
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,400
Exactly.

210
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
With these cases unsolved,

211
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,960
I am willing

212
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,520
to accompany you to the capital

213
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
to uncover the truth

214
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,320
and bring justice to the deceased.

215
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,760
It's late and getting cold.

216
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,720
This will keep you warm.

217
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,360
Oh,

218
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
so you knew I would come.

219
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,080
Nanyi?

220
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,880
Nanyi?

221
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,800
Yes?

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,040
We've arrived in the capital.

223
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,880
Wake up.

224
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,480
Okay.

225
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,040
Just now, someone

226
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,320
was snoring

227
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,120
and drooling.

228
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,760
Now, they're feeling embarrassed?

229
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,880
As long as your engagement
with the Wen family isn't off,

230
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,880
you're still bound by it.

231
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,280
Nanyi,

232
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,960
I've sent

233
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
multiple letters to the Wen Residence
to break off the engagement,

234
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,440
but back then, I wasn't in the capital,

235
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,560
so I couldn't explain in person.

236
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,400
Once we arrive,

237
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,080
I'll go to the Wen Residence

238
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,800
and clear things up.

239
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,880
Tsk.

240
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,560
If you can't let go of Miss Wen,

241
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,720
there's no need to force yourself.

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,960
You're the only one I care about.

243
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,520
No one else

244
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,120
matters to me.

245
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,280
Come and take a look!

246
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,740
What's going on?

247
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,160
Yeah, why are there so many soldiers?

248
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,260
What happened?

249
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,160
Sir,

250
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,280
we've arrived in the capital.

251
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,160
Keep going ahead

252
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,120
to the Jingzhao Office.

253
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,880
Sir,

254
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,920
we might not be able to get through.

255
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,400
Prepare a stool.

256
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,760
Something big must have happened.

257
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,480
Keep it down.

258
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,760
This man must be very important.

259
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,880
Don't worry.

260
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,480
Greetings, Your Highness!

261
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,580
Is he the young Prince of Anding?

262
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,240
Mr. Lin is the young prince?

263
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,280
Who sent you here?

264
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,520
The Prince ordered us
to escort you back to the mansion.

265
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,720
Oh no,

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,520
I hope I haven't offended him before.

267
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Is it too late

268
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
to start flattering him now?

269
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,040
It's not too late
for you to run off now.

270
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,960
Is this my mother's idea?

271
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,680
We are just following orders.

272
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Your Highness, please return
to the mansion with us.

273
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,240
It's probably about the engagement
with the Wen family again.

274
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,080
Qingqiu,

275
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,880
I've been away
from the capital for months.

276
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,040
I'd like to go home first.

277
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,240
Sure.

278
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,800
Qingqiu,

279
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,840
oh no,

280
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,440
sir,

281
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,680
I...

282
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,680
want to go with Miss Yin.

283
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,600
Okay.

284
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,920
Where should we meet later?

285
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,040
The Jingzhao Office.

286
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,640
Understood.

287
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,560
Send word

288
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,440
that I'm on official duty

289
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,680
and that I will return after I catch

290
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,720
the real culprit.

291
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,000
Yuechu,

292
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,320
let's go.

293
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,040
Yes.

294
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,240
No wonder

295
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,520
his family

296
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,440
doesn't approve of him
being with Miss Lu.

297
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,400
He's a young prince!

298
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,720
Shut up.

299
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,940
[Jingzhao Office]

300
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Outrageous!

301
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,080
[Zhou Jinzhong, Jingzhao Office adviser]
How dare you, a mere prefect of Jinzhou,

302
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,680
not kneel

303
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
before the illustrious Vice Mr. Lu

304
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,480
of the Jingzhao Office?

305
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,600
Outrageous.

306
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,160
My young master
is the young Prince of Anding.

307
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,060
Why should he kneel
before a mere vice minister?

308
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,860
[Lu Bai,
Vice Minister of Jingzhao Office]

309
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,560
Lin Qingqiu,

310
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,840
you've got quite the attitude.

311
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,840
Naturally, it's nothing
compared to your grandiosity, Mr. Lu.

312
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,640
Why is this vice minister

313
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,560
giving you a hard time?

314
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,120
Do you two have a history?

315
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,240
Someone knows full well
that his talents are outshined.

316
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,920
Back then, no matter how hard he tried,
he couldn't outdo my master in exams.

317
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,480
He only became the top scholar
thanks to luck.

318
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,240
Now, he relies on his official position

319
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,760
to intimidate others.

320
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,720
I wonder

321
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,840
why the prefect of Jinzhou,
appointed through favoritism,

322
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,440
has come here

323
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,960
to the Jingzhao Office.

324
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,120
There has been a series
of murders in Jinzhou.

325
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,520
I need to check the household records
in the Jingzhao Office.

326
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,200
That's ridiculous.

327
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,880
The records kept in the archive
of the Jingzhao Office

328
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,400
aren't something
you can just access at will.

329
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,480
Even if you're a young prince,

330
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,560
you need proper authorization.

331
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,160
I've heard that you feigned illness

332
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,880
for a woman

333
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,160
and even missed
the Imperial Examination.

334
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
Now, even when investigating cases,

335
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,960
you bring a woman with you.

336
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,920
Lin Qingqiu,

337
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,560
I'm truly disappointed in you.

338
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,440
That's my private affair.

339
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,800
It's none of your concern.

340
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Instead of listening to gossip,

341
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,920
why don't you focus

342
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,080
on improving the security of the capital

343
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,760

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,640

345
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,040
Don't be too smug.

346
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,800
I've been studying
Mr. Lu's storybooks recently

347
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,280
and learning a lot.

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,920
My investigative skills today

349
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,040
may not be any worse than yours.

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,800
Alright.

351
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,520
I heard you banned his storybooks.

352
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
You really have no discernment.
