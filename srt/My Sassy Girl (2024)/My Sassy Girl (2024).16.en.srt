00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,440
You collude with tomb robbers

195
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,880
to steal burial goods

196
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,200
and try to sell them
on the so-called Ghost Market.

197
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
Am I right?

198
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,440
Young man,

199
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,320
that's something

200
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,720
even that

201
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,240
muddle-headed imperial official knows.

202
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,400
You didn't come here

203
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,880
to tell me this, did you?

204
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
Of course not.

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm here to ask you about two people.

206
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,160
Who?

207
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,600
Sun Qinjiu

208
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,080
and Bao Sheng.

209
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,160
Another new story?

210
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,260
They both hailed from Wuyi Town

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,080
and later moved to Jinzhou,
where they were murdered.

212
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,840
The killer is still at large.

213
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,840
You are from the same hometown.

214
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,200
Aren't you curious

215
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,720
who the killer is?

216
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,240
I never thought

217
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,360
the two of them

218
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,720
would die from murder.

219
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,240
You knew them?

220
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,800
I knew them well.

221
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,880
They were old friends of mine.

222
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,280
I never expected

223
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
they'd die before me.

224
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,320
Life is full of surprises.

225
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,880
What else do you know?

226
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,240
They were indeed from Wuyi Town,

227
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,680
and they had two sworn brothers.

228
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,960
The four of them robbed tombs together.

229
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,560
They were skilled in their trade

230
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,520
and formed their own faction.

231
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,960
About ten years ago,

232
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,240
one of them died,

233
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
and the remaining three

234
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,440
vanished from the world.

235
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,360
I've never heard from them since.

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Who are the other two?

237
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,360
Young man,

238
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,360
if you want to know,

239
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
find a way

240
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,040
to get me out of here!

241
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,960
Sir.

242
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,600
What?

243
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,680
It's not a holiday today.

244
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,280
Why are you setting off firecrackers?

245
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,760
Because there's something to celebrate.

246
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,920
Sir,

247
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,760
are you getting promoted?

248
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,640
I just feel deeply happy.

249
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm celebrating in advance

250
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,520
that Miss Wen
is breaking off her engagement

251
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,840
to that imbecile Lin.

252
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,080
I see.

253
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,440
But

254
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,920
what does that have to do with you?

255
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,060
You don't get it,

256
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,800
Zhou.

257
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,560
I think I'm in love.

258
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,240
I never knew

259
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,560
you were such a romantic.

260
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,280
Love

261
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,280
truly brings both joy and worry.

262
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,280
Right.

263
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,680
By the way, Zhou.

264
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,240
Yes?

265
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,040
When do you think

266
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,160
I should propose?

267
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,000
You haven't known each other
long enough.

268
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,840
That's where you're wrong.

269
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,480
How can you be so old-fashioned?

270
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,640
I'm old-fashioned?

271
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
Back in the day,

272
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,440
I was

273
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,360
quite the heartthrob!

274
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,340
[Lu's Book Club]

275
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,280
Move that banner

276
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,760
a bit

277
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,640
to the left.

278
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,360
- To the left.
- Okay.

279
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,360
That's right.

280
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,280
- Straighten it up a bit.
- Got it.

281
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,720
Move the flowers

282
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,800
to the right.

283
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,120
Sure.

284
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,200
Good.

285
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,560
Move that chair a bit inward.

286
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,280
Hey,

287
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,360
Nanyi.

288
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,800
You're here.

289
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Thanks for helping us
in Wuyi Town the other day.

290
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,640
By the way,

291
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
how did you know I wanted
to open a branch in the capital?

292
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
Because we've got a connection.

293
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,320
Our business is sure

294
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,320
to thrive here.

295
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,520
You want to be the top storyteller,

296
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
and I aspire to be
the richest man in Daling.

297
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,400
Though our dreams haven't come true yet,

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,600
we must

299
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
keep the business going.

300
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
It smells amazing!

301
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,160
Ms. Liu,

302
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,120
what are you making?

303
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm making cakes.

304
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,280
Ms. Liu,

305
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,240
your bracelet is beautiful.

306
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,360
Where did you get it?

307
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,560
This?

308
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,680
Every woman from the Feng ethnic group
wears one.

309
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,400
It's not for sale.

310
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,640
Only women wear it?

311
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,680
Yes.

312
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,280
My hometown

313
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,360
abounds with water chestnuts.

314
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,920
We all wear them as good luck charms.

315
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,760
I just made some water chestnut cakes,

316
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,720
a specialty of my hometown.

317
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,960
Try some, Miss Lu.

318
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,440
Okay.

319
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,240
How is it?

320
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,600
It's delicious!

321
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,000
Have some more.

322
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,560
Okay!

323
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,360
Nanyi.

324
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,240
Try these.

325
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,720
What is it?

326
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,920
Water chestnut cake.

327
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,640
How's the investigation going?

328
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,640
I interrogated Yan Canghai and found out

329
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,800
that Bao Sheng and Sun Qinjiu

330
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,280
were indeed from Wuyi Town.

331
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,160
They also had two sworn brothers.

332
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,400
The four of them robbed tombs together
and formed their own faction.

333
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,640
Ten years ago,

334
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,480
one of them was killed,

335
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,520
and the remaining three

336
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,520
vanished

337
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560
without a trace.

338
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,400
I just

339
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,440
looked through Wuyi Town's case records

340
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,840
and found a victim

341
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,160
named Shi Kaiyang

342
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
who was murdered ten years ago

343
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,240
in an unsolved case.

344
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,120
Shi Kaiyang

345
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,520
was one of the four brothers.

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,160
So

347
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,860
aside from the deceased Shi Kaiyang,

348
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,300
Bao Sheng, and Sun Qinjiu,

349
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,680
one of the brothers
should still be alive.

350
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,920
Yes.

351
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,400
So

352
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,640
the killer disappeared

353
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,680
after killing Shi Kaiyang,

354
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,640
only to resurface in Jinzhou
ten years later to kill again?

355
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,320
Yes.

356
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,600
There must've been

357
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,520
a blood feud between the killer
and the four brothers,

358
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,840
or he wouldn't have killed
three of them over the decade.

359
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,320
If we can find

360
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,600
the group's last survivor

361
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,640
and let him tell us who their enemy is,

362
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,000
we will be able to find the killer.

363
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,800
What are we waiting for then?

364
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,280
Let's go ask Yan Canghai

365
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,880
about this man now.

366
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,240
I tried.

367
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,520
He won't tell me

368
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,320
unless

369
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,080
I release him from prison,

370
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,760
so

371
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,160
I'm at a loss.

372
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,400
I know how

373
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,560
to make him talk.

374
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,600
Miss Lu,

375
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,680
are you here to tell me a story?

376
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,680
I have no story for you.

377
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,840
Are you here to set me free, then?

378
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,400
You wish.

379
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Stop sitting over there.

380
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,640
Come here and eat.

381
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,440
How's the food?

382
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,320
This is a water chestnut cake,
a specialty of the Feng ethnic group.

383
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,480
I haven't had one

384
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,560
since my wife passed away.

385
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
Young lady,

386
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,960
how did you know I liked this?

387
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,160
I noticed your water chestnut pendant,

388
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,960
which isn't typically worn by men.

389
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,440
I asked around

390
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,400
and found that it was an ornament
unique to the Feng women,

391
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,920
so I assumed
it belonged to your late wife.

392
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,080
I also found out

393
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,600
that every Feng woman knew
how to make water chestnut cakes,

394
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
so I managed to bring you some.

395
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,040
If you have any dying wishes,

396
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,880
you can tell me.

397
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
I will help you achieve them.

398
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,760
What's the catch?

399
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,840
There's no catch.

400
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,280
I can see that you are a devoted man,

401
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,680
so I'm willing to help you.

402
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,720
