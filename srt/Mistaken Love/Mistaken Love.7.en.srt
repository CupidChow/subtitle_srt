[Episode 7]

3
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,150
What you can't give her,

4
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,710
I can give.

5
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,440
No!

6
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,230
Mo Heng!

7
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,590
Heng!

8
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,270
Heng!

9
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,640
Heng!

10
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,100
Heng!

11
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,789
Mo Heng!

12
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,530
Nine.

13
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,590
Nine.

14
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,700
Let go of me!

15
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,240
It's you again.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,380
It wasn't me.

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,140
Why did you do this?

18
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,070
It wasn't me.

19
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,070
Why do you have to harm

20
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,550
every one of my loved ones?

21
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,070
I didn't do it.

22
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,150
Do you hate me that much?

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,830
Nine, I didn't...

24
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,830
Stay away from me!

25
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,259
I don't want to see you ever again.

26
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,870
Why is it not you who died?

27
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,110
Nine, I didn't...

28
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,360
Heng.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,750
Heng.

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,940
Heng.

31
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,510
Your Highness.

32
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,930
The river currents are strong in winter,

33
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,360
making recovery operations extremely difficult.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,290
So, we haven't been able to find the Crown Prince yet.

35
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,390
Keep looking for him.

36
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:32,110
Should we recall the guards who are investigating
the remnants of the assassins?

37
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,310
No need.

38
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,500
Don't let any clues slide.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,170
Yes.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,450
Crown Princess.

41
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,890
Is there any news of Heng?

42
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,579
It's been ten days already.

43
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,770
I'm afraid the chances are slim.

44
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,050
No, he'll be alright.

45
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,630
Have you found your Big Brother?

46
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,490
We should have news within the next couple of days.

47
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,290
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,180
Your Highness,

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,940
we've found the Crown Prince.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,060
the Crown Prince's body was being submerged and carried by the river;

52
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,290
it's no longer identifiable.

53
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,750
The guards were only able to identify him

54
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,280
by the jade pendant he wore.

55
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,060
Kneel down.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,030
Let my son Heng rest in peace.

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,060
Arrange the funeral for the Crown Prince

58
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,270
according to Qingshuo law.

59
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,840
According to Qingshuo law,

60
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,720
the Crown Princess must...

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,960
be buried with the Crown Prince.

62
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,130
Heng is dead.

63
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,769
Why hasn't Father punished Mo Jin yet?

[Memorial Tablet of Crown Prince Mo Heng of Qingshuo]

65
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,260
Could it be that no one dares to expose his crimes?

66
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,320
Heng.

67
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,730
I can't leave the Eastern Palace,

68
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,130
so I can't seek justice for you.

69
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,590
His Majesty's imperial decree has arrived.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,610
In the 15th year of Qingshuo,

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,990
Crown Prince Mo Heng has passed away.

72
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,110
Crown Princess Li Conghuan will keep vigil for him.

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,830
According to the law, she must be buried with him immediately.

74
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,210
Crown Princess,

75
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,970
choose one... and do it.

76
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,680
I am the princess of Zizhou.

77
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,010
Zizhou has no such law.

78
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,670
This is not up to you.

79
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,540
Your Highness, His Majesty has issued an order

80
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,340
that the Crown Princess must not leave here alive.

81
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,310
You've schemed your way into becoming Crown Princess.

82
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,830
But before you could even enjoy the wealth and glory,

83
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,030
you're about to

84
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,880
join my dear brother in the afterlife.

85
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,310
It was you.

86
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,520
You killed Heng.

87
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,960
Quick, do it!

88
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,920
This woman has brought chaos into the palace.

89
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,310
She must not be left alive!

90
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,350
But His Highness, he...

91
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,110
We...

92
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,930
we don't dare.

93
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,900
She hasn't been officially recorded in the royal genealogy yet.

94
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,280
Therefore, she can't be considered the true Crown Princess.

95
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,130
She can't be buried with the Crown Prince.

96
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,550
His Majesty has already issued a death order.

97
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,750
Your Highness, do you intend to defy the imperial decree?

98
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,540
Then don't blame me

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
for sending her to her death myself!

100
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,950
How many more people do you need to kill before you're satisfied?

101
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,730
As long as I can get what I want,

102
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,770
what does it matter?

103
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,220
Indeed.

104
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,830
Heng is dead.

105
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,050
You can now have everything that was his.

106
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,850
That's right.

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,340
I will inherit everything that belonged to my brother,

108
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,420
including you.

109
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,540
Li Conghuan can't be buried with the Crown Prince

110
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,300
because...

111
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,030
I'm going to marry her.

112
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,540
Your Highness, His Majesty has decreed

113
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,720
that this woman cannot be left alive.

114
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,520
Your Highness,

115
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,380
please don't be bewitched by her.

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,680
Who else wants to die?

117
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,050
You're delusional!

118
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,070
I'd rather die than marry you.

119
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,030
Didn't you want wealth and glory?

120
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,040
Now that my Big Brother is dead,

121
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,070
I'm the only one who can give you that.

122
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,000
The only thing I want is your death.

123
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,810
Why weren't you the one

124
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,140
who fell from the city wall that day?

125
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:06,900
Why?

126
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,720
Li Conghuan.

127
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,310
In your heart,

128
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,020
am I worse than a dead man?

129
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,340
Heng is still alive in my heart,

130
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,320
while you've been dead to me for a long time.

131
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,400
Such a sharp tongue you have.

132
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,840
I'll have to teach you some manners before taking you back to my palace.

133
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,720
Let go of me!

134
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,750
Let go of me!

135
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,840
Nine.

136
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,410
I told you our fates are forever intertwined.

137
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,230
You can't escape.

138
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,230
Why did he go to such lengths to bring me back

139
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,360
and confine me here?

140
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,520
Could it be that he's afraid I'll go to Father

141
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,760
and report that he killed Mo Heng?

142
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,600
Greetings, Crown Princess.

143
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,380
His Majesty has summoned you.

144
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,310
Please, Crown Princess, come with me.

145
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,810
Father has summoned me?

146
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,710
Could it be that he wants to investigate Heng's death?

147
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,850
Eunuch,

148
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,630
this doesn't seem like the way to the palace.

149
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,020
Who are you?

150
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,770
What are you doing?

151
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,190
As you're about to become the Second Princess,

152
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,920
we must confirm your chastity.

153
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,160
You're going to use private punishment on me again, right?

154
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,390
I will now examine...

155
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,020
Don't touch me!

156
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,820
If you had any children before coming to Qingshuo.

157
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,380
You old hags,

158
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,960
always fixating on

159
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,190
nothing but women's private matters.

160
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,020
Why should women have to prove their purity,

161
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,480
while men can be fickle

162
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,030
and still be praised as charming and dashing?

163
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,300
As servants, we have no right

164
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,550
to interfere in men's affairs.

165
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,540
But today,

166
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
you must undress!

167
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,020
You want me to take off my clothes, right?

168
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,830
Fine.

169
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,650
Quick, after her!

170
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,470
You can't run away today.

171
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,990
What a cunning seductress you are.

172
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,350
It seems I'll need to resort to torture

173
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,870
to make you submit.

174
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,070
Li Conghuan,

175
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,490
do you know your crime?

176
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,160
I don't know what crime I have committed.

177
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,510
You've bewitched the princes

178
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,320
and thrown the imperial harem into chaos.

179
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm from the Second Prince's palace.

180
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,120
Empress Dowager, you've arbitrarily punished me today.

181
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,180
Are you not afraid that the Second Prince will find out?

182
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,460
Hurry.

183
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,230
Hurry.

184
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,380
Hurry and summon the Chief Imperial Physician.

185
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,260
No need.

186
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,190
Empress Dowager, why are you

187
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,260
punishing her this time?

188
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,610
Since I want to punish her,

189
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,860
I have my reasons.

190
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,960
Li Conghuan is the princess sent by Zizhou for the marriage alliance,

191
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,200
yet she had an affair with a man before even entering the palace

192
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,610
and gave birth to a bastard.

193
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,960
Such disrespect toward His Majesty

194
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,270
and disgrace to the royal family's honor.

195
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,600
How can I not punish her?

196
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,320
The one who could casually be intimate with you outside the palace

197
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,710
must surely be a filthy,

198
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,670
lecherous, and lustful rogue.

199
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,510
Li Conghuan, will you confess yourself,

200
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,840
or shall I speak for you?

201
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,480
Speaking of rogues...

202
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,860
I do remember one man.

203
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,660
That man once said he'd give up his glory and wealth to be with me

204
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,830
and promised me we'd be together forever.

205
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,030
Back then, I was naive enough to believe him.

206
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,320
Only later did I find out

207
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,710
he was just...

208
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,640
Conghuan has always loved to joke.

209
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,350
How can we take jokes seriously?

210
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,960
Empress Dowager, do you have any evidence

211
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,250
for what you just said?

212
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,330
Why are you defending this woman so much?

213
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,900
Of course, I have evidence.

214
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,850
I came here today

215
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,320
specifically to verify her chastity.

216
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,980
Princess, please remove your clothes

217
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,640
and stand over the fire basin.

218
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,160
I can tell whether you've given birth

219
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,090
whether you've given birth or not.

220
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,900
Li Conghuan is my Princess after all.

221
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,940
I'm afraid this may not be appropriate.

222
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,190
But we cannot allow the royal family's reputation to be tarnished...

223
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,060
This matter must be investigated thoroughly.

224
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,240
You...

225
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,960
She is my woman.

226
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,530
I must examine her myself.

227
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,810
Brother Jin!

228
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,870
-Empress Dowager.
-Brother Jin!

229
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,870
Empress Dowager.

230
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,580
Do you still remember that rogue

231
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,710
outside the palace?

232
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,420
Zizhou's customs are more liberal,

233
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,630
unlike Qingshuo with its strict rules.

234
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,190
I don't know

235
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,130
which rogue you're referring to.

236
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,900
How about now?

237
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,400
Do you remember now, Nine?

238
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,110
You still like him,

239
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,550
don't you?

240
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,830
Speaking of him,

241
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,550
he does bear some resemblance to you.

242
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,340
But you need to let me take a closer look at you.
