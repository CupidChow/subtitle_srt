00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,830
[Mistaken Love]

2
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,550
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,330
We just escaped from the palace.

4
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,860
Let's take shelter at my friend's inn for now.

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,720
Thank you for helping me escape.

6
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,700
So,

7
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,550
you really killed Mo Jin with that poisoned dart?

8
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,010
He killed my mother with that poisoned dart.

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,850
I merely returned what was his.

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,420
Ninth Princess,

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,160
we'd better hurry on our way

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,050
in case the pursuers catch up with us.

13
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,850
No.

14
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,700
All previous assassination attempts failed.

15
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,050
This time, I must see Qingshuo draped in mourning with my own eyes.

16
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,710
I must see him die with my own eyes before I leave.

17
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,530
Then, let's stay here for now.

18
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,250
Tomorrow,

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,650
I'll find a chance to go back to Qingshuo for information.

20
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,950
I didn't expect everything to go so smoothly tonight.

21
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,410
Even the deities can't save Mo Jin this time.

22
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,970
Yes.

23
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,130
This time, if it weren't for that poisoned dart,

24
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,650
I wouldn't have been able to kill him either.

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,450
I had wondered why we couldn't

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,340
find that poisoned dart for so long.

27
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,250
It turns out that it was stolen by the assassins
and given to Mo Jin.

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,450
That poisoned dart has a unique design.

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,870
It must be those assassins who feared
leaving behind evidence.

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,210
Then, this must be God's will.

31
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,930
The timing was perfect;

32
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,100
tonight of all nights, you found Mo Jin's poisoned dart.

33
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,160
He deserved to die.

34
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,090
The timing was perfect...

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,620
Forgive me.

36
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,380
I have offended you, Princess.

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,660
But what if it isn't God's will?

38
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,700
What do you mean?

39
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,880
I've never seen that young eunuch

40
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,030
in the palace before.

41
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,990
Why did the poisoned dart appear

42
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,550
when he appeared?

43
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,590
And why did that poisoned dart

44
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,650
happen to appear right in front of me?

45
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,620
Mo Jin is not one to be so careless with his possessions.

46
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,280
If someone had planned it on purpose,

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
then his purpose would have been...

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,090
To use you

49
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,910
to get rid of Mo Jin.

50
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,350
Search this place.

51
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,790
Soldiers,

52
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,730
what's wrong?

53
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,930
Have you seen this woman?

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
No, I haven't.

55
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,330
Search this place.

56
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,890
Sir,

57
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,440
we just run a small inn here.

58
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,580
We've never seen this person before.

59
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,740
Listen, all of you!

60
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,880
[Wanted]

61
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,520
Whoever catches this woman alive

62
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,150
will be rewarded with 100 taels of gold!

63
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,090
Sir, you saw it too;

64
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,170
we truly don't have the person you're looking for here.

65
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,130
We didn't find her.

66
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,150
Let's go.

67
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,030
Take care, soldiers.

68
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,790
Take care. Take care!

69
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,820
This place is no longer safe.

70
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,190
We should hurry and get out of here.

71
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,820
No.

72
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,380
Something is wrong.

73
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,550
If the owner of the poisoned dart

74
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,150
is truly one of Mo Jin's black-clad subordinates,

75
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,610
then why would they want to use me to kill him?

76
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,190
Unless the owner of the dart is someone else.

77
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,320
Then, who is the true owner of the dart?

78
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,900
He Lianxuan,

79
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,150
did I...

80
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,570
did I make a mistake?

81
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,940
We should leave here quickly.

82
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,750
No!

83
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,310
I can't leave.

84
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,220
I have to get to the bottom of this matter.

85
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,680
Otherwise, I won't leave.

86
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,760
I've checked.

87
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,580
The man in black who used this dart is a remnant
of the assassins from the previous dynasty.

88
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,040
This organization is very mysterious

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,440
and loyal to someone who wields
immense power and influence.

90
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,750
But this person is elusive,

91
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,410
and no one in the martial world has ever seen him.

92
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,140
I've never been able to track him down either.

93
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,440
Why have you never told me this before?

94
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,529
He betrayed you.

95
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,850
He caused your family to be destroyed.

96
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,590
You want to kill him,

97
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,320
and I certainly won't stop you.

98
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,190
Ninth Princess.

99
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,630
I told you

100
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,560
I would always support all your decisions.

101
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,260
After everything,

102
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,590
you still don't trust me.

103
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,310
But what if my decision was wrong?

104
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,380
I want to go back.

105
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,700
Don't go.

106
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,550
Didn't you see those pursuers just now?

107
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,150
You'll die if you go back now.

108
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,160
No.

109
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,810
I have to get to the bottom of this matter.

110
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,950
I've done my best.

111
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,170
The poison has seeped into His Highness's very marrow.

112
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,320
There's really no way to save him.

113
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,970
Is there really no other way?

114
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,390
Normally, His Highness would have died on the spot.

115
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,100
That he has survived until now

116
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,300
is entirely due to his profound internal martial energy.

117
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,740
Quack.

118
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,330
What's the point of having you
in the Imperial Medical Bureau?

119
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,840
What about my mother and my child?

120
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,600
Why didn't you leave

121
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,490
any of my loved ones alone?

122
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,030
Today, even if I have to risk my life,

123
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,870
I will use your blood

124
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,590
to honor my dead families!

125
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,670
Nine...

126
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,670
Don't go.

127
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,670
Is there really no other way?

128
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,310
There is one method left.

129
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,730
Unless we use special medicine

130
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,390
to prolong His Highness's life,

131
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,530
it might allow him to hold on for a few more years.

132
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,520
If we don't use the medicine,

133
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,650
sealing his acupoints would allow him to move normally.

134
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,210
It's just that the poison will break out within a day.

135
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,330
Given the urgency,

136
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,690
we should use the medicine first

137
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,890
to buy me some time to find the antidote.

138
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,220
My Lord, this medicine will severely damage his body,

139
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,409
and from then on, His Highness will be unable to
move like a normal person

140
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:42,450
and will have to lie in bed like a living corpse
for the rest of his life.

141
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,800
The situation is urgent.

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,659
We should use the medicine first.

143
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,200
Even if he cannot move,

144
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,220
you must keep His Highness alive.

145
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,020
Yes.

146
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,640
Empress Dowager,

147
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,260
we haven't found Li Conghuan.

148
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,659
Search. Keep searching.

149
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,270
Even if you have to turn the entire palace upside down,

150
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,980
you must find this treacherous woman.

151
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,510
Yes.

152
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,470
I'm sending people to look for you.

153
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,970
I didn't expect you to have the audacity

154
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,340
to come back and court death.

155
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,760
Guards, arrest her!

156
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,350
Yes.

157
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,810
I want all the subjects of Qingshuo to see

158
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,920
the consequences of assassinating His Highness.

159
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,840
How is he?

160
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,510
You still have the nerve to ask?

161
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,040
You don't think he would plead for you, do you?

162
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,170
I want to see him.

163
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,440
On the day you are executed,

164
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,200
I'll definitely have him come to send you on your final journey.

165
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,230
Report!

166
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,720
Your Highness,

167
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,440
the Empress Dowager has caught the assassin.

168
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,300
Your Highness.

169
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,510
Your Highness.
