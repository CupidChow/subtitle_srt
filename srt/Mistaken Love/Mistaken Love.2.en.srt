00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,550
[Episode 2]

3
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,670
Mo Jin, you toyed with my feelings.

4
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,870
You killed my mother.

5
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,530
You didn't even spare our newborn child.

6
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,870
Today, you shall pay for their lives with your own.

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,630
It's the wedding night.

8
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,430
Let's see how you'll explain this to Mo Heng.

9
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,430
What?

10
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,970
Afraid of being seen?

11
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,230
On her wedding night,

12
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,410
the Crown Princess is alone with her brother-in-law.

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,740
Why hasn't the poison taken effect?

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,680
That little poison of yours,

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,280
you thought it could harm me?

16
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,100
What are you doing?

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,960
Let go of me.

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,060
I heard that in commoners'  weddings,

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,800
there's a tradition of "play pranks in the bridal chamber."

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
I want to join in this tradition.

21
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,600
Crown Princess, are you afraid of being seen?

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,440
Let go of me.

23
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,030
Let go of me.

24
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,310
Why don't we let my elder brother appreciate

25
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,640
our past relationship?

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Let go!

27
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:07,950
No.

28
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,830
Don't.

29
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,820
Mo Jin.

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
You can't.

31
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,740
Where is the Crown Princess?

32
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,270
She must have knocked things over

33
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,800
and thus gone to freshen up.

34
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,110
If you keep moving around,

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,610
I'll push you out

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,570
and let Mo Heng see your current state.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,960
The guards in this courtyard are gone.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,430
Could something have happened?

39
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,630
I'll go find someone.

40
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,880
Quickly, follow the heir.

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,280
Don't let this escalate.

42
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,990
Yes, Your Highness.

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,530
He's fine.

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,810
Could it be that I didn't stab deep enough?

45
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,070
Do you want to kill me that badly?

46
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,340
You even tried to attack me in that situation just now.

47
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,920
Yes.

48
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,680
I wish I could cut you into a thousand pieces,

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,760
drain all your blood,

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,890
and make you die in agony.

51
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,620
Only then would I be satisfied.

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,550
Even if you suppress this poison,

53
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,630
it will reach your heart within three quarters of an hour.

54
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,430
Rest assured, Brother-in-law,

55
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,210
I will attend your funeral in my finest attire.

56
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,380
I won't let you rest in peace in the underworld.

57
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,570
You once said

58
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,000
we'd be entangled for life,

59
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,760
and never fail each other, year after year.

60
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,310
Search every corner of the Eastern Palace.

61
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,430
We must find the Crown Princess.

62
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,560
Yes, Your Highness.

63
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,630
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

64
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,080
Second Brother,

65
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,720
where have you been?

66
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,460
Have you seen Conghuan?

67
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,830
Are you really going to appoint

68
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,760
Li Conghuan as the Crown Princess?

69
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,130
Of course.

70
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
Do you know about her past?

71
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,550
I don't know now,

72
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,980
but we have a lifetime ahead of us.

73
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,570
Jin,

74
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,950
when you have someone you admire in the future,

75
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,080
you'll understand.

76
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,930
Mo Jin.

77
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
I'm waiting to collect your corpse.

78
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,950
Your Highness,

79
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,320
the Crown Princess has finished her toilette and is waiting for you.

80
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,120
Very well.

81
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,100
You may leave.

82
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,880
Yes.

83
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,170
Conghuan,

84
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,270
I, as the Crown Prince,

85
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,150
am merely a target put forth by my father, the Emperor.

86
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,160
With me in place,

87
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,480
the open and hidden attacks in the palace will be directed at my Eastern Palace.

88
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,940
Only this way will my second brother be safe.

89
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,120
So,

90
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,220
are you still willing to spend your life with me?

91
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,250
I am willing.

92
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,060
I've been waiting for this day

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,610
for a long time.

94
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,940
You're finally mine.

95
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,030
Conghuan.

96
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,880
You are the one

97
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,950
I'm willing to treat with sincerity.

98
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm willing to wait for you

99
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,490
and for the day when you willingly

100
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,200
give yourself to me.

101
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,010
Oh, right.

102
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,570
My mother left a pair of jade pendants.

103
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,980
This one is for you.

104
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,620
May we, in this life,

105
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,010
grow old together and never part.

106
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,120
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,590
