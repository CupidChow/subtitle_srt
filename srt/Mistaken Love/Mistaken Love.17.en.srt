00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,520
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,750
Big Brother.

4
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,120
You're finally back.

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,890
Second Brother, you speak as if

6
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,190
you knew I was coming back.

7
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,740
I'm just glad that you returned in time.

8
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,470
Conghuan and I owe our happiness today

9
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,830
to you, Big Brother.

10
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,030
But now that I'm back,

11
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,100
Conghuan will still be my Crown Princess.

12
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,510
Conghuan.

13
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,440
Mo Heng?

14
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,770
Conghuan!

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,270
I thought I'd never see you again.

16
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,950
You...

17
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,320
You're still alive.

18
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,520
After I fell from the city wall,

19
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,130
I was swept away by the river.

20
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,860
Fortunately, a farmer saved me

21
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,920
and let me recover in the mountains.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,720
The moment I recovered,

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,950
I came to see you.

24
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,270
Mo Heng, I...

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,700
What did you call me?

26
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,610
Why aren't you calling me Heng anymore?

27
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,000
She is my wife now.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,670
Naturally, she must distance herself from Your Highness, the Crown Prince,

29
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,330
to avoid any misunderstandings.

30
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,060
What have you done to Conghuan?

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,009
Conghuan,

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,020
if he's threatened you,

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,670
tell me.

34
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,700
I'll take care of it for you.

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,560
You have no right to question her.

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,920
You planned all of this!

37
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,410
You disregard moral principles,

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,360
killing your brother and taking his wife.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,960
How can you be so at ease with yourself?

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,030
I'm not the one with a guilty conscience,

41
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,830
Big Brother.

42
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,550
You know best

43
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,570
about what you did.

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,340
Your Highness,

45
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,920
His Majesty has heard of your return

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
and is waiting for you in the palace.

47
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,760
Jin,

48
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,960
so what really happened

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,360
on the city wall that day?

50
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,100
How did you find out?

51
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,520
Of course, Conghuan told me herself.

52
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,460
We've been completely honest with each other.

53
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,840
Actually, I don't mind Conghuan's past,

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,760
but she said

55
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,230
you're the only stain in her past.

56
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,870
But it doesn't matter.

57
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,670
We have a long future ahead of us.

58
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,500
I'll help her forget the past.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Oh, right.

60
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,230
She also said

61
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,150
she wanted to have many, many children with me.

62
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,750
Second Brother, you haven't had children yet, have you?

63
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,880
You must not know what that feels like.

64
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,770
Shut up.

65
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,240
What you can't give her—

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
I can provide it all.

67
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,990
So that's how it is.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,800
Then, why did he do that?

69
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,000
To conceal the death warriors.

70
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,150
To conceal the death warriors?

71
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,970
I see.

72
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,660
You mentioned before

73
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,070
that after Mo Heng faked his death,

74
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,740
all traces of the remaining death warriors disappeared.

75
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,490
So,

76
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,960
I suspect Mo Heng is connected to the death warriors.

77
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Then, do you think

78
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,540
Mo Heng...

79
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,230
Based on what I know about him,

80
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,280
he's planning an even bigger move.

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,300
Jin,

82
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,670
no matter what happens,

83
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,670
I will always stand by your side.

84
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,820
Do you remember?

85
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,860
Back when we were in Zizhou,

86
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,190
we each had

87
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,380
a red string tied around our wrists,

88
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,750
symbolizing our unity

89
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,850
and unwavering loyalty.

90
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,970
As long as I live,

91
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,870
I will protect you.

92
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,620
We must both live well.

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,470
We're also going to…

94
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,590
I almost forgot,

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,760
I need to take Conghuan to meet Father together.

96
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,320
She is my lawfully wedded Crown Princess.

97
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,720
If she were to remarry...

98
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,500
No,

99
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,650
she won't remarry.

100
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,160
I will never divorce her.

101
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,470
You don't need to divorce a dead person.

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,800
But I'm back now.

103
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,030
She will always be my Crown Princess.

104
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,750
I will never let her leave.

105
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,870
Conghuan is not an object.

106
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,590
She shouldn't be fought over by us two.

107
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,290
Who she chooses to be with

108
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,980
is up to her.

109
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,000
Mo Heng,

110
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,920
you've been good to me,

111
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,540
but there's only one person in my heart.

112
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,170
Then, there's no need for further discussion.

113
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,660
Let Father decide Conghuan's fate.

114
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,170
Your Highness.

115
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,020
Conghuan,

116
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,120
I knew you would come back.

117
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,690
Your Highness,

118
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,350
I think it's best to return this to its rightful owner.

119
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,550
Why have you changed?

120
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,010
It's good that you're back alive.

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,960
Here, I'm returning this to you.

122
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,900
Conghuan,

123
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,470
do you know how I survived?

124
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,180
The river water was so cold in winter.

125
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,150
I fell from the city wall.

126
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,170
My internal organs were ruptured,

127
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,300
bleeding non-stop.

128
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,270
I was supposed to die,

129
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,520
but I wanted to come back to see you.

130
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,780
I was thinking you must be waiting for me.

131
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,670
I couldn't leave you behind.

132
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,330
Even if I had only one breath left,

133
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,110
even if I had to crawl,

134
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,440
I would crawl back to Qingshuo to find you.

135
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,550
-Let's be the same as before. Okay?
-Your Highness.

136
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,090
Soon, this country will be mine,

137
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,330
and it will all be yours, too.

138
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,600
I will make you

139
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,240
the most powerful woman in the world, alright?

140
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,320
Your Highness, I have matters to attend to. I'll take my leave.

141
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,190
I really should be dead

142
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,990
for bumping into you, Princess!

143
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,690
Isn't this the little eunuch who misled me with the poisoned dart?

144
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,820
Why is he here?

145
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,580
Your Highness,

146
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,260
His Majesty requests your presence.

147
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,460
Your Highness must respond carefully.

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,640
This is how it is.

149
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,630
It is up to you to decide, Father.

150
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,730
You two brothers fight

151
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,190
over a woman.

152
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Where does this leave the royal family's reputation?

153
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,110
I don't wish for this either,

154
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,300
but Second Brother tried to take my life

155
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,260
and stole Conghuan away.

156
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,720
Matters without evidence

157
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,550
should not be speculated upon.

158
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,170
I also believe Second Brother didn't mean to.

159
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,640
He might have been too eager to marry,

160
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,860
so he lost his senses.

161
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,520
As his big brother,

162
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,790
I won't hold it against him.

163
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,150
Good.

164
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,140
That is what you should do as the Crown Prince.

165
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,860
Since you've finally returned,

166
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,800
you should rest and recover in the Eastern Palace.

167
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
Let your troublesome Crown Princess

168
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,670
take good care of you.

169
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,870
Yes.

170
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,070
Have you asked for her consent?

171
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,830
Absurd!

172
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,320
I am the Emperor.

173
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,600
Do I need to ask for a woman's opinion?

174
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,690
Father!

175
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,520
I am willing to return to the Eastern Palace.

176
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,170
Father, you favor Mo Jin to such an extent

177
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,190
[Memorial Tablet of Mo Heng, Crown Prince of Qingshuo]

178
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,300
that you don't even care about my life.

179
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,340
Do you think you can appease me with a woman?

180
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,920
Your Highness,

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,620
we've received messages from both the Northern Desert and Southern Regions.

182
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,870
Everything has been arranged.

183
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,730
We await Your Highness's orders.

184
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,940
Who is it?
