[Mistaken Love]

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,530
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,840
Conghuan, I think Prince Yiqin's daughter is good.

4
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,220
She and Second Brother would make a fine couple.

5
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
What do you think?

6
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,590
Sounds good.

7
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,690
Empress Dowager, we must not.

8
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,289
Very well, I approve.

9
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,670
I'll leave this matter to the two of you.

10
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,789
Where is my earring?

11
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,330
Escort the Crown Prince back first.

12
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,130
Yes.

13
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,390
Where did it go?

14
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,080
I still had it during the meal just now.

15
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,310
Your Majesty, we'll light the Meng Tianjiao incense for you
when you return to the palace.

16
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,510
Good, light it for me.

17
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,440
I have something to say to the Crown Prince.

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
You may all leave.

19
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,310
Yes.

20
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,600
You...

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,470
Why are you back?

22
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,560
What?

23
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,329
You really want me to go after the daughter of Prince Yiqin?

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
You know that's not what I think.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,520
Why don't you ask me why I came back to the Eastern Palace?

26
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,740
If I couldn't guess your intentions,

27
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,150
how could I be your Jin?

28
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,880
A wedding night wouldn't be complete without sharing
the ceremonial cross-cupped wine, right?

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,010
Wait for me a moment.

30
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,590
After tonight,

31
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,470
we will truly be husband and wife.

32
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,480
What do you mean with all this?

33
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,040
I've done everything I should for you.

34
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,900
Yet you've gone back on your word.

35
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,820
Empress Dowager, you must remain calm.

36
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,350
What I'm doing now

37
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,790
is to sever

38
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,820
Mo Jin's attachment to Li Conghuan, isn't it?

39
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,870
When my grand plan succeeds,

40
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,339
Prince Yiqin's daughter naturally cannot be...

41
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,750
At that time, I'll arrange for... Mo Jin to marry you

42
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,250
and let you two out of the palace...

43
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,990
to be a perfect couple.

44
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:33,990
Then, you'd better keep your word.

45
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,990
Otherwise, I will never let you off.

46
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,790
Rest assured.

47
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,590
We're in the same boat now.

48
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Conghuan?

49
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,510
Conghuan?

50
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,320
I've already found out.

51
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,240
That young eunuch has newly been assigned here.

52
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,010
That eunuch frequently comes and goes from the Eastern Palace.

53
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,770
He must be close to Mo Heng.

54
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,560
If that's really the case,

55
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,210
Nine...

56
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,730
Conghuan?

57
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,770
Where are you?

58
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,330
Your Highness, we've found the remnants of the death warrior hidden by the Crown Prince.

59
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,010
This is the letter I intercepted

60
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,870
that was exchanged between the Eastern Palace and the four kingdoms.

61
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,620
Mo Heng is growing restless.

62
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,310
He dares to recruit troops with the four kingdoms, attempting treason.

63
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,190
No.

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,300
I can't let Nine stay in the Eastern Palace any longer.

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,960
I must get her out of Qingshuo.

66
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,740
Come on, easy.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,710
Come on, slowly.

68
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
Heng, you're drunk.

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,900
I'll go prepare some sobering soup for you.

70
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,780
Conghuan.

71
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,870
Don't go.

72
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,990
What's wrong?

73
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,150
Let's have a child.

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,890
Why do you bring that up all of a sudden?

75
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,900
Conghuan,

76
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,600
don't you like children?

77
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,080
I do. We'll have plenty of time for that.

78
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,890
You rest for now.

79
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,620
Nine?

80
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,320
Why are you here?

81
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,760
The Eastern Palace has been heavily guarded lately. You should leave now.

82
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,260
Mo Heng is secretly colluding with the rulers of
the four kingdoms to recruit troops.

83
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,350
It's dangerous for you to stay by his side.

84
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,580
Are you asking me to leave Qingshuo?

85
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,480
I know you want to stay by his side to investigate the truth,

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:42,970
but...

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,690
I've already gained his trust.

88
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,190
I'm about to uncover the truth.

89
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,270
The truth is indeed important.

90
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,270
I'll continue investigating for you.

91
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,240
But your safety is more important right now.

92
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,630
Nothing is more important than the truth.

93
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,470
I can't leave.

94
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,750
Conghuan.

95
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,570
Conghuan.

96
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,500
Nine.

97
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,480
I don't want you to stay here for even a moment.

98
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,740
I don't want to either.

99
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
But we've just uncovered the truth.

100
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,430
Jin.

101
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,220
Go quickly.

102
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,010
Go now.

103
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,820
Conghuan?

104
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,750
Conghuan.

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,390
Conghuan.

106
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,930
Catch him.

107
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,390
Don't go...

108
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,250
Count to three.

109
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,960
Conghuan, where are you going? Conghuan.

110
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,040
Three.

111
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,790
Two, one.

112
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,790
Heng.

113
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,250
You're drunk.

114
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,920
Let's go to bed, okay?

115
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,760
Come on, let's go.

116
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,300
I have issued a decree.

117
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
In three days,

118
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,370
you shall marry Shen Ling, Prince Yiqin's daughter.

119
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,570
This marriage is not up for discussion.

120
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,900
I don't wish to waste the Prince's daughter's time.

121
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,350
I'm sorry, but I cannot comply.

122
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,480
You rebellious son.

123
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,830
How dare you defy me?

124
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,520
I will strip you of your military leadership.

125
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,650
Father, any punishment you see fit...

126
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,460
I am willing to bear it alone.

127
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,040
You're so stubborn.

128
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,330
I have already issued the decree.

129
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,370
This marriage will happen whether you like it or not.

130
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,040
That letter Mo Heng put away that day

131
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,390
seems very important.

132
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,490
Conghuan?

133
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,610
Why are you awake?

134
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,750
It's so late.

135
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,310
Why haven't you gone to bed?

136
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,370
I miss Father.

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,930
I want to write him a letter.

138
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,000
If you're homesick,

139
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,750
why bother writing a letter?

140
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,460
How about I send someone to escort you back to Zizhou to visit your family another day?

141
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,170
Okay.

142
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,760
I know you must have endured a lot of hardships.

143
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,750
Rest early tonight.

144
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,490
I've prepared a surprise for you for tomorrow morning.

145
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,500
Okay.

146
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,610
Your Highness.

147
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,270
These are other noble ladies His Majesty has selected for you.

148
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,800
Get lost!

149
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,260
So, this is the surprise you mentioned?

150
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,660
Watching the Second Prince select a bride?

151
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,220
Don't be hasty. The surprise is coming soon.

152
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,970
What are you doing?
