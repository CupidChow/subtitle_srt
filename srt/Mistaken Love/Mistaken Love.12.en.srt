[Mistaken Love]

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,490
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,100
You...

4
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
You're alright?

5
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,820
What?

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,120
Are you disappointed

7
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,880
to see that I'm not dead?

8
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,910
What heavy snow,

9
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,789
it's like pear blossoms blooming.

10
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,510
All the envoys have left,

11
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,740
why haven't you gone?

12
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,580
Because...

13
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,389
Because of what?

14
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,490
Because Qingshuo doesn't have such beautiful pear blossoms.

15
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,590
The season for pear blossoms has long passed.

16
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,079
Yes.

17
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,260
Now it's the dead of winter.

18
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,990
There are no pear flowers.

19
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,840
Pear blossoms are fragile.

20
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,800
How could they survive in this snowy weather?

21
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,800
Even if they did survive,

22
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,180
they would have changed their appearance.

23
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,390
When Your Highness sees them again,

24
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,240
you won't recognize them.

25
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,160
I have something to ask you.

26
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,329
Your Highness,

27
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,410
she has tried to harm you many times.

28
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,260
Now that she's back,

29
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,829
who knows what trick she's playing?

30
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,160
Don't trust her easily.

31
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,710
Come over here.

32
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,440
Let her go!

33
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,040
Protect His Highness!

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,030
Protect the Second Prince!

35
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,900
He Lianxuan.

36
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,279
I'll kill her if you move.

37
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,640
It was my idea to kill you.

38
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,430
She was forced.

39
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,680
I did it all.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
It has nothing to do with him.

41
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,850
You're really protecting him, aren't you?

42
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,870
Take him to the death row.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,350
Yes.

44
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,140
Don't.

45
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,230
Go.

46
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,060
No!

47
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,480
I was the one who killed you.

48
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,570
Please let him go.

49
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,700
You can barely protect yourself now,

50
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:59,710
and you're still trying to bargain with me for him?

51
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,110
I'm begging you.

52
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,060
I'll do whatever you want me to.

53
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,260
I beg you not to hurt him.

54
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,960
Then I want you

55
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,890
to promise me one thing.

56
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,660
Okay.

57
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
You don't even ask what it is?

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,170
Your Highness!

59
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,230
No, Your Highness!

60
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,310
Retreat.

61
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,380
If no medicine is used,

62
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,470
blocking the acupoints can make him appear like a normal person,

63
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,670
but within a day, the poison will definitely take effect.

64
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,260
♫Rain falls down in the yard at night♫

65
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,810
♫Reflecting on the departure in the world♫

66
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,420
♫We meet each other again even when we're apart♫

67
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,780
♫What we had was glorious♫

68
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,360
♫A sharp arrow pierced through memories♫

69
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,200
♫Love is growing♫

70
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,170
♫The curtain separates love and hatred♫

71
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,850
♫After endless sorrow♫

72
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,900
♫Love is hard to forget♫

73
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,170
♫What we had was a dream♫

74
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,070
♫We'd better enjoy the moment♫

75
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,659
♫That year, we chatted and laughed under a pear tree♫

76
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,010
♫Snow flew in the whole night♫

77
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,000
♫All happiness in the world♫

78
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,700
♫Comes with regrets♫

79
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,720
♫I hardened my resolve to leave you♫

80
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,910
I want you...

81
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,600
♫And you never came into my dream♫

82
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,250
To stay with me for one day.

83
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,560
♫When everything turns into nothing♫

84
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,090
♫I wish I could be with you forever♫

85
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,990
♫That year, we chatted and laughed under a pear tree♫

86
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,350
♫Snow flew in the whole night♫

87
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,330
♫All happiness in the world♫

88
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,030
♫Comes with regrets♫

89
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,060
♫I hardened my resolve to leave you♫

90
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,930
♫And you never came into my dream♫

91
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,890
♫When everything turns into nothing♫

92
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,420
Mo Jin.

93
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,420
♫I wish I could be with you forever♫

94
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,380
I hope you are as I expect.

95
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,250
If you can't cure the Second Prince,

96
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,290
you will die.

97
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,820
Your Majesty,

98
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,950
the Second Prince has released Li Conghuan.

99
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,710
What?

100
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,910
Send someone to chase after her.

101
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,810
If Li Conghuan isn't caught,

102
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,470
it's on you.

103
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,350
Yes.

104
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,010
Come take a look and check out some little trinkets!

105
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,470
What are you really up to?

106
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,309
Don't worry.

107
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,900
After today,

108
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,360
I'll tell you

109
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,179
everything I know.

110
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,760
Let's go.

111
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
Steamed buns,

112
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,120
freshly made steamed buns,

113
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,420
delicious and fragrant steamed buns.

114
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,480
You must be hungry.

115
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,500
Miss, these are all delicacies from Zizhou.

116
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,810
Want to give them a try?

117
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,220
These are lily pastries unique to Qingshuo,

118
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,570
famous across the four nations.

119
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,430
Miss, try some.

120
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,970
Thank you.

121
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,790
Is it good?

122
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,160
Mm.

123
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,750
Thank you, sir.
