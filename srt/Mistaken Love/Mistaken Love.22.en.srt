00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,580
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,670
How am I doing?

4
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,650
Your Highness, there is no poison on that dart,

5
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,370
just a small dose of sedative.

6
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,800
Your pulse is stable, Your Highness. You may rest assured.

7
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,910
You may leave.

8
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,950
Yes.

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,520
So you dared to set a trap to test me.

10
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,070
Li Conghuan.

11
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,810
I really underestimated you.

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,600
What are you doing?

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,170
Huo Xin! Mo Jin has treated you well.

14
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,650
Is this how you repay him?

15
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,850
My mother's life is still in Mo Heng's hands.

16
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,470
Huo Xin.

17
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,270
Huo Xin! Huo Xin!

18
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,750
Crown Princess,

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,660
stop calling him.

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,289
What do you want?

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,120
Father.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,850
I've brought you the new batch of Meng Tianjiao incense.

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,190
I have a rare incense, Meng Tianjiao.

24
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,580
It becomes addictive over time.

25
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,260
Light it for Father.

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
Once I ascend the throne,

27
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,960
I'll let Mo Jin and you leave the palace to be a happy couple.

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,110
Comfy.

29
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,660
Father, I hope...

30
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,610
that you will abdicate due to illness

31
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,700
and announce that I... will inherit the throne.

32
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,400
You...

33
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,210
You...

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,300
I...

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,700
I'll write the decree.

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,630
Huo Xin!

37
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,970
Why are you doing this?

38
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,829
Your Highness,

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,760
today is your wedding day.

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,470
The auspicious hour is approaching.

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,320
Wedding?

42
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,980
His Majesty has ordered you to marry Miss Shen today without exception.

43
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,440
You should stop thinking about the Ninth Princess from now on.

44
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,730
What have you done to Li Conghuan?

45
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,180
Tell me!

46
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,780
I...

47
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,770
Huo Xin.

48
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,190
We grew up together,

49
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,560
and now you won't even tell me the truth?

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,490
I wouldn't dare.

51
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,930
It's just that I...

52
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,430
I was truly left with no choice.

53
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,860
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,670
Huo Xin, come back!

55
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,550
Come back!

56
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,300
Let's see who can protect you now.

57
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,080
You little hussy.

58
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,750
Stop!

59
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,920
The Crown Prince still has use for her.

60
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,990
Who are you?

61
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,659
Let go of me!

62
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,030
Let go of me!

63
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,190
Let go of me!

64
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,830
Do you really love her that much?

65
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,420
If your heart can only hold one person...

66
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,500
Even if I had you,

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,570
would that truly make me happy?

68
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,650
Brother Jin, I know where Li Conghuan is.

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,990
Where is she?

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,120
Is it that you can only have one person

71
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,600
in your heart?

72
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,800
For her, you're even willing to give up your life.

73
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,930
Where is she really?

74
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,400
After being the Empress Dowager of Qingshuo for so long,

75
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,930
now I want to be myself.

76
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,870
Brother Jin.

77
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:42,980
Goodbye.

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,420
[Zhengxuan Hall]

79
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,140
[Palace Exit Permit]

80
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,590
Just consider this my good deed for the day.

81
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,240
Empress Dowager, why are you here?

82
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,740
I've done what I promised you.

83
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,900
What do you want?

84
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,780
As the Empress Dowager of Qingshuo,

85
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,370
you can't leave the palace at will.

86
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,030
I don't want to be the Empress Dowager anymore.

87
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,110
I don't want to be trapped here for the rest of my life.

88
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,430
You can't leave.

89
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,170
You will always be the Empress Dowager.

90
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,690
You and I both live in the imperial palace.

91
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,370
You should understand these rules.

92
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,430
It's not like that.

93
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,430
My life should be decided by me.

94
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,380
Are you trying to ruin my plans?

95
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,230
You're going to betray me too?

96
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,340
You can't act recklessly.

97
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,210
This is the Throne Room.

98
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,930
So what if it's the Throne Room?

99
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,970
This empire will soon be mine.

100
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,010
Those who defy me... shall die.

101
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,470
What about Brother Jin?

102
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,760
What are you going to do to Brother Jin?

103
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,730
Him? He will soon be a dead man.

104
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,540
What are you going to do to him?

105
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,150
You're still worried about him even now?

106
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,010
You should worry about yourself.

107
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,370
Proclaim this...

108
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,860
the Empress Dowager has been secluded in the palace for too long,

109
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,720
so she has become deranged and attempted to escape.

110
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,320
Confine her to the Cold Palace,

111
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,600
strictly guarded.

112
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,690
She is forbidden from seeing anyone.

113
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,370
Even if she dies...

114
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,270
she has to die within the palace walls.
