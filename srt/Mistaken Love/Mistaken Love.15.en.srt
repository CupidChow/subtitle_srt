[Mistaken Love]

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,530
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,210
Is this your first time drinking?

4
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,120
There's alcohol in the palace too.

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,760
But I’m the Empress Dowager

6
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,550
so I’m not allowed to drink.

7
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,590
That must make life pretty boring.

8
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,820
Yes, it’s really boring.

9
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,130
I can’t laugh when I want to,

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,230
and I can’t cry when I feel like it.

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,430
Every word and action

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,370
has to fit my position as the Empress Dowager.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,500
I...

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,680
I don't like it at all.

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,510
Not one bit.

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,830
There must be something you like, though.

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,850
The thing I like...

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,700
The thing I like has already been taken by others.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,080
I loved him so much.

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,170
We were childhood sweethearts.

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,000
Now I've become the Empress Dowager.

22
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,670
Why are you staring at me?

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,280
If people’s love

24
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,890
could always go in order,

25
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,759
maybe no one would get hurt.

26
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,910
You think she'll be grateful for what you've done?

27
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,150
Let me tell you,

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,120
she’s a cold and heartless woman.

29
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,480
She probably doesn’t even have a place

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,030
in her heart for you.

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,920
Liking someone

32
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,610
is one's own business.

33
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,280
As long as she's doing well,

34
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,010
it doesn’t matter if I have a place or not.

35
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,160
The world is so vast,

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,790
you don't have to just like one person.

37
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,730
Didn't you say that women from Zizhou

38
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,200
are bold and open-minded?

39
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,670
There’s even bolder than that.

40
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,100
What's that?

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,300
How dare you!

42
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,880
Behaving like this in the Qingshuo Palace

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,210
would get you beheaded.

44
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,870
Good thing we’re outside the palace, then.

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,330
If only I could live this free

46
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,170
for the rest of my life.

47
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,870
Then leave that palace.

48
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,620
Only by seeing a broader world for yourself

49
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,350
can you say you’ve truly lived.

50
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,180
Faster!

51
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,920
It's him.

52
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,870
The man leading the group.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
He's the one who killed my mother and child.

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,120
He claimed he was following your order.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,460
What order?

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,070
To kill my mother and my child.

57
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,210
Right here.

58
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,410
I watched helplessly

59
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,930
as they killed my mother and child,

60
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,330
but I couldn't save them.

61
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,450
Nine,

62
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,250
I never gave such an order.

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,320
Tell me,

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,050
what exactly happened after I left that year?

65
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,410
From now on, there will be three of us.

66
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,110
Thank you for all you've done.

67
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,010
Now that I'm pregnant,

68
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,860
I understand how hard it was for my mother.

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,850
You'll be a great mother too.

70
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,920
Nine, what's wrong?

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
I think I’m fine.

72
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,240
Mother said this pain is normal during pregnancy.

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,080
It should be alright.

74
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,530
Don't scare me, Nine.

75
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,970
What should we do? I think I'm going into labor.

76
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,370
Come.

77
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,700
Nine.

78
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,580
Nine.

79
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,360
Come.

80
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,870
Lie down.

81
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,630
Nine.

82
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,580
Nine.

83
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,860
Nine.

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,680
What's wrong?

85
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,130
-Mo Jin.
-Yes, Nine.

86
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,920
I'll go get your mother.

87
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,780
Nine.

88
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,270
Nine!

89
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,650
It's bad.

90
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,570
Nine is bleeding heavily.

91
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:37,970
Nine!

92
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,650
Quickly, go find a doctor.

93
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:38,930
Nine!

94
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,640
After that it's too late, okay?

95
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,510
-Nine!
-Go!

96
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,780
Nine.

97
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,159
Nine.

98
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,250
Nine.

99
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,170
Don't be afraid, Nine.

100
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,370
I'm here.

101
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,340
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

102
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,430
Come on.

103
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,320
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

104
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,750
Nine.

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,260
Bear down.

106
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,290
Come on, Nine.

107
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,500
Come on, come on.

108
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,650
Bear down.

109
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,170
Hurry.

110
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,050
Bear down.

111
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,820
Bear down, Nine.

112
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,820
Hurry, Nine.

113
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,200
Hurry.

114
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,730
Come on.

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,560
Come on.

116
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,610
Just a little more!

117
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,950
Nine.

118
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,370
Mother.

119
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,490
You're awake.

120
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,550
Where's the child?

121
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,960
Here, right here.

122
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,290
Mother.

123
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,050
Where's Jin?

124
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,410
Nine.

125
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,490
I told you before.

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,290
There's no true love in the palace.

127
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,370
Mo Jin was just putting on an act with you.

128
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,070
Now he's going back to Qingshuo to be the prince.

129
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,500
He won't come back again.

130
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,500
That’s impossible.

131
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,530
That’s impossible. Mother.

132
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,159
It's impossible.

133
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,870
Jin will definitely come back.

134
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,610
This child!

135
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,440
The Second Prince has ordered

136
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,409
to kill this child.

137
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:40,970
Who are you?

138
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,770
What are you going to do?

139
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,500
Do you know whose child this is?

140
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,560
My child.

141
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,050
Give me back the child!

142
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,990
Give me back the child!

143
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,620
Mother!

144
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,420
There's insect poison on the dart.

145
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,900
I

146
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,880
couldn't be saved.

147
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,840
Mother.

148
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,570
Nine.

149
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,070
Run quickly!

150
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,850
Mother.

151
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,330
Hurry.

152
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,810
Mother!

153
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,290
Mother!

154
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,350
Mother!

155
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,120
Mother!

156
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,770
Mother.

157
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,280
Mother.

158
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,169
My child.

159
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,890
My child.

160
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,250
Give me back my child!

161
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,660
Give him back to me.

162
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,650
This is the token of love between Jin and me.

163
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,640
What have you done to him?

164
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,280
By order of the Second Prince,

165
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,090
clear everything here.

166
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,770
Especially this child.

167
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,650
No.

168
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,510
No!

169
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,970
Please don’t!

170
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,530
I beg you,

171
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,440
kill me.

172
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,590
Don't kill my child.

173
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,320
I beg you.

174
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,370
Give him to me.

175
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,910
My child.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,930
My child!

177
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,920
I have nightmares every day,

178
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,100
reliving their deaths over and over again.

179
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,220
Jin.

180
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,250
Where were you at that time?

181
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,050
You were having a difficult labor at that time.

182
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,440
So I went to find a doctor.

183
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,960
On the way, they told me...

184
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,130
The Ninth Princess of Zizhou is to marry the Crown Prince of Qingshuo.

185
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,850
We are ordered to eliminate everyone involved

186
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,590
and retrieve the token.

187
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,250
No one should stand in our way!

188
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,050
They took my jade pendant,

189
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,180
and tried to kill me.

190
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,730
I was outnumbered,

191
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,400
severely injured and unconscious.

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,680
By the time I arrived,

193
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,890
you had gone with Mo Heng to ask for the consent of the marriage.

194
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,790
I was heartbroken.

195
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,400
When I woke up,

196
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,160
it was all too late.

197
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,810
The Ninth Princess was no longer there.

198
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,740
I rushed to the bamboo forest and found you collapsed in the rain.

199
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,580
The child.

200
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,620
The child was already dead.

201
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,700
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,740
I didn't know you were severely injured at that time.

203
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,580
Nine.

204
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,970
Why didn’t you tell me about

205
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,140
Mo Heng’s marriage proposal?

206
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,680
That marriage proposal was accepted by my mother without my consent.

207
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,250
I had already refused it.

208
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,010
They are indeed here.

209
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,570
Nine, let's go.

210
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,250
Go.

211
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,070
