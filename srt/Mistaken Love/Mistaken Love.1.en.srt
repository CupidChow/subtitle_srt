1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,220
In the 15th year of Saint Qingshuo,

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,770
Crown Prince Mo Heng passed away.

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,910
Crown Princess Li Conghuan kept vigil for him.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,950
According to the law, she must be buried alive with him immediately.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,930
Crown Princess,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,700
choose one way

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,390
to end your life.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,510
I am a princess from Zizhou.

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,540
[Zizhou's Ninth Princess, Li Conghuan]

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,080
Zizhou doesn't have such a law.

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,670
This is not for you to decide.

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,390
Your Highness, His Majesty has issued an order.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,920
The Crown Princess must not leave here alive.

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,300
[Second Prince of Qingshuo, Mo Jin]

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,640
You've schemed and plotted to become the Crown Princess.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,229
But before you could enjoy the wealth and glory,

17
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,229
now,

18
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,880
you're going to have to join my dear elder brother.

19
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,789
It was you!

20
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,310
You were the one who killed Heng.

21
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,550
She hasn't been officially recorded in the royal genealogy yet.

22
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,039
So, she can't be considered a true Crown Princess.

23
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,550
She's not eligible to be buried with the Crown Prince.

24
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,009
His Majesty has issued an imperative order.

25
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,360
Your Highness, do you intend to defy the imperial order?

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,250
Then, don't blame me

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,470
for personally sending her on her way.

28
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,780
How many more people do you need to kill before you're satisfied?

29
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,990
As long as I can get what I want,

30
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,270
what does it matter?

31
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,430
Indeed.

32
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,310
Heng is dead.

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,630
Now, you can have everything that was his.

34
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,470
That's right.

35
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,940
I will inherit everything that belonged to my royal brother,

36
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,900
including you.

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,300
Li Conghuan will not be buried alive,

38
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,350
because…

39
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,890
I'm going to marry her.

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,410
Let go!

41
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,220
Let go of me!

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,530
[Mistaken Love]

43
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,350
In the 15th year of Qingshuo,

44
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,880
Zizhou sent their Ninth Princess to marry the Crown Prince of Qingshuo.

45
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,150
[Episode 1]

46

[One month ago]

47
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,050
The auspicious time has arrived.

48
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,260
Please invite the bride to enter.

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,310
For the Ninth Princess from a barbarian country like Zizhou,

50
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,080
[Crown Prince of Qingshuo, Mo Heng]

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,860
to marry Qingshuo's Crown Prince

52
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,880
it's truly her good fortune.

53
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,030
Indeed.

54
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,470
The Crown Prince is kind-hearted,

55
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,290
unlike the Second Prince.

56
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,290
He's practically the King of Hell incarnate.

57
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,610
Mo Jin,

58
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,430
I've finally seen you.

59
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,340
I will kill you with my own hands.

60

Li Conghuan.

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,240
You betrayed our love back then.

62
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,990
Was it really for power and status

63
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,770

138
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,800
You betrayed me

139
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,200
just to marry my elder brother?

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,260
Mo Heng is the noblest Crown Prince of Qingshuo.

141
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,870
Marrying him will bring me endless wealth and glory.

142
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,530
Who else should I marry if not him?

143
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,210
You, Brother-in-law?

144
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,030
It's all for power?

145
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,980
Power is the most alluring thing.

146
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,760
Why can you pursue it while I can't?

147
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,550
Back in Zizhou,

148
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,830
I was nothing but a tool for political marriage.

149
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,890
I was to be sent wherever I was needed.

150
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,750
Now, Heng cherishes and loves me.

151
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,150
He has given me a home.

152
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,960
Of course I will be faithful to him year, after year,

153
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,760
and have many children with him.

154
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,040
Many children?

155
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,920
You're using children as tools for your advancement again.

156
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,450
I am now the Crown Princess.

157
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,910
If I'm hurt, you won't get away with it, either.

158
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,200
Constantly calling yourself Crown Princess.

159
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,790
What?

160
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,280
Whoever has power,

161
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,160
you'll just give yourself to them?

162
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,960
That's right.

163
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,000
I was born to be a gift.

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,110
Wherever I'm needed,

165
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,640
Zizhou will send me there.

166
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,820
When you first met me,

167
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,330
wasn't it the case?

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,920
Now is the time.

169
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,790
What?

170
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,830
Are you in such a hurry

171
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,350
to clear the obstacles on your path to power?

172
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,140
Yes.

173
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,310
I want to forget everything

174
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,710
and start anew.

175
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Crown Princess, you want to forget,

176
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
but I insist on making you remember.

177
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,500
Three,

178
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,940
two,

179
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,310
one.

180
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,710
The hairpin is poisoned.

181
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,270
Mo Jin, you toyed with my feelings

182
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,990
and killed my mother.

183
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,140
Mother!

184
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,830
I beg you, please don't harm my child.
