00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,550
[Episode 18]

3
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,790
Who is it?

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,240
Mo Heng? He really came back from the dead.

5
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,640
Empress Dowager, I hope you've been well.

6
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,120
What are you doing here?

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,550
I've come to help fulfill your wishes, Empress Dowager.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,320
I don't understand what you're saying.

9
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,090
There's no need to be nervous, Empress Dowager.

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,300
I've already requested Father's permission.

11
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,870
Li Conghuan will move back to the Eastern Palace tomorrow.

12
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,330
She will no longer trouble you in the future.

13
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,260
I'm just worried that my second brother's emotional knot hasn't been untied.

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,990
It would be a shame to waste your good intentions.

15
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,190
So, what's your solution?

16
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,580
I have a plan that can permanently relieve your worries.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,150
Since I've returned smoothly,

18
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,280
I need to gain Mo Heng's trust quickly.

19
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,680
He seems more suspicious than before.

20
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,910
Conghuan.

21
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,479
Do you really want to be my Crown Princess again?

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,710
Those things you said to Father—

23
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,340
were they all sincere?

24
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,979
Are you doubting me?

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm not doubting you.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,950
You've seen Father's attitude.

27
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,930
He's always been biased since we were young.

28
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,750
All the good things were always reserved for my second brother.

29
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,230
He never thought about me.

30
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,900
I'm so afraid of losing

31
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,050
what I've regained again.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,090
You're all I have now.

33
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,440
I am your Crown Princess.

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,450
I won't leave you.

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,860
If my mother were alive,

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,310
she would be very happy

37
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,970
that I married such a wonderful Crown Princess.

38
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,590
From today on,

39
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,240
I will be your Crown Prince alone.

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,310
What are you going to do?

41
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,710
You'll know soon enough.

42
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,900
Heng.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,130
What's this?

44
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,300
Have you forgotten?

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,840
We haven't had our real wedding night yet.

46
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,270
Heng.

47
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,570
But I'm not ready yet.

48
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,190
Didn't you say you wanted to be my Crown Princess again

49
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,450
and wouldn't leave me?

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
Were you lying to me?

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,700
After all the twists and turns,

52
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,800
the Crown Princess has returned to the Eastern Palace.

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,140
I heard that the Crown Prince prepared a new bridal chamber.

54
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,400
The Eastern Palace was quite lively last night.

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,520
What did you say?

56
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,950
We spoke out of turn.

57
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,950
We deserve to die.

58
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:19,630
Get out!

59
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,040
Good morning, Second Brother.

60
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,330
Conghuan and I just paid our respects to Father.

61
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,240
Big Brother, you've been away for a long time.

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,210
I'm afraid you've forgotten the proper time to pay respects to Father.

63
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
It's all my fault.

64
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,450
I made Conghuan too tired last night,

65
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,390
Luckily, Father didn't mind.

66
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,990
Right, Conghuan?

67
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,230
Your sister-in-law is shy.

68
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,900
Second Brother, when you get married someday, you'll understand

69
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,630
the taste of the wedding night.

70
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,590
Conghuan says it is a custom for women in Zizhou to tie their hair bands.

71
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,350
It's to declare to others that this man belongs only to her.

72
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,650
Jin.

73
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,610
Do you trust me?

74
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,670
This night

75
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,020
felt like a year to me.

76
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,140
Conghuan.

77
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,590
Conghuan.

78
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm not feeling well.

79
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,030
Let's go back first.

80
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,020
What's wrong?

81
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,800
Big Brother, you've come to my place at this time

82
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,610
just to chat idly?

83
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,020
Of course not.

84
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,340
Father asked me to tell you

85
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,960
that he's hosting a welcome banquet for me tonight.

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,320
You must come, Second Brother.

87
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,030
Alright.

88
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,270
I'll definitely be there.

89
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,370
Let's go.

90
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,740
Heng,

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,340
you've been through a life-threatening ordeal. You should rest well.

92
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,670
Don't worry too much about court affairs.

93
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,159
Leave them to your second brother.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,310
Father, I'm already in good health.

95
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,730
There's no need to trouble Second Brother with this.

96
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,270
Your most urgent task now is to give me a grandson.

97
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,030
I'll arrange everything else myself.

98
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,020
Conghuan and I

99
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,060
are planning the same.

100
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,420
The Crown Prince and Crown Princess are so in love.

101
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,550
Father, I'm about to have both a wife and a child.

102
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,130
Second Brother is still single.

103
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,700
Big Brother, you should mind your own business.

104
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,360
Don't worry about my affairs.

105
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,840
Jin, your big brother is just looking out for you.

106
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,430
It's time to consider your marriage.

107
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,530
Why don't you leave this matter

108
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,400
to Conghuan and me? How about that?

109
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,230
Good. Heng truly understands my intentions.

110
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,900
Conghuan,

111
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,740
I think the daughter of Prince Yiqin is a good match.

112
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,510
She and Second Brother would make a beautiful couple.

113
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,040
What do you think?
