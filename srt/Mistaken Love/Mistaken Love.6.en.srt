00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,349
You're crazy!

4
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,970
Those who pretend to be deaf and mute

5
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,330
are the ones who are truly crazy inside.

6
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,720
Your Highness, please don't be worried.

7
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,610
How am I worried?

8
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,300
Why should I be worried?

9
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,380
What do you know?

10
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,320
It's okay.

11
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,580
You may leave now.

12
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,920
Yes, Your Highness.

13
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,820
Conghuan.

14
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,920
Where have you been?

15
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,670
I...

16
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,960
I suppose after we got married,

17
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,290
you've been cooped up in the palace and feeling bored.

18
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,820
As it happens,

19
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,340
the annual Flower Shadow Festival of Qingshuo is coming up.

20
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,340
I'll have the maid take you to see it.

21
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,630
The Flower Shadow Festival?

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,890
That sounds wonderful.

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
Bravo!

24
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,110
I didn't expect Qingshuo to have such a grand event.

Ninth Princess?

27
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,829
Let's go.

28
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,990
Have you found out anything about
the poisoned dart that killed my mother?

29
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,420
I've traced the dark iron
used to make the poisoned dart.

30
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,680
Give me a bit more time,

31
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,520
and I'll surely find the person in black who used it.

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,650
He survived both times I poisoned him.

33
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,870
What? He didn't die?

34
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,700
I think the poison wasn't strong enough.

35
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,160
Could it be that he has a powerful protector?

36
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,530
I'd better stay here to help you.

37
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,310
Otherwise, I'll be too worried.

38
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,120
I will carefully consider

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,850
my options for ways to kill him.

40
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,480
You continue to investigate the person in black
who used the poisoned dart.

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,110
Alright.

42
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,560
Why is He Lianxuan here?

43
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,180
Why are you here?

44
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,590
I'm here on behalf of my big brother to check

45
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,510
what my sister-in-law is up to outside the palace.

46
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,170
Why are you dressed like this?

47
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,200
Is it to meet He Lianxuan in secret?

48
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,910
He's just my secret guard.

49
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,020
Where did this country bumpkin come from?

50
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,910
How could a lowly person like you be allowed to
attend the Flower Shadow Festival?

51
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,020
Flower Shadow Festival?

52
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,340
You're so ignorant.

53
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,070
The Flower Shadow Festival is our day
to welcome the spring god for the coming year.

54
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,090
From this day on, people start to
look forward to the spring god.

55
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,110
Young men and women also begin to seek their partners.

56
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,840
This is the biggest annual event in our Qingshuo.

57
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,440
I see.

58
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,240
So, you're here to pick a man too, aren't you?

59
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,310
You...

60
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,190
How dare you!

61
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,950
No need to be shy.

62
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,110
In our Zizhou,

63
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,870
it's common for women to look for husbands.

64
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,070
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

65
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,310
I... You...

66
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,300
Empress Dowager, you cannot leave the palace without permission.

67
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,260
Please return with us immediately.

68
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,720
I'll just play for a while.

69
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,550
I'll go back soon.

Empress Dowager.

71
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,820
The lords of the four kingdoms have offered to our Qingshuo

72
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,830
four peerless beauties despite the long distances.

73
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,090
The first three have already performed.

74
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,580
Now, let's welcome the last beauty to the stage
to showcase her talents.

75
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,990
Everyone, please applaud.

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,790
Great!

77
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,670
It's your turn to go on stage.

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,160
What exactly do you want?

79
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,820
What did He Lianxuan tell you?

80
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,220
He told me…

81
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,960
to kill you.

82
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,890
Then try it.

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,580
Great.

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,540
Bravo.

85
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,230
Cunning and deceitful.

86
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,750
Miss, why are you leaving?

87
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,030
You still need to participate in
expressing feelings through writing.

88
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,270
No, I... I'm not...

89
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,510
The person across from you is your destined one.

90
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,900
Just write down your feelings on it, Miss.

91

92
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,810
