[Episode 23]

3
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,960
The Empress Dowager has been confined to the palace for a long time.

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,240
Her behavior was erratic, and she was attempting to escape.

5
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,960
Lock her in the Cold Palace under strict guard.

6
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,390
Don't let her see anyone.

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,630
Make sure she

8
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,740
dies within the palace walls.

9
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:04,910
Yes.

10
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,550
Let me go!

11
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,040
Let me go! Let me go!

12
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,510
Let me go!

13
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,120
Let me go!

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,760
Let me go!

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,620
Lock her in the Cold Palace under strict guard.

16
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,060
Don't let her see anyone.

17
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,110
Make sure she dies within the palace walls.

18
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:35,870
I suppose I'll never have another chance.

19
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,400
He Lianxuan.

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,009
It's snowing.

21
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,830
Nine!

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,950
Nine!

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,200
Nine, Nine!

24
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,430
Nine, where are you?

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,300
Second Prince.

26
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,720
Second Prince, His Highness the Crown Prince requests your presence.

27
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,360
Let her go!

28
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,660
Second Brother, you've finally arrived.

29
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,760
If you dare move,

30
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,590
she won't survive.

31
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,680
If you have any issues, come at me.

32
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,430
Don't hurt her.

33
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,070
Very well.

34
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,360
Then kneel and beg me.

35
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,960
Power truly is the best thing in this world.

36
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,760
Now, even you are kneeling and begging me,

37
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,630
but do you think

38
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,360
you still have the right to negotiate with me now?

39
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,550
You and her, only one of you can live today.

40
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,140
Kill her, and I'll spare your life.

41
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,750
Don't even think about it.

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,350
I just love this

43
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,450
defiant attitude of yours even in the face of death.

44
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,850
Bring him up!

45
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,600
You don't even care about your own life.

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,290
Do you not care about Father's either?

47
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,520
Father… What have you done to him?

48
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,420
Father, be good.

49
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,360
Your good son Mo Jin has come to see you.

50
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,210
But he'd rather save that woman

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,630
than care about you.

52
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,470
Mo Heng!

53
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,270
He's your father, too.

54
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,710
He gave you life as well!

55
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,030
How could you bear to do this?

56
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,030
I haven't had a father for a long time!

57
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,159
I am the true Son of Heaven of Qingshuo.

58
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,270
My life was given by Heaven!

59
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,540
If you die,

60
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,310
remember, it's your good son,

61
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,510
Mo Jin, who caused your death.

62
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,770
When you reach the underworld, go to him!

63
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,910
Do it.

64
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,250
Stop!

65
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,410
Kill her, and I'll spare your father's life.

66
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,270
You can all die.

67
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,030
I'm the one you hate.

68
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,670
Our grudge…

69
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,640
shouldn't involve others.

70
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,170
Let me exchange myself for Li Conghuan.

71
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,010
Release them.

72
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,350
Fine.

73
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,450
All of this started because of you.

74
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,940
You want to die? I'll grant your wish.

75
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,630
Untie her.

76
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,510
Beast!

77
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,390
Kill him,

78
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,020
and I'll let you all go.

79
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Nine.

80
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:31,960
Do it.

81
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,010
No.

82
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,950
Do it.

83
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,020
He told you to do it.

84
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Bring the arrows!

85
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,659
Do it!

86
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,710
No!

87
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,010
No…

88
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,550
You don't know how? Let me teach you.

89
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,400
No!

90
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,750
Go on.

91
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,430
Go on!

92
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,780
