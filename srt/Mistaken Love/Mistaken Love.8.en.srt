00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,530
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,020
Speaking of him,

4
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,030
he does look somewhat similar to Your Highness.

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,230
I'll need to take a closer look.

6
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,430
This shameless woman!

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,280
Empress Dowager, please don't be hasty.

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,610
She's now under the protection of His Highness.

9
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,860
If we want to get rid of her,

10
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,460
we must have solid evidence.

11
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,759
Your skill at turning on a dime

12
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,240
has really improved.

13
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,000
If you want to be alive,

14
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,229
you'll have to do what I say.

15
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,710
Don't think that I'll feel moved

16
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,640
just because you took a whip for me.

17
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,920
Let go.

18
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,540
You want to kill me so badly?

19
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,820
Yes.

20
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,900
I want to kill you with my own hands every day I live.

21
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,810
What are you doing?

22
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,510
Don't you want to kill me?

23
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,310
I'll give you a chance to kill me.

24
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,810
Don't move.

25
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,810
This is my rule.

26
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,450
Well.

27
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,320
How can I kill you like this?

28
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,820
I'm within one meter of you.

29
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,020
Whether you can take my life

30
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,910
depends on what you got.

31
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,460
Nine.

32
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,510
If I die,

33
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,550
will you really be happy?

34
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,480
Come on, try again.

35
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,850
Your Highness!

36
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,290
Your Highness.

37
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,390
The wounds incurred by His Majesty's punishment haven't healed yet.

38
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,630
You were trying to protect her

39
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,230
from being buried alive...

40
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,690
Shut up!

41
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,990
It's time for His Highness to apply medicine.

42
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,710
I have other matters to attend to.

43
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,909
Princess should do it for His Highness.

44
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,670
It has nothing to do with you.

45
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,740
I made a mistake.

46
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,110
So, Father punished me for it.

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,310
I don't want

48
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,640
to experience the pain

49
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,350
of losing another child.

50
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,780
Otherwise, I would have beaten you to death today!

51
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,270
Thank you for your punishment, Father.

52
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,620
Li Conghuan...

53
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,730
Do you really want to make her your Princess?

54
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,330
Yes.

55
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,110
Heng is dead.

56
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,590
The investigation of the remnants of the previous dynasty's assassins

57
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,250
is now entirely in your hands.

58
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,150
But that woman...

59
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,790
Father,

60
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,570
I have already accepted my punishment.

61
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,570
You can't go back on your word.

62
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,080
♫Even if you stand on the snowy peak alone♫

63
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,320

♫All that happened in my life can be recorded♫

73
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,750

You...

81
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,240
Don't talk while I'm applying the medicine.

82
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,590
♫Life is like a lonely boat♫

Nine.

109
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,950
I got this Longevity Lock from the Nanshan Temple for our child.

110
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,490
It's said it can keep the child from diseases and disasters

111
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,890
and serve as a blessing for him to live long.

112
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,390
A Longevity Lock secures a long life.

113
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,020
How about we name our child Changsheng?

114
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Changsheng.

115
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,400
Changsheng.

116
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,310
Mom and Dad

117
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,110
are expecting you to grow up healthy.

118
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,330
Why?

119
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,830
Why would I still...

120
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,760
You still care about me,

121
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,820
don't you?

122
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,490
Could I be wrong?

123
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,460
Could he still have feelings for me?

124
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,190
Then why did he...

125
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,610
Li Conghuan, wake up.

126
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,980
Your Jin

127
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,380
has long gone.

128
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,550
The man you face now is Mo Jin,

129
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,930
