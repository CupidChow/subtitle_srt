[Mistaken Love]

2
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,570
[Episode 3]

3
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,830
Wait outside.

4
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,670
No one is allowed to enter

5
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,000
without my permission.

6
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,350
Yes.

7
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,009
Nine.

8
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,930
Do you really want to kill me that much?

9
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,640
Yes, I do.

10
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,350
I wish I could cut you into a thousand pieces,

11
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,430
drain every drop of your blood,

12
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,430
and make you die in agony.

13
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,190
Only then would I feel satisfied.

14
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,990
Mo Jin,

15
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,850
I let you die so easily.

16
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,020
You really got off easy.

17
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,460
I knew you were faking it.

18
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,890
Are you disappointed that I'm not dead, Sister-in-law?

19
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,289
You...

20
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,430
Let go of me.

21
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,430
Let go!

22
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,090
What are you doing?

23
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,970
Daring to assassinate a prince,

24
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,300
even the Crown Prince couldn’t protect your life.

25
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,700
Assassinating a prince?

26
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,550
What evidence do you have?

27
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,090
The Department of Justice may need evidence to arrest people,

28
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,420
but for me, Mo Jin, to capture an assassin,

29
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,840
I only need to execute them on the spot.

30
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,370
Do you really want to kill me so badly?

31
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,940
Just for the Crown Princess' position?

32
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Killing you would be so satisfying.

34
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,930
Mo Heng is the true heir.

35
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,670
Once he becomes the emperor of Qingshuo,

36
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,530
I will be the empress of Qingshuo.

37
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,100
Then, the world will belong to the two of us.

38
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,510
What are you doing?

39
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,270
I am your sister-in-law.

40
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,280
No matter how powerful you are,

41
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,490
without evidence,

42
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,810
I'd like to see how you explain this to your big brother.

43
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,840
My big brother has always been more pragmatic than you.

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,010
Whatever I want, he gives it to me willingly.

45
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,430
After all,

46
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,850
his virtuous reputation

47
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,680
is mostly thanks to me.

48
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,360
Your Highness.

49
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,820
How is the Second Prince's condition?

50
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,010
Tell me.

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,950
-I'll go in first.
-Your Highness.

52
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,810
You can't go in.

53
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,300
What? Are you scared now?

54
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,830
Of course you're not scared.

55
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,710
After all, you're not the one struggling to survive under someone else's roof.

56
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,790
That's true.

57
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,329
You're bathing with another man on the second day of your marriage.

58
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,620
Anyone who sees this

59
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,630
would think you’re unfit

60
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,010
to be the Crown Princess.

61
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,350
Why?

62
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,040
The Crown Princess has ordered

63
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,770
that no one is allowed to enter.

64
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,910
Conghuan is inside?

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,659
Now is not the time to confront him directly.

66
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,909
I need to get out of here quickly.

67
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,420
Mo Jin, it hurts.

68
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,620
What are you doing?

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,590
Your tricks won’t fool me every time.

70
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,270
Conghuan.

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,000
Your Highness, you can't go in.

72
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,640
Your dear husband has arrived.

73
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,860
How can you leave now?

74
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,080
Conghuan.

75
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,880
Conghuan.

76
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,250
Heng.

77
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,640
Why are you in the medicinal pool?

78
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,750
I caught a cold yesterday.

79
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,670
Then I heard the medicinal bath here has miraculous effects,

80
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,190
so I came to give it a try.

81
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,130
Is it serious?

82
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,350
Do you need me to find an imperial physician to take a look?

83
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,230
No need.

84
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,590
I just soaked for a while,

85
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,220
and I feel much better already.

86
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,350
It's not necessary.

87
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,970
That's good then.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,710
However, the weather has been chilly lately.

89
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,400
You'll get sick

90
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,540
wearing wet clothes like this.

91
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,310
Let me help you out first.

92
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,870
No.

93
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,570
It's fine.

94
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,240
Heng,

95
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,030
I feel comfortable in here.

96
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,110
Next time, we should come together.

97
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,180
Conghuan,

98
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,660
you’d want to bathe with me?

99
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,270
I...

100
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,310
I was so rash and rude.

101
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,990
I'll leave this cloak to you.

102
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,420
Put it on when you come out.

103
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,480
Don't catch a cold.

104
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,690
I'll wait for you outside.

105
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,480
Okay.

106
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,350
Are you satisfied now?

107
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,220
Brother-in-law, have you finished watching the show?

108
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,460
Can you let me go now?

109
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,830
Such a pitiful face.

110
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,440
Has he ever been this close to you?

111
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,430
Has he been intimate with you?

112
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,520
Would you like to hear about

113
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,200
what we've done in our bed?

114
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
I can tell you.

115
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,820
Without my permission,

116
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,510
you're not allowed to leave.

117
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,740
My husband,

118
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,550
who is your big brother, is waiting for me outside.

119
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,040
Why can't I leave?

120
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,560
You are mine.

121
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,909
You can only be mine forever.

122
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,060
You're delusional.

123
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,120
Don't.

124
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,070
Mo Jin!

125
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,280
You can't.

126
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,240
What's wrong?

127
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,950
Which part of you haven't I touched?

128
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,710
I've told you before,

129
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,750
that as long as you're with me,

130
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,710
you can only look at me.

131
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,520
You're ridiculous.

132
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,800
You still have feelings for someone who wanted to kill you.

133
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,809
Conghuan.

134
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,539
Are you feeling better?

135
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,570
Perhaps I soaked for too long.

136
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,470
I'll be fine after some rest at home.

137
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,830
Alright, let's go home.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,470
Where are you two heading?

139
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,090
Second Brother,

140
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,720
I was just looking for you.

141
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,940
Father said you were unwell.

142
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,200
How is your condition?

143
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,470
I'm not sick.

144
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,020
I was poisoned.

145
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,870
Poisoned?

146
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,150
Would you be willing to help me catch the person who poisoned me?

147
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,060
Of course.

148
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,520
Such a villain mustn't be let off.

149
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,590
However, it's too late today.

150
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,250
Let's discuss it another day.

151
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,210
I noticed your figure

152
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,770
is somewhat similar to that of the poisoner.

153
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,480
Second Brother, let her go.

154
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,830
Big Brother, are you going to cover for the poisoner?

155
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,120
Mo Jin.

156
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,620
Conghuan has no grudge against you.

157
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,480
If you have any issues, come at me.

158
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,010
I was just saying.

159
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,420
What are you two afraid of?

160
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,850
Conghuan, let's go.

161
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,800
Sir.

162
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,220
I didn't harbor any remnants of the former dynasty's assassins.

163
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,650
I...

164
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,240
I truly know nothing.

165
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,910
Bleed him.

166
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,430
[Mo Jin's guard, Huo Xin]

167
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,200
I'll stop bleeding you

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,930
only when you tell me the truth.

169
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,020
Even if you don't confess today,

170
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
the Crown Prince, as your superior,

171
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,530
won't get away with it.

172
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,100
Huo Xin,

173
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,260
go on.

174
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,550
Have you heard?

175
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,280
As soon as the Second Prince fell ill,

176
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,480
the Crown Princess rushed to the Imperial Hospital

177
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,280
and dismissed all the servants.

178
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,800
What do you think they might be up to?

179
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,940
The Crown Princess and the Second Prince?

180
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,780
And I've also heard

181
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,510
that on the day of the royal wedding,

182
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,110
the Crown Princess wasn't even in the bridal chamber.

183
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,170
How dare you lowly maids gossip about the royal family!

184
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,170
Please forgive us, Madam!

185
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,230
Have mercy, Madam!

186
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,850
I want to see

187
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,370
[Empress Dowager of Qingshuo, Yun Qian]

188
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,800
what kind of woman dares to ruin Brother Jin's reputation.
