[Mistaken Love]

2
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,540
[Episode 24]

3
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,000
The Crown Prince, Mo Heng,

4
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,610
diligently works day and night,
with keen thoughts for peace and stability.

5
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,940
His Royal Highness humbly accepts
the mandate and the responsibility.

6
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,230
Attentively listening to the last will of the late Emperor

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,300
and solemnly bearing the weight of succession,

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,400
His Royal Highness respectfully follows the imperial decree,

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,720
and informs the world,
on the twenty-fourth day of the second month,

10
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,870
that he's to ascend to the throne as Emperor.

11
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,510
My dear Big Brother.

12
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,330
You're not dead?

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,430
Besides teaching you
how to kill an enemy with one shot,

14
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,190
I also need to teach you
how to miss the heart by an inch,

15
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,030
making it appear as if the target is dead.

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,700
But I've already learned how to
shoot arrows to kill enemies.

17
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,430
Why do I need to learn this, too?

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,479
Haven't you always been reluctant to kill?

19
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,880
If you shoot this spot,

20
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,100
you can spare a life.

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,660
Come on, aim.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
Look again: Who is that?

23
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,950
Comfortable.

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,920
Father.

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,960
Father.

26
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,060
Father.

27
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,320
Here.

28
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,670
Father, here.

29
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,700
Last time at the execution ground,

30
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,240
I noticed Father's abnormality.

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,000
This pill is made with special spices from Zizhou.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,620
It can calm the mind and restore consciousness.

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,460
Father.

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,890
Jin.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,670
Father.

36
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,190
Mo Heng has rebelled.

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,920
I shouldn't have been soft-hearted and spared him back then.

38
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,110
I didn't discipline you properly before,

39
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,980
which led to this conflict between brothers.

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,070
Father.

41
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,340
How could you...

42
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,540
Don't call me Father.

43
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,650
You poisoned me.

44
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,670
I shouldn't have kept you, an illegitimate child!

45
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,270
You finally admit I'm not your biological son.

46
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,210
All my life,

47
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,070
I've tried so hard to please you, but what about you?

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,990
You wouldn't even look at me.

49
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,150
Since you didn't love me,

50
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,590
why didn't you just let me go?

51
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,390
You made me Crown Prince

52
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,250
just to make me the target.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,040
You never intended to pass the throne to me.

54
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,430
Your mother shamelessly gave birth to you.

55
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,650
It's me who spared your life.

56
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,590
I thought you'd be grateful.

57
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,510
I never expected you to ally with the four kingdoms

58
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,829
to covet my throne.

59
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,230
Big Brother.

60
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,720
Do you know this person?

61
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,010
I don't know him.

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,350
The evidence that you hid the remnants of the previous dynasty

63
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,089
and of your conspiracy with the four kingdoms to rebel

64
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,820
has all been intercepted by us.

65
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,680
The evidence is irrefutable.

66
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,800
Do you still want to deny it?

67
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,950
Impossible.

68
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,530
Ever since you failed to capture the remnants of the previous dynasty's death warriors,

69
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,260
I've been hoping that one day you would turn back.

70
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,020
Should we recall the guards who are investigating
the remnants of the death warriors?

71
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,630
No need.

72
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,270
We must not miss any clue.

73
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,830
You mean, once Mo Heng was dead,

74
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,280
the traces of the remnant death warrior disappeared, too?

75
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,790
You must investigate this matter thoroughly.

76
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,590
Don't reveal any information during the process.

77
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,590
But you remained obstinate.

78
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,100
Father and I had no choice but to set up a trap,

79
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,730
pretending to strip me of my military power

80
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,730
to lure you in.

81
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,760
You rebellious son, how dare you defy me!

82
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,500
I will strip you of your military power!

83
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,790
You thought

84
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,320
you could rest easy after allying with the four monarchs?

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,490
Unfortunately,

86
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,300
in the face of self-interest,

87
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,370
allies are unreliable.

88
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,440
I don't believe it.

89
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,390
I've sacrificed so many years for this day.

90
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,290
That throne should be mine.

91
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,470
No one can stop me.

92
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,550
Guards!

93
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,570
Guards!

94
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,580
The Crown Prince's remaining death warriors have all been eliminated.

95
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,080
Your Highness,

96
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,440
I've come to beg for punishment.

97
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,280
Considering your eagerness to save your mother,

98
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
let your merits offset your crimes.

99
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,990
Even you betrayed me.

100
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,820
Your Highness, watch out!

101
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,260
You've destroyed everything I had.

102
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:47,409
I said I would avenge my mother and child.

103
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,270
Blood for blood.

104
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,430
We're even now.

105
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,240
Why?

106
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,549
I hope one day she can leave that cage

107
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,909
and be free from then on.

108
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Empress Dowager.

109
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,950
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

110
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,010
The Empress Dowager has passed away!

111
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,580
Changsheng,

112
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,010
Father and Mother have finally avenged you.

113
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,440
In your next life, find an ordinary family and grow up peacefully.

114
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,870
Don't be reborn into a royal family again.

115
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,300
Are children of royal families

116
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,050
destined to have no freedom?

117
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,940
Must they always covet power, like beasts

118
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,470
chasing prey?

119
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,360
Caged beasts have never seen the sky outside.

120
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,430
They can only see

121
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,850
the golden, glorious cage in front of them.

122
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,110
Fortunately, we've both seen the world outside.

123
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,090
Nine,

124
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,670
currently, Father is still unable to govern.

125
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,710
-I may…
-I know.

126
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,070
I'll wait for you to stabilize the court.

127
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,180
Nine.

128
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,330
Jin,

129
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,860
By the time you read this letter,

130
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,350
I will have already set out to return to the bamboo house.

131
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,090
The Qingshuo rebellion has just been quelled.

132
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,370
The people need you.

133
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,480
They need a stable life.

134
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,460

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,190
♫The lights shine as desired, and we cherish our time together♫

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,770
♫The thrill of infatuation remains unspoken♫

[Mistaken Love] [The End]
