00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,130
Nine, you can't go.

188
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,380
You can't go.

189
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,200
Child...

190
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,430
You'll be killed if you go out.

191
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,200
Our child was...

192
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,110
Listen to me, Nine.

193
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,030
They killed our child.

194
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,670
Nine, you can't go out.

195
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm gonna kill them.

196
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,950
Listen to me first.

197
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,040
Listen to me first.

198
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,100
Our survival is the most important thing right now.

199
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,990
I won't let them off for what they did to our child.

200
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,060
Who is it?

201
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,290
Let's go!

202
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,100
Hurry, after them!

203
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,870
Hurry, after them! Hurry!
