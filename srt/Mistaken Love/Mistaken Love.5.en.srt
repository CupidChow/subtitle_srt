00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,560
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,430
Heng.

4
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,980
Thank you.

5
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,180
We are husband and wife.

6
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,910
No need to thank me.

7
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,900
I do need to thank you.

8
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,460
You can hear now?

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,470
I can hear a little bit.

10
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,420
Then, if I say something,

11
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,670
can you repeat it?

12
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,539
Repeat it?

13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,180
I'll try.

14
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:43,310
I will always be by your side.

15
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,259
By my side.

16
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,110
Conghuan.

17
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,820
I wish I had met you earlier.

18
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,640
The medicine is ready.

19
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,430
Here.

20
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,100
Be careful, it's hot.

21
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,500
Be careful, it's hot.

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,220
What are you afraid of?

23
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,680
It's not like we're the ones getting burned.

24
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,390
Since when did the Imperial Prison allow extrajudicial punishments?

25
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,829
Your Highness, we were also forced into this.

26
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,690
Your Highness,

27
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,060
please don't blame us.

28
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,320
What are you afraid of?

29
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,890
Once he's in here, it's out of his control.

30
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,550
Besides, we have the Crown...

31
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,480
We have someone backing us up.

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,740
What are you afraid of?

33
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,020
Conghuan.

34
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,870
Why are you out of bed?

35
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,260
It's fine, I'm feeling much better now.

36
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,790
I told you you'd get better.

37
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,740
It's all thanks to your care.

38
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,140
I had the kitchen make some special snacks for you.

39
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,180
Dig in.

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,030
I'll go back to work.

41
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,980
Rest well.

42
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,820
Alright.

43
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,620
You two.

44
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,579
Crown Princess.

45
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,780
Thank you for your hard work.

46
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,160
Here, buy some wine to drink.

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,420
Thank you, Crown Princess.

48
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,980
Let's go.

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
Crown Princess.

50
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,100
I...

51
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,420
I'll take my leave now.

52
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,820
Even though things have come to this,

53
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,260
you are still as reckless as ever.

54
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,900
It seems your ears have recovered quite well, Sister-in-law.

55
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,700
Did you come here just to mock me?

56
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,220
I'm not that bored.

57
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,890
I just came to check on you on behalf of my husband.

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,960
Your favorite lily pastries.

59
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,520
My wet nurse taught me how to make these when I was young.

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,540
Do you want to learn how to make them?

61
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,140
I can teach you if you'd like.

62
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,620
Haven't you heard that in Zizhou,

63
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,880
women should stay away from the kitchen?

64
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,860
Fine,

65
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,660
I'll cook, and you eat. How about that?

66
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,460
Mm.

67
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,830
Here, have a taste.

68
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,870
Mm.

69
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,440
How is it?

70
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,340
It's delicious.

71
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,260
Mm.

72
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,140
It's a bit sweet, huh?

73
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,880
You never wanted to learn before.

74
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,970
It's not even the season for lilies right now.

75
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,110
But you went out of your way to find them to make these pastries.

76
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,620
You were sure

77
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,240
I would eat them, weren't you?

78
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,300
Back then, you had already accepted

79
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
the marriage proposal from Mo Heng,

80
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,600
yet you still got intimate with me.

81
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,350
Nine.

82
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,410
What?

83
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,470
Are you afraid I might have poisoned it?

84
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,340
Are you reassured now?

85
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,860
My husband had all this prepared for you.

86
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,620
He's just

87
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,020
too soft-hearted.

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,650
Husband?

89
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,460
Do you really think you know Mo Heng?

90
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,480
If he's a pushover who never fights for anything,

91
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,950
how could he keep his position as the Crown Prince?

92
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,550
Huh?

93
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,440
Of course I know him.

94
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,280
He's a thousand times, ten thousand times better than you.

95
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Li Conghuan.

96
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,270
Mo Jin.

97
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,670
The biggest regret of my life

98
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,310
is knowing you.

99
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,100
Every time I think about how you touched me,

100
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,610
I feel utterly disgusted with myself.

101
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,140
You're just a madman.

102
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Look at yourself now.

103
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,150
There are countless good men in Zizhou.

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,130
Even a beggar on the street is better than you.

105
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,020
You're right.

106
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,340
I am indeed a madman.

107
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,150
Mo Jin,

108
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,770
you lost.

109
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,840
The lily pastries were just a smokescreen.

110
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,920
The real poison...

111
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,760
My mother taught me from a young age to eat all kinds of herbs

112
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,230
and recognize every poison.

113
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,610
She said that wild Jack-in-the-pulpit is an excellent tonic,

114
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,740
but when mixed with cinnabar, it turns into a deadly poison.

115
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,140
The poisoned person will bleed from all seven orifices and die within moments.

116
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,140
But if I take this antidote,

117
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,060
I'll be fine.

118
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,280
Mo Jin,

119
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,720
let me send you on your way.

120
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,730
You're shameless.

121
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,830
Sister-in-law,

122
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,150
it's too late to talk about virtue and morals now,

123
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,940
isn't it?

124
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,200
Let go of me.

125
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,100
Mo Jin,

126
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,920
farewell.
