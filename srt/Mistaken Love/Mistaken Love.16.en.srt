[Episode 16]

3
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,700
Jin.

4
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,140
Nine.

5
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:05,780
Jin!

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,200
Jin!

8
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,570
What are you doing?

9
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,830
Let me out!

10
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,710
Jin, let me out!

11
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,750
Take him!

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,880
Jin!

13
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,310
I beg you!

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,010
Jin!

15
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,890
Jin!

16
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,750
Jin!

17
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,360
Jin.

18
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,479
Mo Jin.

19
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,110
The once dignified Second Prince

20
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,050
has now lost all his internal martial energy,

21
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,580
being humiliated like a dog at others' mercy.

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,880
What a shame.

23
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,690
Tell me!

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,079
Who exactly wanted to kill my mother and child?

25
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,810
Why did you do that?

26
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,860
Tell me!

27
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,090
Wake up!

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,450
You can't die.

29
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
You can't die!

30
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,360
Don't die!

31
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,610
Tell me!

32
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,930
Nine.

33
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,310
He's already dead.

34
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,320
He's already dead.

35
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,180
Nine.

36
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,750
He's dead. Jin.

37
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,590
You've avenged our child.

38
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,570
You've taken revenge.

39
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,980
You've avenged our child.

40
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,790
Your hand...

41
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,170
It's nothing.

42
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,329
If these hands can't protect you,

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,650
then what use are they to me?

44
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,200
I keep thinking...

45
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,990
if I hadn't left that day...

46
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,970
our child wouldn't have died...

47
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,160
and we wouldn't have been separated.

48
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,170
Leaving you

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,790
has become the biggest regret of my life.

50
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,670
It's not your fault.

51
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,780
But I'm really scared,

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,830
Nine.

53
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,480
You're here now, aren't you?

54
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,730
But this man is dead.

55
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,070
We still haven't caught the mastermind behind it all.

56
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,090
He won't escape us.

57
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,480
Nine.

58
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,510
Master,

59
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,659
we have failed the task

60
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,790
and let them escape.

61
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,570
Take them.

62
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,530
That's enough, Yun Qian.

63
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,990
Not enough, not enough.

64
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,410
Isn't it fun?

65
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:19,940
It's fun.

66
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,110
So much fun.

67
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,020
He Lianxuan.

68
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,670
Well, these fruits...

69
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,000
Empress Dowager,

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you should return to the palace now.

71
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,580
Does it hurt?

72
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,990
It's just a minor wound; nothing to worry about.

73
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,400
But you've been wounded in the chest.

74
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,540
I'm afraid it might affect your blood circulation and vital energy.

75
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,880
Let me find an imperial physician to take a look at you.

76
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,480
No need.

77
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,490
I'm fine.

78
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,650
♫The bell rings like questions♫

79
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,870
♫The past is like a dream, sword dance under pear blossoms♫

80
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,980
♫Black hair turned white, yet cannot be severed♫

81
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,970
Why are you so silly?

82
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,720
It's all in the past.

83
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,900
♫Bound by fate, even to death♫

84
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,080
And I was the one who failed to protect you.

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,280
♫Entangled in promises and vows♫

86
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,400
Consider these blows

87
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
as payment for what I owe you.

88
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,160
♫We see each other every year♫

89
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,620
♫You're right in front of me; my heart is broken♫

90
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,360
♫Love is hard to say, the hidden hatred♫

91
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,790
Nine.

92
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,210
♫Is it love or resentment from past lives?♫

93
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,159
We'll never be apart again.

95
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,480
♫The red blood stained the white snow♫

96
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,010
♫If love has turned into a sharp arrow♫

97
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,770
Never be apart again.

98
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,000
♫It will pierce the heart's desire♫

99
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,300
♫The wind and snow rage and swirl♫

100
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,560
♫Entangling to redden the eyes♫

101
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,780
♫It fell between the eyebrows like fate♫

102
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,810
♫The destined cycle♫

103
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,510
♫Gazes across the expanse of time♫

104
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,080
♫Love and hate travel through the years♫

105
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,800
♫The lights shine as desired, and we cherish our time together♫

106
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,380
♫The thrill of infatuation remains unspoken♫

107
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,980
Help! The Crown Prince...

108
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,420
The Crown Prince has risen from the dead!

109
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,660
Help!

110
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,610
Your Highness!

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,730
Something terrible has happened!

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
What's wrong?

113
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,430
It's the Crown Prince.

114
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,430
He's back.
