[Mistaken Love]

2
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,570
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,340
Why did you bring me here?

4
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,050
Do you remember the archery technique I taught you?

5
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,170
All right.

6
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,170
It's your turn.

7
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,690
You were close to killing it.

8
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,560
Why haven't you mastered the technique yet?

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,890
I don't want to master such deadly skills.

10
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,500
But this archery technique

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,700
can save your life at critical moments.

12
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,410
I just need to wound the opponent to get a chance to escape.

13
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,410
I don't need to take someone's life.

14
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,740
All right.

15
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,860
It's up to you.

16
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,930
Anyway, in this lifetime,

17
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,090
I'll protect you.

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,550
This lifetime...

19
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,930
I later realized

20
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,430
one's lifetime is so long.

21
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,150
No one can truly protect another forever.

22
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,539
Don't even think about dodging it.

23
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,180
Today,

24
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,229
you'll have to master it.

25
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,729
The bow should be close to the arrow.

26
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,030
The arrow should be close to the string.

27
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,730
The string should be close to the face.

28
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,540
These are called Three Closenesses.

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,740
Keep yourself aligned with the target.

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,240
Keep your shoulders aligned.

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,570
Keep your arms aligned.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,030
Keep your feet aligned.

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,630
Stay mentally aligned.

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,300
These are called Five Alignments.

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,470
When facing an enemy,

36
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,930
you only have one chance to get a lethal shot.

37
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,060
So,

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
you must aim precisely at his heart.

39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,630
Again.

40
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,220
Start over.

41
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,690
You're not allowed to leave until you master it.

42
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,550
How could you be so unreasonable?

43
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,820
How can anyone master it in just one day?

44
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,300
But I only have one day left.

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,530
Miss,

46
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,830
you're a fast learner.

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,790
You're the first one to hit the target today.

48
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,850
This is your prize.

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,510
Thank you.

50
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,510
This is a special osmanthus sachet from Zizhou.

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,470
Since I came to Qingshuo,

52
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,000
I've never smelled this kind of aroma before.

53
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,550
Nine,

54
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,430
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,400
I can't protect you anymore in this lifetime.

56
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,300
From now on, you're on your own.

57
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,310
They say the gods will help you realize your wishes

58
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,900
that are made while you're setting off sky lanterns.

59
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,300
So, what did you wish for?

60
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm not telling you.

61
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,540
What did you wish for?

62
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,420
I hope I can take your life soon.

63
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,890
Then I have to live a long life.

64
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,460
I won't let your wish come true.

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,440
Nine.

66
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,140
If...

67
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,660
I mean, if one day I die,

68
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,350
will you cry for me?

69
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,409
If one day you die,

70
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,110
I'll definitely applaud and cheer.

71
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,510
What did you wish for?

72
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,180
Don't just stand there.

73
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,050
Let's go.

74
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,890
It's raining. I'll go find an umbrella.

75
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,800
Wait for me.

76
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,030
The dead are free from all worries,

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,210
while the living are burdened with countless concerns.

78
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,390
Who are you?

79
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,550
I'm just

80
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,300
a commoner,

81
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,630
not as noble as you.

82
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,590
But you

83
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,790
will be nothing but a handful of dirt

84
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,420
in two more hours.

85

[Heart's Blood of Medicine Maid]

86
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,910
Medicine Maid?

87
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,390
Medicine Maid was born with a unique constitution.

88
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,870
She has tasted hundreds of herbs since childhood.

89
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,940
Her blood can be used against poison.

90
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,910
Incorporating her heart's blood

91
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,280
into your medicine as a medicinal material

92
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,120
can detoxify you.

93
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,520
If I take her heart's blood,

94
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,150
can she survive?

95
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,830
Life and death are unpredictable.

96
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,240
It's all up to fate.

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,300
This is the only way for you to survive.

98
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,430
She

99
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,630
is just close at hand.

100
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:49,940
Whether you can survive is in your hands.

101
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,050
What's wrong?

102
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,710
Nothing.

103
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,840
Where did that old man go?

104
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,510
What old man?

105
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,200
Let's go.

106
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
It stops raining.

107
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,280
The world is so quiet.

108
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,150
I've never seen what it's like outside the Qingshuo Palace.

109
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,540
Mo Jin.

110
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,030
We haven't had a good conversation.

111
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,090
You promised me

112
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,909
you'd tell me everything today.

113
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,110
I'm looking forward to it, yet I'm a bit afraid.

114
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,430
I'm afraid my expectations will be let down.

115
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,630
But I...

116
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,890
Still want to believe you.

117
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,760
Mo Jin.

118
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,250
Mo Jin!

119
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,050
Mo Jin!

120
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,080
You survived?

121
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,720
Sounds like you're quite disappointed

122
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,980
at the fact that I'm not dead.

123
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,270
But you

124
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,470
will be nothing but a handful of dirt

125
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,010
in two more hours.

126
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,360
You're not allowed to leave until you master it.

127
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,220
How could you be so unreasonable?

128
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,640
How can anyone master it in just one day?

129
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,200
I mean, if one day I die,

130
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,050
will you cry for me?

131
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,940
Liar.

132
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,230
Your life belongs to me.

133
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,490
Without my permission,

134
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,420
you can't die.

135
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,250
Li Conghuan,

136
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,060
since I met you,

137
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,910
nothing positive has come my way.

138
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,910
l want you to stop pestering me.

139
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,230
You should leave.

140
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,640
Do you really want me to leave?

141
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,600
Do you?

142
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,140
Then why did you want me to spend this day with you?

143
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,090
Why did you go to great lengths to arrange all this?

144
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,710
Didn't you arrange all those people?

145
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,910
You're just being overly sentimental.

146
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,950
I've never seen someone as stupid as you.

147
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,120
You have been fooled by others over and over,

148
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,400
yet you're still willing to trust others.

149
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,750
Do you know

150
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,780
why I keep you by my side?

151
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,840
Just to toy with you.

152
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,820
Then why did you take the whip for me?

153
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,510
Why did you save me so many times?

154
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,010
Why do you care so much about the Longevity Lock?

155
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,280
It was all just an act.

156
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,520
You don't really think I still have feelings for you, do you?

157
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,910
Get lost.

158
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,350
Mo Jin.

159
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,720
Look into my eyes.

160

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,020
