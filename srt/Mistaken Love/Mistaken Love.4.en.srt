00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,880
[Mistaken Love]

2
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,540
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,590
You've finally arrived.

4
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,520
You know who I am?

5
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,670
I do now.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,350
Who are you exactly?

7
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,790
If you make me late for greeting the Empress Dowager,

8
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,870
you can't afford to bear the consequences.

9
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,530
Let go of me.

10
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,070
What are you doing?

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,630
How dare you be disrespectful to me?

12
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,390
You were disrespectful to me first.

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,150
Insolent!

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,450
Do you know who I am?

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,670
I hold the highest position in the entire harem.

16
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,070
Kneel down immediately!

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,480
-My Qingshuo's Crown Princess
-What are you doing?

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,310
has no manners.

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,260
-Let go of me!
-Teach her a lesson for me!

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,650
Stop!

21
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,270
Jin...

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,140
Second Prince.

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,380
Empress Dowager,

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,850
what is the meaning of this?

25
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,410
The Crown Princess has offended me.

26
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,210
Of course, she needs to be properly disciplined.

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,410
Empress Dowager, please don't get upset over this woman.

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,520
I've found the rabbit lantern

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,170
you were looking for earlier.

30
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,229
Do you have time to take a look, Empress Dowager?

31
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,490
Oh, that's wonderful.

32
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,950
Second Prince, you're so good to me.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,700
The Second Prince truly cares about you.

34
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,120
His body hasn't fully recovered,

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,410
yet he spent the whole afternoon helping you choose lanterns.

36
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,040
Yes, no matter how much I begged him before,

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,950
he wouldn't do it.

38
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,880
But today, he finally came around.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,320
What are you doing?

40
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,130
Stop!

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,380
He did it for her.

42
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,060
Let go of me.

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,200
What are you doing?

44
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,920
Crown Princess, since you come from an uncivilized land,

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,810
it's understandable that you don't know the rules of Qingshuo.

46
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,350
But now that you're in Qingshuo,

47
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,920
you must abide by the palace rules here.

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,200
I, the Empress Dowager, will personally teach you today,

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,520
so you won't act rashly

50
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,440
and lose your composure again.

51
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,180
You call me "Crown Princess,"

52
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,950
yet why do you use private punishment on me?

53
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,600
Is this the rule of Qingshuo?

54
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,050
I'm the Empress Dowager;

55
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,760
my rules are the rules of Qingshuo.

56
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,420
Naturally, I can discipline whomever I please.

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,800
Guards!

58
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,690
Tie her up!

59
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,810
What are you doing?

60
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,050
Crown Princess, you must learn these important matters by heart.

61
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,900
I will recite a rule,

62
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,860
and you will repeat it.

63
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,250
If you miss a single word,

64
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,010
the bells will chime once more.

65
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,260
Do you understand?

66
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,480
I don't understand.

67
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,870
For all women,

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,290
first, learn how to conduct themselves.

69
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,620
The way to conduct oneself

70
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,350
lies solely in maintaining purity and chastity.

71
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,390
Hit them.

72
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,170
Hit them again!

73
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,730
Crown Princess, if you still refuse to recite it,

74
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,780
these bells will keep ringing,

75
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,730
and your ears will be ruined.

76
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,310
The timbre of this pair of ornate bells,

77
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,400
a tribute from the Southern Region,

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,110
is indeed more pleasant than the chime bells in His Majesty's palace.

79
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,460
Crown Princess, it seems you  didn't hear me clearly.

80
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,430
I will repeat it once more.

81
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,840
For all women

82
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,390
first, learn how to conduct themselves.

83
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,850
The way to conduct oneself

84
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,470
lies solely in maintaining purity and chastity.

85
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,270
Hit them.

86
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,930
Hit them again!

87
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,800
Hit them again!

88
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,580
Hit!

89
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,970
For all women...

90
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,360
As princes,

91
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,370
one of you fails to maintain discipline in his inner court,

92
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,720
[Emperor of Qingshuo]

93
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,870
while the other acts without discretion,

94
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,870
causing all these rumors to spread.

95
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,170
Do you care about our dignity at all?

96
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,010
Father, please calm your anger.

97
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,470
It's all just rumors spread by petty people.

98
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,790
This is the woman you want to marry.

99
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,170
Bringing shame to our royal family.

100
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,010
I guarantee, Father,

101
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,750
that this is not Conghuan's fault.

102
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,470
Fine.

103
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,110
Then it's your fault.

104
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,580
Guards!

105
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,690
Take the Second Prince to the imperial prison.

106
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,220
Confine him for five days and give him lashes.

107
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,180
There's no need.

108
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,210
I'll go by myself.

109
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,580
You can't capture the remnants of the assassins for the court,

110
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,790
and you can't even control the woman in your own palace.

111
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,190
What use are you as Crown Prince?

112
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,700
Father, please calm down.

113
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,730
Those remnants of the assassins are really...

114
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,909
You couldn't catch them,

115
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,510
but Mo Jin captured them for you long ago.

116
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:56,970
Father...

117
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,990
If you dare to disobey again,

118
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,470
you will no longer be the Crown Prince.

119
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,990
I wouldn't dare, Father.

120
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,110
Hit.

121
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,440
Your Highness,

122
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,690
are you really going to receive the lashes?

123
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,570
The Crown Princess has caused quite a bit of trouble.

124
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,070
Fortunately, the Empress Dowager is punishing her

125
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,990
to avenge you.

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,500
The Empress Dowager summoned the Crown Princess to the Jingsi Chamber.

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,190
Well...

128
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,730
Your Highness!

129
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,310
Hit.

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,920
Hit!

131
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,180
Crown Princess, you can't go on like this.

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,620
Keep ringing.

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,540
Stop it, all of you!

134
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,110
Who gave you the audacity?

135
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,590
How come I didn't know this is how rules are taught in the palace?

136
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,110
Jin...

137
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,510
What brings you here, Second Prince?

138
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,470
Conghuan.

139
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,510
Empress Dowager,

140
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,570
you allow servants to bully their master.

141
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,050
She disrespected me first.

142
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,490
Conghuan.

143
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,700
Conghuan?

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,590
You...

145
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,470
You can't protect her like this.

146
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,470
Empress Dowager.

147
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,760
Empress Dowager, please don't be angry with the Second Prince;

148
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,290
it might disturb the royal family's harmony.

149
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,290
As the Empress Dowager,

150
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,310
it is my duty to discipline the princesses and concubines.

151
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,040
Help the Crown Princess up now.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,230
Stop them for me.

153
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,290
Second Prince.

154
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,470
Second Prince.

155
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,220
If you don't want to die, get out of my way.

156
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,510
Brother Jin...

157
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,780
Empress Dowager, please don't be angry.

158
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,060
Stay still.

159
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,470
We need to treat your ears at Imperial Hospital.

160
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,110
Conghuan?

161
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,530
Conghuan.

162
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,520
Put her down.

163
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,090
Heng.

164
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,530
If you don't hand her over to me now,

165
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,730
every moment of delay

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,130
will cause more damage to her hearing.

167
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,080
Heng...

168
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Empress Dowager.

169
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,280
Brother Jin has never been this harsh with me before.

170
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,510
Did I do something wrong?

171
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,810
Empress Dowager, you were just trying to maintain the royal family's dignity.

172
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,010
You did nothing wrong.

173
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,260
But from now on, you should always remember that you're the Empress Dowager.

174
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,990
We can't break the royal rules.

175
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,940
I understand.

176
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,150
Conghuan, you're awake.

177
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,760
Conghuan.

178
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,750
Conghuan, can you hear me speaking?

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,690
I... I can't hear anymore.

180
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,920
Heng, I can't hear anymore.

181
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,520
-I... You...
-Conghuan.

182
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,110
Conghuan.

183
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,810
What did you say?

184
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,680
Say it again.

185
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,750
I can't hear anymore, Heng.

186
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,200
I can't hear...

187
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,730

I promise you,

All those who insult and bully us

will all pay the price.
