1
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,710
I really should be dead

2
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,510
for bumping into Your Highness!

3
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,470
These are His Highness's treasures.

4
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,530
I can't break them.

5
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,510
Poison dart.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,789
Mo Jin.

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,320
I'm going to return this poison dart to you.

8
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,160
He was here just now.

9
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,870
Where did he go?

10
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,270
A dancer came to the palace.

11
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,800
She is dancing for His Highness.

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Do you want to check on His Highness?

13
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,610
Do you know where the dancer's bedroom is?

14
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,840
Mo Jin.

15
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,400
Before I leave,

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,460
I'll definitely send you on your way.

17
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,280
Do you still

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,710
trust me even a little?

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,510
There's only hatred between us.

20
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,630
Your Highness.

21
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,750
Stop drinking.

22
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,120
Get out!

23
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,400
The imperial physician is already waiting outside.

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,190
Get out!

25
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,720
No one is allowed to come in!

26
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,090
Why don't you dance?

27
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,750
Keep dancing.

28
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,710
Nine.

29
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,240
Is that you?

30
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,840
You hate me so much.

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,570
How is it possible that you'd dance for me?

32
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,330
Your Highness, you're in a such good mood.

33
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,630
I thought there was a drop-dead gorgeous dancer.

34
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,360
Turns out she's just mediocre.

35
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,310
Come on, dance for me, too.

36
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,720
Longevity Lock.

37
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,510
Nine.

38
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,330
This is the Longevity Lock I got

39
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,360
for our child from Nanshan Temple.

40
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,310
Let go of me!

41
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Let go of me!

42
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,270
Keep dancing!

43
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,260
If you keep dancing, I'll allow you to pick it up.

44
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,680
It turns out

45
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,760
you were offering sacrifice to our child.

46
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,870
In the end,

47
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,870
you still don't trust me.

48
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,070
The grudge between us

49
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,360
will end here.

50
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,830
Go!

51
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,920
The Longevity Lock

52
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,270
is not dirty.

53
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,159
Brother Jin!

54
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,159
Brother Jin!

55
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Hurry!

56
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,070
Summon the imperial physician!
