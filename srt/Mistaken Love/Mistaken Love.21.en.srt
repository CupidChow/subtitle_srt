00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,510
[Episode 21]

3
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,490
Has the medicine been delivered?

4
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,750
It has been delivered.

5
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,330
Did you personally witness Second Brother take it?

6
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,239
Yes.

7
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,280
This Enchanting Powder only clings to clothes at a close range.

8
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,740
Have the remaining death warriors remain on standby.

9
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,259
This pattern is...

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,280
Could it be?

11
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,460
Jin.

12
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,340
Why are you here?

13
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,940
Yesterday, I found a letter in Mo Heng's study.

14
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
It was a correspondence between Mo Heng and the death warriors.

15
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,380
Mo Heng is the leader of the death warriors.

16
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,010
It's time to make our move.

17
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,540
Your Highness, the Crown Prince's cavalry is on the move.

18
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,070
They entered the city earlier than expected.

19
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,690
Wait for me to return.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Have a good rest.

21
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,380
Be careful.

22
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,870
Why has the cavalry arrived so quickly this time?

23
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,020
Looks like he couldn't wait any longer.

24
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,750
Are our people all in position?

25
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,200
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

26
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,140
[Memorial Tablet of My Mother, Qin Dehui]

27
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,750
Conghuan.

28
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,520
What's wrong with you?

29
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,660
I'm sorry, Heng. I lied to you.

30
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,579
Get up first.

31
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,550
Conghuan, what are you talking about?

32
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,450
Ever since I entered the palace,

33
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,140
I haven't been able to mourn my mother openly.

34
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,930
Today, I remembered something sad, that's why I...

35
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,020
You have to tell me what happened

36
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,190
so I can help you, right?

37
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,829
Heng,

38
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,410
actually, I married you

39
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,020
because my mother died unjustly,

40
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,420
and I want to avenge her.

41
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,540
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,950
You've been suffering alone all this time.

43
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,420
How could I blame you?

44
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,710
Do you know who the enemy is?

45
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,140
Look.

46
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,420
This is the poisoned dart that killed my mother.

47
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,020
Have you ever seen it before?

48
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,420
No.

49
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,750
Perhaps I can have my men investigate for you.

50
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,070
But I've already found the culprit.

51
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,380
Is that so?

52
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,040
Who is it? Tell me.

53
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,460
I'll help you get revenge.

54
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,260
Really?

55
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,150
He is...

56
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,260
He is...

57
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,540
Li Conghuan, have you gone mad?

58
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,580
This dart is coated with insect poison!

59
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,840
So it was you all along.

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,180
Otherwise, how would you know there was insect poison on the dart?

61
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,580
What are you trying to do?

62
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,390
If you kill me, you won't survive either.

63
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,790
You faked your own death,

64
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,530
making me feel guilty,

65
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,550
only to secretly plot alliances with the four nations to seize military power.

66
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,180
You pretended to care for me and love me,

67
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,940
but behind my back, you killed my loved ones

68
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
and framed Mo Jin.

69
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,920
Who's really the mad one here?

70
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,130
Just one poisoned dart proves nothing.

71
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,659
This letter, detailing communications with the death warriors, is the evidence.

72
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,100
Yes.

73
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,850
I did all of this.

74
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,750
I want to take everything from Mo Jin.

75
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,330
Why should he have everything?

76
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,940
I want to possess everything he cherishes,

77
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,340
whether it's a woman or the world.

78
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,460
Did you have to kill my family and child?

79
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,420
What did they do wrong?

80
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,540
My child was so young.

81
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,620
That was your child with Mo Jin.

82
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,420
Of course I couldn't let it live.

83
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,170
But my love for you is sincere.

84
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,980
Everything I did was for our own good.

85
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,360
Once I become the emperor,

86
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,340
I'll make it up to you.

87
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,820
Fine.

88
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,340
Let's see if you survive to see that day.

89
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,180
Don't.

90
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,340
Mother, my child, I'm avenging you.

91
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,680
Wait!

92
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,870
Ninth Princess, please don't be rash.

93
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,690
Huo Xin.

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,570
You won't be able to leave Qingshuo if you kill him.

95
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,740
He killed my mother and child.

96
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,740
I came to Qingshuo just for the day when I could avenge them!

97
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,400
What about the Second Prince?

98
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,180
Jin.

99
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,480
If you kill him,

100
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,560
how can the Second Prince survive?

101
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,770
Crown Princess, why don't you come with me to find the Second Prince

102
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,350
and reveal the truth to the world?

103
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,350
The Crown Prince will receive the punishment he deserves,

104
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,280
and your loved ones will rest in peace in the afterlife.

105
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,130
Impossible.

106
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,880
The emperor won't execute his son for my sake.

107
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,740
The Second Prince will find a way.

108
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,430
Even if you don't believe me,

109
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,070
you should believe the Second Prince.

110
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,550
-I'm sorry, Crown Princess.
-What are you doing, Huo Xin?
