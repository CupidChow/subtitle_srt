[Mistaken Love]

2
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,520
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,620
What are you doing?

4
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,880
Conghuan, I said I'd keep my word.

5
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,040
This time, I won't let anyone bully you again.

6
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,250
Look,

7
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,450
I'm strong enough to protect you now.

8
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,280
Heng, Mo Jin is your brother after all.

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,570
You don't need to kill him, right?

10
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,510
Why would I hurt my Second Brother?

11
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,680
Without my orders,

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,220
they won't do anything reckless.

13
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,930
Then what are you trying to do?

14
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,500
I have no choice.

15
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,010
Second Brother has always been violent.

16
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,530
If I don't use this method,

17
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,610
I'm afraid history will repeat itself.

18
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,509
Conghuan.

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,479
As long as you stay with me wholeheartedly,

20
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,539
I absolutely won't touch one hair on his head.

21
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,100
Inside and outside the palace,

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,250
I have people keeping watch

23
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,870
in visible and invisible places.

24
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,680
If Second Brother dares to bully you again...

25
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,070
I'm your husband.

26
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,220
I won't just stand by.

27
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,470
Alright, alright.

28
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,870
I promise you.

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,990
I promise you.

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,390
Okay.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
Remember what you said today.

32
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,079
Father has stripped Jin of his military power.

33
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,140
Mo Heng's people are lying in ambush.

34
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,610
How should I help him?

35
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,440
Conghuan.

36
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,510
This is a tonic for nourishing the heart.

37
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,630
The imperial doctor said Second Brother's heart meridian was damaged,

38
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,540
and he need to take it for a few more days.

39
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,950
Take it to him for me.

40
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,390
I promised

41
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,150
I wouldn't see him again.

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,130
Take it.

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,950
This time, I'm asking you to go.

44
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Who is it?

45
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,790
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Shen Ling.

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Your Highness, I brought you some soup.

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,350
Your Highness, Your Highness.

48
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,760
Are you alright?

49
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,140
Let me help you to rest.

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,240
Your Highness, let me help you undress.

51
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,050
Your Highness, what did I do wrong?

52
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,450
You dare to drug me?

53
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,120
Who sent you?

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,950
It was the Crown Prince. He threatened my family.

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,130
He ordered me to come here tonight...

56
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,250
To...

57
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,790
To become your woman.

58
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,620
Mo Heng sent me to watch this show.

59
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,100
If you dare to trespass into my palace again,

60
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,210
I'll make sure you'll be dead.

61
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,160
Get out!

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,110
Conghuan, Conghuan.

63
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,870
Conghuan.

64
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,950
Conghuan.

65
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,760
I know you weren't really drugged.

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,280
Why did you still play along with her act?

67
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,000
Enchanting Powder.

68
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,820
What? Are you jealous?

69
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,620
Why would I be jealous?

70
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,750
Weren't you the one asking me to help you find a nice girl?

71
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,410
I think Shen Ling is quite good.

72
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,440
She's pretty

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,860
and attentive.

74
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,720
Is that so?

75
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,340
Yes.

76
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,520
I didn't see her clearly just now.

77
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,920
Why don't we call her back

78
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,220
and take a closer look?

79
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,240
Mo Heng's eyes are watching us.

80
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,040
I know.

81
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,030
What's your plan?

82
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,150
We'll turn their trick against them.

83
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,550
Let's test his strength.

84
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,710
Turn their trick against them?

85
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,530
Do you think you'll succeed?

86
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,860
Thirty percent chance.

87
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,250
It's so dangerous.

88
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,159
Are you sure about this?

89
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,320
I've made up my mind.

90
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,190
I only want to protect one person wholeheartedly.

91
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,610
To live a free life.

92
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,820
From the first moment I saw you,

93
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,990
I knew it would always be you.

94
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:14,590
Inside and outside the palace,

95
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,330
I have people keeping watch in visible and invisible places.

96
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,860
If Second Brother dares to bully you again...

97
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,390
I'm your husband.

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,510
I won't just stand by.

99
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,210
What if Mo Heng really takes action?

100
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,480
It's Mo Heng's people.

101
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,370
Your Highness, Heng asked me to bring you medicine.

102
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,390
Please don't be angry with your Big Brother anymore.

103
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,350
Then thank you two.

104
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,220
It's getting late.

105
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,420
Your Highness, please rest early.

106
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,200
Yes.

107
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,470
Mo Heng has placed archers near your palace.

108
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,390
They could strike at any moment.

109
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,310
I know.

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,330
His people are too obvious,

111
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,500
and he can't protect his back.

112
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,820
You said

113
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,510
this medicine was from him?

114
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,570
Yes, he said it can strengthen your heart.

115
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,800
Do you believe it?

116
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,860
I don't believe it.

117
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,900
I said I don't believe it.

118
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,190
Why did you still eat it?

119
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,520
Are you afraid I'll die?

120
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,270
I'm not afraid.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,460
If we die, we die together.

122
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,510
♫That year, we chatted and laughed under a pear tree♫

123
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,860
♫Snow flew in the whole night♫

124
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,850
♫All happiness in the world♫

125
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,550
♫Comes with regrets♫

126
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,580
♫I hardened my resolve to leave you♫

127
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,450
♫And you never came into my dream♫

128
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,410
♫When everything turns into nothing♫

129
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,940
♫I wish I could be with you forever♫
