1
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,390
It can't be.

2
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,200
This must be a dream.

3
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,240
Wait.

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,150
Last night, the Second Prince...

5
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,430
The Second Prince was in your chamber all night

6
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,039
until just before dawn.

7
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:11,990
I want to get dressed.

8
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,510
Yes.

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,070
You...

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,230
Last night...

11
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,690
What are you trying to say?

12
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't think that by locking me in here,

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,430
you can do whatever you want.

14
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,289
I'm not falling for your pity act.

15
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,250
Why are you acting crazy so early in the morning?

16
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,509
You...

17
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,350
Where's my jade pendant?

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,560
My mother left me a pair of jade pendants.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,620
This one is for you.

20
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,000
This is the last thing he left me.

21
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,680
How could I lose it?

22
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,830
You care about him that much?

23
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,230
So...

24
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,070
Honey.

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,350
You see me as Mo Heng.

26
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,910
Honey.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,870
Don't go.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,750
This is crazy.

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,090
You keep a woman who wants to kill you by your side.

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,840
You still care after all.

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Search carefully.

32
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,680
Your Majesty,

33
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,430
this kind of longevity lock

34
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,030
is used to pray for children at Nanshan Temple.

35
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,000
You're back.

36
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,560
So you really had a child with that guy.

37
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,079
This is the proof.

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Give it back to me.

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,840
Li Conghuan.

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,190
You've deceived the emperor

41
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,280
and disgraced the royal family.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,680
What do you think your punishment should be?

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,960
So what if I had a child?

44
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,030
I'll issue an edict immediately

45
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,470
to expel you from the palace tomorrow.

46
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,190
After that,

47
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,910
you can never step into Qingshuo Palace again.

48
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
Mother,

49
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,040
you were right.

50
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,510
Without power,

51
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,680
we're just trampled on.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,600
It's this child.

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
The Second Prince has ordered that the child must not stay.

54
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,870
What are you doing?

55
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,159
Do you know whose child this is?

56
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,920
My child.

57
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,800
Give my child back!

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
My child!

59
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,120
Mother.

60
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,600
It's insect poison.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,950
incurable.

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,680
Nine.

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Mother.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,870
Mother.

66
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,110
Even my closest relative...

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
I promise you.

68
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,120
I will send him to see you.

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,830
What?

70
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,280
Are you mourning your dead husband again?

71
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,950
You've already cried?

72
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,680
Give it to me.

73
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,240
You really treasure all his belongings.

74
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,970
Give it to me.

75
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,890
Give it to me.

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm begging you.

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,390
Give it to me.

78
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,870
You're begging me for him?

79
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,390
I'm begging you, please give it to me!

80
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,130
What are you doing?

81
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
You care about this so much?

82
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,480
Do you care about him that much?

83
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,390
Let go of me!

84
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,920
You are my wife now,

85
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,190
but you're mourning another man in the palace.

86
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,520
Do you know what the consequences would be

87
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,510
if someone saw?

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,950
Another man?

89
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,330
He was the man I married in a formal ceremony.

90
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,310
He was my husband.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,270
Now I will show you

92
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,070
who your real husband is.

93
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,950
My real husband is already dead!

94
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,170
Do you care so much about a dead person?

95
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,280
Then who should I care about?

96
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,430
You?

97
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,480
The Second Prince,

98
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,000
who would kill his own kin just to take the throne?

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,360
I didn't kill Mo Heng.

100
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,440
What about my mother

101
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,159
and my child?

102
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,080
They were my closest relatives.

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
How could I have killed them?

104
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,840
Closest relatives?

105
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Does someone like you deserve closest relatives?

106
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,640
You don't deserve to have any loved ones at all.

107
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,610
When you wake in the dead of night,

108
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,000
why haven't they come for revenge?

109
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,830
Why?

110
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,190
Do you still

111
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,480
have any trust in me?

112
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,600
There's only hatred between us.

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,669
Stop putting on a show.

114
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,750
I won't be soft-hearted to you anymore.

115
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,360
I'll never trust you again.

116
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,030
Today, even if I have to risk my life,

117
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,200
I will use your blood

118
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,070
to pay tribute to my dead family.

119
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,320
You have such deep feelings

120
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,960
for Mo Heng?

121
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,910
You want to kill me for him?

122
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,120
Nine.

123
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,770
You don't deserve to call my name.

124
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,590
You don't deserve it.

125
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,390
Fine.

126
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,080
If you're sure it was me,

127
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,670
then go ahead.

128
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,790
Don't think I won't dare.

129
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,630
Go on.

130
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,200
Kill me.

131
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,390
Go on.

132
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,080
Aren't you going to kill me?

133
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,360
Aren't you going to kill me?

134
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,480
Do it.

135
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,000
The heart is right here.

136
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,670
If you're going to stab me, do it right.

137
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,630
Kill me.

138
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,200
Do it!

139
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,440
Kill me.
