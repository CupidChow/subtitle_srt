1
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,079
Xixi.

2
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,280
Are you the manager hired by my father?

3
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,040
Hello, Xixi. Nice to meet you.

4
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,519
I'm Tian Sui.

5
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:07,879
In the future...

6
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,719
There is no future

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,040
for a manager kicked out by Xu Mengyun

8
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,760
and shut out by the whole industry.

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,120
I don't know
why my father has hired you.

10
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,120
With your status and background,

11
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,560
it isn't hard to find a manager
with better reputation than me.

12
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,239
And other managers

13
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,319
would obey you more.

14
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,519
They would serve you

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,640
gingerly as if you're
a national treasure.

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,400
Aren't you doing the same

17
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,480
in front of me now?

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,719
But I'm different from them.

19
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,640
I only do what I'm supposed to do

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
within the professional field.

21
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,280
It depends on whether or not
you want to be arranged

22
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,079
and monitored by someone else
like before

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,840
or let me, a manager with poor reputation

24
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,480
to let you do whatever you like.

25
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,079
I hope you could put away
your ill temper.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,159
Think it through.

27
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,120
How you're supposed to choose.

28
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,760
I won't disturb you anymore.

29
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,359
I'll wait for your call.

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,919
Miss, you should go up
for a regular examination.

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,159
For what?

32
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,280
What is the point?

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
The result will be the same.

(Shocking scene of Xu Xixi beating up
(Recently, a video of the rising actress,)

37
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,998
(an accompanying staff member)
(Xu Xixi has gone viral online.)

(Xu Xixi in the video)

39
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:07,038
(slapped a woman hard.)

40
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:08,598
(It's sparked a hot debate
among netizens.)

41
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,838
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

42
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,718
There're some negative news
about Ms. Xu

43
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:24,639
on the internet lately.

44
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,758
I'll take measures at once

45
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,359
to remove all videos and news.

46
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,718
Ms. Xu won't be affected

47
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:30,718
in any way.

48
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:32,119
(I hope the same situation)

49
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,598
(wouldn't happen again.)

50
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:46,318
Yueyue, don't you remember me?

51
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,119
Your full name is An Yue.

52
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:50,838
Your mother...

53
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:52,679
Why are you confused, old woman?

54
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:54,278
Go now. Don't get in my way.

55
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:05,959
Dad.

56
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,399
Why do you come back so early?

57
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:10,558
What are the two of you doing here?

58
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,078
For what?

59
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,438
(What is the point?)

60
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,799
(The result will be the same.)

61
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,239
She...

62
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,719
She is so different from me.

63
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,239
Has no one really suspected before?

64
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,518
Even if someone has,

65
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,719
it'll only be blamed on memory loss.

66
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,359
Why did you go to
my father's reading room?

67
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:45,839
Lu Jinyan, don't lie to me.

68
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,318
We're allies,

69
00:05:50,878 --> 00:05:51,719
aren't we?

70
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:15,359
We have the same purpose.

71
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,438
It's to verify your identity.

72
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,318
I've verified your DNA test

73
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,758
with Mr. Xu.

74
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,318
You're father and daughter.

75
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:40,638
What about the only child?

76
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:44,438
Maybe Xu Yongyu deliberate lied

77
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:45,398
due to certain reason.

78
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:49,758
He must be trying to hide
a bigger secret.

79
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,239
He hides your existence by purpose.

80
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,039
Don't act abruptly.

81
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,039
It'll be very dangerous
if your identity exposed.

82
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,958
Hopefully, we could be honest

83
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,719
with each other from now on.

84
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,039
What? She has realised?

85
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,758
Have you told her everything then?

86
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:50,958
No.

87
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,239
I only told her

88
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:55,279
about the DNA test.

89
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,159
I always thought
that getting to the bottom

90
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,958
is the most righteous thing.

91
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:09,198
The truth is,

92
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,719
I only take advantage
of her memory loss.

93
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:16,919
I deceive her.

94
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,799
I use her.

95
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:22,719
Have you fallen for her?

96
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:32,359
When you have time to analyse me,

97
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,959
why don't you reflect on yourself?

98
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,119
Looking at the shared location,

99
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,398
you don't even dare to say
that you like her.

100
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,599
If she doesn't like you anymore

101
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:45,439
and let go of it completely,

102
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,479
it'll be too late for you to regret.

103
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:58,559
There is still something fatal
stuck in my brain.

104
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:01,719
Don't hold her back.

105
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,638
Aren't you feeling well again?

106
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:06,278
I'm fine.

107
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:07,359
Don't worry.

108
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:16,599
Tiancheng.

109
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:19,599
Yes.

110
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:20,798
Don't be a coward.

111
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,479
You go through all the hassle

112
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,359
only for someone else's happiness.

113
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,079
Don't miss your own happiness.

114
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:38,359
I have to go.

115
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:11,678
Nice glasses.

116
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,479
Limited edition.

117
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,959
It isn't cheap.

118
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,959
I say it's a limited edition.

119
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,559
There're only three.

120
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,918
What do you think?

121
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:25,878
Your life seems pretty good

122
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,398
after terminating the contract with me.

123
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:31,638
You've bought a big house.

124
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,359
You've even bought a luxury car.

125
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,798
And I heard that you pay it off at once.

126
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:37,878
All luxuries.

127
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,038
You earn a lot.

128
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:45,798
That's a sure thing.

129
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:49,479
Terminating the contract with you

130
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:51,959
is the best decision
that I've ever made.

131
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,479
As for you,

132
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:57,918
you must be regretting it

133
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,398
without me, a money tree.

134
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,199
Regret?

135
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:08,998
Not really.

136
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:11,398
You on the contrary

137
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,638
will be too late to regret.

138
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:14,758
What is this?

139
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,119
I'm clear with all the expenses of your

140
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:22,239
commercials and endorsement programmes.

141
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,199
I've made an account

142
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,038
of how much to get in the end.

143
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:39,158
As a public figure,

144
00:11:39,518 --> 00:11:40,959
you've earned a lot.

145
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:44,599
You should know what you can do

146
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,599
and what you can't.

147
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:50,479
There're things that
you can't touch in your life.

148
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,638
There're so many living examples
laid before you.

149
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,678
How can you still take it for granted?

150
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,079
What you can do and what you can't.

151
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:02,518
I told you many times before.

152
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,638
It seems like you didn't
take it into account.

153
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,319
Xu Mengyun.

154
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:16,599
One can be stupid

155
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,878
but not stupid and bad.

156
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,758
Admit to your mistake
and punishment at once.

157
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:23,918
Also.

158
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,038
Stop messing with Xu Xixi.

159
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,758
If there is another time,

160
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,398
I won't come to you personally

161
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:31,839
but mention you in public.

162
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:59,380
(No one can resist such charm,
hope they are really together)

163
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,940
(Are they a good match?
Hope they are really together)

164
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,900
(The young man looks good)

165
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,180
(Her bodyguard is also very handsome)

166
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,980
(I knew this couple would be popular)

167
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,340
(Bodyguard vs. Miss, what kind of
literary work is this?)

168
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:18,959
(They look like a married couple)
(Is this a new variety show?)

169
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:20,158
(I look forward to watching it.)

170
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:22,719
(If this isn't love)
(And identity card.)

171
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,719
(Hope they are really together)
(Her bodyguard is too handsome.)

172
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:27,479
The video of the two of you

173
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,998
is hotly debated
throughout the internet lately.

174
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,319
The team has made a data analysis.

175
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:33,599
If the popularity of the two of you
could last a while,

176
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:34,839
it'll completely cover

177
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:36,439
the negative effect
of the video of slapping.

178
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,119
So the best approach now

179
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:40,798
is continue your business

180
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,758
until the storm vanishes completely.

181
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:44,638
No.

182
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:47,719
Why not?

183
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,998
What you need to do

184
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:51,119
is just to maintain
the current situation.

185
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,959
You continue being the heritress,

186
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:59,758
you continue doing
your duty as the bodyguard.

187
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,199
We'll post some daily Vlogs of you

188
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:05,119
from some side shots.

189
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,719
It won't affect your normal lives

190
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:07,878
at all.

191
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,839
Lu Jinyan.

192
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:17,758
You disagree because

193
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,998
you have a hidden secret, right?

194
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,359
Xu Xixi as the public figure.

195
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,599
You as her personal bodyguard.

196
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,559
There is no possibility
of not being exposed.

197
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,278
So your reasons for
rejecting me are not valid.

198
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:45,798
Unless

199
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:51,158
you like Xu Xixi.

200
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,719
You're scared that the cameras
would magnify your every move.

201
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:55,959
You have no way to hide the secret

202
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,359
of liking her.

203
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:01,998
People in my field

204
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:03,918
have three basic principles.

205
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:05,839
Protect the employer's security
unconditionally.

206
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:07,918
Obey the employer's order
unconditionally and

207
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,678
must not have personal feelings
with the employer.

208
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:16,638
I reject your proposal

209
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:18,678
because my occupation

210
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:19,959
isn't suitable for excessive exposure

211
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,518
so as not to affect
the work of security.

212
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:24,199
I think we should forget it.

213
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:33,518
My hype with Lu Jinyan.

214
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,798
I find it not suitable.

215
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,878
Please think of another way.

216
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,119
For the things in the study,

217
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:00,518
I apologise.

218
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:06,959
I accept it.

219
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,319
I believe you had no ill intent.

220
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:18,839
And I rejected just now

221
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,119
because of the identity sensitivity,

222
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,359
not suitable for excessive exposure.

223
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,158
Ms. Tian will figure out a way

224
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:24,439
for that negative public opinion.

225
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:27,359
You don't have to make too much effort.

226
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,878
When the negative public opinion eased,

227
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,719
we'll go to your mother again.

228
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,798
Thank you. We think alike.

229
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,319
(Hello, Yueyue.)

230
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:55,719
(Are you unhappy)

231
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,199
(because Lu Jinyan doesn't want
to create the hype with you?)

232
00:16:57,878 --> 00:16:59,758
(I'll find you a handsome man
to piss him off.)

233
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,998
I'm not unhappy because of him.

234
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,999
(By the way, it's inconvenient
with the crowd just now.)

235
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,279
(When I was sorting
the purchase record)

236
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,319
(of phone cards in the shop,)

237
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:09,718
(I found out)

238
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,678
(that Aunt An would buy)

239
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:12,079
(a new phone card every year.)

240
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,039
(The most recent one
is over a year ago.)

241
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,119
(And all phone numbers)

242
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:18,559
(have been canceled.)

243
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,519
(Aunt An should be secretly contacting)

244
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,638
(someone all the while.)

245
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:28,398
Can you find the usage history
of the numbers?

246
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,198
(I'll try my best)

247
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:32,799
(and update you when there is a finding.)

248
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,678
What do you think

249
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:49,319
about my daughter?

250
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,438
She is my employer.

251
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,559
No matter how she is,

252
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,079
I'll do my best to protect her.

253
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,198
I think you're getting along.

254
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,638
She becomes very obedient to you
after the car accident.

255
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,398
She is certainly cooperative

256
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:13,478
with our security work.

257
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,079
It's a good thing
when she would cooperate with you.

258
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,319
Next month,

259
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,438
the medical team in charge of her health

260
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:26,519
will come back to the country.

261
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:28,599
I plan to give her
a full body examination.

262
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,878
Xixi

263
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,918
resists examination very much.

264
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,039
You persuade her in advance.

265
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,319
Sure, Mr. Xu.

266
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,678
Mr. Jiang.

267
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,559
Is there a way to extend
flowering period?

268
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:23,678
Oh no!

269
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:26,158
(I've exposed my technical shortcoming
in front of Ms. Tian.)

270
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:29,119
(Is it in time to ask
the flower grower now?)

271
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,020
(Jiang Tiancheng)

272
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,678
What is this app?

273
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:44,279
It looks classy.

274
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,759
I want to install one.

275
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,839
It's developed by my friend on his own.

276
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:49,799
You don't get to download it.

277
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,079
Is there anything I can do for you?

278
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:00,678
Lu Jinyan refuses to cooperate
with the business

279
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,198
so I'm thinking

280
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:04,198
if we should find a backup plan.

281
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:06,198
Do you have any new plan?

282
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,999
Come and try this watermelon.

283
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:19,759
Is it sweet?

284
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:22,638
Yes.

285
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,878
Try this honeydew melon as well.

286
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:27,759
What are you trying to say?

287
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:29,999
I mean to

288
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,398
suppress one melon with another.

289
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,599
An Yue and Lu Jinyan

290
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,918
are as if this watermelon.

291
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:38,319
It's quite sweet if you eat it alone.

292
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,559
But after eating a honeydew melon,

293
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,839
you'll think that the watermelon
has become less sweet.

294
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,158
So my plan

295
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,958
is to find a more popular reality show

296
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,238
to form a new partner.

297
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,279
Am I wrong?

298
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,958
An Yue mentioned it to me before.

299
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,958
She doesn't really want to appear
in a reality show.

300
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,559
(Zhang Jingchuan   Xu Xixi)
As a celebrity,

301
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:13,799
she can't just stay in her comfort zone.

302
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:14,999
And she is a singer.

303
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,559
She needs this kind of exposure.

304
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,878
Didn't I propose

305
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,799
this plan before?

306
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:26,158
Yes.

307
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,238
It's inspired by you.

308
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:33,279
Ms. Tian.

309
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,958
You've approved me much.

310
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,759
Should you motivate your good assistant

311
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,119
by action?

312
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,079
Creativity is the most valuable these days.

313
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,158
Paid knowledge.

314
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,718
But it's rather skin-deep

315
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,999
for us to talk about money.

316
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:49,759
Just say what you want.

317
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,079
If this plan succeeds,

318
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:55,678
promise to go on a date with me.

319
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,359
I choose the location.

320
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,958
Are you sure you want to use

321
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,519
such a rare chance of
making a condition with me

322
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:05,438
on such a meaningless

323
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:07,839
and completely fruitless matter?

324
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:10,999
It's not up to you
to determine the meaning.

325
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:20,478
I get it.

326
00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:24,398
You must be scared of being
moved by my sincerity

327
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,519
and romance after dating with me

328
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,839
and then you can't help but...

329
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:28,678
Stop.

330
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,839
Text me once you set
the time and location.

331
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:32,398
Okay.

332
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,559
I thought you're joking

333
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,718
about the dating variety show.

334
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,999
We're joking last time
but now it's real.

335
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,359
The decision

336
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,918
was unanimously made
in the company's meeting.

337
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,519
The male lead

338
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,799
has agreed to cooperate
with the business.

339
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,799
It seems like I have
no reason to reject you.

340
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:20,238
Although it's scripted,

341
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,478
you should still take
the feelings of the new

342
00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:23,119
business partner into account

343
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,839
so please pay some attention

344
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:28,238
as the experienced partner.

345
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,519
Keep a distance

346
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,359
so as not to affect
the public display of affection.

347
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:54,158
Thank you.

348
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:07,238
Ms. Xu, I'm Zhang Jingchuan.

349
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,478
It's my first time joining
a variety show.

350
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,638
Please take care of me.

351
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,238
It's also my first time.
Let's work together.

352
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,119
One small request.

353
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,638
I hope it isn't too abrupt.

354
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:20,119
What is it?

355
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,398
We're of the same age.

356
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,519
You may call me Jingchuan from now on.

357
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,198
I'll call you Xixi.

358
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,799
I watched the video
of you protecting Xixi.

359
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,759
I'm jealous of your skill.

360
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,718
I must learn a few tricks
from you some day.

361
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:50,878
We've arrived.

362
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,559
See you later, Xixi.

363
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,359
See you.

364
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:08,599
Thank you.

365
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,438
Thank you.

366
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,039
The integration of drama
and variety show

367
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:19,398
is the biggest difference
between this show

368
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,359
and other dating variety shows.

369
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,438
Variety recording
and short drama shooting

370
00:25:23,678 --> 00:25:24,678
will be done alternately.

371
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,718
Our biggest requirement on guests

372
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:28,839
is devotion.

373
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:31,119
There should be mutual sweetness

374
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:32,599
like real couple.

375
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:39,519
If you feel uncomfortable,

376
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:40,918
follow my pace.

377
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:42,198
I'll lead.

378
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,958
I have no problem of
following the script.

379
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:04,678
Hello.

380
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,319
I'm your date today.

381
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,599
I'm Zhang Jingchuan.

382
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,718
Hi, I'm Xu Xixi.

383
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,319
Watch out!

384
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:19,599
Cut.

385
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:21,398
Xixi.

386
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,119
We're recording a dating variety show,

387
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,559
not action film.

388
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,759
Can you ask your bodyguard

389
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,279
to be less dedicated?

390
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,079
It's fine, director.

391
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,678
I also want to change a way of greeting.

392
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:31,958
Let's do it again.

393
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:33,279
Again.

394
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:33,999
I'm fine.

395
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,559
Are you okay?

396
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:42,839
Yes.

397
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:46,478
Thank you for just now.

398
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,958
Don't thank me in a hurry.

399
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,359
You'll blame me

400
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,599
if I make you fall later.

401
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,398
Let's practise here.

402
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,198
Listen first.

403
00:26:58,638 --> 00:27:00,359
You should lower your centre of gravity.

404
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:01,958
Like this.

405
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,478
Walk this way.

406
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,478
Can you do it?

407
00:27:11,478 --> 00:27:12,158
Yes.

408
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:12,878
It's much better than just now.

409
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:13,718
Really?

410
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,638
Jingchuan, I'm a bit hungry.

411
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,359
Should we find a place to eat?

412
00:27:19,718 --> 00:27:20,359
Sure.

413
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,478
Take a seat.

414
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:22,039
Okay.

415
00:27:23,478 --> 00:27:24,158
Thank you.

416
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:26,799
Let me take off the shoes for you.

417
00:27:27,158 --> 00:27:28,759
No. I do it myself.

418
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,839
Ms. Xu Xixi.

419
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,839
Would you give me a chance
to act like a gentleman?

420
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:36,638
You'll embarrass me.

421
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,079
I'm afraid that I would appear
on tomorrow's headline.

422
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:43,279
The headline goes,

423
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:46,238
"Lady let a popular actor
kneel to change her shoes".

424
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,398
"Get out of the entertainment circle".

425
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,359
Be careful.

426
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:07,319
I help you.

427
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,599
Just leave it to me.

428
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:17,958
All right. Thank you, everyone.

429
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,238
We call it a day.

430
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:20,718
Okay.

431
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:21,478
Thank you, everyone.

432
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:22,119
Thank you, director.

433
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:22,638
Thank you, Xixi.

434
00:28:22,638 --> 00:28:23,158
See you.

435
00:28:24,158 --> 00:28:26,039
Xixi, the short drama tomorrow.

436
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,398
The director said we shall
do script reading

437
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:28,279
together tonight.

438
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,759
9.30 p.m. Is it okay?

439
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:30,718
Yes.

440
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,319
My car has arrived. I'll be leaving.

441
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:35,878
Xixi.

442
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,759
The rain is getting heavy.
I see you with an umbrella.

443
00:28:39,198 --> 00:28:39,839
Give me the umbrella.

444
00:28:55,678 --> 00:28:56,279
Let's go.

445
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,918
See you in the late evening, Xixi.

446
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,559
The bodyguard is a real nuisance.

447
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:19,198
I should think of a way
to see her alone.

448
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,958
You did it on purpose, right?

449
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,438
No.

450
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,559
It's forced perspective,
not a real kiss.

451
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,599
I have no right to interfere
with the content of the work.

452
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:49,398
But if it is possible,

453
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,438
I need to know

454
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:52,718
the actual content of your rehearsal

455
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,878
and scenes involved

456
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:57,359
to plan my security work in advance.

457
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:02,599
All right.

458
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:05,478
I can get familiar with the script

459
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:08,799
to rehearse with Mr. Zhang.

460
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:11,799
Let me read it to you.

461
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,238
"Late evening in a classroom,
Zhang Jingchuan, Xu Xixi".

462
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,438
"He hugs her from behind".

463
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:22,238
"Warmth of breath"

464
00:31:22,238 --> 00:31:25,079
"seemingly brushes the back
of her fair neck".

465
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:26,918
"She turns around gently".

466
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,718
"The male lead pulls the female lead
to his side".

467
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:31,799
"Before she have time to speak,"

468
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:35,438
"he kisses her lips".

469
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,319
"They kiss each other"

470
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,119
"under the faint light".

471
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:45,599
What do you think?

472
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,799
Do you have any work to do?

473
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:52,999
Report to the department concerned.

474
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,718
The plot is indecent.

475
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,839
Lu Jinyan.

476
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:07,999
You'll make me feel like
you're being jealous.

477
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:09,958
No.

478
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:19,999
Xixi.

479
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:21,799
It's me.

480
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:34,519
Xixi, have you fallen asleep?

481
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,958
I come to do script reading with you.

482
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,238
Do you do it like this?

483
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:48,999
Do you want to continue?

484
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:55,878
There is no need for an outsider, right?

485
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:11,279
Xixi.

486
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,238
Have you fallen asleep?

487
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:17,918
Mr. Zhang.

488
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:19,958
I'm not feeling well. I'll rest instead.

489
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:28,718
It's okay.

490
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,718
Rest early then.

491
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:34,958
By the way,

492
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:36,999
remember to text me

493
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,359
if you're still uncomfortable.

494
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,398

Hello.

507
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,838
