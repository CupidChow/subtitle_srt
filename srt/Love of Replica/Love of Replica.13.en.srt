alerted me.

Yes.

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,839
This is what I found to be weird.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,960
Why did he go to

10
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,120
Xu Yongyu's company

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,879
so late at night?

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,879
He could have noticed something odd

13
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,280
and followed there
after dropping Xu Xixi off.

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,399
I thought of something.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,759
Two years ago,

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,000
I first met Xu Yongyu and Xu Xixi

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,679
at Yuyuan.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,079
I saw you too at that time

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,880
(but you were in pretty bad shape.)

20
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,399
(You were even weaker than Xu Xixi.)

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,640
(I saw you in a wheelchair.)

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,560
(I thought it was Xu Xixi)

23
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,719
(but after turning around,)

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,799
(Xu Xixi appeared behind me.)

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,120
(I thought I was seeing things)

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,719
until I met you later.

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,120
Then, I knew

28
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,959
I was looking at two different people.

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,319
Are you sure?

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
But I've never been there.

Before the surgery,

32
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,719
Tiancheng showed me the
structure of Yuyuan.

33
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,280
There should be a complicated
space underground.

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,599
Xu Xixi did her checkup and
was hospitalised here.

35
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,599
I've been to Yuyuan many times

36
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,599
but I never knew

37
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,519
such a place existed.

38
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,519
That underground space

39
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,719
could be the experimental lab
in the pictures

40
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,319
of our parents and Dr. Zheng.

41
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,680
That place must have

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
many dark secrets.

43
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,480
So, I cannot end this identity I share

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,280
with Xu Xixi yet.

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,040
I need to use this identity

Xu Yongyu and Xu Xixi are still at the Xu's.

That's right. She sang very well.

Yes.

shifts with Brother Chen.

one either.

what are you doing here?

63
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:28,973
My father told me that

64
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,533
there's a secret base underground.

65
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,692
I find it interesting

66
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:35,773
and want to have a look.

67
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:37,853
Your father told you that?

68
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:39,733
Otherwise?

69
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:46,533
Or is there

70
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:49,733
something my father cannot tell me

71
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,812
about Yuyuan Biotechnology?

72
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:57,853
Of course not.

73
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,492
Everything your father does

74
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:01,692
is for you.

75
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:03,572
That's right then.

76
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,093
Open the door. Quick.

77
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:08,173
I'm afraid I cannot help.

Every time I enter,

79
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,572
I'll need temporary authorisation
from your father's main system

80
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:14,692
in order to enter.

81
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:21,413
Is it that simple?

82
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:24,413
I'll go to my father's office now then.

83
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:26,213
I know the computer password anyway.

84
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:27,093
Not his office.

00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:38,932
if you're really interested,

87
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,452
why don't you get your father
to take you himself?

88
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:45,572
I'll head off first.

89
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:06,533
Sir,

90
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:08,692
we found a dentist nearby.

91
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:11,012
Ms. Xu consulted him recently.

92
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:12,293
These are the consultation records.

93
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:14,773
The diagnosis is inflammation
of the wisdom tooth.

94
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:16,612
So, we are almost certain

95
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:17,973
she's that child.

96
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:24,612
An Yemi made a good move.

97
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:27,093
She used the car accident

98
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:31,012
to plant that child right
before my eyes.

99
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,093
Xixi should have returned

100
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,132
the day of the check up.

101
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:41,653
They then switched
identities after that.

102
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:44,052
The doppleganger appeared before me.

103
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,093
I don't get it.

104
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,132
Why did Ms. Xu hide

105
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,653
the truth for them?

106
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:56,853
Xixi must have been fooled

107
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:58,973
by their story of the
existence of twins.

108
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,333
Xixi is so naive.

109
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:03,372
Seeing that there is a girl

110
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:04,733
that looks exactly like her,

111
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,333
she wouldn't have doubted it.

112
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:11,173
I'll send someone to
catch that child now.

113
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:12,973
No need for that.

114
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,893
Since they wanted to switch,

115
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,653
she will definitely
appear before me again.

116
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,932
Print me a copy of

117
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:22,733
Xixi's schedule lately.

118
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:25,333
If they switch identities again,

119
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:28,173
we'll catch them.

120
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:34,093
Thank you for the song recording today.

121
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:36,293
This is what we promised each other.

122
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,492

00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,733
Xixi switched identities
with that child.

I'm afraid

135
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,013
she will use Xixi's identity

I don't know why you're so worried.

00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:16,692
So what if my father knows?

Even if he dislikes An Yue,

she's still his daughter.

That's true.

I know it has nothing to do with you.

167
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,332
Why?

168
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:59,893
Because An Yue never suspected you.

169
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:01,812
So, I trust you too.

170
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,572
Does she trust me that much?

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,980
(Ding Beifan)

172
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:16,052
(Hello?)

173
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,493
(Did you manage to speak to An Yue?)

174
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:18,812
I need you and Tian Sui's help.

175
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:19,653
(Go on.)

176
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:20,732
Lu Jinyan,

177
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:22,373
I can help you too.

178
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:24,052
I hate

179
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:25,332
owing people favours.

180
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:27,692
Take it as me repaying the
debt I owe her.

181
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:37,373
Mr. Xu,

182
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:38,893
are you sure she's that child?

183
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:39,732
I'm certain.

184
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:41,413
No wonder.

185
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:46,932
What do you mean?

186
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:51,133
Two days ago, I ran into Xixi
at the lift lobby.

187
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,852
She said you told her about
the underground space

188
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:54,972
and wanted to have a look.

189
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:57,413
I found it peculiar

190
00:11:57,692 --> 00:11:58,653
but didn't think too much of it.

191
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,052
Now, it seems like

192
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,253
if that wasn't Xixi

193
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,013
and she was the other child,

194
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:08,572
everything makes sense.

195
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:19,133
It seems she has unearthed many things.

196
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,133
So, we cannot keep her any longer.

197
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:26,452
Someone will send her over
in 20 minutes.

198
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:27,732
After inspection,

199
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:28,932
once you have confirmed
she's that child,

200
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:30,932
take her down immediately
and lock her up.

201
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:33,092
All right.

202
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:38,972
Operate as soon as possible.

203
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,212
Stop the car.

204
00:12:57,812 --> 00:12:59,293
Quick. Stop the car.
I'm feeling unwell.

205
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:03,373
Ms. Xu, hold on a little more.

206
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:04,212
We're almost there.

207
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,413
Can you wind down the windows?

208
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:11,732
I need some air.

209
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,613
Help me pick up the medicine. Quick!

210
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:40,413
I cannot take it. It's so painful.

211
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:42,852
Hurry!

212
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
(Please help me contact...)

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,070
(An Yue)

214
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,740
(An Yue)

215
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:23,893
Where are you now?

216
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:24,692
I'll come over right now.

217
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,253
I'm not her.

218
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:30,173
Earlier, someone tossed a cell phone out

219
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:31,773
(and wrote to call this number.)

220
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:34,533
May I ask which road are you on now?

221
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:37,572
Guang'an Xi Road.

222
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,160
(Ding Beifan)

223
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:43,052
(Ding Beifan)
Beifan,

224
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:44,613
(Ding Beifan)
I have An Yue's location.

225
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,452
I need you and Tian Sui to work with me.

226
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:05,932
Stop. Stop.

227
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:12,692
There's construction up ahead.
Please wait for two minutes.

228
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:28,493
I said there's construction up ahead.

229
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:29,572
It'll take just two minutes.

230
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,013
Don't move.

231
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:33,413
Is this the traffic police?

232
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:34,692
Could you come over for a bit?

233
00:15:35,173 --> 00:15:35,972
There's a driver here

234
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:37,212
who isn't willing to cooperate with us.

235
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:38,373
That's not it.

236
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:39,493
We're really rushing for time.

237
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:40,773
There's a patient in the car.

238
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:42,812
What are you talking about?

239
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,212
There's no one in the car.

240
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,413
Quick. Let's go.

241
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:18,452
Where did my father
ask you to send me?

242
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:20,173
Let's go. Don't waste time.

243
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:22,613
All right.

244
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:51,533
How did it go?

245
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,133
The results are out.

246
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,013
It's Xixi herself.

247
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:56,293
It's not that child.

248
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:08,373
Xixi.

249
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:25,853
Where is she?

250
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:35,012
She...

251
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:38,972
Who?

252
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:41,613
I don't know what you're talking about.

253
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:44,732
Don't act dumb to me.

254
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:48,012
The one who looks like you

255
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:49,772
and switched identities with you.

256
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:51,653
Where is she?

257
00:17:58,053 --> 00:17:59,413
Then, you tell me first.

258
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,573
Who is she?

259
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:04,972
Are we really twins?

260
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,932
Why did I not know of all this?

261
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:15,292
You don't have to know.

262
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:17,613
You just have to know

263
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:22,012
everything I do is for you.

264
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,613
For me?

265
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:32,732
Do you even know what I want?

266
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:37,053
That's just what you want.

267
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,133
I don't want all this.

268
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:40,653
Xixi.

269
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,492
I don't want to live.

270
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:42,012
Xixi.

271
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,573
I don't want to live.

272
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,972
Xixi.

273
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,133
Xixi.

274
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,373
I don't want to live.

275
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,292
I don't want to live like this.

276
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:54,813
Let me go.

277
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:06,772
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:09,613
Father, I'm sorry.

279
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:14,212
I'm not blaming you.

280
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,573
After each checkup,

281
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,692
I am in so much pain.

282
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:32,012
Xixi, it's all right.

283
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:35,212
I promise you.

284
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:38,333
Very soon,

285
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:42,173
you won't have to suffer anymore.

286
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,893
You don't have to come here anymore.

287
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:50,373
You will be healthier than

288
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:54,972
many others.

289
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:09,012
Father,

290
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,093
if I die,

291
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:21,212
what will happen to you?

292
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:20,452
(Hello, Xixi?)

293
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:24,333
I have a live interview
the day after tomorrow.

294
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:27,972
I want to use this opportunity

295
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:31,413
to bring my father onto the show.

296
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:37,893
I want to spend some time

297
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:40,853
with my father in my final days.

298
00:22:43,692 --> 00:22:45,292
So, for this interview,

299
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,573
we don't have to switch.

300
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:02,853
(The popular singer, Xu Xixi,
surprises all.)

301
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:04,893
(Is she using her twin sister to debut
or a stand-in singer?)
