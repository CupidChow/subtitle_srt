1
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,160
I bought Tian Sui flowers.

2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,239
Here it is.

3
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,039
Congratulations.

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,280
Come.

5
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,479
It was unlucky that

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,960
I encountered a strong opponent,

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,520
but we reached an agreement that

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,479
we will compete fairly.

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,640
All the best then.

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,479
That's all for my presentation.

11
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,159
It's your turn.

12
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,760
Xu Yongyu will invite a medical team to

13
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,680
conduct a physical examination
on An Yue in the country.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,040
Xu Yongyu attaches
great importance to this examination.

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
There might be
something wrong, I suppose.

16
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,760
Here is a new task for you.

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,560
This is the information
about Xu Xixi's medical team.

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,400
Take a look and see
if there is any findings.

19
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,620
=Love of Replica=

20
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,140
=Episode 6=

21
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:25,949
What's the matter?

22
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,628
I wanted to go somewhere today.

23
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,140
(Blossom)

24
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,068
I almost misunderstood
the situation today,

25
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,028
but luckily these photos reminded me.

26
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,309
Here are some fansite pictures

27
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,468
I collected from the fans group chat

28
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:24,348
when I was writing the proposal for

29
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,668
"the Bodyguard and the Miss".

30
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:27,829
Lu Jinyan had started stalking Xu Xixi

31
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,108
before he began his job

32
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:31,709
as a bodyguard at Family Xu.

33
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:34,668
So, Lu Jinyan,

34
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:37,509
could you please tell me

35
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,908
the reason you work for Family Xu?

36
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,949
So I suspect that

37
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:46,829
he must have some other intentions.

38
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,348
I've already knew that

39
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,949
Lu Jinyan likes Xu Xixi.

40
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,389
And everyone tacitly approves that.

41
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,228
When Xu Yongyu had one daughter,

42
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,668
only you were certain that

43
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:01,709
I'm not Xu Xixi.

44
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,189
Is it just because you likes her,

45
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,108
so you treat me

46
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:08,829
as a substitute of her?

47
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,629
If you refuse to
tell the truth, nevermind.

48
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,309
I also hold a lot of secrets.

49
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:30,468
But as long as you ask me,

50
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,348
I'll tell you the truth honestly.

51
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:37,869
So, any questions for me?

52
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:43,348
No.

53
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:01,548
I see.

54
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:52,389
Paparazzi!

55
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:55,788
Follow them!

56
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:56,428
Yes.

57
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,468
Where are them?

58
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,629
Just an instant and they are missing.

59
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:08,389
Let's check on there.

60
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,028
Sure.

61
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:11,028
The crowd is still there.

62
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:45,428
Let's hide ourselves there.

63
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,829
Are you afraid of dark?

64
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:12,869
No.

65
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:13,749
But I'm afraid.

66
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:21,949
An Yue.

67
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:24,988
Regarding what you questioned me

68
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,028
in the cinema just now,

69
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,588
I can actually make up
of different answers for that.

70
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,308
But I gave up in the end.

71
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:36,589
Why?

72
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:39,308
Because I don't want to lie to you.

73
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:41,869
What I'm doing now

74
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:43,589
is like moving forward in the dark,

75
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,229
and you are the
beam of light that lights me up.

76
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,509
Please don't go.

77
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:49,989
I'm scared if there is no light.

78
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,749
Tell me the secrets in the dark

79
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:58,509
when only you feel
it's the right time to tell.

80
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:00,948
If I were the beam
of light that lights you up,

81
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,269
what about Xu Xixi?

82
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:08,109
What is she to you?

83
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:12,469
I never ever treat you

84
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,828
as a substitute of Xu Xixi.

85
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:18,589
Then what about your feelings...

86
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,269
I never ever have feelings for Xu Xixi.

87
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,509
This is actually a ghost market.

88
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:38,229
A ghost market?

89
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:40,629
A market that
doesn't switch on the lights.

90
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:41,668
It's really fun.

91
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:45,708
It's sugar figurines.

92
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,188
Mr. Wang's sugar figurines.

93
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,269
Come, take a look.

94
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,269
Look at this figurine.

95
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:51,109
What kind do you like?

96
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:53,548
I would like a star.

97
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,349
A star-shaped sugar figurine please.

98
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:55,908
Sure.

99
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:18,229
This is for you.

100
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,109
Take it.

101
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:20,149
Thanks.

102
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:21,188
Thanks.

103
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:21,749
You are welcome.

104
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,269
Pinwheels here.

105
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,149
Look at there.

106
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:36,749
It's beautiful. Let's buy one.

107
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:38,869
Let's go there.

108
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:43,349
Old-fashioned cell phones.

109
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,229
Quite old-fashioned.

110
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:46,509
Look at that.

111
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:47,389
Look at this.

112
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:50,548
How is this made?

113
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,668
The sugar is melting.
Why haven't you start having it?

114
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:02,389
It melts before
I'm able to give it to you.

115
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:04,749
It is for me?

116
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:08,308
You said that you're scared

117
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:10,308
if there is no light, didn't you?

118
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,548
So I'm thinking
of something romantic.

119
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,109
When we walk through

120
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,308
the dark and narrow alley later,

121
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:17,989
I'll give you a bundle of starlight.

122
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:24,989
I received

123
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:27,389
the bundle of starlight from you.

Hi,

141
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:15,109
I'm your date today.

142
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:16,269
My name is Zhang Jingchuan.

143
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:17,989
Just call me Jingchuan.

144
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:30,428
Pick one.

145
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,269
What is this?

146
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:34,389
A dating routine.

147
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,068
Where is the promised tale?

148
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:37,349
So this is an award
for covering up another gossip.

149
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:38,989
You can't go back on your word.

150
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:40,349
Of course I wouldn't.

151
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,188
But I forget it.

152
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,308
I will pick this then.

153
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:43,469
For tomorrow afternoon,

154
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,668
I don't have to go to
the dating show recording.

155
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:48,668
All right.

156
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:19,869
Do you feel hot?

157
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:21,028
Ding Beifan,

158
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,668
don't you know how
many degrees it is today?

159
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:24,229
Yet, you still
choose an outdoor activity.

160
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:26,469
It wasn't me who chose that.

161
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:27,428
You picked it by yourself.

162
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:31,149
What were the other two options?

163
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:35,389
Biking around the island

164
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:38,589
and mountain camping.

165
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:39,989
How do you think?

166
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:41,629
Don't you think you are quite lucky?

167
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:43,389
Thanks but no thanks.

168
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,589
It's a good weather
to take a sunbath.

169
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:47,708
For supplementing
calcium and health's sake.

170
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,149
Don't just sit and
enjoy the aircorn in the office.

171
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,548
It's not healthy
for your neck and shoulders.

172
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:55,229
You can't see anything
wearing sunglasses.

173
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,708
Let's go, I'll take you
boating to see the scenery.

174
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:02,269
Don't take my hands.
I can walk on myself.

175
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:06,068
I've read the new proposal.

176
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:07,269
For now, it hasn't
reached the minimum requirement.

177
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:09,509
Kindly send me the
new proposal by this Friday.

178
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:16,668
I've acknowledged the new plan.

179
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:18,828
It clashes with the second programme.

180
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,749
Quickly communicate
with the programme department.

181
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,149
Respond me by tomorrow.

182
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:30,749
Ding Beifan, what's wrong with you?

183
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,668
Don't be angry.

184
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:34,629
Take a good rest
since you are on a vacation.

185
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:35,668
Even if

186
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,349
you don't work for a day,

187
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:38,869
the company wouldn't bankrupt, right?

188
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:39,749
Ding Beifan,

189
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:40,948
can't you take note of

190
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,869
the boundaries
of interpersonal relationships?

191
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,428
Don't always make
decisions for me presumptuously.

192
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:48,068
I'm not.

193
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,749
I just feel sorry for you.

194
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:07,469
I actually noted the work shift
arranged by human resource department.

195
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:10,269
Since you become
the talent agent of Xu Xixi,

196
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:12,389
you haven't got a real chance to rest.

197
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:14,109
But I am not tired.

198
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:17,708
Is it you are not tired

199
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,349
or you shouldn't be tired?

200
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,109
Actually, I've thought of

201
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,629
bringing you to enjoying
good food at high-class restaurants.

202
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:17,349
Or shopping at malls, perhaps.

203
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,268
But in the end,

204
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,149
I chose here anyway.

205
00:17:21,988 --> 00:17:23,029
Because I hope

206
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:24,228
you can take a good rest

207
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:25,428
at somewhere you
wouldn't be disturbed by anyone.

208
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,948
This is the dating agenda

209
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,589
I arranged for today.

210
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:30,948
How do you think?

211
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,380
(Future Recreation)

212
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:57,589
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang.

213
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,428
Ms. Tian is on leave today,
she isn't at the company.

214
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:01,468
On leave?

215
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,589
Thank you then.

216
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,629
Please help me to pass this to her.

217
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:08,468
Sure.

218
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:27,668
Why is she switching off her phone?

219
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:29,708
She never switches off her phone.

220
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,549
Is there anything going wrong?

221
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,900
(Tian Sui)

222
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:00,988
You deserve what

223
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:02,948
other children deserve.

224
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:04,349
Thanks.

225
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:09,268
Taste this.

226
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,069
Does it taste good?

227
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:18,948
Let me taste it too.

228
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:40,468
What's wrong?

229
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:42,948
What's wrong?

230
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:43,869
I'm sorry, director.

231
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:44,629
Sorry.

232
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,069
We will do another one.

233
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:47,508
One more time.

234
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:47,948
Please do another one for us.

235
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:49,748
Once again.

236
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:09,549
Once again.

237
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:17,109
Thank you so much.

238
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:19,268
This is the most relaxed

239
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:20,869
I have been in a long time.

240
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,309
You will only

241
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,668
be even relaxed by following my steps.

242
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,149
So Ms. Tian,

243
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:28,708
when will be our next date?

244
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:30,988
Don't take advantage of the situation.

245
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:32,589
Just because of your behavior of

246
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:33,988
throwing my phone into
the lake without my permission today,

247
00:20:33,988 --> 00:20:35,268
there will not be a next time.

248
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:37,988
Don't you dare to bet with me that

249
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,629
if I manage to find your phone back,

250
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:43,789
you'll have to date
with me for the second time.

251
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:44,508
Do you dare?

252
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:46,629
You've already thrown it.

253
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,149
How could it possible to find it back?

254
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:53,988
You store so many data on it.

255
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,309
How could I really throw it?

256
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:57,829
So when is our next date?

257
00:20:58,349 --> 00:20:59,668
Give my phone back to me.

258
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:00,948
Give it back to me first.

259
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,268
If you agree with the date.

260
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,589
Ding Beifan.

261
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,668
Give it back to me.

262
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:07,508
I just don't.

263
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:09,869
You better give it back to me.

264
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,980
(Tian Sui)

265
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:13,908
Ding Beifan.

266
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:14,988
Agree with the date then.

267
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:15,748
Date with me.

268
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:16,309
Give it back to me.

269
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,109
If you date with me.

270
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:18,869
So childish of you.

271
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:20,708
Faster, give it back to me.

272
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,589
Then agree to go on a date with me.

273
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:22,549
Never.

274
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,309
Give it back to me first.

275
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:24,309
Willing to bet and
accept the consequences.

276
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,708
Sure. Give it back to me first.

277
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,340
(Jiang Tiancheng)

278
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,589
Did you specially come to me

279
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,948
because you find me
switching off my phone?

280
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,629
No.

281
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:10,869
I'm here to see a friend.

282
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,908
I thought you were in a meeting

283
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:14,789
since your phone was off.

284
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:17,228
But do you know that

285
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:18,869
I never switch off my phone?

286
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:22,549
Yes.

287
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:24,668
It's actually nothing.

288
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:28,309
Just want to dial you and tell you that

289
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,789
I have an appointment
with someone today.

290
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:32,908
The barbeque stall
wouldn't open tonight.

291
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:38,869
I forgot to introduce.

292
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,748
This is Ding Beifan, my assistant.

293
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:50,349
This is my friend, Jiang Tiancheng.

294
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,428
Hi.

295
00:22:57,268 --> 00:22:58,228
I have to answer a call.

296
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,309
Ms. Tian,

297
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,309
the proposal of the promotion
of Xu Xixi's album has been done.

298
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:11,668
And I have sent it to your mailbox.

299
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:12,869
Okay.

300
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,109
Why don't you admit it?

301
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:19,109
What should I admit?

302
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,268
Admit that you are here

303
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:24,268
because you worry about her.

304
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,869
It couldn't be me the factor that

305
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,468
make you feel embarrassed.

306
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,389
I know you don't mean it.

307
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:39,869
But you are interesting, too.

308
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,629
Before, you emphatically stated

309
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:43,948
that you wanted to
compete fairly with me.

310
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,508
But why don't I
see any actions from you?

311
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,468
You're a weirdo too.

312
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:54,149
Why do you always
tell me everything so directly?

313
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,708
Is there anything
can't be told so directly?

314
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:01,069
If you still don't take any actions yet,

315
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,428
I will be the one who success.

316
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,069
Approximately in a year,

317
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:07,589
the hyperplasia caused by shrapnel

318
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,188
would compress the brain's
main artery, and it would rupture.

319
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,988
There is a little chance
of success for this surgery.

320
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:12,988
But we also can't sit here and waiting.

321
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:14,589
We can't delay it anymore.

322
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:15,708
Uncle Jiang,

323
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:18,029
please don't tell anyone first

324
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,748
about my current situation.

325
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:23,988
Let me consider about it.

326
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:32,228
Sure.

327
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,109
But, no matter you
want to do the surgery or not,

328
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:38,069
please make the
decision as soon as possible.

329
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:40,708
So I can adjust
the treatment plan for you.

330
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,389
All right, I see.

331
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:45,668
Talk to you later.

332
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:47,268
Okay.

333
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:02,629
That's also good.

334
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:06,869
As long as she is happy,
that would be enough for me.

335
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:30,389
Was the darts fun to play?

336
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:38,228
Is the marsh mellow tasty?

337
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:50,149
Taste it and you will know it.

338
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,580
♪What should I say
What should I tell you♪

339
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,980

(The effect for the
dating show is not bad so far.)

351
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,948
(We would like to take this
opportunity to publish an album.)

352
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:20,188
(This is the cover for
the album. Please take a look.)

353
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:21,668
(And tell me your thoughts.)

354
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,060
(My bones buried in the tree
under the Tree Gin.)

355
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:27,149
"Tree Gin"

356
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:30,789
I might have

357
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,948
read the story from somewhere else.

358
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:40,268
You have bought the books.

359
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:43,389
Are we going home or hotel now?

360
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,780
(The Tree Gin)

361
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:57,508
The Tree Gin.

362
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:00,109
My mother she killed me.

363
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:03,389
My father he hate me.

364
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:05,948
My little sister, Marlin,

365
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,549
she picked up all my bones,

366
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:11,829
tied them in a silken handkerchief,

367
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:16,228
buried them in the tree
under The Tree Gin,

368
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,268
Kywitt, kywitt,

369
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:21,309
what a beautiful bird!

370
00:28:26,268 --> 00:28:26,948
Bear in mind.

371
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,708
I will wait for you

372
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:29,988
under the juniper tree.

373
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:38,748
We will go to
the scene of the car accident.

374
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:40,468
Juniper tree.

375
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:41,869
I must have heard that before.

376
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:06,549
I have a gut instinct that

377
00:29:08,508 --> 00:29:10,349
I am familiar with that place.

378
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,389
And I even witnessed the car accident.

379
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,508
After Xu Xixi's car falls into the sea.

380
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:17,309
You will dive into the sea.

381
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:18,549
And I will bring her away.

382
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,069
You will go back to
Family Xu pretending you are her.

383
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:30,668
Who is she?

384
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:33,629
Yongyu Capital's Miss, Xu Xixi.

385
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:39,789
You have to imitate Xu Xixi's

386
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:41,708
speech, behaviour, and demeanour.

387
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,268
It is a must to be exactly like her.

388
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:47,829
After entering their house,

389
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,988
you have to flip over
Xu Xixi's music sheets.

390
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,629
She jotted down what happened
to her and her mood everyday

391
00:29:54,948 --> 00:29:56,149
only on music sheets.

392
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:59,508
The Tree Gin.

393
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:01,908
My mother she killed me.

394
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:05,069
My father he hate me.

395
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:06,349
Are you okay?

396
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,309
Are you not feeling well?

397
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:15,789
I'm fine.

398
00:30:17,908 --> 00:30:19,188
I was just absent-minded a moment ago.

399
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:25,508
(It seems like it's
my mom who plans everything.)

400
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:27,748
(Should I tell him?)

401
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,468
(No.)

402
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:33,349
(I need to find my mom first.)

403
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:35,668
(To make everything clear.)

404
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,589
Did you recall something?

405
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:47,349
Nothing.

406
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,589
I just feel like

407
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:55,268
the ocean is scary.
