1
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,239
She's terminally ill

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,960
and doesn't have much longer to live.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,000
Who

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,920
is she?

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,519
Xu Xixi, the daughter
of Yongyu Capital.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,559
From now on,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,079
you have to imitate her behaviour,
her expressions, her habits,

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,719
until you can replace her

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,719
as Ms. Xu.

10
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,479
I don't know what you're up to,

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,399
but I won't do as you say.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,920
This is for your own good.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,280
For my own good?

14
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,600
Which mother

15
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,519
would do this to her child?

16
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,159
When I was a child, I even wondered

17
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,000
whether I was your child or not.

18
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,920
Of course you are my child.

19
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,640
Still, you have to be Xu Xixi.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,439
You have no choice.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,120
Otherwise, both of us will die.

22
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,480
Ms. Xu, take care.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,280
All right.

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,040
Go ahead.

25
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,879
But they just left.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,719
If you can't even fool them,

27
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,680
how can you fool Xu Yongyu?

28
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,000
Come on. Just go.

29
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,400
Ms. Xu.

30
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,199
Call out all the people who
were involved in the project.

31
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,360
Okay.

32
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,560
Ms. Xu.

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Are you sure you want to
do the same project again?

34
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,039
Your cuticle is thin,

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,599
if you cleanse it repeatedly...

36
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,680
Can you hear?

37
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,039
Since you're not deaf,

38
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,080
do I have to repeat myself?

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,439
Sorry.

40
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,439
We will have it ready.

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,240
This way, please.

44
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,500
(Unknown number)

45
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:33,710
(Why is my dad's phone)

46
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,950
(ringing at this time?)

47
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,030
(Who is it?)

48
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,740
(Jiang Tiancheng)

49
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,749
Tiancheng?

50
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,610
Can you check

51
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,610
the location of this
phone number for me?

52
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,850
Wait,

53
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,880
he called on my dad's cell phone.

54
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,480
(The only person in the world
who loves me is gone)

55
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,680
(and the person I love has
never been honest with me.)

56
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,610
(Since no one cares about An Yue's existence,)

57
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,650
(as you wish,)

58
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,170
(there will be only
Xu Xixi from now on.)

59
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Old man.

60
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,730
I regained my memory.

61
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:39,880
Really?

62
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,170
So,

63
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
do you recall the illness too?

64
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,680
Yes.

65
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,050
I don't have many days
left to live, do I?

66
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,480
Don't talk nonsense.

67
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,680
Xixi.

68
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,770
Don't do stupid things again.

69
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
Even if I don't,

70
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,210
someone is still going to kidnap me

71
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,050
and kill me.

72
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,650
I promise you.

73
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,090
What happened yesterday

74
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,680
will never be repeated.

75
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,120
What about that woman?

76
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,210
Is she

77
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,850
really dead?

78
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,170
That wicked woman

79
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,530
deserved to die.

80
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,560
What's wrong?

81
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,410
I'm just a little scared.

82
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,850
By the way,

83
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
why did you sneak off to
Qingling Mountain yesterday

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,680
and deliberately leave Lu Jinyan behind?

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Well,

86
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,320
I went on a date with Jingchuan.

87
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,880
He asked me out for a sleepover.

88
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,650
How awkward it would be

89
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,360
if Lu Jinyan was there.

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,610
Is he the guy you
worked with on the show?

91
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,610
Do you have a crush on him?

92
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,050
Can't I?

93
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,090
He is much more
considerate than Lu Jinyan.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,730
By the way,

95
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,960
I want to replace Lu Jinyan.

96
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,440
Why did you change me suddenly?

97
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,290
The first basic principle of a bodyguard

98
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,530
is to protect the safety of his client.

99
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,250
If you can't even do that,

100
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,890
what qualifies you to be by my side?

101
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,010
I know how hard it
must be for you right now.

102
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,680
Who do you think you are?

103
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,760
Don't think you know me well.

104
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,570
Listen.

105
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,640
I'm fine now

106
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,400
and I know exactly

107
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
what I want to do.

108
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,640
What are you going to do?

109
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,210
I want to be Xu Xixi.

110
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,850
So please don't get in my way.

111
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,360
Let Xixi learn self-defence from you?

112
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,330
Yes, sir.

113
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,930
After yesterday's kidnapping,

114
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,360
I think Ms. Xu

115
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,570
could learn some self-defence skills.

116
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,720
During my suspension,

117
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,050
I had nothing else to do but coordinate

118
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,930
the return of the medical team.

119
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,850
I can teach her.

120
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,880
All right.

121
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,970
However,

122
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,050
you mustn't forget
about the medical team.

123
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,090
They will return in three days.

124
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,120
There is no room

125
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,570
for error in this matter.

126
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,810
Yes, sir.

127
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,910
Let go.

128
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,630
I don't want to learn self-defense.

129
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,670
This is Mr. Xu's order.

130
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,350
Don't use him to pressure me.

131
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,110
I said no.

132
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,790
The most effective
self-defence technique

133
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,070
is to use the hardest part

134
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,390
to hit the vulnerable part of the body.

135
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,910
Temple, neck, chest.

136
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,110
Let go.

137
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,430
I don't have time for this.

138
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,430
Then try to break free from me.

139
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,070
Lu Jinyan.

140
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,190
Do you know why I don't want to learn?

141
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,990
Because I don't even want to see you,

142
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,150
let alone be near you.

143
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,550
Are you crazy?

144
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,110
It's full of surveillance.

145
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,950
This is the blind spot.

146
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,990
Xu Yongyu won't see it.

147
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,550
It's okay.

148
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,910
If you're frustrated, let it out.

149
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,590
I promise you'll be fine.

150
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,270
Do you think this is funny?

151
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,870
Do you think I'm pretending to be strong

152
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,350
and need your comfort

153
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,310
and venting?

154
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,590
If you don't feel like it,

155
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,190
then try to push me away.

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,070
It is An Yue.

174
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,030
No wonder.

175
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,310
We didn't get a single photo yesterday.

176
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,110
Please return the deposit.

177
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,430
Just we didn't
get a shot yesterday,

178
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,470
it doesn't mean we can't get one today.

179
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,430
What do you mean?

180
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,670
Look at this.

181
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,790
(Newcomer, named Xu, has been kidnapped
in Qingling Mountain.)

182
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,470
Xu Xixi was kidnapped.

183
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,590
As a boyfriend,

184
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,750
shouldn't you be concerned?

185
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,180
(Newcomer, named Xu, has been kidnapped
in Qingling Mountain.)

186
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,070
No,

187
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,910
we arranged to meet
at Qing Ling Mountain.

188
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,550
Why did she go to Qingling Mountain?

189
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,990
Yes, I wonder about that too.

190
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,870
I heard you on the phone yesterday

191
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,390
when you were planning your date.

192
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,470
Unless...

193
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,110
Unless she was just toying with me,

194
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,950
using me

195
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,630
as a shield from the start.

196
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,870
Are you saying that

197
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,710
she went to Qingling Mountain
for another purpose?

198
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,350
Perhaps she went to see

199
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,430
someone important to her.

200
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,430
Who?

201
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,470
Do you think I'm stupid?

202
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,150
How can I tell you

203
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,190
something so important?

204
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,590
I'm going to use this

205
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,830
to get a good grip on Xu Xixi.

206
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,430
(An unidentified woman's body)

207
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,590
(was recovered from the waters off)

208
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,390
(Qingling Bay early this morning.)

209
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,670
(The police are currently investigating)

210
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,030
(a suspected connection to a kidnapping.)

211
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,950
That report is false.

212
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,190
Aunt An couldn't have
kidnapped her own daughter.

213
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,590
She couldn't have failed
to recognise An Yue.

214
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,270
She...

215
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,150
Sorry, I...

216
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,670
I don't know how to explain this to you.

217
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,950
You don't have to.

218
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,950
I will cancel

219
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,910
all her jobs.

220
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,030
You two should have a good rest.

221
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,830
About Mr. Xu...

222
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,590
I'll handle it.

223
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,470
Close the door.

224
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,150
Why did you call me here?

225
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,710
It's okay.

226
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,790
I am here.

227
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,510
I'm fine.

228
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,430
Let's go home

229
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,070
and see Aunt An off for the last time.

230
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,510
I'm not going.

231
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,630
Don't worry.

232
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,750
Tian Sui will deal

233
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,430
with Xu Yongyu.

234
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,910
(You stood me up yesterday)

235
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,630
(to meet someone at
Qingling Mountain, right?)

236
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,070
I've got things to do.

237
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,430
So I'll be off.

238
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,190
What is it?

239
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,750
What is

240
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,830
more important than your mother?

241
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,750
There is.

242
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,470
To become Xu Xixi.

243
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,030
To become Xu Xixi?

244
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,350
Yueyue, Aunt An brought
you up by herself.

245
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,590
Now she's dead,

246
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,470
you don't even go back to see her.

247
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,550
You only care about
being Ms. Xu, don't you?

248
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,110
An Yue.

249
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,310
Don't you feel sorry for her?

250
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,390
Everything I do now

251
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,950
is to be worthy of her.

252
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,430
Ding Beifan.

253
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,750
Can't you see?

254
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,590
She is the one who suffers the most.

255
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,590
Give her some space to be alone.

256
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,150
I'm just afraid

257
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,870
she'll go off the rails.

258
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,190
Where is An Yue?

259
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,670
She just left.

260
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,550
Didn't you run into her?

261
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,870
Wait.

262
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,510
I think something is wrong with An Yue.

263
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,270
I don't know what she's been through,

264
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,550
but she

265
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,310
doesn't look like herself anymore.

266
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,870
It was my fault.

267
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,710
Don't worry. I will bring her back.

268
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,670
I have something to tell you.

269
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,070
Why are you standing still? Stop him.

270
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,030
Don't let him come near me

271
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,470
without my permission.

272
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,590
Yes.

273
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,310
(Xixi.)

274
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,150
(I knew you'd be eager)

275
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,030
(to call me.)

276
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,190
Jingchuan, I want to see you.

277
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,830
I have something to
say to you in person.

278
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,390
Get out of the way.

279
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,750
I'm sorry, Lu.

280
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,590
We are brothers.

281
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,590
I don't want to fight with you.

282
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,550
We neither,

283
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,470
but if you continue to follow Ms. Xu,

284
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,070
we'll have no choice but to take action.

285
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,630
You had arranged to
meet at Qingling Mountain,

286
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,990
but you were afraid those men

287
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,230
would find out and tell your father.

288
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,630
So you used me as a cover for you.

289
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,590
Qingling Mountain.

290
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,950
Qing Ling Mountain.

291
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,190
Xixi.

292
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,270
That was a good move,

293
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,790
but I had to make two trips
up and down the mountain

294
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,310
and my legs are still sore.

295
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,310
When did you find out about it?

296
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,430
I knew it during the variety show.

297
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,750
He's been watching you, hasn't he?

298
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,030
Who else knows about it?

299
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,950
It depends on your sincerity.

300
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,510
I was going to

301
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,110
go straight to see Mr. Xu today,

302
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,950
but I'm too soft-hearted.

303
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,430
I've heard a lot about

304
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,270
Mr. Xu's style of handling things.

305
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,070
I can't even imagine

306
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,350
what would happen if he found out

307
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,310
that his baby girl

308
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,030
was dating a poor bodyguard

309
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,710
and was kidnapped.

310
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,310
Yes, you are right.

311
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,750
I did go to see Lu Jinyan that day,

312
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,390
but we weren't having a date,

313
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,110
we were breaking up.

314
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,950
Breaking up?

315
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,790
We broke up.

316
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,670
Can't you see I've changed my bodyguard?

317
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,750
Zhang Jingchuan.

318
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,510
I didn't know you had the guts

319
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,550
to threaten me before.

320
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,030
If I send

321
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,190
this recording of you
threatening me to my dad,

322
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,030
I don't know

323
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,990
what he'll do.

324
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,430
After all, my father

325
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,710
is not very good-tempered,

326
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,270
especially when he knows
someone is messing...

327
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,030
Xixi.

328
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,070
I was just joking.

329
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,670
Don't take it seriously, okay?

330
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,790
Then forget about
the matter of Qingling Mountain.

331
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,790
I'm sorry, Lu.

332
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,190
Well, Xixi,

333
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,710
if there's nothing else,

334
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,550
I'll be off.

335
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,350
What's the hurry?

336
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,950
I need you to do me a favour.

337
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,310
At your service.

338
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,350
Ms. Xu ordered us to stop you.

339
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,870
It's okay.

340
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,710
Let's play by the rules.

341
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,950
I hate guys who keep
pestering me after a breakup.

342
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,030
I want you to pretend to be my boyfriend

343
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,510
and get rid of him.

344
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,070
What?

345
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,750
Are you not willing?

346
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,430
No.

347
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,190
That's not it, Xixi.

348
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,350
I'm afraid that he will...

349
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,470
What are you afraid of?

350
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,190
With me and my dad around,

351
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,430
Lu Jinyan won't dare
to do anything to you.

352
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,390
However, if you go public and say

353
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,550
that I had an affair with him,

354
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,390
I won't be able to protect you.

355
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,190
After all, you've seen

356
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,590
what he's capable of.

357
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,470
Give me five minutes.

358
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,630
I need a chance to explain.

359
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,150
I know what you want.

360
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,150
I can help you.

361
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,350
Are you helping me or using me?

362
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,590
Lu Jinyan.

363
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,510
I don't trust you

364
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,550
and I don't need you.

365
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,990
Then you can use me,

366
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,350
just like you used him.

367
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,670
Mr. Xu wants me to
pick up the medical team

368
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,190
and they're going to
give you a full body checkup.

369
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,270
So I need to go back
and arrange it right away.

370
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,270
Clear Xixi's work schedule

371
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,550
for the next few days.

372
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,270
I want her to take a couple of days off.

373
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,230
(Is Ms. Xu's body...)

374
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,910
Tian Sui.

375
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,470
Don't ask so many questions.

376
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,510
Just do as I say.

377
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,430
I won't do the check-up.

378
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,670
Don't fool around.

379
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,310
The result will be the same anyway.

380
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,270
I don't want to waste my time.

381
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,030
Don't you care about me the most?

382
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,070
Do you want to see me

383
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,270
suffer again?

384
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,510
Xixi.

385
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,190
I can let you have your way
with everything else,

386
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,750
but not with this.

387
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,390
Dr. Zheng will be in
Lancheng in three days.

388
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,950
You must have a full medical check-up.

389
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
(Xu Xixi)

390
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,990
(Aren't you trying to let me use you?)

391
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,470
(I'm giving you a chance now.)

392
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,030
Dance with me.

393
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,270
Beware of surveillance.

394
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,310
What do you need from me?

395
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,230
With Xu Yongyu's current stance,

396
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,470
the check-up in the next
three days is inevitable.

397
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,110
Yes, Xu Xixi once resisted,

398
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,710
but Xu Yongyu never compromised.

399
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,750
Since there's no other way,

400
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,710
we now have only one option.

401
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,110
Find the real Xu Xixi

402
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,230
to switch identities with her.

403
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,590
Yes.

404
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,830
Since my mother was prepared

405
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,710
to send me back,

406
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,390
she must have left me a clue

407
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,790
as to where Xu Xixi was.

408
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,950
I need to find her.

409
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,950
Given Xu Xixi's temperament,

410
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,990
she will never cooperate.

411
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,350
I'm not sure about that,

412
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,550
but this is the only way.

413
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,950
Xu Yongyu won't let you out.

414
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,670
That's why I need your help.

415
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,190
My help alone is not enough,

416
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,270
you need Tian Sui.

417
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,150
I will talk to Tian Sui.

418
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,150
You just need to
show up at the restaurant

419
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,590
at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

420
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,390
Sir.

421
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,830
Take a look at this email
from Dr. Zheng's team.

422
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,550
It's about Ms. Xu's check-up plan.

423
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,870
Tell them to get lost.

424
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,790
I don't want to have a check-up.

425
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,070
This is

426
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,990
not negotiable.

427
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,390
Not negotiable?

428
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,510
Xixi, what are you doing?

429
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,870
Put down the knife.

430
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,270
You are always like this.

431
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,590
I have to obey you

432
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,670
and do everything you say.

433
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,990
You don't even think about my feelings.

434
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,470
I hate you.

435
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,070
I don't want to see you again!

436
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,910
Okay.

437
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,190
Okay, Xixi.

438
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,870
If you hate me,

439
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,630
I'll be gone.

440
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,910
Just put down the knife.

441
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,670
Put the knife down
and I will leave, okay?

442
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,110
Right away.

443
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,310
So what if you leave?

444
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,310
This house is full of your
informants and surveillance.

445
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,910
This place is as annoying as you are.

446
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,070
I can't take it anymore.

447
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,350
I've had enough of your control.

448
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,310
- Ms. Xixi.
- Xixi.

449
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,390
Let me go.

450
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,590
Sir, are you all right?

451
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,590
Mr. Xu.

452
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,830
Since Ms. Xu doesn't want to stay here,

453
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,430
why don't you let her
stay out for a few days?

454
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,710
I assure you.

455
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,270
I'll make sure she's safe this time.

456
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,150
What is it?

457
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,390
Here's the thing, Mr. Xu.

458
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,910
A resort hotel

459
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,950
wants to hire Xixi as their Experience Officer.

460
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,430
Didn't you tell me yesterday

461
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,710
(that you wanted to give her
a couple of days off?)

462
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,510
(I thought it would be a good opportunity)

463
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,710
(for her to stay out
for a couple of days.)

464
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,630
I'm afraid she'll feel worse

465
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,990
if she stays at home alone.

466
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,030
Okay,

467
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,870
but on one condition.

468
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,750
Lu Jinyan has to be by her side.

469
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,230
(No problem.)

470
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,990
What are you looking at?

471
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,990
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

472
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,350
Don't need to pretend at this moment.

473
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,550
To be clear,

474
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,230
you and I are just cooperative partners.

475
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,550
I was stupid

476
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,150
to think you'd really help me before.

477
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,750
Actually...

478
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,350
I'm not interested in your plight.

479
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,430
So you're not curious about

480
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,230
the phone call the other night?

481
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,910
I met with your mother the night before

482
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,710
I left for Qingling Mountain.

483
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,790
I felt something wasn't quite right,

484
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,710
not at all expecting her

485
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,430
to be prepared to sacrifice herself.

486
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,790
So she...

487
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,990
She found out that
Xu Yongyu suspected you

488
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,630
and she was very worried about you

489
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,870
and asked me to protect you.

490
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:02,990
You...

491
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,310
What are you to my father?

492
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,230
Are you guys planning something?

493
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,710
Why do you want An Yue
to pretend as Xu Xixi?

494
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,270
All I can tell you

495
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,830
is that your father and I

496
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,910
have always been on the same front.

497
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,990
We do everything we can

498
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,510
to keep An Yue

499
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,710
in good hands.

500
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,470
You really resemble your father

501
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,710
when he was young.

502
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,470
No matter what happens,

503
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,670
you will protect An Yue,

504
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,710
right?

505
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,990
Thanks.

506
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,230
My father and your mother

507
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,070
were in regular contact
before the accident.

508
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,990
They must be

509
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,070
very attached to each other.

510
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,310
Yet they have done...

511
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,030
It shows that you are

512
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,990
important to them too.

513
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,750
So

514
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,670
even for their sake,

515
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,430
for Tian Sui's

516
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,190
or Ding Beifan's sake,

517
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,030
you can't erase An Yue's existence.

518
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,390
They are all still
expecting An Yue to return.

519
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,870
How about you?

520
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,070
I am always here.

521
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,870
I've been waiting for you to use me.

522
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,550
I won't use you anymore.

523
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,430
That's okay.

524
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,110
It was my fault anyway.

525
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,270
I shouldn't have lied to you.

526
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,670
Lu Jinyan.

527
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,030
I misunderstood you.

528
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,710
I'm sorry.

529
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,190
I'm the one who should apologise.

530
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,230
I shouldn't have lied and used you.

531
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,390
I'm sorry.

532
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,470
I forgave you.

533
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,270
What now?

534
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,550
Do you remember what I told you

535
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,830
about the three bodyguard principles?

536
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,630
Bodyguards must protect
their clients unconditionally.

537
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,670
Bodyguards must

538
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,750
remain loyal to their clients.

539
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,110
Bodyguards must not have
personal feelings with their clients.

540
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,550
And remember the fourth.

541
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:12,040
♪My love in my dream♪

542
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:19,970
♪Deeply hidden in my heart,
no one can replace you♪

543
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,990
I will protect and be loyal
to An Yue unconditionally.

544
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,390
This one

545
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,630
takes precedence over
all other principles.

546
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,250
♪I feel you more♪

547
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:43,240
♪I love you more♪

548
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:49,080
♪It's always been you♪

549
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,190
Then

550
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,430
what about the term of employment?

551
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,390
Indefinite.

552
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,320
♪It's you who stay close to me to guard♪

553
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,690
♪in the name of love♪

554
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:19,080
♪Without the need
for extra consideration♪

555
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,820
♪Regardless of identity, memory or name♪

556
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,930
♪I rush towards you♪

557
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,910
I'm sorry.

558
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,390
I just

559
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,270
wanted to ask you what
you would like to eat.

560
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,190
This is not the time to eat.

561
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,870
Let's get down to the real deal.

562
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,750
Okay.

563
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,050
(An Yemi,
the project leader for the experiment)

564
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,390
Our priority now

565
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,150
is how to deal with Dr. Zheng's
examination the day after tomorrow.

566
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,950
I once saw how meticulous
he was about examination.

567
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,030
Basically, the chances of
getting through are nil.

568
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,710
Our only way now

569
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,750
is to find Xu Xixi

570
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,310
before the examination.

571
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,190
(Xu Xixi  An Yue  Twins)

572
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,550
But where is she?

573
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,150
My mother said she is free now.

574
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,710
So why doesn't she go home?

575
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,070
Unless

576
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,270
Xu Xixi is already dead.

577
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,550
No way.

578
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,150
My mom wouldn't do that.

579
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,750
There is also a most
unlikely possibility

580
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,830
that the two of them

581
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,550
were in cahoots.

582
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:54,750
You're right.

583
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,670
If it was an inside job,

584
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,870
it would explain how your mother

585
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,350
staged the accident
in front of Lu Jinyan

586
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,390
and how she secretly
switched two people in the sea.

587
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,670
Driver He.

588
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,210
(Xu Yongyu, Li Wanting, He)

589
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,710
I remember his words

590
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,070
after the accident.

591
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,790
Lu.

592
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,350
It wasn't intentional, Lu.

593
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,070
Ms. Xu ordered me to speed up.

594
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,270
I didn't notice there was a car.

595
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,630
It just came out of nowhere.

596
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,310
Lu.

597
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,710
I thought he was trying
to shirk responsibility,

598
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,230
but now it seems likely

599
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,470
that Xu Xixi made him speed up

600
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,030
in order to crash into the sea.

601
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,830
Even so,

602
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,630
we don't know where she is now.

603
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,430
(An Yemi,
the project leader for the experiment)

604
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,550
Remember.

605
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,310
Under the juniper tree.

606
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,550
I'll be waiting for you there.

607
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,010
(The Tree Gin)

608
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,190
The Tree Gin.

609
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,910
My mother, she killed me.

610
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,590
Under the juniper tree.

611
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,990
(An unidentified woman's body)

612
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,270

613
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,990

I saw the news, what happened? Did you really die?)

(Take care of yourself.
I'm sorry.)

(- The medicine has been given to you.
- Why are there so many this time? )

619

- You're being too verbose.)
