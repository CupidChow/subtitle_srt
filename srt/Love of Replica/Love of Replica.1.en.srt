Drive faster.

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,920
He, slow down now.

5
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,240
Keep Ms. Xu safe.

6
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,520
Don't forget whose driver you are.

7
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,799
Shake him off.

8
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,200
Drive faster. You hear me?

9
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,399
Yes, miss.

Xixi.

25
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,460
Xixi, how do you feel?

26
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,900
Do you feel any discomfort?

27
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,180
Who...

28
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,620
Who are you?

29
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,780
I am your dad.

30
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,980
Xixi, let the doctor
examine you first.

31
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,300
Don't worry.

32
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,300
Miss, don't worry.

33
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,300
Sir, the man has been brought in.

34
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,220
Xixi, it's okay.

35
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,540
I will wait here.

36
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,140
Measure the blood pressure.

37
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,700
Yes, doctor.

38
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Measurement begins.

39
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,860
Don't move or talk.

40
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,660
Lu.

41
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,940
It wasn't intentional, Lu.

42
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,980
Ms. Xu ordered me to speed up.

43
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,340
I didn't notice there was a car.

44
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,540
It just came out of nowhere.

45
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,020
Lu, help me.

46
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,660
If I were in the hands of Mr. Xu,

47
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,820
I might as well fall into the sea

48
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,980
like Ms. Xu.

49
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,140
Lu, help me. Lu.

50
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,580
Lu, please help me.

51
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,780
Lu.

52
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,980
It wasn't intentional, Lu.

53
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,780
Ms. Xu ordered me to speed up.

54
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,140
It just came out of nowhere.

55
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,900
Get rid of him.

56
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,300
Doctor.

57
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,980
I still can't remember anything.

58
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,140
And my head hurts

59
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,380
when I try to remember.

60
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,620
Miss, you don't have to worry.

61
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,460
These symptoms are

62
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,780
the result of the car accident,

63
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,300
post-traumatic stress disorder.

64
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,540
Memory loss is also only temporary.

65
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,340
As long as you relax

66
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,580
and get more in touch
with things you like,

67
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,620
your memories will come back slowly.

68
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,980
Okay.

69
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,340
I'll get going.

70
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,620
Xixi can't remember anything.

71
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,740
She must be very distressed

72
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,140
and she's certainly going
to be more irritable.

73
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,460
With her previous suicidal tendencies,

74
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,340
I'm really scared she will

75
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,740
harm herself.

76
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,100
I have a very important business function.

77
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,060
I need to go on a business trip.

78
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,620
Be sure

79
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,860
to take good care of
her during my absence.

80
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,020
She is the only daughter I have.

81
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,620
She is my everything.

82
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,700
If anything happens to her...

83
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,540
I will ensure Ms. Xu is safe and sound.

84
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,980
I feel at ease now.

85
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,580
(I don't think
the crash was an accident.)

86
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,180
(I have to find a way
to get close to Xu Xixi)

87
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,500
(while Xu Yongyu is away
to find out the truth.)

88
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,420
Thanks.

89
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,020
Lu, take some rest.

90
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,060
It's my turn.

91
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,340
Miss.

92
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,460
Ms. Xu.

93
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,540
Who are you?

94
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,380
What do you want to do?

95
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,420
I'm your bodyguard.

96
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,180
I'm on a mission

97
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,220
to protect you,

98
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,980
including stopping you
from hurting yourself.

99
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,100
It's you.

100
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,380
I just want you to help me untie this.

101
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,860
Sorry, but...

102
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,740
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

103
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,620
I just wanted to take a relaxing bath,

104
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,740
but my head was throbbing.

105
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,340
So I didn't pay attention to
what was going on outside.

106
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,900
Sorry, I was mistaken.

107
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,740
It's not blood in the bathtub.

108
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,620
It's cranberry bath bombs.

109
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
You used to hate the smell so much

110
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,460
that you never used it.

111
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,100
So I didn't think about it.

112
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,620
Get some rest then.

113
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,580
Miss, you should take your medicine.

114
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,260
Doctors say it helps
you restore your memories.

115
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,500
Thank you.

116
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,860
Why are you looking at me?

117
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,140
I...

118
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,180
Was I

119
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,460
mean to you before?

120
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,580
This is the first time you
have said thank you to me.

121
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,900
(Memory loss is horrible.)

122
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,020
(I have such a
beautiful garden at home,)

123
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,500
(yet I have no recollection of it.)

124
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,300
Take him to the security room.

125
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,580
Ask him who he works for.

126
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,660
Okay.

127
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,420
Li Feizhang,

128
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,780
is also known as Li Ba.

129
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,380
He is a reporter for KK Entertainment,

130
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
who made a name two years ago
by taking scandalous photos

131
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,300
of female celebrities.

132
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,220
No.

133
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,380
I didn't take

134
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,540
a single photo of Ms. Xu.

135
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,260
The camera was just in focus.

136
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,220
He...

137
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,420
No, I fell down by accident.

138
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,020
See for yourself.

139
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,180
There's nothing.

140
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,860
Xu Mengyun sent you, right?

141
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,860
Then please pass a message to her.

142
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,300
The brand endorsement
she's been talking about

143
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,380
has been taken down by Ms. Xu.

144
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,740
However,

145
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,900
since she was with me once,

146
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,460
I'll reserve her

147
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,780
brand ambassadorship for now.

148
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,020
Take him away.

149
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,900
Move.

150
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,340
My bag.

151
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,140
Who is she?

152
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,380
Tian Sui.

153
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,020
The manager hired by Mr. Xu for you.

154
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,580
It's okay if you don't remember me.

155
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,780
As long as you don't forget

156
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,140
that today is your debut day.

157
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,340
The whole team

158
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,660
has been preparing for this

159
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
for two and a half years.

160
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,260
I hope you won't ignore

161
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,940
everyone's hard work and efforts

162
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,220
by changing your mind
overnight on the grounds of

163
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,260
a bad mood, a car accident, etc.

164
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,980
Debut performance?

165
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,580
No one ever mentioned it to me.

166
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,660
Besides, my mind is blank now.

167
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,020
I can't remember anything.

168
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,500
How should I perform?

169
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,460
It doesn't matter if your mind is blank.

170
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,140
Just show up

171
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,100
and I'll take care of the rest.

172
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,180
Do you think I should go?

173
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
I'm just your bodyguard.

174
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,500
I am not at liberty to decide for you.

175
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,340
However, you've been very committed

176
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,220
to this performance before.

177
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,260
I don't think you're a person

178
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,380
who gives up easily.

179
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,860
So,

180
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,660
if I go,

181
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,420
will you be there to protect me?

182
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,300
Of course.

183
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,580
I will take full responsibility

184
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,660
for your safety.

185
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,980
All right then.

186
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,100
Those who don't know would
think you are a princess.

187
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,420
Ms. Xu, say hello to the camera.

188
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,060
Ms. Xu.

189
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,100
Say something, Ms. Xu.

190
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,620
Tell us more about your performance.

191
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,860
Please accept our interview.

192
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,980
Ms. Xu.

193
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:40,380
(First Appearance)

194
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,460
Are you asking me

195
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,380
to learn dancing in two hours?

196
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,260
You just lost your mental memory,

197
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,220
but you still have
your physical memory, right?

198
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,300
Besides, you started
dancing from childhood.

199
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,580
You should have a good foundation.

200
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,180
It's not a difficult move.

201
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,780
You can do it with a couple of gestures.

202
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,380
Can't you make it simpler?

203
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,060
For instance,

204
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,420
let me stand there and sing quietly.

205
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,380
Ms. Xu.

206
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,060
Please be clear.

207
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,380
This is a live show.

208
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
There is no audio fixing.

209
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,700
I'm afraid even
excellent audio engineers

210
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,260
can't save your tone-deaf voice.

211
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,740
You don't need to turn on
the mic to sing on stage.

212
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Just lip sync.

213
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,980
Then

214
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,700
can it be postponed or cancelled?

215
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,180
The news is out

216
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,060
and the media has made
the official announcement.

217
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,220
So there are

218
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,340
only two ways for you.

219
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,660
Either you go on stage and perform well,

220
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,980
or all of us here today

221
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,660
will have to join you in
announcing your retirement

222
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
and become a joke

223
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,740
on tomorrow's headlines.

224
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,500
All right, I'll stop watching videos.

225
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,940
Find me someone who can dance.

226
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,060
I'll do my best.

227
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,340
Xixi.

228
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,140
Xu Mengyun.

229
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,820
She was Tian Sui's former contracted artist

230
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,940
and had a falling out two years ago.

231
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,100
Beware of her.

232
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,420
You two weren't on good terms before.

233
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
Haven't you been practicing
ballet for over ten years?

234
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,220
How come you can't even do

235
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,980
such a basic move?

236
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
Miss, let's continue.

237
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,780
What's the rush?

238
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,740
Let's take some group photos first.

239
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,740
I'll post it online in a while

240
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,300
and give you some
publicity for the stage today.

241
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,020
Come on.

242
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,620
The lighting is bad here.

243
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,620
Let's go to the waiting room.

244
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:03,980
Let's go.

245
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,540
No need.

246
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,380
I know you're trying to waste my time,

247
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,340
but knock it off.

248
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,980
How long

249
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,060
do you think a spokesperson

250
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
who only can lip sync can last?

251
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,700
I'll be sitting with

252
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,100
the OD brand when you perform.

253
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,700
By that time,

254
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,820
I'll talk to them

255
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,460
and let them see

256
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,740
what you're really capable of

257
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,700
as a spokesperson.

258
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,260
Do your best.

259
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,940
I'm looking forward to your stage.

260
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,940
Miss, let's continue.

261
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,580
Five, six, seven, eight.

262
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,620
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

263
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,460
Okay, let's do it again.

264
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,740
(Can memory loss change)

265
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,820
(a person's personality so completely?)

266
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,180
Five, six, seven, eight.

267
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,060
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

268
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,580
Okay, hold on.

269
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,220
Keep your back steady. Yes.

270
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,300
Okay, miss.

271
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,820
I'll practice on my own a little longer.

272
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,460
Okay, see you later.

273
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,020
Thank you, miss.

274
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,940
Miss, here.

275
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,740
Let me help you.

276
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,140
I think she is...

277
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,220
- Mengyun.
- Shanshan.

278
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,020
Sorry we are late.

279
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,700
Hello.

280
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,700
Did you just arrive?

281
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,780
I was stuck in traffic.

282
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,540
Where is the prelude humming?

283
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,500
Who changed the backing track?

284
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,260
Xu Xixi, stay where you are.

285
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,300
(Sound engineer,
switch back to the original audio.)

286
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,860
Be on the lookout

287
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,580
for any suspicious people
around the stage.

288
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,100
What is Tian Sui up to this time?

289
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,580
(Sound engineer, what are you doing?)

290
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,700
(Why haven't you changed it yet?)

291
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,100
(Isn't Xu Xixi tone-deaf?)

292
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,700
(This is not the original audio.)

293
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,700

I can't see a thing.

301
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,260
Is this some kind of gimmick?

302

Is this intentional?

I'm fine.

Protecting the safety of the client

318
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,060
is the basic principle of bodyguards.

319
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,900
Anyway,

320
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,580
thank you for earlier.

321
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,260
You don't know

322
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,180
how much it just meant to me.

323
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,220
I was actually quite at a loss

324
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,900
before I went on stage.

325
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,660
Memory loss makes me feel

326
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,340
unaware of everything around me,

327
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,260
even myself.

328
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,300
Xu Xixi is more like

329
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,660
a stranger to me.

330
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,540
Yan's fear,

331
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,460
Tian Sui's mockery

332
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,940
and Xu Mengyun's hostility,

333
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,940
all muddled my mind.

334
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,020
It was only when you held me on stage

335
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,500
that I began to find

336
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,980
a sense of identity as Xu Xixi.

337
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,140
Then...

338
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,220
Good night, Lu Jinyan.

339
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,180
(Lu Jinyan.)

340
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,740
(What kind of person is he?)
