1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,279
So what are you both talking about?

2
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,000
We're discussing what things need to

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
be handed over to you.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,880
So that you can be yourself again.

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,800
It also allowed An Yue to exit smoothly.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,079
Since we're all here,

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,039
let's make sure we're on the same page.

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,160
So that we don't make
any mistakes in public in the future.

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,600
Don't bother.

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,280
As long as I share
Xu Xixi's identity with her,

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,479
she'll be responsible
for socializing and liaising.

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,600
I'll be responsible for
the routine checks every week.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,600
Isn't everything resolved then?

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,600
No,

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,759
this is too risky.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,119
If you aren't careful,
you will be exposed.

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,520
Risky?

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,200
Is this more risky than

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,159
you letting her pass me
off in my debut?

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,520
Tian Sui, on this matter,

21
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,759
you are responsible as well.

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,920
It's already hard to explain
to my dad and the public.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,239
Tian Sui has also been kept in the dark.

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,079
It was too late

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,760
when she knew about it,

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,159
so she could only lie for me.

27
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,519
I don't agree neither.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,799
This will only further
complicate things.

29
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,319
As long as An Yue and
I maintain our covers well

30
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,560
and cooperate

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
so that we don't appear in
the public simultaneously,

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,959
things should be fine.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,319
Moreover,

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,239
my dad changed the frequency
of the routine check

35
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,840
to once weekly.

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,200
If I walk away,

37
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,959
what about An Yue?

38
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,239
I don't have much time left.

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,959
Even if there is a risk,

40
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,640
it will be a short-term risk.

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,040
I just don't want to spend
the rest of the days

42
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,280
trapped in the hospital and at home.

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,599
Besides, I said I will
have one condition

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,599
when we were on the island.

45
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,759
This is my condition.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,439
Are you going to go back on your word?

47
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,280
All right then, I promise you.

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,240
By the way,

49
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,400
Lu Jinyan,

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
when An Yue takes Ms. Xu's
identity in the future,

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
take your time off.

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,960
I told my dad,

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,199
during this period,

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,240
you will be my exclusive bodyguard.

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,439
But with so many people watching,

56
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,400
what do we do when we change
identities in the future?

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Besides, there are so many
bodyguards at the door.

58
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,639
I can pretend to be Xu Xixi

59
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,520
and lure away the bodyguards.

60
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,400
Please bear with me, Ms. Xu.

61
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,840
What do you mean?

62
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,420
=Love of Replica=

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,060
=Episode 11=

64
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:05,465
You can just take the day off.

65
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:08,065
Let him follow me in the live
stream this afternoon.

66
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,185
Take care of Ms. Xu.

67
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:13,905
Don't worry.

68
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,105
The stench almost suffocated me.

69
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:50,026
Couldn't you find a cleaner trash can?

70
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:51,586
I couldn't.

71
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,105
If it's too clean, we will seem suspicious.

72
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:54,586
Get on the car first.

73
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,586
Lu Jinyan, I want ice cream.

74
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,225
Ms. Xu, give me a minute,

75
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:13,785
I'll go and buy it for you.

76
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:18,425
Boss,

77
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,545
I want an ice cream

78
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:20,305
Sure.

79
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,706
Do you know what flavour I like?

80
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:32,026
Boss,

81
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:34,345
I want another rum flavored one

82
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:36,586
for my boyfriend.

83
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:37,345
Sure.

84
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:39,665
Sorry, Ms. Xu,

85
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:43,186
it's not my job to joke
around with you.

86
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:49,985
Here, this is for you.

87
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:02,266
(Hello everyone, I'm Xu Xixi.)

88
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:04,345
(It has been a long time
since I last streamed.)

89
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:06,305
(I don't know what to talk about,)

90
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,746
(but all of you can send
messages in the chatbox.)

91
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,746
(I will try my best to reply to your
messages when I see them.)

92
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:13,545
(As for today,)

93
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:15,345
(I'll make a dessert for everyone.)

94
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:20,225
Look, she can do anything.

95
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,465
(Everything the goddess
cooks is delicious.)

96
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,626
(I don't want dessert.)

97
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:29,105
(Can you let your handsome bodyguard)

98
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:29,946
(be on the camera?)

99
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:31,946
(Mr. Bodyguard, what's your ID number?)

100
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:34,345
(I haven't seen you both
together for a long time.)

101
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,266
Are you all talking about Lu Jinyan?

102
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,985
He has other resposinbilities today

103
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,105
so he can't come here.

104
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,905
(Does he still have time
for a girlfriend?)

105
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,506
(We should ask Mr. Bodyguard
if he has a girlfriend.)

106
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:51,865
(Let's be clear here.)

107
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:53,665
(Is his girlfriend's name Xu Xixi?)

108
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,026
(As far as I know,)

109
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:03,305
(Lu Jinyan has a girlfriend now.)

110
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,186
(However, her name is not Xu Xixi.)

111
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,425
Is this your duty to her?

112
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:11,066
To her,

113
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:14,266
I have responsibilities as a partner.

114
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:18,626
She is just a substitute,

115
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:20,345
she is like you.

116
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,865
Both of you are Mr. Xu's daughters.

117
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:28,465
I'm just kidding.

118
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,305
While she's streaming,

119
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,425
I want to take the time to go shopping.

120
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:35,865
Let's go.

121
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,260
(Xu Xixi)

122
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,746
(Xu Xixi)
(The sunset is always here,)

123
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,746
(but it's rare to have
somebody to share it with.)

124
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:35,746
Lu.

125
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:36,905
Is everything all right?

126
00:08:37,106 --> 00:08:38,626
I'll take her back to the hotel
when the stream ends.

127
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:40,746
Thanks, Yu.

128
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:41,825
I'll go and call Ms. Xu.

129
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:42,466
All right.

130
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:45,545
Ms. Xu,

131
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:47,266
Yu is here.

132
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:48,945
He will take you home.

133
00:08:58,466 --> 00:08:59,866
Who said I'm going home?

134
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:02,026
I haven't enjoyed enough.

135
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:07,185
Ms. Xu, it's the wee hours now.

136
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:09,746
If you don't go home, Mr. Xu
will become suspicious.

137
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:14,226
Stop using my dad as an excuse.

138
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,626
You just want to go home
to your girlfriend, don't you?

139
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:20,866
Don't forget,

140
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:22,545
you are working now,

141
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,506
and your job is to protect me.

142
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:26,626
Stay with me.

143
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,785
Let's go for a midnight movie.

144
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:35,626
Ms. Xu,

145
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:37,825
Mr. Xu just called.

146
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:38,785
He told you to go home immediately,

147
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:40,266
otherwise he'll come and
pick you up himself.

148
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:50,585
I'll go first then, Lu.

149
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:53,106
You're back.

150
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:56,545
Sorry,

151
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:57,866
I came back late.

152
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:08,346
It's okay,

153
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:12,545
you didn't mean to.

154
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,185
It's getting late,

155
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:21,986
get some rest.

156
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,266
I don't want to play this
game with her anymore.

157
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,866
I haven't seen you all day today,

158
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:46,746
I really miss you.

159
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,626
Although the person
standing in front of me

160
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,346
looks exactly like you,

161
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,705
I'm sure that's not you.

162
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:02,866
I can't help thinking,

163
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:04,026
where are you?

164
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,705
What are you doing?

165
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,665
Are you safe?

166
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:15,626
Let's bear it for now,

167
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,346
our investigation finally
managed to bear fruit,

168
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:22,665
we can't give up our efforts like this.

169
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:37,026
She looks exactly like me.

170
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:42,746
If we both pretended as one another,

171
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,466
do you think you can tell us apart?

172
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,026
Will you be like this?

173
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:50,866
I won't.

174
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,660
♪No one can replace you in my heart♪

175
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,506
Your birthday is two days away,

176
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:07,905
let's go to that old
movie theater again

177
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:10,266
and watch a movie.

178
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:15,425
Sure.

179
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,620
♪I feel you more♪

180
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,340
♪I love you more♪

181
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:36,866
Who planned this?

182
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,545
Did he want Xixi to put on a show

183
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:41,146
for all the guests at her
own birthday party?

184
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,305
Sorry, sir,

185
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:45,785
we didn't think this through.

186
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:47,626
We're going to plan this again.

187
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:48,986
There's no need for that,

188
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,026
I think it's great.

189
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:52,945
No,

190
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,386
how can the birthday girl be
the one putting on a show?

191
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:58,986
Dad,

192
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,425
this may be my last birthday.

193
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:04,626
Just follow my plan.

194
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:18,945
Switch the piano performance

195
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,626
to a piano playing and singing act
for the opening performance.

196
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:21,905
All right.

197
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:32,185
(Lu Jinyan,)

198
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,746
(if you can't tell us apart,)

199
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,785
(I'm curious as to how you will uphold)

200
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,026
(your duty as a partner.)

201
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:40,945
All right, Mr. Xu.

202
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,425
I will free up the time

203
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:43,785
before and after Ms. Xu's birthday.

204
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:51,146
Xu Yongyu is going to hold
a birthday party for Xu Xixi.

205
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:52,825
Apparently someone planned

206
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,785
for the birthday girl to play and
sing as the opening performance.

207
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:55,825
An Yue,

208
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,626
when the time comes, you
might need to back her up.

209
00:15:59,026 --> 00:15:59,785
- No way.
- Sure.

210
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:04,785
It's also Yue's birthday that day.

211
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,026
Why should she be Xu Xixi's backup?

212
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,585
Ask her to cancel the plan.

213
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,945
She can't.

214
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:13,226
If Xu Yongyu

215
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,626
decided something,

216
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:15,986
he won't change it easily.

217
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,506
Where will the birthday party be held?

218
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:21,506
Swellcom Hotel.

219
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:24,386
The surveillance in
the building is loose.

220
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:26,626
Plus, with Lu Jinyan
as the security guard,

221
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:27,986
I shouldn't be discovered.

222
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:31,945
Sneak out when the opening
performance is over

223
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:33,585
and I'll pick you up then and there.

224
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:35,585
We'll throw you a birthday party too.

225
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,626
It will be much better than theirs.

226
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,266
Beifan,

227
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,386
I made an agreement with Lu Jinyan that

228
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,945
I will spend my birthday with just him.

229
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,185
How can you put dates before mates?

230
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:58,785
Put it here.

231
00:16:59,545 --> 00:16:59,986
Okay.

232
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:00,905
Is everything ready over here?

233
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:01,665
It's almost done.

234
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:03,665
Go over there when you're done.

235
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:04,385
Got it.

236
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,385
Put one more here.

237
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:09,906
All right.

238
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:10,666
Move it a little bit

239
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:11,865
to the left.

240
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:12,666
That's good.

241
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:13,226
All right.

242
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,545
Is that okay, manager?

243
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,666
Is everything ready here?

244
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:18,986
This is a bit crooked.

245
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,466
Let me replace this bouquet
with another one.

246
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:22,825
It's a little wilted already.

247
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:23,906
Hurry up.

248
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:26,266
Can I put it here?

249
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,226
Yes,

250
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:28,026
just put it there.

251
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:28,986
Okay.

252
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:46,426
The dress arrived.

253
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:47,385
You can get changed.

254
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:50,545
Men, avert your gaze.

255
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:53,186
All right.

256
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:08,545
You can come out now.

257
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,865
After the opening performance is over,

258
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:15,065
let's switch back quickly.

259
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:17,625
The old man will be waiting
for me to eat the cake.

260
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:19,426
Don't give anything away.

261
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:20,746
No problem.

262
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,026
Later,

263
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,226
wait for me to go out
before you come in to hide.

264
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:25,385
Otherwise I'm afraid you'll be bored.

265
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,385
Try this.

266
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,266
Okay.

267
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:36,986
Ms. Zhang, here.

268
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:41,145
Mrs. Liu, I haven't seen
you for a long time.

269
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,145
Isn't that so?

270
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:43,545
You look stunning.

271
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:45,986
What else do you need?

272
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:47,065
Nothing.

273
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:48,345
Thank you.

274
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:50,385
I'll go over there to say hello.

275
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,105
All right.

276
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:54,345
She's so cute.

277
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:55,065
Address your uncle.

278
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,666
Hello, uncle.

279
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:57,746
Isn't she joyful?

280
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,266
Happy birthday to Ms. Xu.

281
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:01,426
I wish you a booming business.

282
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,345
Thank you.

00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:04,266
Happy birthday to Ms. Xu.

284
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,666
She played the piano so well.

285
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:12,946
Being able to play and sing,

286
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,545
isn't she talented?

287

for our project...

00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,305
I hope Mr. Li will give us a chance

310
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:17,026
to have a pleasant cooperation.

311
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:18,385
All right.

312
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,785

She often talks about you.

319
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,906
Seeing you today,

320
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:52,105
you really live up to
your name, don't you?

321
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:09,666
There's no need to

322
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:10,345

00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,666
to being Ms. Xu's manager now

338
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:16,946
by getting in bed
with the right people.

339
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:19,506
What reason is there for
you to be mad at me?

340
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:21,506
Mr. Li,

341
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,186
I'm sorry for my friend's

342
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:25,026
impulsive behavior just now.

343
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:29,865
But there is one more thing

344
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:31,585
I want to ask you.

345
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:35,266
You said that I was the
one who came onto you.

346
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,746
Let me ask you,

347
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,105
what could I possibly want from you?

348
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:42,105
When it comes to this kind of thing,

349
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,906
shouldn't it be like a
man choosing a car?

350
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:45,865
Performance

351
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:47,345
or value,

352
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:48,825
you don't even have

353
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:50,625
both of these things.

354
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:53,065
You!

355
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:56,625
I...

356
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:58,026
Stay there.

357
00:24:58,466 --> 00:24:59,266
Let me go!

358
00:24:59,266 --> 00:24:59,785
Let's go.

359
00:24:59,785 --> 00:25:00,825
I'm not done with you.

360
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:02,426
Let me go!

361
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:09,825
Ms. Tian,

362
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:12,065
I never knew you had it in you.

363
00:25:14,065 --> 00:25:15,186
Be careful, this will happen to you too

364
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:16,545
if you mess with me in the future.

365
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:32,625
Tomorrow is the weekends,

366
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:35,186
do you want to go and relax?

367
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:51,825
As long as it's not boating,

368
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:52,986
sure.

369
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:55,266
Let's go.

370
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:01,865
She plays so well.

371
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:03,865
Yes, she's really good.

372
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:07,026
Ms. Xu, happy birthday.

373
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:08,385
I wish you a happy birthday, Ms. Xu.

374
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:10,266
Happy birthday, Ms. Xu.

375
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:11,825
Happy birthday.

376
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:29,746
You didn't give anything away, right?

377
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:30,625
No.

378
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:37,545
Xixi,

379
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:39,186
happy birthday.

380
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:52,666
I took a selfie in the mirror.

381
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,186
Doesn't it look like a
photo of us together?

382
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:11,585
An Yue,

383
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:12,946
thank you.

384
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:14,865
However,

385
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:17,426
you are the last person I want to see.

386
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:35,105
(Did Xu Xixi run away again?)

387
00:28:36,785 --> 00:28:38,105
(Why did she do that?)

388
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:48,385
Ms. Xu,

389
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:50,026
the birthday live stream
is starting soon.

390
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:54,026
(We have to finish what we started.)

391
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,105
(I need to end this here quickly)

392
00:28:56,105 --> 00:28:56,906
(and find Lu Jinyan.)

393
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:24,906
Tonight is my night.

394
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:55,865
She looks exactly like me.

395
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:01,666
If we both pretended as one another,

396
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:06,545
do you think you can tell us apart?

397
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,186
Will you be like this?

398
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:09,906
No, I won't.

399
00:30:13,785 --> 00:30:14,625
Lu Jinyan,

400
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:16,666
I trust you.

401
00:30:24,065 --> 00:30:25,266
Let's not go to the cinema first.

402
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:26,785
I want to stay here for a while.

403
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,545
I want to be with you right now,

404
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:31,906
and wherever is fine.

405
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:42,825
The stars here are so beautiful.

406
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:46,906
Let's not go home tonight, okay?

407
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,906
(Hello everyone, I'm Xu Xixi.)

408
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,105
(Thank you for remembering my birthday.)

409
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,105
(Today's birthday celebration)

410
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:00,906
(was lively and happy.)

411
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:02,466
Yes,

412
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:03,906
I ate a huge cake.

413
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:31,825
(It's yet another year
in the blink of an eye.)

414
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,706
Thank you for your hard work, Xixi.

415
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:40,385
I really don't know

416
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:41,986
what birthday gift to get you.

417
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:45,825
So I simply cooked a bowl of
birthday noodles for you.

418
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:48,506
I hope you

419
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,186
stay healthy and safe,

420
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,625
and the happy days

421
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:55,785
will last for days to come.

422
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:01,065
Eat it while it's hot.

423
00:32:17,946 --> 00:32:18,785
Lu Jinyan.

424
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,666
Have you had enough fun,

425
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,186
Ms. Xu?

426
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:54,706
What gave me away?

427
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:58,585
From the moment you
showed up in the trunk,

428
00:32:58,585 --> 00:32:59,986
I can see right away
that you're not her.

429
00:33:02,865 --> 00:33:04,706
The reason I cooperated
with you for so long

430
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:07,026
was to avoid you and An Yue

431
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,145
giving yourselves away at the same time

432
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:09,906
and put her in danger.

433
00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:16,186
I have arranged for
someone to pick you up.

434
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:17,986
He will be here soon.

435
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:36,065
Lu Jinyan, what's wrong with you?

436
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,065
She's just my substitute.

437
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:40,426
Everything she has is what I give to her.

438
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,105
Substitute?

439
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:45,266
Then what are you doing now, Ms. Xu?

440
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:46,865
Aren't you trying hard to be

441
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:48,266
An Yue's substitute right now?
