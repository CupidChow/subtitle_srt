1
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
(All the things in the fishing
boat are still around.)

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,719
(I think my mother will be
coming back to the house.)

3
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,319
(Are you Xu Yongyu's daughter?)

4
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,879
(Just be Ms. Xu.)

5
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,879
(Don't ever come back to this place.)

6
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,640
You have a shooting tomorrow morning.

7
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,480
Rest earlier.

8
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,439
I'll be standing guard at the deck.

9
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,120
(I think mother left
the phone here intentionally.)

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,120
(What does she mean by this message?)

11
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,500
(I need to find her soon.)

12
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,700
=Love of Replica=

13
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,880
=Episode 4=

14
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:36,936
Twin flowers?

15
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:38,936
The concept

16
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:40,977
came from the legend
of the twin flowers.

17
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,577
Two flowers stem from one pedicle.

18
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:45,017
The two flowers should be inseparable,

19
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,857
but they always grow
towards the opposite directions

20
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:50,297
and they never get to see each other

21
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:51,857
until the end of their flowering period.

22
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,336
Only then they turn around

23
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:55,297
and meet each other for the first

24
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,817
and last time before they die.

25
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,377
Such a romantic and tragic theme.

26
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:01,336
If this is handled well,

27
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:02,537
the market response will not be bad.

28
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:05,496
I trust your judgement.

29
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,056
Moreover, this story is beautiful.

30
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:09,336
I like it very much.

31
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:11,616
Get changed then.

32
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,176
Get into the character.

33
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:14,776
Director He, won't go easy on you

34
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:15,656
because of who you are.

35
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:17,496
I will perform well.

36
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,537
I won't disappoint you.

37
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:20,257
Bye.

38
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,377
Ms. Xu.

39
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,776
Please wear this set of costume first.

40
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,537
(Mother, why didn't you
answer the phone?)

41
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,216
(You are still in
the fishing village, right?)

42
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,137
(How did I become Xu Yongyu's child?)

43
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,496
(Mother, I'm really worried.)

44
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:04,496
(I want to see you.)

45
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,017
Although we don't have such
a location in our village,

46
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:31,976
I used wood

47
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:33,336
to build you an identical place.

48
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:34,776
The chair is the only thing left.

49
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:36,216
Everything will be done
once I paint it later.

50
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:39,656
What do you think, Ms. Tian?

51
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:40,937
Are you satisfied

52
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:41,817
with me, the temporary assistant?

53
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:44,177
I guess so. I'm barely satisfied.

54
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:47,896
You also bought a black beauty.

55
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:50,017
Didn't the prop master say
the flower market was closed?

56
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:50,896
Don't...

57
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:53,976
This smell...

58
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,937
I can't find black pigment.

59
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:00,536
So I used squid ink.

60
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:03,296
Did you dye it with squid ink?

61
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:04,497
Yes.

62
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,296
Except for a little fishy smell,

63
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,377
no one can tell.

64
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,617
Therefore, in this place,

65
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:13,257
you name it,

66
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:14,817
I got it.

67
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:36,976
How long are you going to paint this?

68
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,617
You know how to do this kind of work.

69
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:55,937
Before I became an a manager,

70
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:56,896
I was an errand girl.

71
00:05:57,697 --> 00:05:58,937
The artiste only needed
to tell me the requirements.

72
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:01,177
There was nothing I
couldn't do or provide.

73
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:47,737
Cut!

74
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,377
The gaze is wrong.

75
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:51,776
One more take!

76
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:53,497
Action!

77
00:06:54,377 --> 00:06:55,296
Let's repeat!

78
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:57,416
Cut!

79
00:06:57,976 --> 00:06:58,817
Cut!

80
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,017
Cut!

81
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:02,137
It's still wrong.

82
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,057
Let's take a five!

83
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:08,057
What's wrong with you?

84
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:14,976
Can you act?

85
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,456
How many times have I told you?

86
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,577
Your gaze has to be wild and bad.

87
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:23,216
It must be passionate
enough to seduce a man.

88
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,336
If you can't even do
something simple like this,

89
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,497
what are you doing here?

90
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:29,416
Why don't you go home
and be an heiress?

91
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,617
Director, I can do it.

92
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:36,896
Please give me another chance.

93
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:37,856
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:40,536
Director He, please don't be angry.

95
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:43,377
Xixi may be a bit unfamiliar with this.

96
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:45,497
Let me find her a partner.

97
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:46,617
She will get better.

98
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:47,656
Who are you going to look for?

99
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:50,216
Why don't I get you somebody
from the sailing club?

100
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:51,096
No need.

101
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,497
This guy will do.

102
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:02,017
What?

103
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:03,536
Did I just go deaf?

104
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:05,536
Didn't you beg me

105
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,057
to give you another chance?

106
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,536
If you don't want to do it,
we'll call it a day.

107
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,257
No, director. He can't.

It's a wrap.

134
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:26,816
Good job, everyone.

135
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:33,217
I've caused you a lot of trouble lately.

136
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:34,377
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:35,816 --> 00:10:36,737
Also,

138
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:40,737
thank you.

139
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:43,257
If you wish to thank me,

140
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:44,656
promise me three things.

141
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:46,656
Tell me about them.

142
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:48,896
Do not lose contact.

143
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:50,936
Do not simply make a move.

144
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:53,977
Do not mess up your work

145
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:55,017
because of your bodyguard.

146
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:19,536
What's wrong?

147
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,576
I'll take a look over there.

148
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:24,377
Okay.

149
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:30,416
Mom.

150
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:54,217
Ms. Tian, ​​where is Ms. Xu?

151
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:57,217
She said she was going there for a walk.

152
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:31,776
Mom, is that you?

153
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:41,416
Mom, this is for you.

154
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:43,737
Look.

155
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,056
It's the prettiest shell

156
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,217
I picked up this morning.

157
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:48,457
Also, this one.

158
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:50,056
I picked it up yesterday evening.

159
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:05,017
Show me your hands.

160
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,097
Show me your hands.

161
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:14,257
What a waste of time.

162
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:16,056
If you have time, you should
practise playing the piano.

163
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,097
I look for her everywhere.

164
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,217
Why won't she see me?

165
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:32,977
Why did she leave me?

166
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,497
Why didn't she love me
since I was little?

167
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:54,217
Let's go.

168
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:56,896
Let me take you to a place.

169
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,480
(Blossom)

170
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:46,617
When I was a kid, I always suspected
that my father didn't like me.

171
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:51,816
I even ran away from
home because of this.

172
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:55,617
However, you know what?

173
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,377
When he found me later,

174
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:01,617
he didn't scold me.

175
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,857
He brought me here,

176
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:10,416
clumsily bought me a Coke

177
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:12,737
and popcorn.

178
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:19,017
Then he quietly watched a movie with me.

179
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,017
Eat it.

180
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,056
They are both first-time parents.

181
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:34,776
They clumsily

182
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:36,896
learn how to treat their children well.

183
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:42,337
During the process, they might panic

184
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:43,296
and make mistakes.

185
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:49,217
If your mother used to
be very harsh on you,

186
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:52,816
I'm sure it is because

187
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,017
she desperately wanted you to grow up.

188
00:15:59,977 --> 00:16:00,857
A parent's love

189
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,056
is like a cloud rimmed with gold.

190
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:08,017
Don't focus on the rainstorm

191
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:13,536
but fail to notice the sunshine
behind the dark cloud.

192
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:04,977
Thank you.

193
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,360
(Tian Sui)

194
00:17:19,657 --> 00:17:20,457
Thank you.

195
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:22,376
You are welcome.

196
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:24,296
Here.

197
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:12,616
Tian Sui.

198
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:14,056
What are you doing?

199
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,096
I kind of like you.

200
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:39,136
Thanks.

201
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,056
Is that all?

202
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,217
What else?

203
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,737
Would you prefer a direct rejection?

204
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:56,657
No.

205
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:58,576
I

206
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:00,897
just wanted to tell you.

207
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:05,056
Ding Beifan.

208
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,417
Don't waste your time on me.

209
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:09,177
Once the filming is over,

210
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:11,217
we'll return to our
respective familiar territories.

211
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:12,937
We won't cross paths ever again.

212
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,140
(Tian Sui)

213
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:10,576
Then I'll swim to your world.

214
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,230
(Friend Barbecue)

215
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,830
(Tian Sui)

216
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,056
What kind of software is this?

217
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:33,856
Location-sharing.

218
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:36,217
You can check the location and safety

219
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:37,616
of your friends anytime.

220
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:40,576
When they're in danger,
there will be an alarm.

221
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:42,897
Good.

222
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:44,856
It's suitable for
a single woman like me.

223
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:46,336
Download one for me, too,

224
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,336
so that when I am in danger,

225
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:50,096
you can come to me immediately.

226
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,737
Also, based on the distance
between you and me,

227
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:54,136
you can prepare barbecue for me on time.

228
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:17,576
A moment, please.
Let me pack it for you.

229
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,136
Okay.

230
00:21:26,056 --> 00:21:26,657
Boss.

231
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,536
Please get me

232
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:31,336
some of these,

233
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:33,937
as well as

234
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:36,136
some of these.

235
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:37,017
Sure. Please wait a moment.

236
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:37,657
Okay.

237
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:40,336
Sunflowers and roselle.

238
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:42,217
What a unique combination.

239
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,937
Is this flower called Roselle?

240
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:49,937
Not bad.

241
00:21:51,096 --> 00:21:53,576
The person who is getting this
bouquet is as warm as a sunflower.

242
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:55,177
She's like the Goddess of Luo River.

243
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,897
It's a nice combination.

244
00:21:58,136 --> 00:21:59,136
You have great taste.

245
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:02,737
Thank you.

246
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,616
Sir, your flowers are ready.

247
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:06,776
Thank you.

248
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,977
Your bouquet is too simple.

249
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:11,136
Let me help you to pick the flowers.

250
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,136
It's okay.

251
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:13,576
Thank you.

252
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:17,017
Hello. What else do you need?

253
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,290
(Future Recreation)

254
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:19,816
Okay. Let me jot it down.

255
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:20,657
What is it?

256
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:25,217
Okay.

257
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,376
Please go on.

258
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:33,056
Sure. Let me record it.

259
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:33,737
What a coincidence.

260
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:36,177
Does the person you like also work here?

261
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:39,257
You, too?

262
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,177
Yes.

263
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:40,977
However,

264
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:43,417
my future girlfriend
has a high position here.

265
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,136
Maybe she knows your girlfriend.

266
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,056
I can ask her to take
care of your girlfriend.

267
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:48,937
Thanks,

268
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:50,457
but no, thanks.

269
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:52,776
Okay. No problem.

270
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:57,776
Excuse me, sir.

271
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:58,737
Who are you looking for?

272
00:22:59,136 --> 00:22:59,977
- I'm looking for Tian Sui.
- I'm looking for Tian Sui.

273
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:06,616
Let's go out and talk.

274
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,816
What are you doing?

275
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:20,136
The person that I said

276
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:21,697
would be my girlfriend soon

277
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,096
was Tian Sui.

278
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,457
So,

279
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:30,457
did she accept your love confession?

280
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:35,136
Not yet.

281
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:36,856
However,

282
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:38,657
she will sooner or later.

283
00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:45,616
Okay.

284
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:48,697
I wish you success.

285
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:56,776
I'm sorry.

286
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:57,856
It was instinct.

287
00:23:59,096 --> 00:23:59,856
Sorry.

288
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:03,136
I'm sorry.

289
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:15,816
Let me tell you.

290
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:17,296
Tian Sui.

291
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,697
I will never give her up.

292
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:22,017
I don't need you to give up on her.

293
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:24,816
She deserves outstanding suitors.

294
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,056
Although we both like Tian Sui,

295
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:35,657
I respect you.

296
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:37,336
Let's compete fairly.

297
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:45,376
Okay. Let's compete fairly.

298
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,417
This bouquet is for you.

299
00:24:55,937 --> 00:24:56,856
Thank you, Ms. Tian.

300
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:05,937
Hi, this is Future Recreation.

301
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:10,417
You wish to apply to be
Ms. Tian's assistant, right?

302
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:12,977
Okay. I understand.

303
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:16,697
Fair play

304
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:18,296
is also about strategies.

305
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:23,776
The cafe?

306
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:26,536
Once Xixi arrives,

307
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:27,697
get the styling done first.

308
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:28,977
Hello, Ms. Tian.

309
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:31,776
Today is the pre-release press
conference for the music video.

310
00:25:31,977 --> 00:25:33,497
We've checked the publicity materials.

311
00:25:33,536 --> 00:25:34,417
Make sure nothing will go wrong.

312
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:35,536
Yes.

313
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:37,417
Why are you being polite?
We're on the same side.

314
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,376
I'll treat you to a meal when
you come to my place next time.

315
00:25:39,937 --> 00:25:40,977
It's a promise then, Fan.

316
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,257
It's a promise.

317
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:43,497
Ms. Tian.

318
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:46,977
Do you know each other?

319
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:49,336
I do. I'm very close to him.

320
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:51,056
When did you get to know him?

321
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:52,776
I just did.

322
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:54,897
I came to the company for an interview.

323
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:56,296
I bought coffee for everyone.

324
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:59,056
Ms. Tian, ​​this is for you.

325
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:01,096
When I came to the office last time,

326
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:03,096
I noticed that you all liked to
order takeaway from this shop.

327
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:06,856
He is not suitable. Find someone else.

328
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:08,856
Ms. Tian.

329
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:11,336
Do you find me unsuitable

330
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:13,776
from a personal or
professional point of view?

331
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:17,497
Ding Beifan, you're not suitable

332
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:19,657
to be my assistant
from every point of view.

333
00:26:20,177 --> 00:26:22,217
What you did in the fishing
village doesn't work here.

334
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:24,977
Try it out.

335
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:27,977
Who knows? It might be suitable?

336
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:38,616
So,

337
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:40,497
you got a master's degree in economics

338
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:42,737
from Waseda University at the age of 21.

339
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:45,177
No.

340
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,536
I found it boring when
I was halfway through.

341
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:49,017
So I dropped out of school and
returned to the fishing village.

342
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:52,856
What do you mean by it's boring?

343
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:58,017
That means it's too simple.

344
00:26:58,136 --> 00:26:59,096
It's not challenging at all,

345
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,576
unlike my life in a fishing village.

346
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:02,536
Dealing with senior citizens every day

347
00:27:02,776 --> 00:27:04,657
takes a lot of mental
and physical effort.

348
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:08,336
Moreover, the fishing village

349
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:10,576
has my favourite humanity.

350
00:27:12,977 --> 00:27:14,576
Then you shouldn't
come to the interview.

351
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:16,497
This job is way more boring

352
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:17,737
than you imagine.

353
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,776
Whether the job is boring

354
00:27:22,177 --> 00:27:24,056
depends on who is next to me.

355
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,096
If I work with you, Ms. Tian,

356
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:28,497
I believe that every day is a challenge.

357
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:32,257
I told you clearly

358
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:34,497
not to waste your time on me.

359
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:36,336
I like someone else.

360
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:44,616
I know.

361
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:46,897
Therefore, a person like me,

362
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,457
who is way behind the opponent,

363
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,257
should take every opportunity

364
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:51,657
to outperform my opponent.

365
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:55,977
However, don't worry,

366
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:57,776
I respect my opponent very much.

367
00:27:58,616 --> 00:27:59,776
Also, I'm an honest person.

368
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:01,417
I'm not like Xu Mengyun.

369
00:28:02,177 --> 00:28:03,096
I won't use dirty tricks

370
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:05,096
for the sake of a promotion.

371
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,616
If you are my assistant,

372
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:10,217
how are you going to deal with her?

373
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:13,257
That's easy.

374
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:15,616
If you're dealing with a cockroach,

375
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:17,296
you must give it a devastating blow.

376
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,417
Otherwise it will give birth to many
small cockroaches to disgust you.

377
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:26,017
If you want to work in this industry,

378
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:27,937
you have to understand one thing.

379
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:29,977
This is a small industry.

380
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:32,497
Don't burn your bridges.

381
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,296
I noticed that

382
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:40,536
you're quite soft-hearted.

383
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:43,937
You always care about
that so-called decency.

384
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:46,376
You don't understand a thing.

385
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:48,536
Okay.

386
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,336
Would you dare to make a bet with me?

387
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:52,017
Xu Mengyun will continue

388
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:53,417
to push her luck.

389
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:54,776
If I get it right,

390
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:57,657
give me the position of your assistant.

391
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:02,257
I always feel that my mother
is watching me in the dark.

392
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,376
Otherwise, how would she know that
I went back to the fishing village?

393
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,776
That's possible.

394
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:08,657
Maybe she will come to you soon.

395
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:09,856
Yes.

396
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:26,897
Don't move!

397
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:29,017
Help!

398
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,417
The superstar, Xu Xixi, hit me!

399
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,177
Stop shouting!

400
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:32,737
Help!

401
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,217
Look here, everyone!

402
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:35,616
She's going to bully me!

403
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,616
Let me go!

404
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:37,376
Are you okay?

405
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,376
Let me go!

406
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:42,217
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

407
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,536
Dingding, why are you here?

408
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:46,457
I'm here

409
00:29:48,697 --> 00:29:49,376
for work.

410
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:51,816
I will be Ms. Tian's assistant soon.

411
00:29:52,977 --> 00:29:54,257
Media representatives who came
for the press conference,

412
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,056
please come in.

413
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:56,937
Thank you, everyone.

414
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:00,576
Please come in.

415
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,417
Please go in.

416
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:09,457
Let me handle this place.

417
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:10,856
You should stay.

418
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:14,136
Yueyue, don't worry.

419
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:15,136
I won't spare

420
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:16,177
the person who bullies you.

421
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:17,897
Let's go.

422
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:22,856
You were right.

423
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:25,136
How are you going to
deal with Xu Mengyun?

424
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:27,657
I'm a fisherman. What can I do?

425
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:30,977
At most, I'll check her
financial statements online.

426
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:33,776
Then I'll look at her company's
annual performance.

427
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:34,376
After that,

428
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,856
I'll use a calculator
to calculate her income

429
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:36,937
and taxes payable.

430
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,336
However, I don't have her quotation.

431
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:39,497
I have it.

432
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:42,017
Why don't we calculate her taxes

433
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:43,616
and teach her a lesson?

434
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,417
Thank you for what you did just now.

435
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:49,136
It's my duty to protect you.

436
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:01,697
I found this mobile phone
on the fishing boat.

437
00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:04,376
My mother must have left it for me.

438
00:31:06,257 --> 00:31:07,417
I called her

439
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:09,056
but no one answered.

440
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:13,897
Why are you telling me that?

441
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:21,336
We are allies.

442
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,096
I don't know what the first message

443
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:27,737
she sent to me meant.

444
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:30,937
What did she say?

445
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:35,776
She said I was Xu Yongyu's daughter.

446
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:36,856
She asked me not to come back.

447
00:31:45,497 --> 00:31:46,056
Yu.

448
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:48,457
Mr. Xu's itinerary for tonight
has been arranged, right?

449
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:51,017
There is an important meeting
at Yuyuan Biotech tonight.

450
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:53,217
Mr. Xu is expected to leave at 5.30 p.m.

451
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:54,417
and return at around 10 p.m.

452
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,616
Mr. Xu is ready to go downstairs now.

453
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:00,937
Lu, I shall get going.

454
00:32:00,937 --> 00:32:01,737
Mr. Xu has gone downstairs.

455
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:21,856
Since An Yue is also
Xu Yongyu's biological daughter,

456
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:22,937
why did Xu Yongyu

457
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:24,657
hide her existence?

458
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:26,737
Xu Yongyu concealed this secret.

459
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:30,056
It must have something to do
with my father's car accident.

460
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:33,737
In your opinion,

461
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:36,457
where do you think

462
00:32:36,657 --> 00:32:37,897
Xu Yongyu will hide the secret?

463
00:32:57,697 --> 00:32:59,977
(Mom, why didn't you
reply to my message?)

464
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:05,017
(I lost my memory.)

465
00:33:05,296 --> 00:33:06,616
(I can't remember anything.)

466
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:16,816
(You said that I was
Xu Yongyu's daughter.)

467
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:24,977
(Are Xu Xixi and I twins?)

468
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:50,616
This is the only route

469
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:52,177
that will not be captured
by surveillance cameras.

470
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:53,776
Nothing can go wrong.

471
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:22,817
(If we are twins,)

472
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,056
(there must be some evidence.)

473
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:28,616
Why are you here?

474
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:31,857
Didn't you say Xixi was sleeping?

475
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,377
Why is she missing all of a sudden?

476
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:35,297
Where is Lu Jinyan?

477
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:36,937
Ask him to see me immediately!

478
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:37,857
Dad.

479
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,337
Why did you come back so early?

480
00:37:41,297 --> 00:37:42,457
What are you two doing here?

481
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,736
Mr. Xu.

482
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:49,176
If there's nothing else,
please excuse me.

483
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:55,696
You're a girl.

484
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:56,736
What are you doing?

485
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:58,136
Tell me honestly.

486
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,497
Does Lu Jinyan

487
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:01,017
treat you disrespectfully?

488
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:03,576
You two came to my study
in the middle of the night.

489
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,256
He brought you here, right?

490
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:27,616
Dad.

491
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:30,977
Are you trying to ask me

492
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,576
whether he seduces me?

493
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,417
I would love to see that.

494
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:40,337
However, this man,

495
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:43,176
as you are aware, is very rigid.

496
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:46,096
I tried so hard

497
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:47,576
to trick him into the study.

498
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:50,457
I wanted to have some fun.

499
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:53,337
Who knew you would come back suddenly?

500
00:39:14,576 --> 00:39:16,337
He is not suitable for you!

501
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:18,616
I like Lu Jinyan.

502
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:30,497
Ever since the car accident,

503
00:39:31,777 --> 00:39:32,937
he's always by my side.

504
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:35,256
You're always away on a business trip.

505
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:37,736
Yan and others treat me very well,

506
00:39:38,696 --> 00:39:39,817
but they're scared of me.

507
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:45,457
In this huge house,

508
00:39:50,176 --> 00:39:52,056
when I see pictures of my mother,

509
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:56,777
I can't even remember who she is.

510
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,937
I even suspect that

511
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,497
you and mother dislike me.

512
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,817
That's why you abandon me.

513
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:09,696
Nonsense!

514
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:15,457
Xixi.

515
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,136
When your mother was pregnant with you,

516
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:19,656
she was diagnosed

517
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:21,536
with an almost terminal disease.

518
00:40:22,857 --> 00:40:25,377
The doctor advised her
not to have the baby,

519
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:27,377
but she insisted on giving birth to you.

520
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:32,216
Do you know how much pain
she suffered at that time?

521
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,216
She wanted to protect your health.

522
00:40:35,297 --> 00:40:36,497
Therefore, throughout the pregnancy,

523
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:38,656
she didn't take any painkiller.

524
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:46,736
I felt very bad when I saw her.

525
00:40:48,017 --> 00:40:49,417
However, do you know what she said?

526
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:52,696
She said Xixi

527
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:57,576
was the most precious
gift God ever gave her.

528
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:09,576
The fingerprint is correct.
Please open the box.

529
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:19,136
Look.

530
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
(Medical certificate of birth)

531
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:59,870
(Xu Xixi D.O.B 14th July, 5.05 p.m.
Mother: Li Wanting, Father: Xu Yongyu)

532
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:07,297
(Why is there only one?)

533
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:13,616
(Yongyu, look.)

534
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:16,536
(Look at her little hands.)

535
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:17,616
(Baby.)

536
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:19,176
(Your father and I love you.)

537
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:22,736
(You are the most
precious baby in my life.)

538
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:24,937
(You two are my babies.)

539
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:26,457
Look.

540
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:27,857
Ever since we got married,

541
00:42:28,377 --> 00:42:29,777
your mother and I

542
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:33,297
had always wanted to have a cute baby.

543
00:42:33,736 --> 00:42:34,857
(She is laughing.)

544
00:42:35,897 --> 00:42:37,777
However, your mother was in poor health.

545
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:40,337
So we weren't able to have a child.

546
00:42:42,297 --> 00:42:45,096
After that, your mother was
diagnosed with a terminal illness.

547
00:42:46,576 --> 00:42:47,536
At that time,

548
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:50,417
we were devastated.

549
00:42:52,977 --> 00:42:54,337
However, at the same time,

550
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:56,696
you came to us.

551
00:42:58,056 --> 00:43:01,937
It's a silver lining.

552
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:09,497
No one in this world

553
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:12,337
loves you more than your mother and me,

554
00:43:16,216 --> 00:43:17,777
because you are

555
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:19,497
our only child.

556
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:24,256
(You are)

557
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:25,857
