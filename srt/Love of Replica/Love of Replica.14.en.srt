1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,039
(Hello, everyone.)

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,960
(I'm the one leading you on
the front line)

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,719
(to uncover shady plots as a
real-time reporter,)

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,679
(Li Feizhang.)

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,679
(Do you know where I am?)

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,559
(That's right.)

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,920
(I'm at the famous Yuyuan Biotechnology)

8
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,679
(which was founded single-handedly)

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,719
(by the tycoon, Xu Yongyu.)

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:33,920
(This is)

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,240
(a very open company.)

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,039
(There are no locks and security guards.)

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,799
(Anyone can enter and leave the building.)

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
(But actually,)

15
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,280
(Xu Yongyu has built an
underground world which)

16
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,000
(is the reason that)

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,240
(I'm risking my life)

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,280
(to come here and reveal it.)

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,119
(Let's look for)

20
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,679
(the underground world.)

21
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,079
(Let's see how Xu Yongyu)

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,119
(turned from a gangster)

23
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,960
(into a billionaire.)

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,760
(It seems that)

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,959
(our security system)

26
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,319
(really needs some upgrades.)

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,319
(Since you're here,)

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,920
(you can't leave empty-handed.)

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,820
=Love of Replica=

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,160
=Episode 14=

31
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:12,267
(No wonder Li Feizhang
keeps targeting Xu Xixi.)

32
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:15,267
(There are old grudges
between him and Xu Yongyu.)

33
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,030
(The popular singer, Xu Xixi,
surprises all.)

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,530
(Is she using her twin sister to debut
or a stand-in singer?)

35
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,827
Remove all reports immediately.

36
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,146
Don't let more people come
across it again.

37
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,947
Sweep everything
under the carpet soonest.

38
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:39,227
Compatibility?

39
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,906
Indeed, there're many news reports about

40
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,866
parents having another child

41
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:46,787
because of their currently sick child.

42
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:51,067
But An Yue and Xu Xixi are twins.

43
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,706
Xu Yongyu wouldn't give up

44
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:55,107
a healthy child for

45
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,387
a sick one, would he?

46
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:58,986
The video given to An Yue by her mom

47
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:00,107
mentions that, too.

48
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,706
I don't understand that, too.

49
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:05,547
That doesn't make sense.

50
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:07,146
An Yue is his daughter.

51
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:08,866
However biassed he is,

52
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,866
he wouldn't have been so cruel, right?

53
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:13,746
But the possibility is there.

54
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,067
Xu Yongyu's fatherly love for Xu Xixi

55
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,186
has become too extreme.

56
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,186
To him, An Yue is a stranger

57
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:24,347
whom he hasn't

58
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:25,107
spent time with.

59
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:28,186
If he wants to kill An Yue
to save Xu Xixi,

60
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:32,107
indeed,

61
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,667
I won't be surprised.

62
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,227
But we're just speculating.

63
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,787
I don't understand

64
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,227
why my mom doesn't want me to see him.

65
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:48,787
She'd rather die

66
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:52,227
than reveal who I am.

67
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,627
What're we waiting for?

68
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,026
Let's run

69
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,026
or we'll be dead.

70
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:00,586
Xu Yongyu's power

71
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,186
is beyond your imagination.

72
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:03,627
We can't escape.

73
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:05,986
Our only choice

74
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:07,986
is to get into Xu family to

75
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:10,146
gather criminal evidence

76
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:11,746
and hand it to the right party.

77
00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:14,507
Did he know about you

78
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:15,787
after reading the news?

79
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,827
I'll get someone to remove it

80
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:19,666
for you to keep swapping identities

81
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,627
for Xu family's investigation.

82
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:22,307
(That's unnecessary.)

83
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:24,146
(The report is in An Yue's favour.)

84
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,906
(She's safer because of the exposure.)

85
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,507
I think

86
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,026
we can't do without him.

87
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:33,267
He has just undergone a surgery.

88
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:36,947
Tiancheng, go and rest.

89
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:40,067
Don't worry about me.

90
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,067
The doctor says my wound
is healing very well.

91
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,947
After the blood clots
in the brain were cleared,

92
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,267
I'm suddenly relaxed quite a bit.

93
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:57,666
(Let's return to the subject.)

94
00:04:57,947 --> 00:04:59,586
(When the news was released,)

95
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:00,747
(I immediately removed it.)

96
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:02,026
(But I realised that)

97
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:03,427
(another party)

98
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:04,827
(was doing the same thing.)

99
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:10,906
He didn't want to act rashly

100
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:12,546
and put us on our guard.

101
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:15,627
But undeniably,

102
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:17,747
the news saved me.

103
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:21,827
Could you find out who wrote it?

104
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,507
(It's Li Feizhang.)

105
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:25,827
(But)

106
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,627
(he's currently not contactable.)

107
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:28,747
I doubt if

108
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,867
Xu Yongyu has done something to him.

109
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:34,346
Tiancheng, save your energy

110
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:35,466
and go to rest.

111
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,387
Don't remove the news.

112
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:40,466
But

113
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,427
we have to trouble your agency

114
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,546
to spread the news to everyone.

115
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,586
Let's make sure everyone knows that

116
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:49,987
An Yue and Xu Xixi are twins.

117
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:51,827
Do you think that...

118
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,586
He will reach me soon.

119
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:58,466
We may face the same.

120
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,507
We're not safe.

121
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:02,867
Yes.

122
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:04,747
Our capability

123
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:06,187
is too limited

124
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,307
to handle Xu Yongyu.

125
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,026
The best way forward

126
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:11,146
is using public opinion and publicity

127
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,387
to protect An Yue

128
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:14,466
and us better.

129
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:17,387
The report mentions
'See you on Monday'.

130
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:19,387
It means more future updates.

131
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,466
Monday...

132
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,427
That's tomorrow.

133
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:32,507
Although we don't know what he's up to,

134
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:35,507
apparently, Xu Xixi has a
live stream on Monday.

135
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:37,466
Not only she does that.

136
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:38,706
There's also Xu Mengyun.

137
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:40,666
I think the news report

138
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,747
was most probably created by
her and Li Feizhang.

139
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:44,387
She's so stubborn.

140
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:46,906
This time around,

141
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:49,387
we'll use Xu Mengyun

142
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:51,507
to our advantage.

143
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,786
Since the computer with administrator account

144
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,187
is not in Yuyuan Biotechnology,

145
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,267
it's most probably in
Xu Yongyu's study.

146
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:09,387
So we have to figure out how
to get into his house

147
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:10,466
to get authorised access.

148
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:13,906
The security level of

149
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,906
the hidden base exceeds that of labs.

150
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,146
It may be about

151
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,507
our parents' past research.

152
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,346
The cause of my dad's accident

153
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,026
and the truth your mom

154
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:26,867
doesn't want us to find out

155
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:29,226
should all be there.

156
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,267
An Yue,

157
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,146
before we access the hidden base,

158
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,666
don't overthink.

159
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,546
Dayu, go in with Xixi.

160
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:22,906
Okay, Mr. Xu.

161
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:44,747
Hello.

162
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:46,906
(Sir, we searched the hotel)

163
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:47,747
(but couldn't find him.)

164
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:49,146
I checked the surveillance camera

165
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:50,627
and saw him leave early.

166
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,587
Lu Jinyan knows I'm looking for them.

167
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,946
He's been working for me

168
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:58,587
and knows how I manage things.

169
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:00,987
He knows he can't escape.

170
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,186
To him,

171
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,906
the safest place

172
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,066
is anywhere within my control.

173
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,227
Do you mean that

174
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:13,707
he has gone to the venue?

175
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:16,467
Go back to the venue now.

176
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,146
Step up the security there.

177
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:20,107
If you see Lu Jinyan,

178
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:21,826
don't spare him.

179
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:34,627
Who's that? Does he even know
how to drive?

180
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:35,946
Oh hell!

181
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:48,146
Xu Xixi?

182
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:49,786
I'm An Yue.

183
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:09,146
She can't sing.

184
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,587
She let me be the ghost singer.

185
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:14,867
I solve the problems

186
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,066
without any recognition.

187
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:21,666
I have to hide behind the scenes.

188
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:24,707
And Tian Sui

189
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,826
always uses me to find
sources for Xu Xixi.

190
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:30,906
I really don't wish

191
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:32,507
to continue bearing it.

192
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:34,867
I don't want to be
her substitute anymore.

193
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:39,026
So please help me.

194
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,066
Help me expose their true colours.

195
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:44,946
Fear not.

196
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:47,867
The live stream today

197
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:51,906
is a chance to ruin their reputation.

198
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:08,227
Take a look here again.

199
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:08,867
Okay.

200
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:09,627
Ms. Chen,

201
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:11,227
regarding the script today,

202
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:13,066
Xixi and I have new ideas that we'd like

203
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,186
to discuss with you.

204
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:16,867
Tian Sui,

205
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:18,786
I've told you before.

206
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,267
For your sake,

207
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,146
I exceptionally

208
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:22,987
let Mr. Xu

209
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:24,747
avoid mentioning in the interview

210
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:26,826
anything about the news report.

211
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,426
Do you think I haven't done enough?

212
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:30,387
Now if Ms. Xu demands

213
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:31,786
anything further,

214
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,026
let's just cancel the programme.

215
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:36,347
Ms. Chen,

216
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:38,146
I think you've misunderstood.

217
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:39,867
I'm here to

218
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:41,867
tip you off big time.

219
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,146
The viewership will surely skyrocket.

220
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:49,987
What's the tip-off?

221
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:51,267
It's something like

222
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:54,267
Xu Xixi's twin sister's surprising

223
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:56,546
appearance on set of
'Star Colleagues' or

224
00:11:57,066 --> 00:12:00,227
live-streamed reunion between
tycoon and long-lost daughter.

225
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:02,507
Are you serious?

226
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:13,227
The supervisor arrived early, right?

227
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:14,227
It's a big opportunity.

228
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:15,267
It's a rare opportunity.

229
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:15,826
Yes.

230
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:16,786
Xu Yongyu rarely shows up.

231
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,146
Will he be in the headlines?

232
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:19,107
Yeah, will he?

233
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,306
Stop!

234
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:36,026
Catch the girl!

235
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:37,426
What are you doing?

236
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:39,347
Don't you dare touch me!

237
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:40,786
I'm going to live-stream.

238
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:43,107
Go after her!

239
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:00,747
Hello.

240
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,467
(The girl's at the venue.)

241
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:03,627
(We're chasing her.)

242
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:04,507
Okay.

243
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:07,066
Dayu,

244
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,306
they were spotted nearby.

245
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:10,507
Go and check it out.

246
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:11,107
Okay.

247
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:12,387
Let's go.

248
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,347
Don't be nervous and do your best.

249
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:43,107
Get ready to live-stream.

250
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:44,146
Three.

251
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:45,107
Two.

252
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,066
One.

253
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:46,946
Go!

254
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:05,627

Hello, my lovely audience.

273
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:57,826
I'm the host, Chen Xin.

274
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,426
Welcome to this episode
of 'Star Colleagues'.

275
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:01,387
(Today's guests - Xu Yongyu and Xu Xixi)
Today,

276
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,826
(Today's guests - Xu Yongyu and Xu Xixi)
I have the privilege to introduce

277
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:05,227
(Today's guests - Xu Yongyu and Xu Xixi)
two special guests who are

278
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:05,586
(Today's guests - Xu Yongyu and Xu Xixi)

279
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:08,066
(Today's guests - Xu Yongyu and Xu Xixi)
the founder of Yongyu Capital,

280
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,267
Mr. Xu Yongyu,

281
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,267
and his celebrity daughter,

282
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:12,786
Xu Xixi.

283
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,147
Welcome them with applause.

284
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:17,026
Hello, Xixi.

285
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:18,507
Our netizens had known about

286
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:20,626
your scheduled appearance
on my programme.

287
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:21,947
They reacted excitedly

288
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:23,106
by leaving your comments

289
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:24,546
asking about your latest plans

290
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:25,907
for the near future.

291
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:26,987
For example,

292
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:29,026
will you organise any concert?

293
00:17:36,147 --> 00:17:37,786
I'm sorry that

294
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:40,147
due to my personal plans,

295
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,707
I'm quitting the entertainment
industry infinitely.

296
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:44,586
Oh, why?

297
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:45,626
That's so sudden!

298
00:17:45,707 --> 00:17:47,026
You sing so well.

299
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:49,427
You're doing so well.

300
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:51,546
Why are you quitting suddenly?

301
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:54,626
Today

302
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:56,227
marks Xixi's last filming

303
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:57,427
before she suspends work.

304
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,987
Her father, Mr. Xu Yongyu,

305
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,707
has been by her side.

306
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:03,066
We can feel

307
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:04,907
the father-and-daughter bond

308
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:06,026
that is really harmonious

309
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,786
and touching.

310
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:09,147
I think Mr. Xu has

311
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:11,267
the qualities of a good father that

312
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:12,546
all children anticipate.

313
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,467
As a token of appreciation to
Xixi and her father

314
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,306
for being our guest stars,

315
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:36,586
our crew have specially

316
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,707
prepared a surprise

317
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,826
for them.

318
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:45,346
The surprise is the news
about twins.

319
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,106
Another guest star is

320
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:51,106
the long-lost twin sister of Xixi's,

321
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:52,866
An Yue.

322
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,667
She's coming from behind.

323
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,427
Really?

324
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,147
They really look the same.

325
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,507
They mirror each other.

326
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:10,267
Indeed.

327
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:13,346
How come they look exactly the same?

328
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:14,866
They're really twins, then.

329
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:16,467
They look exactly the same.

330
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,306
It turns out she has a twin.

331
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:20,586
So, Xu Yongyu has two daughters?

332
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:21,586
Exactly.

333
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:48,467
Dad.

334
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:56,147
Are you An Yue?

335
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:02,026
That's great!

336
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,066
I've finally found you!

337
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,586
Li Feizhang is not contactable.

338
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:30,626
Who's the mastermind?

339
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:31,826
Do you think

340
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,187
he will spare you?

341
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:55,546
Congratulations, Mr. Xu, for being

342
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,707
reunited with your daughter.

343
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:58,907
Xixi and An Yue look identical.

344
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,747
By her looks, people know
she's your daughter.

345
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:02,987
When I first saw An Yue,

346
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,026
I was shocked

347
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:05,947
especially when she showed

348
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:07,227
the DNA report.

349
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,907
The crew really racked their brains

350
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:11,507
for the surprise.

351
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:13,546
Indeed.

352
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:15,786
I was very surprised, too.

353
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,306
This is a memorable moment.

354
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:20,586
Let's take a photo.

355
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:21,427
Good.

356
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:22,187
Okay.

357
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:24,546
Where is Xu Xixi?

358
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,026
Is that An Yue?

359
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,507
Mr. Xu.

360
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:40,707
Sir,

361
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:41,987
do you want to avoid them?

362
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:43,427
I'll get the press dispersed.

363
00:21:43,826 --> 00:21:45,707
No. Stay beside Xixi.

364
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:46,427
Mr. Xu,

365
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:47,707
could you answer our questions?

366
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:48,586
Everyone knows

367
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:49,947
you only have a daughter, Xu Xixi.

368
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:52,106
Is Ms. An Yue standing by your side here

369
00:21:52,106 --> 00:21:53,346
also your daughter?

370
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:55,626
Were you hiding her identity
purposely or

371
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:56,907
do you have other explanations?

372
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:58,187
Could you answer us?

373
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:00,707
Is the one beside you Xu Xixi or An Yue

374
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:02,747
that you've just got reunited with?

375
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:04,507
Okay, everyone.

376
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:06,147
An Yue

377
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:07,947
is my daughter.

378
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:13,227
She was kidnapped when she was little.

379
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:14,667
For years

380
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,747
I've been searching for her.

381
00:22:17,907 --> 00:22:19,227
The kidnapper is the one

382
00:22:19,427 --> 00:22:22,346
who took Xu Xixi hostage.

383
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:24,346
So it's the kidnapper!

384
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:25,106
Luckily,

385
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:28,106
the kidnapper faced the music.

386
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:30,267
An Yue has found

387
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,747
two loving family members.

388
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,346
I wish to tell everyone concerned
about this matter

389
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:39,947
and the press to stop worrying.

390
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,227
I'll treat An Yue well.

391
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:45,066
She's my daughter, after all.

392
00:22:45,826 --> 00:22:46,987
I should make it up to her,

393
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:48,786
after the years when we were apart.

394
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:52,106
Ah,

395
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:54,626
An Yue

396
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:56,227
isn't well.

397
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:58,467
The three of us have just

398
00:22:58,467 --> 00:22:59,586
been reunited.

399
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:02,947
Wonderful time feels short.

400
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:05,427
We don't want too much

401
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:07,907
attention and disturbance
from the public.

402
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:09,826
I hope you understand.

403
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:13,306
Yueyue,

404
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,227
let's go home.

405
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:19,386
Thank you, dad.

406
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:22,507
Thank you for your concern, everyone.

407
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,427
In the future, I'll try

408
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,786
my best to integrate into my new family.

409
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,626
For easy access
to future updates and

410
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:30,507
your convenience,

411
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:33,187
I've decided to accept

412
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:35,947
the programme crew's invitation

413
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,947
to live-stream my new family
life for seven days.

414
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:41,507
So, everyone can see how the three of us

415
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,267
get along in our daily lives.

416
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:44,907
Right.

417
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:47,346
Right.

418
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:49,306
Good.

419
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:08,866
Sir,

420
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:11,826
you were treating An Yue so well today.

421
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:14,546
Have you changed your mind
to accept her?

422
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:17,227
Accept her?

423
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:25,866
What do you think the daily live stream
starting tomorrow is for?

424
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,187
It's to ensure An Yue

425
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,947
appears in the videos throughout

426
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:35,147
so that I don't get to target her.

427
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,147
In that case,

428
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:39,707
they'll have it their own way.

429
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:42,467
From tomorrow onwards,

430
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:45,786
they'll see what they want,

431
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:49,066
a loving father and a filial daughter.

432
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:54,106
Let everyone see

433
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,987
how biassed I am towards

434
00:24:57,907 --> 00:24:59,907
my sick daughter.

435
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,346
As for Lu Jinyan,

436
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:04,826
let him stay.

437
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:08,106
Instead of letting him stir up trouble,

438
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:11,826
let him stay within my control.

439
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,826
(I'll treat An Yue well.)

440
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:20,667
(She's my daughter, after all.)

441
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:22,467
(I should make up for)

442
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:24,026
(the years when we were apart.)

443
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:27,346
(Ah,)

444
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,066
(An Yue)

445
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:31,707
(isn't well.)

446
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,187
(The three of us)

447
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:35,066
(have just been reunited.)

448
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,187
People

449
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:40,306
may take that to mean that
An Yue is ill.

450
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:42,346
It's his self-fulfilling prophecy

451
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,106
if An Yue disappears.

452
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,747
Don't worry.

453
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:47,786
Once An Yue joins the family,

454
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:49,306
the real-time reporting crew

455
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:50,667
will immediately live-stream.

456
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:52,786
Tian Sui will be watching.

457
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:53,667
Live stream

458
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:55,667
makes Xu Yongyu think twice.

459
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:07,386
I think

460
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,346
besides taking care of me,

461
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:11,227
you're busy with An Yue's case.

462
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,227
Tian Sui and you aren't making progress.

463
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:15,386
You're so quiet.

464
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:17,667
You're not your real self, Ding Beifan.

465
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:20,227
Didn't I promise to wait for

466
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:21,066
your discharge?

467
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:22,026
I'll fulfil my promise.

468
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:23,106
Let's eat.

469
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:34,147
I'm ready for the discharge.

470
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,147
I'll confess to Tian Sui.

471
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:38,626
Today?

472
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:40,187
Yes.

473
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:42,147
Uncle Jiang said I'm recovering well.

474
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:44,826
What about you?

475
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:47,106
You want me to go all out.

476
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:48,987
I wouldn't let you down.

477
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,386
Why? Are you scared?

478
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:58,306
No.

479
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,427
Why would I be scared?

480
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:07,866
Jiang Tiancheng,

481
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:10,346
I've long known that

482
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:13,346
she likes you more.

483
00:27:14,386 --> 00:27:15,507
But I like her.

484
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:18,386
If our relationship isn't successful,

485
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:20,866
it means I don't love her enough.

486
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:24,026
I'm not scared.

487
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:25,106
I'll only work harder.

488
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:28,826
Okay.

489
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:32,467
We'll see if you have time
to work harder.

490
00:27:37,227 --> 00:27:38,227
Where will you confess?

491
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:40,987
I'll send you there.

492
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:50,866
Do you remember the place?

493
00:27:52,427 --> 00:27:53,267
Of course.

494
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,866
We gave Tian Sui flowers together here
for the first time

495
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,586
and agreed to compete fairly.

496
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:02,066
Now that I recall,

497
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,346
it was wonderful.

498
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:08,667
You looked confident and sincere.

499
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:10,546
You don't know how I envied you.

500
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:13,546
I envied you

501
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:15,907
for being able to confess your love to her
freely and fearlessly.

502
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,826
But because of my health,

503
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,866
I wasn't even brave enough to do that.

504
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:26,187
Now everything is better.

505
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,707
The biggest obstacle

506
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:29,427
between her and me is removed.

507
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:33,346
Do you think

508
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,507
my confession will be successful?

509
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,106
Maybe.

510
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:43,546
She...

511
00:28:49,786 --> 00:28:50,626
Tian Sui.

512
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:55,987
Why are you guys here?

513
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,026
Weren't you just discharged today?

514
00:28:58,187 --> 00:28:59,507
I had Ding Beifan send me here.

515
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:01,346
There's something

516
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:02,907
I want to tell you in person.

517
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:11,267
Let's go there.

518
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:18,507
Ah,

519
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:21,707
if there's nothing else, you may leave.

520
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:25,227
If I go back later,

521
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,467
you don't have to send me.

522
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:16,427
I know

523
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:18,386
it's wrong timing for me to be here.

524
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:21,866
But I need to tell you something.

525
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:27,786
I assure you that after this,

526
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,187
I'll never disturb you.

527
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:36,786
Tian Sui,

528
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:39,866
I like you.

529
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:41,346
I...

530
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:42,507
Don't say anything.

531
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:45,066
Please let me finish.

532
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:47,626
Since I met you,

533
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:50,106
my life has become colourful.

534
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:51,147
I want to hold you.

535
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:52,427
I want to enter your life.

536
00:30:54,346 --> 00:30:55,106
I know that

537
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,106
you have someone you like.

538
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,546
I'm not up to your expectations.

539
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:03,106
But I've never given up and
chickened out.

540
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:05,227
Maybe

541
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,507
I don't know about love

542
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:10,626
but I do know that

543
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,826
I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.

544
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:23,667
I may have said too much

545
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:24,947
because I think

546
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:28,346
if I don't say it now,

547
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:31,987
there won't be another chance.

548
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,306
In fact,

549
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:42,066
I indeed used to have a long list of

550
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,066
detailed criteria for a suitor.

551
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,467
I hoped my future partner would be

552
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:51,386
gentle, tall, caring,

553
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:53,586
ambitious, proactive,

554
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:55,227
and most importantly,

555
00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:57,267
we'd share some common ground.

556
00:31:58,346 --> 00:31:59,346
In short,

557
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:01,586
you don't fit in with

558
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:03,987
all the criteria.

559
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,227
But

560
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:17,586
I've still fallen for you.

561
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:26,667
Ding Beifan,

562
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:29,267
let's give it a try.

563
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:38,227
No. Wait a minute.

564
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:39,546
I...

565
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:43,346
Didn't you make any confession?

566
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:45,947
I wanted to confess to her

567
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:48,187
that I came to bid farewell.

568
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:49,467
That's right.

569
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:51,267
Jiang Tiancheng just told me

570
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:52,546
he's leaving Lancheng.

571
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:56,467
So you...

572
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,026
Did you do it purposely?

573
00:33:07,907 --> 00:33:08,786
Nonsense.

574
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:11,306
My only intention was to
bid farewell to her.

575
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,386
You misunderstood me.

576
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:14,826
Okay. You're right.

577
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:16,786
The surgery's done.

578
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:18,066
It was successful.

579
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:20,106
I'm relieved so much.

580
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:21,866
I thought of

581
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:23,947
travelling the world

582
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:26,386
after An Yue's case is settled.

583
00:33:27,026 --> 00:33:29,267
I want to make up for all the
wonderful time

584
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,227
I've lost.

585
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:33,346
I've just

586
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,306
wished him a happy journey.

587
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:39,346
Okay.

588
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,826
I'm making a move.

589
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:44,667
Three's a crowd.

590
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:46,147
I'll drive you.

591
00:33:46,227 --> 00:33:46,907
No, I'm fine.

592
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,786
I told you I don't need
you to send me home.

593
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:51,147
Bye.

594
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,667
Calm down. Don't stir up trouble.

595
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:39,786
Let me do it.

596
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,946
We've infiltrated into Xu family.

597
00:34:51,227 --> 00:34:52,547
Next, distract Xu Yongyu.

598
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:54,747
I'll figure out in the study
the authorised access

599
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:55,506
to Yuyuan Biotechnology base.

600
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:59,306
I'll delay as much as possible.

601
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,866
Xu Yongyu and An Yue are
live-streaming at the garden.

602
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:17,346
Enter the study quickly.

603
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:18,946
Access the computer to get authority.

604
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:42,826
Tiancheng, let's start.

605
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:46,027
(System user can't be changed
but can be added.)

606
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:48,506
(Your palm vein patterns
need to be entered.)

607
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:50,946
(The palm vein authentication device
should be)

608
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:52,107
(at the bottom of the table.)

609
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,150
(Left hand inputting)

610
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:09,986
How long does it take?

611
00:36:10,986 --> 00:36:11,826
Around ten minutes.

612
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,290
(Left hand inputting)

613
00:36:24,587 --> 00:36:25,267
Yueyue,

614
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:27,306
how does the new home

615
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:28,587
feel?

616
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:31,547
It feels good.

617
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,267
I like the place.

618
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:36,426
It's your home now.

619
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:37,627
Feel free.

620
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:40,107
And feel free to talk with daddy.

621
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:45,107
The family has never felt
so joyful before.

622
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:50,466
I have to leave for work.

623
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:52,067
I have to go to the study.

624
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:52,906
I'll be right back.

625
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,120
