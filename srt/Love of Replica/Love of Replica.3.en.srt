00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,279
(Xu Xixi & Xu Mengyun's cooking competition)
As a host of a cooking show,

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,359
(Xu Xixi & Xu Mengyun's cooking competition)
I've never witnessed

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,839
(Xu Xixi & Xu Mengyun's cooking competition)
such a touching friendship in the studio.

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,800
Xixi has been living under my nose
since she was a child.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,920
Why is there a friend whom I don't know?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,519
This is the happiness
we cherish the most.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,960
Zhou.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,719
Cancel the meeting.

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,039
Book the earliest flight home.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,760
Yes. Right away.

=Episode 3=

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,560
Hello.

14
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,879
(Memory loss caused by a car accident?)

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,719
(This is too dramatic.)

16
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,239
(I want to figure out who I am.)

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,839
(So, please)

18
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,239
(bring me to the fishing
village you mentioned.)

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,880
(I might be able to remember something.)

20
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,719
(Okay.)

21
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,119
(When do you want to go?)

22
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:19,679
(11 a.m. tomorrow.)

23
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:20,959
(See you tomorrow.)

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,799
(I have arrived.)

25
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:36,959
(I'll be waiting for you at
the back door of the office.)

26
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,880
Good. Let's move on to the next phase.

27
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:09,839
What's wrong?

28
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,080
Miss, I have a stomach ache.

29
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,119
I'll take a break.

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,799
What's wrong?

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,160
I have a stomach ache.

32
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,440
Can you help me to buy some medicine?

33
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,719
Here. Have some gastric medicine.

34
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,160
I'm not having gastric problem.

35
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,679
I'm having my period.

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,640
Can you buy "that thing" for me?

37
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,559
Here you go.

38
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,600
Why do you have everything with you?

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,600
How can any boy carry this
thing with him all the time?

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,519
It's within my scope of responsibility.

41
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,800
Yueyue.

42
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,039
I used to think you sang very well

43
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,039
and your songs should be heard
by the whole world.

44
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,200
I never thought

45
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,479
you're more promising than I thought.

46
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,959
You became a superstar.

47
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
Also, you play the piano very well.

48
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,279
The broken electronic organ
on the fishing boat,

49
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,120
you always...

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm sorry. I forgot you
lost your memory.

51
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:44,719
It's okay.

52
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,800
Once we get to
the small fishing village,

53
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,959
I'll tell you about it.

54
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,479
(So...)

55
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,640
(Am I really An Yue,
whom he speaks about?)

56
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,000
What's wrong?

57
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,030
(Dad)

58
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,120
Hello, dad.

59
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,519
(Where are you?)

60
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,320
I have a class in the vocal classroom.

61
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,800
Which classroom are you in?

62
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,320
I'm looking for you now.

63
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,800
I...

64
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
Have you come back from abroad?

65
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,200
(The butler said you missed me.)

66
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,320
(So I turned down all the appointments.)

67
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,159
Answer me honestly.

68
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,680
Are you not in the office?

69
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,200
I...

70
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,719
Ask Lu Jinyan to answer the phone.

71
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,839
Dad, Lu Jinyan...

72
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,159
Mr. Xu.

73
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,599
Ms. Xu is not in the office now.

74
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,440
She is filming a short
music video by the beach.

75
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,120
This is a huge matter.

76
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,399
Why are you the only one following her?

77
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:52,880
What if anything happens?

78
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,719
Who is going to be responsible for it?

79
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

80
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,320
Hello, dad.

81
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,080
(This has nothing to do with Lu Jinyan.)

82
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,440
I don't want so many people
to follow me around.

83
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,039
That's why I forced him to do it.

84
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,519
The short music video shooting
was arranged on a short notice.

85
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,560
I don't want you to worry about me.

86
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,080
That's why I kept it from you.

87
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,880
(Xixi.)

88
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,440
Don't do that again.

89
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,200
If you want to go out and do anything,

90
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
you need to let me know.

91
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,959
(Only then I can work in peace.)

92
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,279
(Do you understand?)

93
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:29,959
Yes.

94
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,399
I won't repeat this.

95
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:32,879
Okay.

96
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,520
I'll be waiting for you at home.

97
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,839
Okay.

98
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,119
What sort of music video is that?

99
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,400
Mobile phone.

100
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,599
Hello, Ms. Tian.

101
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,119
I'm Lu Jinyan.

102
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:56,959
Arrange for the shooting.

103
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,560
Yes, notify Director He, now.

104
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,599
You heard me right.

105
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,599
Make a music video.

106
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,479
Stop complaining.

107
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,599
The address has been sent to you.

108
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,119
Hurry up.

109
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,759
Mr. Xu.

110
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,879
Xixi is filming outside.

111
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,280
According to our agreement,

112
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,440
as her manager,

113
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,599
you should be taking care of her.

114
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:21,400
I just finished
reorganising my schedule.

115
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,599
I'm heading to the filming location now.

116
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,320
That's great.

117
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:27,239
I planned to visit Xixi
at her workplace.

118
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,320
Let's go together.

119
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,959
Let me ask the producer

120
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,239
and see if they're still
at the same location.

121
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:32,999
No.

122
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,280
I know where they are.

123
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,760
(Your dad is on his way to see you)

124
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,759
You don't need to tell Xixi.

125
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,800
Let's surprise her.

126
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,999
The journey takes three hours.

127
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,560
You can have a good rest.

128
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,130
(Starlight convenience store)

129
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,879
Lu Jinyan.

130
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,920
You are my bodyguard.

131
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,160
It's your duty to protect me,

132
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,320
but lying for me

133
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,520
is not your job, right?

134
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,599
Why did you let me go?

135
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,999
I knew it.

136
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,800
As expected,

137
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,080
this bodyguard

138
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,119
has ulterior motives.

139
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,119
You like Ms. Xu.

140
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,800
Am I right?

141
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,239
It's getting late.

142
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,320
Let's go.

143
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,680
Here.

144
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,999
Yueyue.

145
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,160
Yueyue.

146
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,800
Are you okay?

147
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,239
I want to be alone.

148
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,839
They all think An Yue as Xu Xixi.

149
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,080
Do they really look identical?

150
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,400
Aren't you working as
a bodyguard for the Xu family?

151
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,719
You must have seen Xu Xixi.

152
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:33,959
Tell me.

153
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,119
Yes.

154
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,719
They look exactly the same.

155
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,560
Did she have a plastic surgery?

156
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,160
I know.

157
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
It must be your boss, Mr. Xu.

158
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,839
He must be a heartless man.

159
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,680
He abandoned An Yue and Aunt An.

160
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,160
That's why they ended up in this place.

161
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,479
Aunt An?

162
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,759
An Yue's mother, An Yemi.

163
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,800
The mother and daughter lived together.

164
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,359
They had been living
on this small fishing boat.

165
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,599
How was their relationship?

166
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,719
Aunt An

167
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,400
was strict with An Yue.

168
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,599
I remember An Yue telling me
that when she was a child,

169
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,599
they spent most of their time at sea.

170
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,479
Only when they needed to buy something,

171
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,440
they would return to the village.

172
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,080
Her world

173
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,879
was confined to everything she saw

174
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,119
through that little piece of glass
on the small fishing boat.

175
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:30,639
Look.

176
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:31,879
It's beautiful.

177
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,359
An Yue's dream was to leave the boat.

178
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,520
Mom.

179
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,680
However, Aunt An didn't allow it.

180
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,400
Besides,

181
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,119
Aunt An didn't allow her
to use a mobile phone

182
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,520
nor the Internet.

183
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,560
She met me when she was 18 years old.

184
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
(The two of us behaved)

185
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,520
(like spies and got a broken phone.)

186
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,759
(However, in the end...)

187
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,599
(An Yue spent most of her life
playing the piano.)

188
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
(No matter how well she played,)

189
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,400
(Aunt An wouldn't praise her.)

190
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:25,800
Mom.

191
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,719
She was not allowed to leave the boat.

192
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,719
She was not allowed
to use a mobile phone.

193
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,959
She was completely cut off
from the outside world.

194
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:41,520
When she grew up...

195
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,959
You don't have to feel bad for her.

196
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,119
Not only she didn't take the wrong path,

197
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,239
she became more optimistic
and enjoyed life

198
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
more than anyone else.

199
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,119
Dingding.

200
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,959
How many times have I tell you?

201
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,119
Don't call me Dingding.

202
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,560
What should you call me?

203
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:33,680
Beifan.

204
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm here.

205
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,119
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,719
I made you look for me for so long.

207
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,879
Do you remember everything now?

208
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:02,800
No.

209
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,000
However, I know I'm not Xu Xixi.

210
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,679
I'm An Yue from Xingguang Village.

211
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,080
I plan to confess to
Mr. Xu when I go back,

212
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,359
so that he can find
Xu Xixi as soon as possible.

213
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,639
Also, my mother is missing, too.

214
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,599
I want to find her as soon as possible.

215
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,159
Don't act rashly.

216
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,320
Obviously, that car accident

217
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,000
was orchestrated by someone

218
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,560
to switch the identities
of you and Xu Xixi.

219
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,240
If you rashly tell Mr. Xu

220
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,320
that you are not Xu Xixi,

221
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,560
he will be suspicious of you.

222
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,560
Then you and your mother

223
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,800
will be in danger.

224
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,839
However, he looks like a kind person.

225
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,240
Anything involving his daughter

226
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,760
turns him paranoid.

227
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
In Xu Xixi's car accident,

228
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,919
if you hadn't been rescued by accident,

229
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,399
the driver, He, might
have to pay with his life.

230
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,760
Not only you can't confess now.

231
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,280
You have to learn how
to act like Xu Xixi

232
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,439
until you find her.

233
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,720
Otherwise, you will be in
a very dangerous situation.

234
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,199
However,

235
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,720
how do I act like her?

236
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:54,359
Xixi.

237
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,599
Father, what brings you here?

238
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:08,080
I came to visit you.

239
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,320
Water.

240
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,119
The room is ready.

241
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:17,800
You can rest there anytime.

242
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:25,040
Are you Xixi's good friend?

243
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,599
Yes, my name is Ding Beifan.

244
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,760
Xixi has been a loner
since she was a child.

245
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,000
It's not easy for her to
have such good friends.

246
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,320
How long have you known each other?

247
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,040
More than ten years.

248
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,480
That's weird.

249
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,040
Since Xixi has supported
you for quite some time,

250
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,639
why isn't there any record

251
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,320
on Xixi's account?

252
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:15,520
Oh...

253
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,119
Cash. She paid in cash.

254
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,280
Throughout her life,

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,040
Xixi has never used cash.

256
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,040
Who are you?

257
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,879
Why are you trying to approach Xixi?

258
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,399
Did you bring her here?

259
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Mr. Xu.

260
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:53,320
Forget it. Let's come clean.

261
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,520
Mr. Xu.

262
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,359
I hired him.

263
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,560
Ms. Tian, ​​isn't this a secret?

264
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,919
Didn't we sign
a non-disclosure agreement?

265
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,399
Mr. Xu is one of us.

266
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,599
Since you're one of us,

267
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,879
Mr. Xu, I won't keep it from you.

268
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,599
I work for Ms. Tian.

269
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,080
She's the one who arranged
for me to be in the live stream,

270
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,720
pretending to be an orphan
funded by Ms. Xu.

271
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,359
It is meant to create an image

272
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,599
of a philanthropist for Ms. Xu.

273
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,520
He's also our outreach
producer for this project.

274
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,560
He's the one who suggested
to film at this fishing village.

275
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,359
How did you find such a place?

276
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,000
Xixi never came

277
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,919
to such a remote and rustic place.

278
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:44,199
It's for work.

279
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,800
I think this is a good place.

280
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,040
Lu Jinyan is here.

281
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,760
What are you worried about?

282
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,199
I'm not worried.

283
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,159
Xixi, what time will
the filming end today?

284
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:03,839
Actually,

285
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,000
there's a problem with
the van over there.

286
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,439
So the shooting will be delayed.

287
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,320
Xixi has to stay here tonight.

288
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
No way.

289
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:14,839
She has to go back with me.

290
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,919
Xu Xixi likes to call
her father "old man".

291
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,960
She has a habit of scolding
people with her arms folded.

292
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,639
Old man, are you done?

293
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,359
I told you that I came here for work.

294
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,839
Don't waste my time, okay?

295
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,960
My daughter has
great passion for work

296
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:50,480
and arts.

297
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,720
I support you.

298
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,080
However, I've come all the way here.

299
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,720
I don't care.

300
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,159
You must have dinner
with me, no matter what.

301
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,040
How many people in
the village know An Yue?

302
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,480
Let me handle it.

303
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Mr. Xu and Ms. Xu.

304
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,560
How about this?

305
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,800
Why don't we take a walk
by the beach first?

306
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,720
Ms. Xu is a superstar.

307
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,040
I have to arrange a private room

308
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,280
so that she won't be
disturbed by people.

309
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,639
Come with me.

310
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,320
Let's go.

311
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:33,560
This small fishing village
has good ambience.

312
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,639
It seems we're going
to have dinner there.

313
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,720
Yueyue.

314
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,159
I recognised you from afar.

315
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:51,560
I knew it was you when you came closer.

316
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,720
Who are these people?

317
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,080
I've never seen them before.

318
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,760
Madam.

319
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,679
She is Xu Xixi.

320
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,839
She is not Yueyue.

321
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,040
This is her father.

322
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
We are his employees.

323
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,919
Yueyue, don't you remember me?

324
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,119
Your full name is An Yue.

325
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,080
Your mother is...

326
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,800
Old woman, what's wrong with you?

327
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,599
Go away! Don't block our way.

328
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,280
I'm wrong?

329
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,520
I'm not wrong.

330
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,439
You are Yueyue.

331
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,280
Yueyue, you don't look well.

332
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,439
You can't even remember me.

333
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,760
You must be sick.

334
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,839
What nonsense is that?

335
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,720
My daughter is fine!

336
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,839
Dad.

337
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,599
She's going to stay healthy!

338
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,199
Let me go.

339
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,280
She will live a long life!

340
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,240
I won't allow anyone...

341
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,119
I won't let anyone to curse my daughter!

342
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,599
No way!

343
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,439
Why did you curse my daughter?

344
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,359
That's enough! Are we still
going to have dinner?

345
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,560
Tell me!

346
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,919
Clear the place now.

347
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,119
Isn't this bad enough?

348
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,399
Madam.

349
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,720
Did you get the wrong person again?

350
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,159
Dad.

351
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,439
I'll bring her away.

352
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,080
I'll send her back now.

353
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,240
Come here, madam.

354
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,240
Xixi.

355
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,399
Don't be scared. It's okay.

356
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,439
I'm here.

357
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,439
It's okay, Xixi. Don't be afraid.

358
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,000
(He's really obsessed with Xu Xixi.)

359
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,040
(He reacted aggressively when
that woman said I was sick.)

360
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,919
(If he knows that I'm not Xu Xixi,)

361
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,560
(I'll be dead.)

362
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,199
Jinyan.

363
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,919
In the future, don't let this
kind of mentally-ill person

364
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:38,760
approach Xixi again.

365
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:40,800
Yes.

366
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,240
It's okay.

367
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,839
Xixi.

368
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,960
Everything is okay.

369
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,679
I'm here.

370
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,520
It's okay.

371
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,439
Everything is fine.

372
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,800
Don't work too hard.

373
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,720
Take care of your health.

374
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:17,520
Jinyan.

375
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,199
Take good care of Xixi.

376
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:22,320
No problem.

377
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:29,399
Mr. Xu, please don't worry.

378
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,199
I promise you that

379
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,080
I will return safely.

380
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:39,919
In that case, this old man

381
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,960
will wait for you at home.

382
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,470
(Parking lot)

383
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,050
(Starlight convenience store)

384
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,439
If you wear these shoes again,

385
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,119
your legs will be injured.

386
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,800
Is there any suitable place
for wedding photos here?

387
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,159
Do you plan to take wedding photos?

388
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,159
Do you have a boyfriend?
Are you getting married?

389
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,240
It is needed for the music video.

390
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,439
I'm looking for something like this.

391
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,800
Is there a place like this?

392
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,520
If there is, please bring me
there to check it out.

393
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,800
We have to hurry up.

394
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,199
I'm not your assistant

395
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,879
nor your boyfriend.

396
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,679
Why should I help you?

397
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,439
Be it an assistant or a boyfriend,

398
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,439
you're even not qualified
for those positions.

399
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,839
I asked you for help

400
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,000
to cover up

401
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,720
the lie you said to Mr. Xu.

402
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,439
Why did you lie for An Yue?

403
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,879
I was not helping her.
I was helping myself.

404
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:22,960
It doesn't matter to me who she is.

405
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,720
I don't want to get involved
with that wealthy family.

406
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,480
I only know she's my artiste.

407
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,599
Also, so far,

408
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:32,839
I'm very satisfied with her performance.

409
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,080
She has the potential to be a superstar.

410
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
No one can stop my star-making plan.

411
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,320
So you'd better watch your mouth.

412
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,480
That's how you protect her.

413
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,320
Okay.

414
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,679
Although we don't have
such a place in our village,

415
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,199
I can help you to build one.

416
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,480
Although I remember that I am An Yue,

417
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,480
my memory is not fully restored.

418
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,760
My mother is missing, too.

419
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,879
Where do you think she went?

420
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,000
She didn't even look for me.

421
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,960
Do you think my mother

422
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,879
has been kidnapped by the mastermind?

423
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,639
It's also possible that after she
found out that you're missing,

424
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,679
she went out to find you.

425
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,240
Maybe when she sees your debut video,

426
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,599
she will contact you.

427
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,359
Ever since I confirmed my identity,

428
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,720
I've been thinking about a question.

429
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,960
Xu Xixi and I

430
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,159
are either twins

431
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:40,000
or I got a plastic surgery
to look like this.

432
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,560
Check my face. Is there any sign
of a plastic surgery?

433
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Hurry up.

434
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,800
Pinch my nose and chin.

435
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,480
Is there any prosthesis?

436
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,320
Pinch harder. Don't worry about it.

437
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:15,560
Your chin is real.

438
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,800
Your nose is real, too.

439
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,119
Your eyes are real as well.

440
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,240
They're all real.

441
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,480
Stop imagining things.

442
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,839
Now that we've reached
the fishing village,

443
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,720
let's follow the lead of your mother

444
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,639
to find out the truth.

445
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,119
Us?

446
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,399
Do you mean that

447
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,720
you're going to help me?

448
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,119
Somebody switched Ms. Xu
and you in front of my eyes.

449
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,000
I want to find out the truth
as much as you do

450
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,480
and find the real Xu Xixi.

451
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:30,399
Thank you.

452
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:38,879
Mom.

453
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,199
This shell is so beautiful.

454
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,800
Let me put it on you.

455
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
This is so beautiful.

456
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,399
Mom, this is for you.

457
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,080
Look.

458
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,399
It's the prettiest shell

459
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:54,679
I picked up this morning.

460
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:55,760
Also, this one.

461
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,720
Pick some.

462
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,639
This.

463
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,000
What's wrong?

464
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,520
Nothing.

465
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,280
