1
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:22,500
Three minutes and fifty seconds,

2
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:24,459
you failed.

3
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:25,667
Again.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,520
(Two years ago)

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,120
(83. Xu Xixi has a
belly button piercing)

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,600
(98. Dislikes cranberry flavor)

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,810
(99. Never eats more than five bites)

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,000
(First floor hallway)

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,940
(101. Never puts on shoes by herself)

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,280

13
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:27,449
Jinyan,

14
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:28,949
I have new discoveries.

15
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:46,239
I found a photo

16
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,699
in your father's photo album.

17
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,824
This photo proves that

18
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,074
your father was involved
in a medical project.

19
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,032
The main objective of the project

20
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:02,323
is to treat Xu Xixi's cancer.

21
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:14,699
Xu Xixi has cancer?

22
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,490
(26 years ago,
laboratory treatment team colleague)

23
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,615
(An Yemi, head of the experiment)
26 years ago,

24
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,740
the director of the medical
project your dad involved with

25
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,740
is An Yemi,

26
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:22,490
An Yue's mother.

27
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:24,991
They are in charge of treating
Xu Yongyu's wife and daughter.

28
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:26,907
During the course of treatment,

29
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:28,824
Xu Yongyu's wife succumbed
to her illness.

30
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,866
Xu Yongyu vowed to treat Xu Xixi

31
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:31,991
at all cost.

32
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:33,699
I found

33
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,116
some information of the medical team.

34
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,032
The data shows that

35
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:36,782
they gave an

36
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,239
astonishing treatment plan,

37
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:40,074
which was to sacrifice An Yue

38
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:42,199
to rescue the terminally ill Xu Xixi.

39
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:44,199
However, it failed for some reason.

40
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,199
The medical team

41
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,782
disbanded three months after that.

42
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:49,116
Many aspects about this

43
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,240
don't make sense at all.

44
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,158
Why did Xu Yongyu hide
the existence of An Yue?

45
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:55,239
Most importantly, why did
they want to sacrifice

46
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,120
a healthy child

47
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,980
(Twins)

48
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,490
(Twins)
to save a terminally ill child?

49
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,116
This is recently

50
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,866
taken at the place where
Ms. Xu works.

51
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,323
I'm sure it's An Yemi.

52
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:23,239
I have sent someone to follow her.

53
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:24,490
We should soon be able to find

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,532
some clues about the kid.

55
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,116
Assign more people

56
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,449
to be around Xixi.

57
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:35,074
Xixi has Lu Jinyan guarding her,

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,866
there shouldn't be any security issues.

59
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,449
Xixi's recent behaviour is too abnormal.

60
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,490
I think

61
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:46,782
something could be wrong with Xixi.

62
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,365
You mean Ms. Xu

63
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,407
is that kid?

64
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,532
Regarding the security
personnel changes,

65
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,365
there's no need to tell Lu Jinyan.

66
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:00,074
Understood.

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,250
(26 years ago)

68
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:13,239
(26 years ago)
Fantastic.

69
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:16,699
Compared to the proto-oncogenes,
the tumor suppressor genes are

70
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,657
significantly more active.

71
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:19,490
Come, both of you,

72
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:21,532
look here, let's record this moment.

73
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,365
One more!

74
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:28,824
Mr. Xu.

75
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,407
- Mr. Xu.
- Mr. Xu.

76
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:32,532
This is the latest lab report.

77
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:34,158
The new treatment plan

78
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,740
achieved initial success.

79
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,323
Very good.

80
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,199
That's good.

81
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,323
When can the surgery be scheduled?

82
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,282
The child is still too young,

83
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,407
a surgery will be risky.

84
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:58,199
We have to wait for a year at least.

85
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:04,240
That works as well.

86
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,574
However, you have to make sure

87
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,199
nothing goes wrong with my daughter

88
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:10,240
during this period of time.

89
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,323
Don't worry.

90
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,260
(25 years ago)

91
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,199
Didn't you promise me

92
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,574
nothing will go wrong?

93
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:34,657
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

94
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:37,239
There were some unforeseen
risks in the process.

95
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,490
I am willing to

96
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:41,074
take full responsibility for this.

97
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:42,574
You want to take responsibility?

98
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,699
How are you going to
take responsibility?

99
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:46,407
What makes you think you can
take the responsibility for this?

100
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,615
It's my daughter's life
we are talking about!

101
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,282
I'm really sorry.

102
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:52,574
I'm willing to resign from...

103
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:54,991
I put you in charge

104
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,323
and told you to ensure
nothing goes wrong!

105
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
How dare you!

106
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,323
You promised me.

107
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:00,740
You promised me yourself!

108
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,907
(Mom, why don't you answer the phone?)

109
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:17,907
(You are still in the
fishing village, right?)

110
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,032
(Why did I become Xu Yongyu's child?)

111
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:26,365
(Mom, please come soon)

112
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:27,991
(and tell me what's going on, okay?)

113
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:37,532
(Mom, why haven't you
responded to my message?)

114
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,699
(Mom, I have amnesia.)

115
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:40,907
(I can't remember anything.)

116
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,824
(You said I am Xu Yongyu's daughter,)

117
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:46,032
(so are Xu Xixi and I twins?)

118
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,949
(Then where did Xu Xixi go?)

119
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:50,907
(Mom, I want to see you.)

120
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,949
(See you at Qingling Mountain)

121
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,407
(tomorrow afternoon at four.)

122
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:21,657
(Before finding out the truth,)

123
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,532
(I can't tell Lu Jinyan anything.)

124
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:25,365
(I have to figure out a
way to go by myself.)

125
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:27,407
A date tomorrow?

126
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,032
Sure.

127
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:30,907
It's a date then, Xixi.

128
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:34,449
Okay, rest early today.

129
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:36,657
Good night.

130
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:43,907
The time and place of my
date with Xu Xixi tomorrow,

131
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:44,615
did you get all of that?

132
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:46,239
Be alert,

133
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,782
take more suggestive photos
when we are together.

134
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:51,074
Play with the angles.

135
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,699
Don't worry, as long as
money is enough,

136
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,032
everything can be done.

137
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:55,782
Rest assured.

138
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:00,490
I'm leaving.

139
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,032
(There is no recording for
the show tomorrow,)

140
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,532
(take the time to rest well.)

141
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,239
There are some ugly words

142
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,449
which I didn't want to mention

143
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,615
in order to save Xixi's face.

144
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:47,782
But it seems like

145
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:49,282
you are not observant at all.

146
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,490
Do you even know what
it means to be sensible?

147
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:58,824
In these past few days of recording,

148
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,740
the atmosphere between me and
Xixi is getting better gradually.

149
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,449
I hope you won't show up
during the hike tomorrow.

150
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:06,991
Please don't hinder our date.

151
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:10,074
A date?

152
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:15,239
That's right.

153
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,782
Why would Ms. Xu

154
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:22,240
report everything to a bodyguard?

155
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:25,239
As a person,

156
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:28,240
we need to know our place.

157
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:31,282
Don't let the articles on the Internet

158
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:34,282
saying the young lady and
the bodyguard is a match

159
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,407
get to your head.

160
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:38,323
The date tomorrow

161
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:39,949
was proposed by Xu Xixi
herself to me.

162
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,991
Camping at Qing Ling Mountain,

163
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:49,239
out in the wilderness,

164
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,240
just a man and a woman,

165
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:55,074
she is

166
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,199
obviously hinting at me.

167
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:01,574
I wonder

168
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,615
what's the feeling

169
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:06,323
with dating Ms. Xu?

170
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,490
You want to hit me, don't you?

171
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:11,907
Let me tell you,

172
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:13,116
there are cameras all over here.

173
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:15,282
If you hit me,

174
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:16,532
you will drag Ms. Xu down with you.

175
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:17,239
Then...

176
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:26,158
Watch your mouth.

177
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,282
Be polite to Ms. Xu.

178
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:29,824
Remember,

179
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,532
there are no surveillance
cameras on Qing Ling Mountain.

180
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:58,991
Stop finding information
about An Yue's life.

181
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,074
You wouldn't wish

182
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,365
An Yue to fall into your father's
fate as well, would you?

183
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,407
Did my dad's car accident

184
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:12,407
have anything to do with you?

185
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:17,032
At that time,

186
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:19,449
I was in a phone call with him.

187
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,740
You don't need to worry,

188
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,199
and don't look for us again.

189
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:26,323
It's dangerous here.

190
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:28,949
(Yes, we should be more careful.)

191
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,615
(Ms. Xu's condition is getting worse.)

192
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,532
I was ready for this.

193
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,323
I have already asked An Yue to study

194
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,699
the information you sent me.

195
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,239
If Xu Yongyu...

196
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:41,490
(Someone is following me.)

197
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,991
(I think he's Xu Yongyu's man.)

198
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,239
(Don't worry,)

199
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,490
(I'll keep the secret.)

200
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,074
(I'm hanging up.)

201
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:54,240
He suffered because of me and An Yue.

202
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,240
The reason I came to you today

203
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,323
is because of An Yue as well.

204
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:07,158
She's in a very dangerous situation.

205
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:08,949
Tonight,

206
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:11,824
Xu Yongyu sent more
people to monitor her.

207
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,199
I think

208
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:17,699
Xu Yongyu has begun to doubt her identity.

209
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:24,032
What do you need me to do?

210
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:26,365
What time is it now?

211
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:30,532
It's nine o'clock.

212
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,365
Remember this number.

213
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,240
When I yell nine,

214
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,074
protect An Yue.

215
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:40,239
What do you mean?

216
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:43,824
When we meet next time,

217
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,365
you will understand.

218
00:13:58,116 --> 00:13:58,907
Be careful.

219
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:50,100
(Qing Ling Mountain)

220
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:32,239
What are you looking at?

221
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,615
Give me the water.

222
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:44,532
Here you go.

223
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:26,949
This is so tiring.

224
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,199
Take more pictures of
my left cheek later,

225
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,199
it looks better.

226
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,032
No problem, as long as money is enough,

227
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:36,407
everything can be done.

228
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:40,032
You just have to sort out the
photos and send them to me.

229
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,116
Don't worry about the other things.

230
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:43,323
I promise you will get
exclusive coverage.

231
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:46,449
Don't worry.

232
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,490
Where is the heroine?

233
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:51,490
I don't see her.

234
00:16:58,615 --> 00:16:59,532
Give me the phone.

235
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:09,991
Hello?

236
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,574
Xixi,

237
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:12,740
are you here yet?

238
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:13,949
I'm here.

239
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:15,991
I just started hiking.

240
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,699
Why is this mountain so high?

241
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:19,490
How about you come
down and bring me up?

242
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:21,949
Xixi,

243
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:23,657
I'm already at the top of the mountain.

244
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,158
Do you not want to come?

245
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:31,449
Fine, since you have
so little sincerity,

246
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:32,615
our date today...

247
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:33,782
(Don't, Xixi,)

248
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:36,158
(I was just joking with you.)

249
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,740
I was afraid that

250
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,116
you were waiting for us
up here for too long.

251
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,699
We'll go down and bring you up now.

252
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:43,282
All right then, hurry up.

253
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:03,449
I'll find a place to hide, okay?

254
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,282
Yes, you can just wait here.

255
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:05,991
You come down with me.

256
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:07,074
All right.

257
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,824
Sir, An Yemi is at Qingling Mountain.

258
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:18,991
Let's go there now.

259
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:21,116
But it's weird,

260
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:23,866
Ms. Xu is also heading
towards that direction.

261
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:26,657
Xixi?

262
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:45,520
(Qingling Mountain)

263
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:57,949
Hello?

264
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:58,940
(Qing Ling Mountain)

265
00:18:58,949 --> 00:18:59,740
(Qing Ling Mountain)
Xixi?

266
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,699
(Qing Ling Mountain)

267
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:01,199
(Qing Ling Mountain)
You...

268
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,407
I'm already at the
bottom of the mountain,

269
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,240
where are you?

270
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:05,239
Didn't you say you were at
the top of the mountain?

271
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:06,282
I came up,

272
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:07,782
but no one was here.

273
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,239
Come on up, I'm terrified.

274
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:13,407
What? Xixi...

275
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:15,323
Hello? Xixi?

276
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:25,866
Just you wait and see.

277
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:32,574
Let's go back up.

278
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,940
(Qingling Mountain)

279
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:27,740
Mom!

280
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:30,240
An Yue!

281
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:32,449
Mom!

282
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:33,032
An Yue!

283
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,991
Don't talk and go along.

284
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,323
Let go of Ms. Xu!

285
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:46,991
Don't move!

286
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:52,824
Don't move!

287
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:54,740
Ms. Xu is still in her hands.

288
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:01,782
An Yemi,

289
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:02,866
let her go!

290
00:21:06,158 --> 00:21:06,866
An Yemi,

291
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:08,574
I'll give you one last chance.

292
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:10,615
Don't repeat your mistakes.

293
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:12,282
Stop!

294
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:18,824
Xu Yongyu,

295
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:21,615
you don't have to threaten me.

296
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,991
I'm all alone now,

297
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:26,907
I have nothing to be afraid of.

298
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:29,574
What will it take for
you to let Xixi go?

299
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:32,615
You made me infertile

300
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,032
and rendered me unable
to become a mother.

301
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,782
I will fulfill your wish now.

302
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:41,532
If you want to be a good father,

303
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,240
and save your daughter,

304
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:45,074
jump down from here.

305
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,240
All right.

306
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,907
You want me to jump down from here,

307
00:21:58,532 --> 00:21:59,407
I'm okay with that.

308
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:01,532
But let her go first.

309
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:03,449
Xixi is innocent!

310
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:10,282
What are you doing?

311
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,240
Stop!

312
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:19,032
Stop stepping back!

313
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:21,824
With each of my count,

314
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,282
take a step forward.

315
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:33,657
Don't listen to her!

316
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:36,991
Xixi,

317
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:38,740
don't be afraid.

318
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,158
I'm here.

319
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:42,490
One!

320
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:49,116
Two!

321
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:52,907
Three!

322
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:55,949
Four!

323
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:01,199
Five!

324
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,532
Mr. Xu, be careful!

325
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,158
Protect Xixi.

326
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:14,449
Six!

327
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:20,991
Seven!

328
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,282
It is only through this way

329
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,074
he will stop doubting you.

330
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:30,907
Remember,

331
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:33,239
you are Xu Xixi.

332
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:36,824
Eight!

333
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:42,657
What do you need me to do?

334
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:43,949
What time is it now?

335
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:45,158
It's nine o'clock.

336
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:46,740
Remember this number.

337
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:49,490
When I yell nine,

338
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:51,490
protect An Yue.

339
00:23:55,116 --> 00:23:55,991
Nine!

340
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:01,323
Ms. Xu!

341
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:08,949
Xixi!

342
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,980
Everything is all right now.

343
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,782
Everything is all right now.

344
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,449
Is Xixi all right?

345
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:21,699
She's okay, she's just in shock.

346
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:32,615
Go and make sure that she's dead.

347
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,782
I need undeniable proof that she's dead.

348
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:36,449
Yes, sir.

349
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:00,699
Sir, the police recovered
a female body

350
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:01,866
from the waters surrounding
Qingling Mountain.

351
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:04,574
It's been confirmed that
the body is An Yemi's.

352
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:07,158
I think An Yemi suddenly
appeared this time

353
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:08,824
because she wanted to take revenge
on what happened to her before.

354
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,782
Looking at her trying to kill Ms. Xu today,

355
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,490
can we deduce that

356
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:15,116
Ms. Xu

357
00:25:15,323 --> 00:25:16,282
isn't the same person as the kid before?

358
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:17,699
Nine.

359
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,282
As for Dr. Zheng's side...

360
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:28,323
Let him come back to the country.

361
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:30,991
Whether she is the real Xixi,

362
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,574
everything will be clear after the test.

363
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:34,740
Understood.

364
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:52,407
She's fine,

365
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,158
but she needs more rest.

366
00:25:58,032 --> 00:25:58,740
Thank you.

367
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,199
I'm leaving then.

368
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,080
(Email sent by An Yemi)

369
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:45,032
(An,)

370
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:49,824
(this is a timed message.)

371
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:54,532
(When you see this video,)

372
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:57,657
(it is possible that)

373
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:00,532
(I've already gone.)

374
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,699
(I know)

375
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,699
(you must have a lot of questions.)

376
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:07,866
(I will tell you everything.)

377
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,699
(When you and Xu Xixi were first born,)

378
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:15,824
(Xu Xixi)

379
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:19,240
(inherited the cancer gene
from your biological mother,)

380
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:22,365
(but you are healthy.)

381
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:26,782
(After your biological mother died,)

382
00:29:27,824 --> 00:29:29,615
(Xu Yongyu was afraid that
the tragedy will repeat itself,)

383
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,490
(so he set a cruel plan in motion.)

384
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:38,240
(He wanted to sacrifice
you to save Xu Xixi.)

385
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:41,240
As for me, I

386
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,240
was the person in charge of this plan.

387
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:50,991
I can't stand

388
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:54,074
to watch you die like this.

389
00:29:55,949 --> 00:29:57,740
(So I secretly took you away.)

390
00:30:00,158 --> 00:30:01,365
(I told Xu Yongyu)

391
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,116
(that the plan failed)

392
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:04,490
(and you were dead.)

393
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:08,991
I spent so many years

394
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,158
pushing you

395
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:13,657
to do things you didn't like to do

396
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,490
(and training you)

397
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,239
(because I was afraid that one day)

398
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,199
(I have to send you back to Xu Yongyu)

399
00:30:20,323 --> 00:30:21,991
(as a last resort.)

400
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,240
(I certainly don't want)

401
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,657
(this day to come.)

402
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:30,782
(But a phone call a year ago)

403
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:34,239
(shattered our lives.)

404
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
Xu Yongyu

405
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:41,699
somehow found out that you're alive

406
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:43,949
and was looking for you everywhere.

407
00:30:44,824 --> 00:30:46,699
He restarted the plan.

408
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:51,323
I used the method of
exchanging identities

409
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:52,907
between you and Xu Xixi

410
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:55,866
and sent you back to the Xu family.

411
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,657
At first,

412
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:03,824
everything was going smoothly.

413
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,199
(But you suddenly lost your memory.)

414
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:11,991
(This happened too suddenly.)

415
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:15,866
I'm stupid.

416
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,282
I have no other way.

417
00:31:23,158 --> 00:31:24,449
I can only use my death

418
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:29,490
(to dispel Xu Yongyu's
suspicions about you.)

419
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,782
(Looking back at my life,)

420
00:31:36,657 --> 00:31:38,158
I made a lot of mistakes.

421
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,991
But what I did right

422
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,866
was that I took you away

423
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:48,949
and kept you alive.

424
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:53,907
(Don't worry,)

425
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:56,365
the real Xu Xixi

426
00:31:56,824 --> 00:31:58,740
is in a very safe place now.

427
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:01,949
She is living a great life.

428
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:04,199
She is happy and free.

429
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:05,991
So,

430
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:07,991
all you have to do

431
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:10,866
is to keep being Xu Xixi.

432
00:32:13,657 --> 00:32:14,699
(But in the future,)

433
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:19,574
I can't be with you anymore.

434
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:23,949
You have to live well.

435
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,239
Remember,

436
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,449
I love you.

437
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:15,239
(I found Aunt An's call records.)

438
00:33:16,449 --> 00:33:17,239
(During all these years,)

439
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,824
(she had only been in
contact with one person.)

440
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:20,991
(This is the person's number.)

441
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:17,490
Doesn't this sound special?

442
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:21,158
It's like the sound of
loading a bullet.

443
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,199
(It's Lu Jinyan.)

444
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,032
(Everyone is acting.)

445
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,991
(Everyone is lying to me.)
