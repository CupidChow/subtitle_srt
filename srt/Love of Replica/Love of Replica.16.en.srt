1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,879
(Who do you think is more
pathetic between the two of us?)

2
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,559
(You don't have to
compare yourself to me.)

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
(Owing to you,
I have everything I have now.)

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,839
(We are like light and shadow,)

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,640
(performing the dual-sided life
in competition with each other.)

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,839
(But to put it bluntly,)

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,719
(a shadow is just a shadow.)

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,200
(Xixi.)

9
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,200
(Where do you think is the boundary)

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,719
(between the clone
and the original body?)

11
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,320
(Neglecting the fact
we are genetically identical,)

12
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,560
(we have our respective memories.)

13
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,640
(We get moved to tears,)

14
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,000
(we seek emotional fulfillment,)

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,719
(we all have the
capacity for self-realisation,)

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,240
(and we all have the ability
to transfer our emotions to others.)

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,479
(We don't have a difference at all.)

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,560
(Of course we are different.)

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,039
(Without light
there would be no shadow.)

20
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,240
(But without shadow)

21
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,920
(the light would only be brighter.)

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,040
(Xixi.)

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,079
(You are not my shadow.)

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,599
(You are just who you are.)

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,959
(We have different memories.)

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,480
(We are loved and
cherished by different people.)

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,439
(Will all of these disappear)

28
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,079
(just because the markings of clones?)

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,560
(Just like your dad,)

30
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,599
(his love towards you)

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,319
(will not change because of anything.)

32
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,239
(I think I am lucky)

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,599
(that I was created)

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,159
(so I can perceive the world.)

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,760
(Even though this is owing to you.)

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
(An Yue,)

37
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,480
(thank you.)

38
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,840
(But to me,)

39
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,680
(it is not the emotion
that differentiate)

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
(the clone and the original body.)

41
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,599
(It is the dignity.)

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,439
(Only by self-igniting, the shadow is
completely independent from the light.)

43
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,480
(Even if it's just for a moment.)

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,319
(Xixi, what are you doing?)

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,439
(There are times
I can't make decisions on my own.)

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,879
(But at least,)

47
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,520
(I can decide to leave with dignity)

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,599
(like a human.)

49
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,280
(Please tell my dad
that I love him so much.)

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,120
(And)

51
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,080
(I'm glad to meet you.)

54
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:17,745
Dad.

55
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:19,666
Dad.

56
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:20,706
Step aside.

57
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:22,345
Dad.

58
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:26,905
Dad.

59
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:29,506
Dad.

60
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:29,986
Xixi.

61
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:32,506
Xixi.

62
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:33,146
Dad.

63
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:36,625
Xixi.

64
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:38,226
Dad.

65
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:39,946
Please don't

66
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:42,905
keep repeating the mistakes.

67
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,745
I don't want...

68
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,506
I don't want you to do this for my...

69
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:55,986
Xixi.

70
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:57,506
Xixi.

71
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,465
There are no signs of life.

72
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:10,386
She loses

73
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,065
the sense of survival.

74
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:16,146
Xixi.

75
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:18,665
How could Xixi die?

76
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:21,345
No.

77
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:22,866
It is impossible.

78
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:25,306
It's just that her heart stops beating.

79
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:26,706
She just needs
to change a healthy heart.

80
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:27,545
Mr. Xu.

81
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:28,905
Why are you all still standing there?

82
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:32,345
We have clones.

83
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:34,585
Transplant the heart
and the brain at once.

84
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:35,345
Don't!

85
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:37,225
Xu Yongyu, are you crazy?

86
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:40,345
Don't!

87
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:57,465
Don't move.

88
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:10,465
Don't be afraid.

89
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:11,905
I'll bring you back to home shortly.

90
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:14,105
Don't move.

91
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:15,066
Are you all right?

92
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:15,506
Yes.

93
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,306
Where is Xu Yongyu?

94
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:36,866
It's because of
you all that Xixi died.

95
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,706
No one will be remitted.

96
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:43,025
I want you all to die together with her.

97
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:46,506
Be careful.

98
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:47,905
There is a self-destruct device
in the building

99
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:50,146
and explosives are scattered
throughout the underground base.

100
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:01,186
Gosh.

101
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:02,826
The self-destruct system is triggered.

102
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:04,746
The bomb will explode in five minutes.

103
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:15,025
Run.

104
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,105
There are explosives.

105
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:18,665
Faster.

106
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:25,706
Tiancheng, what's going on right now?

107
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:27,306
Something must go wrong.

108
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:28,386
You try to check what's the problem.

109
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:30,545
(The self-destruct device
only recognise your palm print.)

110
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:31,985
(Once your palm print is not detected,)

111
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:32,866
(the bomb will explode immediately.)

112
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:34,545
(Don't move your hand away.)

113
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:35,425
What should we do now?

114
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:38,545
I'm trying to
terminate the self-destruct system.

115
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:46,506
The system has

116
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,706
interrupted my access to log in.

117
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:50,506
I need some time to
construct a new connection.

118
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:51,626
How long do you need?

119
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,465
(At least a couple of minutes.)

120
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:54,826
Dayu,

121
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,105
notify everyone to evacuate.

122
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:56,785
All right.

123
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,506
Tian Sui, An Yue.

124
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:58,306
You all have to leave here.

125
00:06:58,306 --> 00:06:58,946
Ding Beifan,

126
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:02,345
please take care of my dad.

127
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:04,386
Don't worry.

128
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,225
What about you?

129
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:09,985
No worries.

130
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:11,386
60 seconds will be
enough for me to escape.

131
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:15,545
I will obediently listen to you

132
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:16,506
and not hold you back.

133
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:18,186
I will wait for you at the lift.

134
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:20,545
But if you deceive me,

135
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:22,585
I will die with you.

136
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:25,025
I assured that I will never lie to you.

137
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,306
Dad, you go up first.

138
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:31,985
Later we return home together
after I go up.

139
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:33,746
Return home together.

140
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,025
Let's go.

141
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,186
An Yue, go.

142
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,105
For now, protecting ourselves
is protecting them.

143
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:43,066
Otherwise they have
to spare time to bother us.

144
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:44,345
Hurry up, An Yue.

145
00:07:44,946 --> 00:07:45,585
Go.

146
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,386
Faster, An Yue.

00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:58,425

148
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,545
Run.

149
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:02,266
Run away.

150
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,025
Hurry up.

151
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:03,946
Be faster.

152
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,186
Quick.

153
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:07,146

157

00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:28,345
How could I go?

159
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:29,746
Not only me.

160

All of you

161
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:35,586
should die together with her.

162
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,346
Up to this point,

163
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,866
you still don't want to give up.

Are you the saviour?

There is no much time.

00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:58,785
Fast.

174
00:08:58,825 --> 00:08:59,699
Wait for me.

175
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,620
♪I can't stop loving you♪

♪Even though I know
that you don't feel the same♪

177
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,025
Faster.

178
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:08,905
Go.

179
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,000
♪I don't know who to blame
or what to say♪

180
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:30,626
Go in, quick.

181
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:31,866
- Let me in.
- Quick.

182
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:32,506
Quick.

183
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,266
Come in.

184
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,185
Ding Beifan.

185
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:38,386
You go up first.
There are three minutes left.

186
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:39,545
I'll wait for the next lift.

187
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:41,466
Tian Sui.

188
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:43,746
Let's go on a date

189
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,386
after I go up.

190
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,270
♪If I had a chance to do this over again♪

191
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:00,785
Uncle Gu, you don't have to worry.

192
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:01,825
Jiang Tiancheng is there.

193
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:04,305
(I still can't connect to the system.)

194
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:07,025
You go up first.

195
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:08,665
I have to get back to the lab.

196
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,665
I remember there is
a circuit of the self-destruct system.

197
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:12,386
Cutting the circuit off

198
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,746
can delay the explosion for one minute.

199
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:18,185
Uncle Gu, it's too risky.

200
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:19,825
(There is no time.)

201
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,785
Uncle Gu, I come along with you.

202
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,626
It will be faster that I push you.

203

♪I'll let you go♪

205
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,226
Then I would have
to make you to kill them.

206
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,866
I want to make
them to die on your hands.

207
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,146
Old man, who are you cursing?

208
00:10:58,705 --> 00:10:59,305
Xixi.

209
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:02,065
Xixi.

210
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:11,905
Old man.

211
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:15,545
You see, your hair has turned all grey,

212
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:16,386
why don't you dye it?

213
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:18,106
How ugly.

214
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:26,545
Daddy is busy recently.

215
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:28,705
I don't have time for it.

216
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:32,226
Xixi.

217
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:37,545
Don't worry. Daddy will not get old.

218
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:48,226
Let's go home.

219
00:11:57,705 --> 00:11:58,746
You are not Xixi.

220
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,305
Xixi has died.

221
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,545
Hurry up.

222
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:07,506
Left hand side.

223
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:13,545
Over there.

224
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,626
The most effective
self-defence technique

225
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:23,945
is to use the hardest parts of your body

226
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:26,386
to strike the most vulnerable parts
of the human body.

227
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:29,986
Temple,

228

(Uncle Gu succeed.)

231
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:54,945
(They gain one more minute.)

232
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:55,665
(Run.)

233
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:57,905
Go.

234
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:08,185
What are you waiting for?

235
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:41,945
The staff in the building has evacuated.

236
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:43,226
The police have gathered

237
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:45,545
all the criminal evidence of Xu Yongyu,

238
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:48,665
and his accomplice
Zheng Guangzhi has surrendered.

239
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:49,626
Watch out!

240
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:51,106
Stay behind the line.

241
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:51,945
Quick.

242
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,945
Ding Beifan, where are you guys?

243
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,346
Why haven't you come out yet?

244
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,425
Hurry up.

245
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:11,705
Hurry up.

246
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,266
Miss.

247
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:20,945
Officer.

248
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:21,945
It's dangerous inside.

249
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,025
There are still people inside.

250
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:24,866
They haven't come out yet.

251
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:26,986
They are still inside.

252
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:28,266
Kindly step back.

253
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:31,545
(Li Feizhang always has big news)
(There are still people inside, officer.)

254
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,346
(Please rescue them.)

255
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:44,466
How many of them are still inside?

256
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,146
No idea.

257
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,185
They are coming out.

258
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:49,746
Here they are.

259
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:51,705
Is that Xu Xixi?

260
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:54,665
They are coming out.

261
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:56,346
Xu Yongyu is also coming out.

262
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:57,346
Xixi.

263
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:58,785
Xixi is still inside.

264
00:14:58,785 --> 00:14:59,626
Is there anybody else?

265
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:00,346
Anyone else?

266
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:05,025
How many people left?

267
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:05,665
Yes.

268
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:06,626
Has everybody come out?

269
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:07,945
Supposedly.

270
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:08,665
Where is my dad?

271
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:09,866
And Ding Beifan?

272
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:26,266
Tian Sui, let's cancel

273
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:28,305
our date.

274
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,540
(Lancheng People's Hospital)

275
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:47,986
You are awake.

276
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:49,866
Tian Sui, I'm all right.

277
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,705
I'm fine.

278
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:56,665
Ding Beifan,

279
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:59,466
get well soon,

280
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:01,185
and we'll go on a date

281
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:03,266
once you're
discharged from the hospital.

282
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:06,265
Really?

283
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:07,866
Don't simply move.

284
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:10,665
You have injuries all over your body.

285
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:11,826
Doctor said

286
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:13,425
you can survive

287
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:14,786
because you are resilient.

288
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:19,745
It's not because I'm resilient.

289
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:22,185
It's because Lu Jinyan's dad saved me.

290
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,826
He returned back because

291
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:27,146
he was worried about Lu Jinyan.

292
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,546
He knew the location of some of the bombs,

293
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:34,026
so

294
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:39,386
he took the closest one for me.

295
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,626
Good morning, Uncle Gu.

296
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:09,026
Then, I'll wait for you in the car.

297
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:15,665
Dad,

298
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:18,465
I'll go then.

299
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,265
Don't worry about me.

300
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:23,665
After joining the military,

301
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,425
your identity as a soldier will weight more than

302
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,346
that of a son.

303
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:31,346
Your personal honor,
family, and emotions

304
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:33,705
must all be subordinated
to the collective interest.

305
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:36,465
This is the responsibility of a soldier.

306
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:37,826
Understand?

307
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:41,826
This path is not easy.

308
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:43,905
There will be lots of challenges.

309
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:46,185
And I can't do anything to help you.

310
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:51,665
If you encounter the
darkest moment in your life,

311
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:56,346
I hope there will be a beam of light

312
00:18:57,306 --> 00:18:58,705
the brightens up
the way in front of you

313
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:00,306
and guides you to the right track.

314
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:16,546
You are daddy's
biggest pride for my lifetime.

315
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:18,985
Whenever

316
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:20,505
you want to come back,

317
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,826
I will always be
waiting for you here.

318
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:29,066
Dad.

319
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:32,985
Wait for me.

320
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:37,826
It's getting dark, let's go in.

321
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,185
Wait.

322
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:52,306
It's not the sky getting dark,

323
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:57,786
it's the stars shining.

324
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:09,866
Your dad and my mom

325
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:13,225
have become the stars in the sky.

326
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,786
They will always
accompany and protect us.

327
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,306
Everything he did was for me.

328
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:32,265
I knew that

329
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:38,225
he wanted to be my pride too.

330
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,350
(Xu Yongyu, Zheng Guangzhi, and others have been punished
for their illegal and criminal behavior.)

331
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,610
(Lu Jinyan, Jiang Tiancheng, and others have been punished
for illegally using monitoring equipment.)

332
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,440
(Dedicated to those
who believe in justice.)

333
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,530
(Even those who do the right thing
should do so through legal means.)

334
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,480
(Justice and crime are not multiple-choice questions.
To do justice, one must be upright.)

335
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,470
(Two Years Later)

336
00:22:55,505 --> 00:22:56,265
It's real.

337
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:41,745
Where were you then?

338
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:47,665
I guess An Yemi treated you well.

339
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:23,626
An Yue.

340
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:53,265
Happy birthday, Xixi.

341
00:24:58,626 --> 00:24:59,306
Let's go.

342
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:09,985
I've just received a call.

343
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,066
Mr. Xu passed away in prison.

344
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,265
Who are you trying
to fool with this proposal?

345
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:51,106
What I want is a
real public welfare activity,

346
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:51,945
not just a show.

347
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:53,026
Go and modify it first.

348
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:53,985
I'm busy with something else.

349
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:55,225
Have a conference call later.

350
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:55,985
Bye.

351
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:02,866
80 yuan will do.

352
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:04,185
Okay.

353
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:05,546
Let me send you out.

354
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:06,586
Sure.

355
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:09,465
Tian,

356
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:11,705
no wonder I liked you at first sight.

357
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,465
You are as competent as me that

358
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:15,265
you can take care of everything.

359
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:16,745
It's still far from comparing to you,

360
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:18,905
especially your braised pork.

361
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:20,386
It's just a piece of cake.

362
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,185
Let me show you
something else next time.

363
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:24,225
Come over and have a meal with Beifan.

364
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:24,985
Sure.

365
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,185
I'll go then.

366
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,026
I'll transfer the money later.

367
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:27,626
Sure.

368
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:29,225
Waiting for your bruised pork, aunt.

369
00:26:29,306 --> 00:26:30,306
Beifan is back.

370
00:26:30,665 --> 00:26:31,465
Go ahead.

371
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:36,586
Ms. Tian.

372
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,745
You're putting pressure on me.

373
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:39,945
In what way?

374
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:41,265
Are you afraid that I will take away

375
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:43,505
the title of the most
favored son in your village?

376
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:44,745
Don't you know that

377
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:47,425
you are replacing me

378
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:51,146
to be the most favoured
daughter-in-law in this village?

379

Tian Sui.

381
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,026
Sorry. I intended to

382
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:01,745
bring you here to relax,

383
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:04,106
but I didn't expect that
it would make you more tired.

384
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:08,425

I want to thank you for not killing me.

509
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:04,431
But to be serious,

510
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:06,152
this story is great.

511
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,232
Can I adapt this into a stage play?

512
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:11,272
No problem.
I wouldn't charge you any copyright fee.

513
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,632
For the next season,

514
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:18,112
could you add few more lines for me?

515
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:23,551
Adding few more lines?

516
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:26,551
Depends on your performance then.

517
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,551
But you just make a point.

518
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,511
For the next season,

519
00:39:34,112 --> 00:39:35,031
wait for me to return together.
