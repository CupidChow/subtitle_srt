1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,039
I've voluntarily paid off

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,519
all the taxes.

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:11,880
Now I'm

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,039
absolutely vindicated.

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,320
And I can withstand
the scrutiny from netizens.

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,079
The OD brand launch event

7
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,559
is my first activity after returning.

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,960
I want you to help me build momentum
and promote it as much as possible.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,160
What kind of
marketing theme we should use then?

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm holding the same activity with her.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,320
I want every single photo you take

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,759
to be more stunning than Xu Xixi's.

13
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,640
It's really bizarre.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,039
How can I see her everywhere?

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,239
Wait, Xu Xixi is on her video live show.

16
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,280
Of course I'm happy.

17
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,200
Who would be sad on their birthday?

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,760
Reverse.

19
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,959
I wondered why her singing
improved so much in a sudden.

20
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,519
It turns out she
formed a twin girl group

21
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,439
and debuted with lip-syncing.

And you will look for An Yue.

27
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:39,852
Tiancheng, thanks.

28
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,532
If you dare to see her,

29
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:50,532
I will tell my dad.

30
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:54,132
I guess you all are afraid of my dad

31
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,412
to find out about her identity, right?

00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:31,051
(If we both pretended as one another,)

35

36
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:34,692

37
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:35,331
I wouldn't.

38
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:38,491
Your birthday is two days away,

39
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:40,452
let's go to that old
movie theater again

40
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:41,931
and watch a movie.

41
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,692
Once we find out the truth,

42
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:46,852
and send the culprit
who harmed my dad to the court,

43
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,172
we will leave here immediately.

44
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,692
And live our dream life.

45
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:53,412
We'll throw you a birthday party too.

It will be much better than theirs.

47

48

I will spend my birthday with just him.

96
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,532
(The App you installed
on my phone is alerting.)

97
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:38,931
(Anything happened to you?)

98
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:40,372

00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:44,532
(Jiang Tiancheng?)

101
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:47,252
(Jiang Tiancheng, are you okay?)

102
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,012
(Hello?)

103
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,372
Uncle Jiang, how is Tiancheng?

104
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:03,451
He has woken up.

105
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,051
But,

106
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,971
he decided to undergo the surgery.

107
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:08,292
However,

108
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:10,372
for his current state,

109
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:12,652
the success rate of the surgery
can only reach 20% at maximum.

110
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,652
So you all better be mentally prepared.

111
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:23,571
What happened
to Jiang Tiancheng, actually?

112
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:25,492
Why does he need to undergo a surgery?

113
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:31,012
There is a shrapnel

114
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:34,652
stuck in him.

115
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:48,292
I haven't died yet.

116
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,211
Can you all

117
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:52,051
not be like this?

118
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,731
Tiancheng, have you decided yet?

119
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:03,331
I have been delaying it for so many years.

120
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,372
Finally

121
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:09,012
I made the decision to bet on it.

122
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:12,851
Treat it as
another mission to be executed then.

123
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:17,091
Failure will not be tolerated.

124
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:20,691
All right.

125
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,412
Actually, since the moment I was injured,

126
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:27,451
my life

127
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,372
has been in a stationary state.

128
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,612
It's just like

129
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:37,012
waiting at a station,

130
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:39,772
seeing everyone

131
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,451
holding their fares

132
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:42,652
and boarding the train,

133
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,211
and they are departing to the next destination.

134
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,252
But I'm the one

135
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,372
without a ticket.

136
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,012
I can only be waiting in vain.

137
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,492
Back in the first time I saw Tian Sui,

138
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,691
it was as if I saw myself.

139
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,571
She seemed to be in dire straits.

140
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,892
All I can see from
her eyes is disheartenment.

141
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:23,252
I felt like I must help her.

142
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:27,851
I thought she would stay low-spirited.

143
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:30,971
But she didn't.

144
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,691
She tried her best
to pull herself together.

145
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:38,331
And began a completely new journey.

146
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:42,132
Tian Sui was the one who

147
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:44,971
held the ticket

148
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,451
and brought me onboard the train.

149
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,931
But then, I was the coward

150
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:57,731
who was afraid of
being a encumbrance to her.

151
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,132
And couldn't give
her the future she wanted.

152
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:04,292
So,

153
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:07,691
I decided to get off the train halfway.

154
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:14,091
Even if my luck is bad,

155
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:17,372
that the surgery will fail,

156
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,892
at least I'm not a encumbrance to her.

157
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,811
After your surgery is successful,

158
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,451
go and pursue Tian Sui.

159
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:41,492
You will be together
if you love each other.

160
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,132
Success once undergo a surgery,

161
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:52,172
is the plot only exists in fairy tales.

162
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:07,612
Jiang Tiancheng.

163
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,011
Tian Sui, you are always the best.

164
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:16,691
Always remember that

165
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,572
any kind of challenges can't defeat you.

166
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:22,892
You too.

167
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:25,052
Nothing can defeat you.

168
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:26,451
Take care.

169
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:28,852
We are all waiting for your safe return.

170
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,931
We agreed to fair competition.

171
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:34,971
I'll give you half a month to recover.

172
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:36,771
You can't go easy on me this time.

173
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:45,092
So you have to keep working hard.

174
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:47,211
For sure.

175
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:58,612
Waiting for you to come back.

176
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,011
Roger that.

177
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:13,892
While you are alone
tonight taking care of me,

178
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:16,451
there are some things
I need to talk to you about.

179
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:19,771
Before the surgery,
he kept reminding me that

180
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:23,612
you all are not his family members.

181
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:25,852
So you all don't have
to know about his surgery outcome.

182
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:29,132
But if you all ask me,

183
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:30,612
I would consider

184
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,052
the surgery is successful

185
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:34,612
if he survives on the surgery table.

186
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:47,572
That means the
surgery wasn't successful, right?

187
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:54,251
The shrapnel wasn't taken out.

188
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,251
Only the blood clots
in the brain were cleared.

189
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,011
It wouldn't be a big deal in two years.

190
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:02,211
But it could happen anytime

191
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,931
afterwards.

192
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:48,052
Why haven't you gone back to home?

193
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:51,451
I'm here to visit Tiancheng.

194
00:19:57,852 --> 00:19:58,612
Jinyan,

195
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,412
I can feel your sadness and self-blame.

196
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,612
Tiancheng was attacked by the grenade

197
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,172
to rescue me.

198
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:19,931
Be careful!

199
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,531
Shrapnel sticks at
somewhere near the cerebral artery.

200
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,332
It can't be taken out.

201
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,572
He may be in danger of
losing his life at any time,

202
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:40,612
so he can only choose
to retire from the army

203
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,652
and return to
Lancheng to run a barbecue stall.

204
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:48,092
He worried that I would be guilty.

205
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:53,332
So he always acted like
he as content with his current life.

206
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:58,172
And me,

207
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,531
actually believed what he said.

208
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:20,211
When he said that

209
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,971
his life remains
stationary after he was injured,

210
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:32,931
only then I realised

211
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:35,052
in fact, he had been going through

212
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:36,971
very hard time these two years.

213
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,572
He sacrificed his dream,
career and love relationship

214
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,652
because he rescued me.

215
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:52,931
I'm afraid that Tiancheng...

216
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:56,852
He wouldn't.

217
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:01,052
Tiancheng would take care of himself

218
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,291
for you.

219
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:37,691
Lu Jinyan, you need to understand

220
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:39,731
that she's just a substitute for me.

221
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:41,971
Everything she has is what I give to her.

222
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:44,771
A substitute?

223
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,052
Then what are you doing now?

224
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:53,291
You are all standing by her side.

225
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:55,531
Okay.

226
00:22:57,852 --> 00:22:59,931
I will make her
totally disappear from this world.

227
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:02,771
So you will know

228
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:05,132
whom the fans actually like.

229
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:37,531
Who?

230
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:54,092
Who is outside?

231
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:56,052
From now on,

232
00:23:57,251 --> 00:23:59,531
I wouldn't give you
a chance to pretend me.

233
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,172
I want you to live in
darkness for the rest of your life.

234
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:31,531
Xixi,

235
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:35,211
are you okay?

236
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:37,332
You look not well.

237
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:41,531
Can I look well

238
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:43,372
seeing you?

239
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:45,172
Okay.

240
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,211
Let's welcome our brand  for

241
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,132
OD perfume series, Ms. Xu Xixi

242
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:50,691
and our best companion of the brand,

243
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:52,291
Ms. Xu Mengyun to be on stage.

244
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:55,491
Coming.

245
00:24:56,132 --> 00:24:58,092
Ms. Xu.

246
00:24:58,092 --> 00:24:59,332
Ms. Xu, look at here.

247
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,731
Ms. Xu, please look at here.

248
00:25:02,491 --> 00:25:03,251
Ms. Xu.

249
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:06,132
You two are so beautiful.

250
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:10,172
Both of you are equally beautiful.

251
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:10,771
Of course.

252
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:14,931
Thanks.

253
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:15,931
Thanks.

254
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:18,812
Since Xixi and Mengyun

255
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,291
have collaborated
with us for so many times,

256
00:25:20,572 --> 00:25:21,531
I'm not going to
introduce them too much.

257
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:23,691
I'll leave the stage to them

258
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:24,971
and let them hold this event freely.

259
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:26,572
Say hi to everyone.

260
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:30,612
So suddenly?

261
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,931
What if we are not prepared

262
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,332
and embarrass ourselves?

263
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:38,491
Hi all, I'm Xu Xixi.

264
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:40,892
Let's begin our journey of

265
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:42,172
looking for the scent.

266
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:50,011
In order to cherish

267
00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:51,451
this important moment with you all,

268
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:55,572
Xixi and me have

269
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:58,451
prepared songs respectively

270
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:00,812
as a warm-up for this event.

271
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:05,852
I believe you all know that

272
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,771
Xixi gained a lot of
supporters and followers

273
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:10,771
since her debut stage performance.

274
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:12,812
And the birthday live show

275
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,132
broadcasted yesterday,

276
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:16,412
also proved Xixi's

277
00:26:16,412 --> 00:26:18,572
ability to sing to more people.

278
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:21,132
So everyone present here today

279
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:22,852
is in for a treat.

280
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:25,291
This is a live performance.

281
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:28,211
Great.

282
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:33,812
Why is she not singing?

283
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:36,011
Is her throat uncomfortable?

284
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:37,291
I feel like it is.

285
00:26:37,612 --> 00:26:38,291
So strange.

286
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,531
She should have informed that.

287
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:45,412
Are you Xu Xixi?

288
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:48,892
Or the substitute of the fake singer?

289
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:52,731
Where is she?

290
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,691
Did I missee?

291
00:26:56,892 --> 00:26:58,132
You saw her just now, right?

292
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:01,372
I'm not certain too

293
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,291
because it is dark now.

294
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:06,172
By the way,

295
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:09,132
for the OD brand launch event
two days later,

296
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,052
you two

297
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:13,132
will be there together, right?

298
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:17,211
Exactly.

299
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,372
Then,

300
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:24,052
let's verify Xixi's
singing on that occasion.

301
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:12,572
Sorry, guys.

302
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:15,132
Today our brand is more important,

303
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,572
I worry that if I sing a song later,

304
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:18,652
you all will forget

305
00:28:18,652 --> 00:28:20,011
the purpose of today's event.

306
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:22,892
Then I have to
quickly go over the event flow.

307
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:24,691
We can't let Xixi
be the focus of attention.

308
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,652
On display here are six ladies' perfumes

309
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,892
that embody the Italian style,

310
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:30,372
and six pure fragrances.

311
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:32,691
You two can freely try them out.

312
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,332
And pick your favourite variation

313
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:35,291
to share with us.

314
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:51,251
Get out.

315
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:52,132
Yes.

316
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:13,892
Xu Xixi.

317
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:15,931
How much longer
do you want to make trouble?

318
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:16,892
Open the door.

319
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:31,172
Xu Xixi.

320
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,332
Xu Xixi, are you okay?

321
00:30:56,132 --> 00:30:58,132
Ms. Xu.

322
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:01,572
Ms. Xu, come here.

323
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:20,451
Ms. Xu,

324
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:21,971
I will call a driver to
send you to hospital immediately.

325
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:23,491
No need.

326
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,172
I'm okay.

327
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,332
I dial a call to Mr. Xu then.

328
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:28,251
Don't tell my dad.

329
00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:30,372
Ms. Xu...

330
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:32,011
I want to stay alone for a while.

331
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:35,652
Go away.

332
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:38,052
Why did you rescue me?

333
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,291
I used to keep troubling you.

334
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,771
You must have hated me.

335
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:44,852
What about you?

336
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,251
Do you hate me so much that

337
00:32:50,372 --> 00:32:51,731
you desperately want me
to disappear from the world?

338
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:54,531
Xixi,

339
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,812
actually you have
thousand ways to confront me.

340
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:00,572
You can even tell your dad.

341
00:33:02,852 --> 00:33:04,052
But you didn't do any of that.

342
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:06,971
When you locked me in here today,

343
00:33:08,092 --> 00:33:10,251
you actually didn't
really intent to hurt me.

344
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:15,412
What you are doing now

345
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:17,491
is no difference from

346
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:19,011
a little girl whose
toys are snatched by someone else.

347
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:21,372
Don't overthink.

348
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,132
I don't tell my dad

349
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:26,491
because I don't want him to know

350
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,612
he actually
has a pair of twin daughters.

351
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:32,251
You've already snatched Lu Jinyan.

352
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:34,812
I wouldn't let you snatch my dad.

353
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:41,812
Then stop being wilful

354
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:43,251
and love yourself.

355
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,211
Do you think
I will not hate you any more

356
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:51,251
just because you say such things?

357
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,820
(Rest Room)

358
00:33:58,892 --> 00:34:01,652
Xixi, are you ready?

359
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,852
They are still waiting
for us for the interview session.

360
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:06,812
Waiting for you.

361
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:09,691
It seems that she knew our presence

362
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,652
and she made me to sing just now.

363
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,291
I'll go send her away

364
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:18,371
to prevent her from
causing any trouble again.

365
00:34:22,572 --> 00:34:23,371
I'll go.

366
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:24,972
You take rest.

367
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:49,492
Xixi,

368
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:52,652
actually, I have never hated you.

369
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:55,291
On the other hand,

370
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:57,851
I'm glad that I met you.

371
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:04,932
Let me in.

372
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:07,172
I'm Xu Xixi's bestie.

373
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,132
Xixi.

374
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,452
We are not besties.

375
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,452
Don't let her approach me.

376
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:25,652
And I will ask the
representatives from the brand

377
00:35:26,052 --> 00:35:27,932
to interview the brand
and the best companion of the brand

378
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,092
separately.

379
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,532
Xu Xixi...

380
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,211
Sorry.

381
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:44,251
Ms. Xu, are you okay?

382
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:00,492
How is it?

383
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,572
Could you smell the fragrance?

384
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,291
I purposely sprayed a lot of perfume

385
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,612
on her during my earlier activity.

386
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:15,132
If she was alone,

387
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:16,851
the fragrance must still last.

388
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,492
I didn't smell it.

389
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:24,291
That means there are two people.

390
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,771
See, I told you
Xu Xixi has a substitute.

391
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:36,452
Then, do you think
she is Xu Xixi's twin sister?

392
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:40,211
Or she underwent a plastic surgery?

393
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,731
Maybe neither.
