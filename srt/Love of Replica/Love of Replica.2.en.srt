1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,080
Cheng, this way.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Uncle Jiang, how is my dad?

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,039
He's safe,

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,199
but the accident was serious.

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,599
He's in a deep coma

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,199
and likely to become a human vegetable.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,359
There is something

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,640
I need to give you.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,359
This was found in your father's stomach.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,239
Based on the scratches on the esophagus,

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,039
it's likely that they were
taken before the accident.

12
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,840
(The walls of the secret room)

13
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,240
(are covered with photos
my father took.)

14
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,759
She is Xu Xixi, the daughter of Yongyu Capital.

15
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,879
I'm trying to figure out

16
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,479
what she had to do with
my dad's car accident.

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,599
I've followed her a few times,

18
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,479
but Xu Yongyu keeps her well-protected

19
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,840
so I basically have no
access to her at all.

20
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,840
Unless...

21
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,919
Do you mean

22
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,199
you want to approach
Xu Xixi as a bodyguard?

23
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
So I'll have to ask you

24
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,479
to delete all of Gu Cheng's information

25
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,560
and create a new identity for me

26
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,639
that has nothing to do with Gu Donglei

27
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,639
so that I can get into the Xu family.

28
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,040
Okay.

29
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,240
(Identity information file,

An Yue.

35
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,248
(Xu Xixi)
No wonder I can't find her.

36
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:31,767
(Xu Xixi)

37
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,288
(Xu Xixi)
She's a big star now

38
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,527
and changed her name to Xu Xixi.

39
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,390
(Work Contact: Tian Sui
Affiliated Company: Future Recreation)

40
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,007
Get me some red wine.

41
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:49,887
Okay.

42
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:54,527
Hello.

43
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:56,327
(Hello, is this Ms. Tian?)

44
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:57,608
My name is Ding Beifan.

45
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:00,887
I'm Xu Xixi's best friend.

46
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:02,288
(I can't reach her now.)

47
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:03,248
(Can you please pass the phone...)

48
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:04,488
Hello?

49
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:14,808
(The number you have dialled
is busy. Please try again later.)

50
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:27,327
Ms. Xu.

51
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,127
I've double-checked

52
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,527
the security system here.

53
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:32,447
The police are already investigating the one

54
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:34,687
who was behind yesterday's incident.

55
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:36,848
I can assure you that
it's very safe here.

56
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:38,527
So

57
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:42,048
could you ask these bodyguards

58
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,408
to leave for a while?

59
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:57,647
Xixi.

60
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:58,687
Your music video

61
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,608
will be personally directed
by Director He this time.

62
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,408
His temper and personality are notorious

63
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:03,327
in the industry.

64
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:05,728
If he sees you like this,

65
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:07,608
he'll probably just walk away.

66
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:17,447
Lu Jinyan.

67
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:21,288
I also think it's a bit of a hassle.

68
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,848
I only need you when I go out.

69
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,127
I'll have them follow in secret

70
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,007
so they don't interfere
with your daily work.

71
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:39,728
Let's go.

72
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,127
He's here. I'll receive him.

73
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:47,767
Okay.

74
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:53,808
Please give way.

75
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,647
Sorry.

76
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,048
I'm fine.

77
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:18,207
All right.

78
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:21,207
Then I'll try to make it quick

79
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:22,687
so you can finish early.

80
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:45,767
How well do I hold my liquor?

81
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,127
You're a bad drinker.

82
00:08:58,248 --> 00:08:58,887
Hello.

83
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:00,248
Pour me one glass.

84
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:01,127
Okay.

85
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:10,728
Please.

86
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:29,807
Give me another glass.

87
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:30,328
Okay.

88
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:43,688
More.

89
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,927
Director He. This way, please.

90
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,127
Director He, this is Xixi.

91
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:07,527
She has mentioned to me many times

92
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:08,527
that she would like to work with you.

93
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:09,767
So she...

94
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:19,248
What's wrong with her?

95
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:21,688
She's drunk.

96
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:25,007
Gosh. Why would she drink so much
when she's such a bad drinker?

97
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:26,448
Take her home now.

98
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:28,088
Send me a message when you get home.

99
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:34,968
Ms. Tian.

100
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:36,887
I'm very busy.

101
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:39,167
Director He, sorry about that.

102
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:40,968
Actually, she is very serious.

103
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:42,448
She's mentioned it to me many times.

104
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:43,807
She was very nervous

105
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:44,887
on the way here because

106
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:46,047
she admired you so much.

107
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,488
She tried her best to brace herself.

108
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:49,167
I didn't expect her to be so serious.

109
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:50,647
This way, please.

110
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,007
Miss, you are drunk.

111
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:29,167
Let me see your wound.

112
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:31,047
Please behave.

113
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:45,047
Lu Jinyan.

114
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,448
It really hurt me to see you

115
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,448
standing there in pain today.

116
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:06,368
Lu Jinyan.

117
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:10,647
I have a secret to tell you.

118
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:15,007
I seem to have a crush on you.

119
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,127
She is not Xu Xixi.

120
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,007
How do you know?

121
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:30,767
I felt something was wrong

122
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:31,848
since she woke up.

123
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,287
(She's friendly to her maids.)

124
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,527
(She's not a pushover at work.)

125
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:38,007
(She's positive)

126
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,927
(and she cares about the feelings
of everyone around her.)

127
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:44,728
(Although she is still confused
about her surroundings,)

128
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:46,767
(she does her best)

129
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:48,448
(not to let those around her down.)

130
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,167
(She can overcome all the hardships.)

131
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:54,448
(She's definitely not the unruly)

132
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,007
(and domineering Xu Xixi
she used to be.)

133
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:57,527
(She's basically a different person,)

134
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:58,807
(not someone with memory loss.)

135
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:01,167
(So is she still of use)

136
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:02,448
(to our investigation?)

137
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:05,088
(There are too many doubts now.)

138
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:10,688
(We still need to observe.)

139
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,167
(Friend Barbecue)
Boss, we're here.

140
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:29,568
(Friend Barbecue)

141
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:30,127
(Friend Barbecue)
Okay.

142
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,208
(Friend Barbecue)
Make yourself at home.

143
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,070
(Reserved)

144
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
(Tian Sui's exclusive)

145
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,420
(Prompt: Your friend Tian Sui
has met up with you)

146
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:23,728
I thought you'd be drinking
and socialising until midnight again.

147
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:26,807
It smells good.

148
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:31,208
How is it?

149
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,287
Tasty.

150
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:40,328
Jiang Tiancheng, I did it.

151
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:43,608
Congratulations.

152
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:46,927
Half of the credit goes to you.

153
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:48,208
I've survived this long

154
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,647
thanks to your great skills.

155
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,287
This is hangover soup,

156
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,767
not life pills.

157
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,167
You're here, aren't you?

158
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,328
By the way,

159
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:04,927
Xu Xixi's debut performance

160
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:06,248
was even more successful
than I expected.

161
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,568
I'm going to be very busy.

162
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,807
I won't be able to visit you very often.

163
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:13,608
It's okay.

164
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,007
Send me a text when you're free.

165
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,007
What would you like to eat?

166
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:20,407
I'll bring it to you.

167
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:22,688
Anytime?

168
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,208
I'm on call all the time.

169
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:32,407
Hello.

170
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:33,568
Hello, Ms. Tian.

you're her childhood friend?

but the entire Xingguang Fishing Village

00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:52,007
can attest to the fact

301
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:53,327
that An Yue and I,

302
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:56,208
or Xu Xixi, as you call her,

303
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:57,168
grew up together.

304
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:05,128
So what exactly is your
relationship with An Yue?

305

307
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:09,728
What does that mean?

308
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,488
Are you a sugar daddy?

309
00:24:15,728 --> 00:24:17,007

310
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:25,688

this must not be made public.

314
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,408

317

pass something to her.

318
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:12,488

319

She knows I'll be waiting
for her at the usual place.

320
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:22,047
Now that Director He has agreed to help,

321
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:23,567
you should try to

322
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,448
familiarise yourself with
the new album in the meantime.

to do a live food
broadcast with Xu Mengyun.

326

327
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:38,607

329
00:25:39,648 --> 00:25:41,488

00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:27,287
I'll call the doctor.

342
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,648
It's okay. I just have a toothache.

343
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:31,728
It's probably because of
the malt candy I ate this afternoon.

344
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:33,807
Why did you sneak candy again?

345
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:35,408
The last time you had
your wisdom teeth removed,

346
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:37,007
the dentist specifically told you

347
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:38,928
to avoid eating candy in the future.

348
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:44,807
Did you say I had my
wisdom teeth removed?

349
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:46,007
Yes.

350
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:48,888
Which side?

351
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:51,448
You have all your wisdom teeth removed.

352
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:56,688
I see.

353
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,367
Luckily it's not wisdom teeth.

354
00:28:00,728 --> 00:28:03,408
It's probably just because of the malt candy.

355
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:05,527
Get some rest.

356
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:07,607
Okay, miss.

357
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,090
(After wisdom teeth grow,
will they grow again?)

358
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,518
(Once wisdom teeth have grown,
they will not grow again.)

359
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:21,310
(Because human permanent teeth are
non-regenerative and irreplaceable.)

360
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,000
(Old Town Dental Clinic)

361
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:04,047
Take care.

362
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:04,888
Thank you.

363
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:18,888
Let's go. I'll take you home.

364
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:38,488
Lu Jinyan.

365
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:40,968
Aren't you curious why I'm here?

366
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,488
I don't need to know.

367
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:45,367
I am only responsible for Ms. Xu safety.

368
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:50,968
What if I'm not?

369
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:54,728
Now you are.

370
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:09,488
Childhood friends?

371
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:11,688
What do you mean?

372
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:15,767
You used to be a couple.

373
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:18,007
After she became a star,

374
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:19,208
she dumped you.

375
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,327
Do you hate her?

376
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:22,367
Or

377
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,648
do you want her back
in the little fishing village?

378
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:26,847
I can help you.

379
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,527
We have two guests here today

380
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:38,128
who are experts in the kitchen.

381
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:41,168
Xixi's seafood handling skills

382
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:42,688
are truly professional.

383
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:46,287
Is it because you like seafood

384
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:48,007
that you've developed
such an interest in it?

385
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:49,527
Yes.

386
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:51,007
I like to eat seafood.

387
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,408
I'm sure you don't just like to eat,

388
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,168
but based on your skills,

389
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,327
it looks like you learned for someone.

390
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,287
Please don't get me wrong.

391
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:12,527
I was referring to a friend.

392
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:18,208
How come I didn't know

393
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:21,168
I had such a friend?

394
00:32:23,128 --> 00:32:24,367
Coincidentally,

395
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,248
this old friend of Xixi's

396
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:30,208
happens to be a new friend of mine

397
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:32,408
and we both met

398
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,968
over a can of seafood.

399
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:35,287
I can

400
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:36,327
think of no one better

401
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:37,928
suited to our topic today than him.

402
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:17,448
Old friend, long time no see.

403
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:22,567
Xixi.

404
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,567
I know I'm probably going to get

405
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,567
completely shut off
from you for doing this,

406
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:31,087
but I can't agree with you

407
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:33,488
as someone who knows you.

408
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:34,847
You cast away your childhood friend

409
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,728
for the sake of popularity

410
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,847
and lied about being
the daughter of a wealthy family.

411
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:41,807
Xixi.

412
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,488
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

413
00:33:44,527 --> 00:33:45,847
He's already here.

414
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,168
How can you deny it?

415
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:50,607
Xixi.

416
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,208
I know you don't want
to disclose who I am

417
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:55,087
for fear of being ridiculed, right?

418
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,248
However, your kindness

419
00:34:12,327 --> 00:34:13,807
should be known to all.

420
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,168
Pleasure working with you.

421
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:26,487
Okay.

422
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:44,728
Are you sure you want to

423
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:46,608
mess with An Yue with
that intelligence of yours?

424
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:48,648
You'll make a fool of yourself.

425
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,520
(Tian Sui)

426
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:03,208
Name your conditions.

427
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:05,528
I don't need any conditions

428
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:06,568
to protect my sister.

429
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:10,287
You, on the other hand,

430
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,287
you don't know my relationship with her,

431
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:14,767
yet you want to help me.

432
00:35:15,728 --> 00:35:16,728
I don't care about that.

433
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:18,128
I just know that

434
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,407
my artist's image

435
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:21,168
can't be ruined by Xu Mengyun.

436
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,168
I was right about you.

437
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,208
You won't hurt her.

438
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:29,208
You'll just strike back
more effectively.

439
00:35:32,407 --> 00:35:33,208
Actually,

440
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,088
I am an orphan,

441
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,327
abandoned by my parents
since I was a child.

442
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:39,728
I couldn't even afford to go to school,

443
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:43,487
but luckily I met Xixi.

444
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:46,487
Although she's the daughter
of Yongyu Capital,

445
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:48,407
she treats me like her own brother.

446
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:51,728
For more than ten years,

447
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,887
she used her pocket money
to pay for my education

448
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:56,088
and encouraged me to improve.

449
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,940
(20,000 RMB)

450
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:07,887
You guys ganged up on me.

451
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:10,287
Today,

452
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:11,407
I would like to tell Xixi this.

453
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:13,728
Xixi.

454
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:16,528
Thank you.

455
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:27,767
Whoever you are now,

456
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:29,528
all I know is that
you are my sister.

457
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:30,847
An Yue.

458
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,640
(Friend Barbecue)

459
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:51,688
The results of the hair test
you gave me are out.

460
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:06,648
Although the genetic test
did not show Xu Xixi,

461
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:09,008
(Probability of twins: 99.9999%)
she is closely related to her.

462
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,770

463
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,048
(Probability of twins: 99.9999%)
Based on the analysis of

464
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:12,327
different results for the 15 loci,

465
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:14,447
the probability of this
biological relationship

466
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:15,287
being established is

467
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:17,367
99.9999%.

468
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,450
(Probability of twins: 99.9999%)

469
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:22,927
(Probability of twins: 99.9999%)
Twins.

470
00:38:31,688 --> 00:38:33,008
(In the year I've been
with the Xu family,)

471
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:34,327
(I've never heard)

472
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:35,767
(that Xu Yongyu has another daughter.)

473
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:39,927
(Why did she suddenly appear)

474

(as Xu Xixi?)

475
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,528
(It turns out my dad
wasn't tracking one person,)
