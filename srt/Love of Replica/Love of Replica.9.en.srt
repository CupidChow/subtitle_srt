(A year ago)

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,320
(Medical Report)
A few more of these tests

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,679
would be too much for
even the healthy to handle.

4
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,959
Come here.

5
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:42,959
Come on.

6
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,519
Here.

7
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,760
I have had a patient

8
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,599
with the same disease before.

9
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,599
I thought I could cure her

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,520
and put her through all sorts
of tests and treatments.

11
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,400
She suffered more

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,919
during that time than you do now.

13
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,599
Who are you?

14
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,919
Is all that talk

15
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,000
going to cure me?

16
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
I can't cure you,

17
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
but I can help you find freedom.

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,759
If you want to avoid this painful

19
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,800
and useless treatment,

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
you can come and see me.

=Episode 9=

23
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,831
Are you sure this is where

24
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:33,591
Xu Xixi is located?

25
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:37,752
It's almost an isolated place.

26
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:42,071
I lived on a fishing boat
all my childhood.

27
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:44,312
Whenever the boat went to a place,

28
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:45,752
my mother would tell me

29
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,432
a story from a book on the shelf

30
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,552
with the corresponding coordinates

31
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:51,471
based on the location of the place.

32
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:53,511
Page number indicates east longitude

33
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:54,391
and row number indicates north latitude.

34
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,872
The juniper tree she
mentioned to me once

35
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,271
was the story in the picture book.

36
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:04,831
So I guess the longitude and
latitude of the picture book

37
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,389
is where Xu Xixi is.

38
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,630
(Friend Barbecue)

39
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:13,951
Jiang Tiancheng.

(Jiang Tiancheng)

41
00:05:57,071 --> 00:05:57,992
Just in case,

42
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,432
I've told Tian Sui what happened.

43
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,672
We can use the villa she arranged

44
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:03,711
to stall Xu Yongyu

45
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,312
and buy us time to find Xu Xixi.

46
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:08,552
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

47
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:17,432
Go and explain.

48
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:20,831
Tian Sui.

49
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:25,432
Tian Sui.

50
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:29,672
Tian Sui.

51
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:40,112
Have you known Lu Jinyan
for a long time?

52
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:42,752
Yes.

53
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:45,232
He was my work buddy

54
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:48,271
before I opened the barbecue stall.

55
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:50,432
Did you

56
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:52,631
help him join

57
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,591
Xu Xixi's bodyguard?

58
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:57,552
Yes,

59
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,031
but I assure you,

60
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:03,071
I have never used you.

61
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:05,391
I believe that.

62
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,831
So

63
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,391
is there anything else
you are hiding from me?

64
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:29,511
In fact, I always knew

65
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,112
that even if you reluctantly agreed
to share the location with me,

66
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:36,151
there was still a part of you

67
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:39,312
that couldn't completely open up to me.

68
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:43,192
From the time we've known each other,

69
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,752
you've always been

70
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:49,951
as gentle, decent

71
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:52,471
and gentlemanly as you are now.

72
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:55,992
You've never lost your temper.

73
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:58,271
As for me,

74
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:03,031
I am becoming less and less

75
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:06,151
of who I am in front of you.

76
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:10,271
But you know what?

77
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:13,271
All this is because

78
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:15,872
I like you.

79
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:27,672
Jiang Tiancheng.

80
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,152
Do you like me?

81
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:48,591
Sorry.

82
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:04,951
I should thank you

83
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:07,751
for leaving me enough decency

84
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,272
even to reject me.

85
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:42,672
Ms. Tian.

86
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:43,951
There is a make-up line

87
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,951
that wants Xixi to endorse it.

88
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:46,512
Ask if it contains perfume.

89
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:47,912
We have an exclusivity clause

90
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:48,711
in our contract with OD.

91
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:49,231
Okay.

92
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:49,792
By the way, Amy,

93
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:52,111
OD will hold a new
product launch next month.

94
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:53,591
Confirm Xixi's schedule in advance.

95
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:54,152
Okay.

96
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,111
Go ahead.

97
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,111
What's wrong?

98
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:02,432
(Are you okay?)

99
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,432
I'm fine.

100
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,991
I was just rejected
by Jiang Tiancheng.

101
00:10:07,632 --> 00:10:08,792
(No big deal.)

102
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:11,192
(I also have more important
things to accomplish.)

103
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:13,032
By the way,

104
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:14,231
I've already arranged

105
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,312
the hotel villa for you.

106
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:16,672
You can go there anytime.

107
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:19,392
Thank you, Tian Sui.

108
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,751
No problem.

109
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:21,951
I have a meeting to attend.

110
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:22,871
I'll talk to you later.

111
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,272
With Tian Sui's help,

112
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:49,351
the villa will be more secure.

113
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,951
We just need to follow
the coordinates and find Xu Xixi.

114
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:05,672
Before we go to the villa,

115
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:07,751
let's go back to the fishing village.

116
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:10,912
Go and say goodbye to your mother.

117
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:44,552
Mom.

118
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:46,751
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:50,991
I only came to see you now.

120
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:36,912
Don't worry.

121
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:40,871
I will be fine.

122
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:00,951
It's strange.

123
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,951
It just feels like

124
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:09,552
she's always by my side,

125
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,351
never leaving.

126
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:24,831
Don't worry about me.

127
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:29,751
The most important thing now

128
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:31,751
is to find Xu Xixi.

129
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:33,032
Yes.

130
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,231
Ms. Tian, let's go back.

131
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,471
I work overtime tonight.

132
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:05,192
Ms. Tian.

133
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,432
Are you in a bad mood?

134
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:07,672
Go home early and take some rest.

135
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:09,871
Don't waste the company's resources.

136
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:10,831
Okay?

137
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,231
Ding Beifan, you're so annoying.

138
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:16,392
Can you mind your own business?

139
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:28,231
No.

140
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,711
Do you know you're
really annoying like that?

141
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,071
I'm not afraid of being hated by you.

142
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,951
I just don't want to see you cry.

143
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:51,432
What are you doing?

144
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:54,951
Where are we going? Hey.

145
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,460
(Starlight convenience store)

146
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,792
Have some. Fill your stomach
before you drink.

147
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,032
What's the point of drinking beer?

148
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:27,871
If you want to get drunk,

149
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:29,392
then go big.

150
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:33,632
This one is called Titanic.

151
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:36,351
We'll take turns filling the cap.

152
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:38,711
If your cap flips over,

153
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:40,632
you'll drink the whole glass.

154
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:41,711
Do you dare?

155
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:42,552
Bring it on.

156
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:43,912
Okay.

157
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:44,991
Let me demonstrate it for you.

158
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:51,071
See?

159
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:52,432
This is called professionalism.

160
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:55,351
People of the sea will
never flip their boats.

161
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:06,871
You tricked me with fake alcohol.

162
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,991
I didn't want you to feel
worse if you were drunk.

163
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,512
So I used grape juice instead.

164
00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:21,272
I don't feel worse,

165
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,552
but rather relaxed.

166
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:26,552
Strange, isn't it?

167
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:35,792
Actually,

168
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,032
I knew I'd end up like this

169
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:42,951
with him.

170
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:45,912
I've been

171
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:49,152
too tense all these years.

172
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,432
I'm always careful,

173
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,272
both at work

174
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:00,272
(and in my relationships,)

175
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:04,632
(for fear that I'm not perfect.)

176
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:08,511
(Sometimes)

177
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,832
(when I'm feeling exhausted,)

178
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:14,352
(I wonder)

179
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,511
(if I had waited)

180
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,311
and waited,

181
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:25,311
maybe

182
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:28,152
he would have come to me.

183
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,432
He's quite fond of you.

184
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,072
I know.

185
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:51,592
I'm not stupid.

186
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:01,912
We...

187
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:06,832
We are too much alike.

188
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:10,832
We both have many concerns.

189
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:14,432
We want to show our best side

190
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,511
to each other.

191
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:21,872
I have a big temper

192
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:24,912
and I'm selfish when
it comes to relationships.

193
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:26,112
I'm also very careful.

194
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:29,751
It wasn't only him
who was hiding something.

195
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:34,991
I wasn't entirely
honest with him either.

196
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:39,832
Do you think

197
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:42,471
such a relationship

198
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:45,632
can last?

199
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:55,231
Actually,

200
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,392
you are

201
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:57,791
indeed a bad-tempered person.

202
00:18:59,031 --> 00:18:59,951
That's not nice.

203
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:02,711
Like the fake alcohol thing,

204
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,072
did you feel like

205
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:06,352
throwing me into the sea?

206
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:08,711
You had that in mind,

207
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:09,672
didn't you?

208
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:16,432
How about this?

209
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:17,751
Let's get real.

210
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:27,192
Wait.

211
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:28,271
Let me tell you the rules.

212
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,551
The rule is that

213
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:42,791
you have to finish the drink,

214
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,072
and get flicked in the forehead.

215
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:45,791
Sure.

216
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:48,152
Okay.

217
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,432
I'll go first.

218
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:58,192
What is this called?

219
00:19:58,192 --> 00:19:59,872
Life hanging by a thread.

220
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:01,991
Let me see.

221
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:03,592
I have to focus.

222
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:09,832
Perfect.

223
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,311
Drink it.

224
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:13,352
Admit defeat.

225
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:18,592
Okay.

226
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,951
The next session.

227
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:24,832
Come on.

228
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:30,352
Are you being serious?

229
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:31,951
As you said, admit defeat.

230
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:33,832
Is it red?

231
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:35,231
No.

232
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:36,832
Come on.

233
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:37,912
Again. I'll go first this time.

234
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:38,872
Okay.

235
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:47,231
Drink.

236
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:20,551
Why are you here?

237
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:21,832
Where is Tian Sui?

238
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:23,672
You leave her alone...

239
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,031
You are really funny.

240
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:27,711
You obviously like her
and care about her.

241
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:29,751
Why did you reject her?

242
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:39,511
Jiang Tiancheng.

243
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:41,231
I don't care what your reason is,

244
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:43,231
but you have to give
Tian Sui an explanation.

245
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:46,632
I don't want to wait
until we're together

246
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:48,352
for you to change your mind.

247
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:51,471
I'll explain when I get a chance.

248
00:22:59,271 --> 00:22:59,791
Hello.

249
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,551
(Where have you been?)

250
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:02,152
(I looked all over the village for you)

251
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:02,832
(but couldn't find you.)

252
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,872
I'm with Jiang Tiancheng.

253
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:10,872
Okay.

254
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:12,991
I just wanted to let you know

255
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:15,672
(that I'm going to cover for
An Yue for the next two days.)

256
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:16,751
(You take some days off.)

257
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:17,672
(No need to go to the office.)

258
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,271
(It's about what
Lu Jinyan said last night.)

259
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:20,912
(About dealing with
Xu Xixi's examination.)

260
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:22,592
How can I take time off?

261
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:23,471
Send me the address.

262
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:25,072
(What are you trying to do?)

263
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:26,672
Jiang Tiancheng and I will help you.

264
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:27,711
I mean,

265
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:29,872
we'll help An Yue and Lu Jinyan.

266
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:31,031
(No need.)

267
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:32,632
(I can go alone.)

268
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,672
More people would attract suspicion.

269
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:36,231
(Xu Yongyu is difficult to deal with.)

270
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,912
At least the three of us

271
00:23:38,912 --> 00:23:39,672
can work out a plan together.

272
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:41,072
That's it then.

273
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:48,711
Let's go.

274
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:49,912
Now is the chance.

275
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:05,072
Why did you two come along?

276
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:09,551
Seriously?

277
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,152
Do you even think of us as family?

278
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:13,271
This is a big deal.

279
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:14,791
Of course we have to come.

280
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:19,672
Everyone, Dr. Zheng will arrive

281
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:21,072
at the airport tomorrow at 6:10 p.m.

282
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,632
Xu Yongyu will arrive
at the villa after 6 p.m.

283
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:25,751
and will take Xu Xixi

284
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:27,711
to the hospital for a check-up.

285
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:29,471
So An Yue...

286
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:32,192
An Yue and I

287
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:33,711
have to leave immediately
to find Xu Xixi.

288
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:34,872
We may

289
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:37,112
need the three of you

290
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:38,632
to cover up for us at the villa.

291
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,072
If we don't make it back in time,

292
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:42,791
you must find a way

293
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:44,711
to hold off Xu Yongyu.

294
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:57,432
Did your mother always tell you

295
00:24:57,432 --> 00:24:59,031
such horrible stories
when you were young?

296
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:02,592
Not really,

297
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:05,672
but I do remember one time

298
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:07,711
when I was so freaked out.

299
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:10,271
Fortunately, there was...

300
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:12,991
(This is for you.)

301
00:25:14,072 --> 00:25:17,912
If you hear the sound of
the sea breeze in the conch,

302
00:25:18,832 --> 00:25:21,832
it means I'm thinking of you.

303
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:26,751
So come find me when you do.

304
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:29,951
(Okay.)

305
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:31,551
(I'll come to you soon.)

306
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:36,271
What was it?

307
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:39,271
Nothing.

308
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:42,912
I have a concern.

309
00:25:43,872 --> 00:25:45,551
What if we find Xu Xixi

310
00:25:45,832 --> 00:25:47,192
and she doesn't want
to go back with us?

311
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:48,672
There will be a way.

312
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:50,231
Okay.

313
00:26:52,751 --> 00:26:54,152
I can't afford to
pay for it if it breaks.

314
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:55,511
I'll go and dry it.

315
00:26:57,231 --> 00:26:57,951
I'll go now.

316
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:11,432
Sorry.

317
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:20,592
Is this apology

318
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:23,791
for what happened to Lu Jinyan before

319
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:25,471
or

320
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,832
for rejecting me?

321
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:33,872
If it's because of what happened before,

322
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:34,951
I accept your apology,

323
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:37,152
but if it's because of the latter,

324
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:38,791
there's absolutely no need.

325
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:50,751
Jiang Tiancheng.

326
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,152
I'm always glad

327
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:57,912
it was your barbecue stall that I passed

328
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,031
on the night I was at my worst.

329
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:15,951
What's the rush?

330
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:17,112
I got it. I'm coming.

331
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:18,511
I'm sorry.

332
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,311
(Renowned manager, Tian Sui's)

333
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:34,592
(financial corruption was exposed)

334
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:37,392
(after years of abuse and
exploitation of artist, Xu Mengyun.)

335
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,140
(Renowned manager, Tian Sui's
financial corruption was exposed)

336
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,140
(after years of abuse and
exploitation of artist, Xu Mengyun.)

337
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:20,832
New friend.

338
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,432
Come in and have a drink.

339
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,632
You gave me all the warmth and decency.

340
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,112
So whatever happens,

341
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:35,791
we will always be friends.

342
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:57,991
Yes.

343
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:01,951
Best friend forever.

344
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:05,751
But be honest.

345
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,271
Are there any other secrets

346
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:08,432
you're hiding from me?

347
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:11,912
Yes.

348
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:16,511
Actually, I...

349
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:18,832
There should be secrets

350
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:20,951
and personal space between friends.

351
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:33,991
This is an expensive speaker.

352
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:34,951
It's good.

353
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:36,392
It's waterproof

354
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,872
and the sound quality is very good.

355
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:39,031
I just tried it.

356
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:40,311
It's exactly the same
as listening to a live track.

357
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:42,632
When I'm rich,

358
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,511
I'll have to buy one

359
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:45,031
and listen to An Yue's songs every day.

360
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:16,791
What's wrong?

361
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:18,951
What comes to your mind?

362
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:22,072
An older brother.

363
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:25,711
The only person who was
there for me when I was a child.

364
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:28,791
The one you were
talking about in the car.

365
00:31:30,031 --> 00:31:30,872
Luckily you met him.

366
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:35,031
I spent my childhood

367
00:31:35,672 --> 00:31:37,192
on a fishing boat

368
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:39,432
with no friends

369
00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:43,311
and had no idea what
the outside world looked like

370
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,271
until I met him here.

371
00:31:49,072 --> 00:31:50,311
He showed me the world

372
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,511
in his way.

373
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,192
It was also the first time I knew

374
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:58,392
that the world outside was so beautiful.

375
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:00,072
From then on,

376
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,951
I would wait here for him.

377
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:07,632
It's nothing to hold on to.

378
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:09,912
Isn't it just something

379
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:11,271
that a phone can settle?

380
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,672
He's not as vulgar as you think.

381
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,711
Then did this refined man

382
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:18,551
ever come to you?

383
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:22,991
Or is he right here?

384
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:24,551
Are you going to
catch up with him later?

385
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:41,192
Little kid.

386
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,471
Why are you here alone?

387
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,072
I am waiting for my mother.

388
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:49,951
Where are you going next?

389
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:51,112
Brother.

390
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,951
Can you sit with me for a while?

391
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,951
I just heard a scary story.

392
00:32:56,231 --> 00:32:57,551
I am a little scared.

393
00:32:58,872 --> 00:32:59,551
All right.

394
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:23,872
Drink it.

395
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,751
It's nice.

396
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:37,271
Have you never had a Coke before?

397
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:40,592
This is my first time
getting off a boat.

398
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:42,912
Is your mother a sailor?

399
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,072
Then you're lucky

400
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:47,072
to be able to sail around
the world on a boat

401
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:49,632
and see the Sydney Opera House
and the Tower of London.

402
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:51,471
Not really.

403
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:55,072
All I can see is the sea.

404
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:57,711
You're also the first person

405
00:33:57,872 --> 00:33:59,632
besides my mother to talk to me.

406
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,152
Let's go.

407
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,831
I'll take you around the world now.

408
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:28,391
Come on.

409
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:48,152
This is the Sydney Opera House.

410
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:49,751
There are many great artists

411
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,911
who perform here, doing opera.

412
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:56,072
Then I'll be singing here too.

to the Sydney Opera House.

421
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,391

434
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,391
My father told me

435
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,391
he was going to find a friend

That person would be your mother.

438
00:36:43,032 --> 00:36:44,992
Then they went out to talk
because they were worried

439
00:36:45,112 --> 00:36:45,992
about what I had seen.
