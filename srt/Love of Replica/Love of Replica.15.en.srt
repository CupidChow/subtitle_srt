1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,480
Yueyue,

2
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,480
how does the new home feel?

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,679
As you've just reached your home.

4
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,559
It feels good.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,239
I like the place.

6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,440
It's your home now.

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:26,839
Feel free.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,320
And feel free to talk with daddy.

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,479
The family has never felt
so joyful before.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
I have to leave for work.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,359
I have to go to the study.

12
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,200
I'll be right back.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,280
(Left hand inputting)

14
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,320
Dad.

15
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,519
Are you taking work as an excuse

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,719
because you don't like to see me?

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,000
Silly girl.

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,799
I'm always happiest

19
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,280
when I see you.

20
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,959
Is there any work
more important than you?

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,159
Okay, let's leave work aside today.

22
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,319
What would you like to do?
I'll be here for you.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,159
I want to eat the food you cook.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
For sure.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,439
Let's go in now then.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,359
And I'll make delicious food for you.

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,120
Let's go.

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,759
Done.

29
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,540
=Love of Replica=

30
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,920
=Episode 15=

31
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:05,564
The desserts in kitchen
are still enough, right?

32
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:06,524
Yes.

33
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:08,763
Don't you think

34
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,643
ever since An Yue returns,

35
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:12,883
Mr. Xu's temper has become much gentle?

36
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:14,164
Unlike before,

37
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,404
he always gave me goosebumps.

38
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:18,164
Don't talk nonsense.

39
00:03:18,444 --> 00:03:20,083
Mr. Xu always treats us well.

40
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:21,964
He was emotionally unstable

41
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:23,124
because of An Yue's sickness.

42
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:25,284
Since An Yue is healthy now,

43
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:26,244
of course he is happy.

44
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:29,244
Mr. Xu is quite pity too.

45
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:31,043
Luckily, he has another daughter.

46
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:41,004
True.

47
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,124
It's his luck.

48
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,004
Thanks, director.

49
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:54,363
The effect of today's live show

50
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:55,363
is even better than I imagined.

51
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,244
The audience envies An Yue and Xixi

52
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:59,803
for having such a good dad like Mr. Xu.

53
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,244
You know what,

54
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:03,643
it's too happy

55
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,043
to have two of them as my daughters.

56
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,323
You work hardest

57
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:09,284
from morning till night this day.

58
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:11,043
I've arranged buffet

59
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:12,083
in the hotel you're living.

60
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,083
When you all get back later,

61
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:15,083
eat quickly so that you can rest early.

62
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:16,443
Thanks, Mr. Xu.

63
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,884
Dad, I want to go up to see Xixi.

64
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:19,683
Go ahead.

65
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,123
These two girls

66
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:26,603
have a really good relationship.

67
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:29,284
Will it be too rush
if I go up to see her now?

68
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:31,003
No worries.

69
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:32,844
They still need ten minutes

70
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:34,003
to tidy up the site.

71
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:36,243
From now on, all of these are safe.

72
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,043
Yes.

73
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:42,443
How do you think?

74
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,003
Is the hotel comfortable?

75
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:45,084
Not bad.

76
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:04,123
Why are you coming?

77
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:08,884
I'm here to thank you.

78
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:11,204
Thanks for saving me last time.

79
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:13,644
And,

80
00:05:15,003 --> 00:05:17,324
when the colleague
was broadcasting the interview,

81
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:20,324
I'm sorry that I stepped in suddenly.

82
00:05:24,764 --> 00:05:26,003
It wasn't a big deal.

83
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:28,884
It's a good thing that

84
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:31,524
father and daughter
recognise each other.

85
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:35,844
But to be honest,

86
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:39,803
whenever I see you being

87
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:41,964
so close with my dad,

88
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:47,084
it's inevitable to feel sad.

89
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:50,764
But after considering that,

90
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:54,884
it's not a bad thing either.

91
00:05:56,164 --> 00:05:57,043
Xixi,

92
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:58,284
it's not like what you think.

93
00:05:58,764 --> 00:05:59,443
He and I...

94
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:02,964
It's not like what you think anyway.

95
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,524
In your father's mind,

96
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,404
you are his most beloved daughter.

97
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:24,084
An Yue,

98
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:26,724
I'm not being sarcastic.

99
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:32,123
To be honest,

100
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:34,964
I hate him a lot of time.

101
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,563
He keeps me locked up
in this house

102
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:42,803
to undergo examinations day after day.

103
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:48,603
When I see those nervous doctors

104
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,363
and those cold instruments,

105
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:56,803
I feel both scared and angry.

106
00:06:58,524 --> 00:06:59,884
But apart from losing my temper,

107
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,803
I really don't know what else to do

108
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:04,164
for all these to be over.

109
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,603
He often tells me that.

110
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:11,204
Xixi,

111
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:13,803
everything will be fine.

112
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:15,724
And you will be all right.

113
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:18,164
You will not

114
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,404
feel any pain soon.

115
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:30,204
But you see,

116
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:32,964
I'm actually dying.

117
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:40,003
You don't have to tell me nonsense like

118
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:40,964
never give up

119
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:43,084
or everything will be fine.

120
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:44,764
You are not me.

121
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,123
You can never feel me.

122
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:50,443
Actually,

123
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:52,884
I'm not afraid of death at all.

124
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:55,003
Oppositely,

125
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,844
it's kind of relief for me.

126
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:02,443
But,

127
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,084
when I saw my dad

128
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:11,123
grey hair growing on his head that day,

129
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:15,043
I couldn't help but think that

130
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,443
if I were gone,

131
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:21,003
he must be hurt very painfully.

132
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:23,683
After all,

133
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,363
he has put too much effort into me.

134
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:28,844
You are healthier,

135
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:30,563
more cheerful,

136
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,244
and more likeable than me.

137
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,803
And I've even imagined
how great would it be

138
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:39,843
if...

139
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:41,364
If I were you.

140
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:47,683
Xixi,

141
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:51,004
actually I hope a lot of time that

142
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:53,443
it would be great

143
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:54,764
if I had a dad

144
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,644
who loves me
as much as your dad loves you.

145
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,323
In that case,

146
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,803
I could live more recklessly

147
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:04,244
and indulge myself more.

148
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:14,524
If you really think so,

149
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,563
I'll feel more at ease.

150
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:26,484
An Yue,

151
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:31,404
actually I'm glad that I met you.

152
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:33,244
Sometimes I even feel that

153
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,124
it's also good to have you.

154
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:38,043
So you can be my dad's side

155
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:41,644
when I'm gone.

156
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:42,723
It's impossible.

157
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:44,443
I wouldn't accompany him on your behalf.

158
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:48,443
Xixi,

159
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,923
because of you,

160
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:52,404
there is me.

161
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:58,364
In your dad's mind,

162
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:01,323
no matter how healthy I am,

163
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,683
I could never replace you.

164
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:21,803
Anyway,

165
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,524
I just hope that you are doing well.

166
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,244
You told them you are fine.

167
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:42,604
And you think you are really fine?

168
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,364
The outcome wasn't bad, actually.

169
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:48,484
Just that

170
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,563
I have to trouble you in the future

171
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,803
to take care for me for a lifetime.

172
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:55,364
Okay.

173
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:08,323
Jinyan.

174
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,124
Don't spoil my mood, okay?

175
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:11,484
I've just been through a breakup

176
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:12,723
and I need to have some drinks.

177
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:15,083
Am I not making an exception
for drinking on your behalf?

178
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:17,764
If you want to drink in the future,

179
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:19,803
at least you inform me earlier.

180
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:24,683
I'll eat this.

181
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:31,524
You really don't want to tell her?

182
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:43,323
Like what I have agreed with Ding Beifan,

183
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:47,004
at least we are competing fairly.

184
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,284
Losing is just losing.

185
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:52,923
Besides being slightly embarrassed,

186
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:55,884
it's actually nothing.

187
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:01,443
True.

188
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:04,563
If she knows that

189
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,244
and rejects you,

190
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,524
you are super embarrassed then.

191
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,923
Don't talk if you don't know the art of speech.

192
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:30,323
Tiancheng.

193
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:31,323
Yes?

194
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:36,884
Try your best to live longer.

195
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:43,083
This time,

196
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,923
you'll treat it
as you are doing this for me.

197
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:57,124
Understood.

198
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:13,083
Mr. Xu.

199
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:15,004
Has Lu Jinyan entered the study room?

200
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:16,083
Yes.

201
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:20,604
Inform the medical team

202
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:21,764
to launch the surgery tomorrow.

203
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:22,923
All right.

204
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:27,764
Xixi.

205
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:31,043
Xixi.

206
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:32,524
Xixi.

207
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:34,443
Xixi, are you okay?

208
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,923
I said that

209
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:37,963
I don't want a surgery.

210
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:39,124
Don't be reckless, Xixi.

211
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:40,843
You must undergo the surgery.

212
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,443
It can't be delayed any more,
for your current physical condition.

213
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:45,244
I'll bring you there later.

214
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,963
Dr. Zheng has already...

215
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:48,644
Ms. Xu.

216
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:49,563
Xixi.

217
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:50,043
Ms. Xu.

218
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:50,683
Are you all right?

219
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:51,884
Wake up, Xixi.

220
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:52,723
Don't scare me.

221
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:53,644
What's wrong with you?

222
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:54,923
Call the ambulance.

223
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:55,563
Right now!

224
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,803
Xixi.

225
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,963
The lift is using
palm vein recognition system.

226
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:17,563
From the palm vein distribution diagram,

227
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,963
pictures of the veins of

228
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:20,764
fingers, palmer side and dorsal
side of the palms can be retrieved.

229
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:22,124
And they must be
the palms of living humans.

230
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:23,484
We can't retrieve
the traits of vein diagram

231
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:25,244
from non-living palms.

232
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660
(Comparing palm prints)

233
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,923
There should be where Dr. Zheng

234
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,004
last stayed.

235
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:24,524
Go in and see.

236
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:55,164
Xixi.

237
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,404
Xixi.

238
00:16:58,923 --> 00:16:59,683
You're up.

239
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:01,764
Everything is fine.

240
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:04,884
It's all right now.

241
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:10,124
Xixi.

242
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:12,604
Xixi, are you okay?

243
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:14,164
Xixi.

244
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:15,763
Xixi, don't move.

245
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:16,443
Take these away.

246
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:18,483
- You shouldn't move, Xixi.
- Stop her.

247
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:19,203
Don't move.

248
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:20,124
I don't want the examination.

249
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,644
Nor the surgery.

250
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:22,683
You are not supposed to move, Xixi.

251
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:24,963
Hang in there a bit more.

252
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:28,243
Dad, let me meet my maker.

253
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:28,804
Xixi.

254
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:29,923
Let me meet my maker.

255
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,324
I don't want to live any more.

256
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:32,283
What nonsense are you talking about?

257
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:35,483
Xixi, just bear it a little longer.

258
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:36,884
Just a little longer.

259
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:38,283
Daddy assures that

260
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:40,523
you will be cured very soon.

261
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,523
You liar.

262
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:44,124
You are lying.

263
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,164
Ever since I'm sick,

264
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:48,164
you say that every time.

265
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:49,003
Xixi.

266
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,003
But it ends up

267
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,044
nothing has changed.

268
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:55,203
I don't want to be like this any more.

269
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:57,124
I don't want to listen to your lies.

270
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:58,364
I don't want to live.

271
00:17:58,364 --> 00:17:59,763
I'm serious this time.

272
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,443
We found your clone.

273
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,884
You will be cured shortly, for sure.

274
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:08,203
What do you mean?

275
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:12,923
Don't you always want to know

276
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:14,564
who is An Yue?

277
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,324
She is not actually a twin of yours,

278
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,443
but a clone

279
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:25,324
specifically created for you.

280
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,780
(Unauthorized access prohibited)

281
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,490
(Archive of failure experimental subject)

282
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:42,404
Zheng,

283
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:44,963
every time when we do experiments,

284
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,963
we would mark the clones, right?

285
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:49,084
Of course.

286
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:51,124
Or else how should
we differentiate them?

287
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:53,483
Why are you asking this?

288
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:56,564
No... Nothing.

289
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,203
Uncle Gu.

290
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:22,044
Uncle Gu.

291
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:23,963
You're awake.

292
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:56,683
It turns out the person in the photo
in your father's secret room

293
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:59,564
is really not the same person.

294
00:22:07,443 --> 00:22:08,364
I'm okay.

295
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:14,763
I've expected that, actually.

296
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:17,164
I have the same fate with them.

297
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:22,044
We are born for Xixi

298
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:29,203
as organs providers.

299
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:33,243
You are not.

300
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,443
This is a fact.

301
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:46,404
I'm just slightly luckier than them.

302
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:57,084
You are An Yue,

303
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:02,084
the person An Yemi
is willing to sacrifice everything

304
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,124
to protect

305
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:06,844
and the partner
I want to hand hands with

306
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,003
for the lifetime.

307
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,884
An Yue, you don't
have to bother all that.

308
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,164
You just have to think of us

309
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:18,844
and those who really love you.

310
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:19,683
That will be enough.

311
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:26,683
Okay.

312
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:33,564
Don't worry.

313
00:23:34,283 --> 00:23:35,483
I understand.

314
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:41,844
It's just that after
these speculations were confirmed,

315
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,644
it's really hard to accept.

316
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:02,203
Let's get out of here first.

317
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:04,124
These pieces of evidence

318
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,644
should be enough for Li Feizhang
to expose and prove his point.

319
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:07,963
Okay.

320
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:20,044
(Since you guys return to Family Xu,)

321
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:22,564
(I know what you are up to.)

322
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:26,443
(I just used your own tactics against you)

323
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,644
(and let you indulge)

324
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:30,483
(in your own delusions.)

325
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:33,044
Gu Cheng,

326
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:36,763
your acting skill is so astonishing.

327
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:43,283
Go print a copy of
Xixi's recent schedule for me.

328
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:45,884
If they two exchange identities again,

329
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:48,443
just catch them.

330
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:51,404
There is one thing I don't understand.

331
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:52,923
They've exchanged for so many times.

332
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:54,483
It's impossible
Lu Jinyan never noticed that.

333
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:56,844
Why is he covering the fact for them?

334
00:24:57,844 --> 00:24:59,324
I suspect this Lu Jinyan

335
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:00,683
sides with An Yemi.

336
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:05,243
He secretly helped
them to switch identities.

337
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:07,963
And turned up in front of me
as if there was nothing happened.

338
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:14,723
You better investigate his identity.

339
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:16,923
Be careful not to alarm them.

340
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:19,844
Don't tell anyone.

341
00:25:20,124 --> 00:25:20,683
All right.

342
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:30,604
Hiding by my side for so long,

343
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:32,844
have you found your desired answer?

344
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:36,443
My dad's car accident
definitely has a connection with you.

345
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:38,443
He brought it upon himself.

346
00:25:47,723 --> 00:25:48,364
Mr. Xu.

347
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:50,364
It's been a while.

348
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,483
Where is An Yemi?

349
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:53,443
An...

350
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:54,763
I don't know.

351
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:56,884
Since her missing,

352
00:25:57,003 --> 00:25:58,283
we are not able to reach her.

353
00:26:00,884 --> 00:26:01,884
Where is that kid then?

354
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:07,243
I'm not sure which sample
you are referring to.

355
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:09,084
Because since An's leaving...

356
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:10,443
Gu Donglei.

357
00:26:11,164 --> 00:26:12,483
You are still fooling me at this point.

358
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:14,723
She didn't actually die.

359
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,324
It was An Yemi
who brought her away, right?

360
00:26:18,763 --> 00:26:19,723
You mean...

361
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:20,763
Didn't she die?

362
00:26:21,564 --> 00:26:23,003
Everyone involved in the surgery

363
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,203
witnessed that.

364
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:26,443
Didn't you confirm that too?

365
00:26:27,564 --> 00:26:29,124
Up to when you want to deceive me?

366
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:30,923
You found a failed clone

367
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,084
to fool me

368
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,003
at the beginning.

369
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:35,963
Am I right?

370
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:37,243
No.

371
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,283
I really don't know
what you are talking about.

372
00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:47,044
Stubborn.

373
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:51,763
I want to see

374
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:54,443
how long you can hold on.

375
00:26:55,124 --> 00:26:56,044
Bring them back.

376
00:26:57,044 --> 00:26:57,644
Stand still.

377
00:26:58,443 --> 00:26:59,124
Don't run.

378
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:09,404
Someone is crashed.

379
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:11,124
Let's go and see.

380
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:12,723
Mister.

381
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:13,804
Quickly call the police.

382
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:14,324
Mister, call the ambulance.

383
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:19,364
By the way,

384
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:22,644
it was someone
who is by your side harmed your dad.

385
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:27,604
No.

386
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,923
She can't be
considered as a real human.

387
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,283
Xu Yongyu.

388
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:38,324
Does Xu Xixi know your true identity?

389
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:39,763
If she knows it...

390
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:40,683
(She doesn't have to know.)

391
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:45,044
And never will she know.

392
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,003
Hold your breath.

393
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:21,644
Jinyan.

394
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:25,003
The signal has been interrupted.

395
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:25,963
I lost my connection.

396
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:27,243
How long will you take

397
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:29,084
to reconnect to
Yuyuan Biotechnology's system?

398
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:32,203
At least half an hour.

399
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:34,844
You'll continue working on that.

400
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:36,124
You guys will bring me to see Xu Yongyu.

401
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:37,483
It's too late now.

402
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:38,283
All right.

403
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:40,443
Don't worry.
We will bring them back shortly.

404
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:41,884
Bring electrical pens along for defence purpose.

405
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:42,523
All right.

406
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:44,124
And

407
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:46,683
keep in touch at all times.

408
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:47,923
All right.

409
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:49,243
All right.

410
00:29:16,124 --> 00:29:16,923
Don't move.

411
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:21,124
An Yue.

412
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:34,963
Behave well

413
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,044
and cooperate with the surgery.

414
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:38,564
Otherwise,

415
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,203
I will kill him first.

416
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:46,044
An Yue, you can't
compromise with him.

417
00:29:46,564 --> 00:29:47,523
Even if you compromise,

418
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:48,604
he wouldn't let me go either.

419
00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:50,203
No.

420
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:53,084
Okay,

421
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,203
I'll cooperate with the surgery.

422
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:58,723
But please don't hurt Lu Jinyan.

423
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:02,164
Let's begin.

424
00:30:13,763 --> 00:30:14,443
Xixi.

425
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,443
Xixi.

426
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,604
I don't want her to sacrifice.

427
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:19,443
It's all right.

428
00:30:19,683 --> 00:30:21,324
Just peacefully go to sleep

429
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:22,523
and when you wake up,

430
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:23,923
everything will be over.

431
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:58,683
Don't move.

432
00:31:02,763 --> 00:31:03,763
No one should touch her.

433
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:16,084
It's okay, I'm here for you.

434
00:31:16,963 --> 00:31:17,763
Beifan.

435
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:36,763
I'll go into the operating room first.

436
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,044
You all will wait
for He Dayu's response.

437
00:31:58,923 --> 00:31:59,644
Lu.

438
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:11,283
Cheng.

439
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:16,044
It's okay.

440
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:19,243
Dad.

441
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:21,324
You're awake.

442
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,044
I'm all right, don't worry.

443
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:24,324
An Yue will be fine as well.

444
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:26,884
I came here

445
00:32:27,324 --> 00:32:28,483
to end the mistakes

446
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:29,483
we've made in this lifetime.

447
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:32,763
Xu Yongyu.

448
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:34,804
Don't go for the surgery.

449
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:35,963
Never go for the surgery.

450
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:38,763
An Yue is your biological daughter.

451
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:43,884
An Yue is not a clone.

452
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:46,443
She is really your biological daughter.

453
00:32:50,044 --> 00:32:52,364
Gu, what nonsense
are you talking about?

454
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:55,844
How could this be possible?

455
00:32:58,884 --> 00:32:59,723
(The door of the operating room)

456
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:01,203
(can only be opened)

457
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:01,923
(with the highest
administrator permission of Xu Yongyu.)

458
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:04,164
(Jinyan is the only one
among us who registered palm print)

459
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:05,124
(and has the access.)

460
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:07,283
Go to the door
of the operating room immediately.

461
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,763
And put your hands
on the touch-screen sensor.

462
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:10,923
I'll pass Xu Yongyu's
administrator permission to you.

463
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:21,324
Listen to me.

464
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:23,044
When these two kids

465
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,203
had been successfully replicated,

466
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:26,564
they were mistaken.

467
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:28,844
An put the marking of clone's DNA

468
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:31,084
on the real Ms. Xu.

469
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,443
That is, on An Yue.

470
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:34,364
Afterwards,

471
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:36,604
we have been taking the marked kid

472
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:38,003
as the clone.

473
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,404
That's why

474
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:41,324
our experiments always fail.

475
00:33:41,763 --> 00:33:44,164
In other words,
besides the only successful experiment.

476
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:46,723
The clones we produced later

477
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:50,364
were replicated from a clone?

478
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,003
Exactly.

479
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:52,723
About this,

480
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:56,003
clear records are noted

481
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:57,283
on An's manuscript notebook.

482
00:33:58,483 --> 00:33:59,844
Both of them are here now.

483
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:02,084
You can make a comparison

484
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:03,804
between their DNA reports.

485
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:05,003
Then you all will know.

486
00:34:16,883 --> 00:34:18,124
Gu Donglei.

487
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,124
You almost have died once too.

488
00:34:22,283 --> 00:34:23,363
Why are there still so many things

489
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,524
that you don't understand until now?

490
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:28,924
Do you think I'll
believe the stories you made up?

491
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,883
I, Xu Yongyu,

492
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:34,444
never trust a person this lifetime.

493
00:34:35,683 --> 00:34:37,164
I just do I want to do.

494
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:38,403
I will pour everything I have.

495
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,564
If anyone dares to stop me,

496
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:42,084
I will make them
disappear from the world.

497
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:44,164
If necessary, I will destroy everything,

498
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:45,444
including myself.

499
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:49,283
I know.

500
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:51,004
Xixi

501
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:53,683
is just a patient

502
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:55,683
in your perspectives.

503
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:58,164
Her life

504
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:00,403
worths less than

505
00:35:01,444 --> 00:35:03,283
that of a healthy clone.

506
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,524
Just because to An,

507
00:35:08,964 --> 00:35:09,883
both of them

508
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:11,604
are equally precious.

509
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:13,323
That's why she used any possible method

510
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:14,283
to bring An Yue away.

511
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:17,124
When I realised that,

512
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:19,164
she was already eight years old.

513
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:21,403
I didn't know where she was.

514
00:35:21,763 --> 00:35:22,883
I wasn't able to reach her.

515
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:25,683
I can only know
from the postcard An sent that

516
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:27,723
she and her daughter were doing well,

517
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:29,924
and Xu Xixi

518
00:35:30,203 --> 00:35:31,403
was also healthy at that time.

519
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:33,644
You even regarded her
as the apple of your eye.

520
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:35,363
I know

521
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,084
if I spit the truth,

522
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:39,883
the peace we are enjoying now
will be ruined.

523
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:41,644
So I can only cover the truths.

524
00:35:41,763 --> 00:35:42,763
And compound a mistake
by further mistakes.

525
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:45,484
Only then,

526
00:35:46,164 --> 00:35:47,203
these two kids

527
00:35:48,164 --> 00:35:49,803
could grow up without discriminations

528
00:35:50,964 --> 00:35:53,203
and grow up safely
under parents' protection.

529
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:57,883
I just didn't expect that

530
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:01,203
I still have to face
the situation like this today.

531
00:36:02,164 --> 00:36:03,484
Xu Yongyu, did you hear it?

532
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:05,484
An Yue is your biological daughter.

533
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:14,723
You all are wrong.

534
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:16,763
My daughter

535
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:19,004
is Xu Xixi.

536
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:21,444
Xu Yongyu.

537
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:23,683
Why don't you want to believe it?

538
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,203
It's not about whether I believe it.

539
00:36:27,964 --> 00:36:29,683
I only recognise Xu Xixi.

540
00:36:47,883 --> 00:36:49,243
Let me tell you all.

541
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,683
The first time I held Xixi in my arms,

542
00:36:59,044 --> 00:36:59,924
she was just so small,

543
00:37:03,484 --> 00:37:05,243
such a small kid.

544
00:37:06,763 --> 00:37:08,004
She smiled to me.

545
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,484
She was babbling and learning to talk,

546
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,604
calling me "daddy".

547
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:20,564
After that,

548
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:23,564
Xixi grew up into a girl.

549
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:30,084
A girl who never cried

550
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:31,763
during examinations and injections.

551
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,243
One day,

552
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:37,843
she cried uncontrollably when she saw

553
00:37:42,403 --> 00:37:44,604
a few strands of grey hair on my head.

554
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:51,883
She knew how to feel sorry for me.

555
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:58,124
And later,

556
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:01,763
Xixi grew up into an adolescent girl.

557
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:05,723
People said

558
00:38:06,763 --> 00:38:09,683
she was wilful and had a bad temper.

559
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:13,243
Only I, as her father, know

560
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:15,644
what Xixi was enduring.

561
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:22,124
Whenever she fell sick,

562
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:25,363
she...

563
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:31,323
she was in so much pain
that she didn't even want to live.

564
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:35,843
But I can't bear to see her

565
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:38,604
struggle day by day

566
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:43,644
and year by year until now.

567
00:38:55,323 --> 00:38:57,524
Throughout my life,

568
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,403
I have done all the bad things.

569
00:39:03,283 --> 00:39:04,683
I don't have friends.

570
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,164
I don't have anything

571
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:10,883
but money.

572
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:13,964
I don't even have a relative.

573
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:21,203
Xixi.

574
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:25,484
She is

575
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,683
the only reliance in my life.

576
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:33,004
And she is the only one

577
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:35,564
in this world

578
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:41,243
who cares for me.

579
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:47,444
But An Yue is also your daughter,

580
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,084
your biological daughter.

581
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:51,524
Your wife would rather

582
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,564
sacrifice her own life to protect An Yue.

583
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:54,604
Xu Yongyu.

584
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:56,444
What was the original intention

585
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:58,363
of setting up this project?

586
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:01,044
Wasn't it for protecting her?

587
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,444
Could you bear seeing your daughter

588
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:04,843
being put on the cold operating table?

589
00:40:04,843 --> 00:40:06,004
Why are you accusing me

590
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,164
using the highest standards of moral?

591
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:10,924
Didn't you all participate in

592
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,403
all of these tragedies?

593
00:40:17,604 --> 00:40:18,683
Xixi

594
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:21,243
is my daughter.

595
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:27,484
You can call me cruel and heartless,

596
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:32,363
you can say I'm a complete villain
and have done nothing but bad things.

597
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:35,203
But from the very beginning till now,

598
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:36,564
I have only had one goal.

599
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:39,363
To save my daughter.

600
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,500
(Analysing)

601
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,860
(Xixi is a clone of An Yue)

602
00:40:51,604 --> 00:40:52,323
Mr. Xu.

603
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:55,564
Mr. Xu.

604
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:57,803
Mitochondrial DNA of the clones

605
00:40:57,803 --> 00:40:58,644
are shorter than
that of the original copies.

606
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:00,644
Xixi is exactly a clone.

607
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:02,363
When the cloning was completed,

608
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:03,403
although both of them

609
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:05,164
carry the inherited cancer genes,

610
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:07,564
the incidence rate
is less than fifty percent.

611
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:09,403
Later, because you kept her confined

612
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:11,084
at home and in the hospital for a long period,

613
00:41:11,484 --> 00:41:12,604
her mood became depressed,

614
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:14,604
which caused a sudden increase
in the incidence of her illness

615
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:17,164
and ultimately
led to the uncontrollable situation.

616
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:19,883
If this is the case,

617
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:24,124
I'm the one who harmed Xixi.

618
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:41,843
I harmed Xixi.

619
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:46,203
We still have time.

620
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:52,883
Don't move.

621
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:57,924
Beifan.

622
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:58,683
Go.

623
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,403
Ding Beifan!

624
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:00,524
Beifan.

625
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:01,564
Go.

626
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:03,283
Tiancheng, hurry up.

627
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:04,203
We have no time.

628
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:15,564
If you all want to live,

629
00:42:16,763 --> 00:42:17,723
carry on the surgery.

630
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:20,524
Hurry up!

631
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:21,763
Faster.

632
00:42:22,564 --> 00:42:23,363
Anaesthetic please.

633
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:25,403
