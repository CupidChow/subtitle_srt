Twins?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,940
(The possibility of being twins is 99.9999%)

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,000
Why have I never heard
my dad mention it before?

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,359
I just found out too.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,719
Seems like An Yemi has
hidden quite a lot from me.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,079
Sorry.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,600
What are you apologizing for?

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,239
I don't care at all

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,559
about what she plans behind my back.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,879
As you can see,

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,600
I wanted to stay here by myself.

13
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,759
Here,

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,520
I can go wherever I want

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,359
without reporting to anyone.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,920
And no one would be

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
monitoring me 24/7.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Plus, no one would be

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,439
serving me every day

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,799
while being afraid of not pleasing me.

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,920
I don't have much time left.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,759
I just want to live happily.

23
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,560
So

24
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,920
I won't leave with you guys.

25
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,040
Lu Jinyan.

26
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,920
If it weren't for this crisis,

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,760
you wouldn't have come to find me.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,799
Ms. Xu.

29
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,560
This is your crisis too.

30
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,159
Do you remember Dr. Zheng?

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,159
His team will be returning
from overseas tomorrow

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,719
for a comprehensive
medical checkup for you.

33
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,319
If An Yue is in
charge of the checkup,

34
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,920
her identity would
definitely be exposed.

35
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,159
Till then,

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,120
do you think you can still hide here?

37
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,200
Don't you miss your dad?

38
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,560
He has been working hard and
worrying about your illness.

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,759
Don't you want to meet him?

40
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,319
It's late.

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

42
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,980
=Love of Replica=

43
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,980
=Episode 10=

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,160
Looks so alike.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,230
No wonder even my dad
couldn't recognize you.

46
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,750
It's really not plastic surgery.

47
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,230
I guarantee I've never done it.

48
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,670
So,

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,510
are we really twins?

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,790
From the perspective of
paternity testing,

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,470
there are 99.99% possibilities that

52
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,560
we are twins.

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,520
If we are twins,

54
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,160
are all of our organs exactly the same?

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,430
I wonder.

56
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,040
Okay.

57
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,430
As long as Xu Yongyu leaves the house,

58
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,470
the system will alert us immediately.

59
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,550
So this will ensure
no element of surprise.

60
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
I wonder what's

61
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,990
going on at An Yue's side.

62
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,910
We've located her.

63
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,400
We're going back now.

64
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,350
I can go back with you

65
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,470
but

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,870
on one condition.

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,230
Sir,

68
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,160
Dr. Zheng will arrive at
the airport in two hours

69
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,870
and he will arrive at the
hospital at 7 p.m. sharp.

70
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,720
Let's go.

71
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,040
I'll go see Xixi first.

72
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Xu Yongyu has departed.

73
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,290
(56 more minutes until
they reach the destination)

74
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,430
Jinyan, urgent!

75
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,470
(Xu Yongyu has started off early.)

76
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,520
(How much longer do you need?)

77
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,910
Probably another hour.

78
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,080
Xu Yongyu is here.

79
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,310
You guys go ahead.

80
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,790
Let me handle him.

81
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,640
He's a suspicious person.

82
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,430
If we stop him from
going upstairs forcefully,

83
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,040
he'll only become more suspicious.

84
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,200
Don't worry.

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,160
I won't stop him that way.

86
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,280
Come.

87
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,470
Mr. Xu is here.

88
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Why are you here?

89
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,910
Xixi asked me to come
and keep her company.

90
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,080
Where is Xixi then?

91
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,670
Xixi.

92
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,520
Xixi.

93
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,720
Mr. Xu.

94
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,350
Xixi.

95
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,280
Xixi could be a little nervous

96
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,960
today because of the examination.

97
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,400
She didn't sleep well last night

98
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,350
so she's still resting.

99
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,200
Well, let's not disturb her rest then.

100
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,280
Zhou.

101
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,160
How was the airport pick-up?

102
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,160
Let me check.

103
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,910
The flight is expected
to land in one hour.

104
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,430
We should wake her up early

105
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,070
so she doesn't wake up grumpy

106
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,880
and then refuses to cooperate
with the examination.

107
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
Mr. Xu, let me handle it.

108
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,590
You may rest first.

109
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:08,760
Ding Beifan.

110
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,950
Jiang Tiancheng.

111
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,590
(Where have you all been?)

112
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,360
Where's Xixi?

113
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,360
Is she awake?

114
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,280
Yes, she is.

115
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,310
She was very grumpy when
being woken up just now.

116
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,190
Mr. Xu.

117
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,760
Where's Xixi?

118
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,240
Where is she?

119
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,240
And also Lu Jinyan?

120
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,070
Why isn't he around as well?

121
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,000
Xixi is taking a shower.

122
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,280
I don't know about Lu Jinyan.

123
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,520
Maybe Xixi got him to go buy something.

124
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,190
Lies.

125
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,710
All of you

126
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,070
were helping Xixi to
avoid the checkup

127
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,430
by lying to me.

128
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,760
Mr. Xu.

129
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,550
Mr. Xu.

130
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,400
Xixi.

131
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,280
Xixi.

132
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,640
What's going on, old man?

133
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,160
Didn't you see that I was showering?

134
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,790
Sorry, Xixi.

135
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,120
I'm just worried about you.

136
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,140
(An Yue)

137
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,590
We would know if I'm okay

138
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,310
after the checkup.

139
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,360
Glad you're okay.

140
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,790
Glad you're okay.

141
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,190
You scared me there.

142
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,590
This thing was indeed

143
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,640
quite good.

144
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,910
It sounds very realistic in there.

145
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,070
Luckily, you're smart.

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,910
It's not because I'm smart.

147
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,190
But I understand
Tian Sui's personality better.

148
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,830
Once she told a lie,

149
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,240
she would do everything
to make it come true.

150
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,880
Give me back my pants.

151
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,880
Dr. Zheng has arrived at the airport.

152
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,670
Now off to the hospital.

153
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,400
Old man.

154
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,000
Xixi, dry your hair quickly.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
It's time to go.

156
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,520
Old man, I miss you so much.

157
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,310
Xixi, my baby.

158
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,000
When did you start acting coquettishly?

159
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,550
As long as you

160
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,240
take good care of your body.

161
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,590
Dad

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,670
will be happier than ever.

163
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,910
The fishing village is not safe.

164
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,880
You can stay with me for the time being.

165
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,240
You've been staying in a hotel, right?

166
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,360
Yes.

167
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,160
So that Xu Yongyu won't
find out about my true identity.

168
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,480
Can I take a look around?

169
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
My girlfriend.

170
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,120
Feel free.

171
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,760
Let me help you.

172
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,910
Okay.

173
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,880
When did you buy these?

174
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,760
These are prepared by Tian Sui for you.

175
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,760
She was worried that you
didn't have clean clothes.

176
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,000
So she prepared some
clothes for you in advance,

177
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,310
as well as toiletries.

178
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,000
Tian Sui is a person who speaks her mind
but she has a soft heart.

179
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,670
She may not be easy to approach,

180
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,590
but she's actually very thoughtful.

181
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,340
(Oil Soap)

182
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,540
(Family planning products)

183
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,830
What's so funny?

184
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,040
Nothing,

185
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,400
I was just thinking

186
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
that you're right.

187
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,000
She's quite thoughtful.

188
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,310
I'm going to wash up.

189
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,880
Well...

190
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,910
Goodnight.

191
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,120
I'll sleep on the couch.

192
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,760
Well...

193
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,360
Goodnight.

194
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,040
Well...

195
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,830
Goodnight.

Lu Jinyan.

217
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,070
I forgot that I came on my period.

218
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,870
I'll make you some brown sugar drinks.

219
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,590
The brain tumor lesion

220
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,920
hasn't shown any
obvious signs of deterioration,

221
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,790
but other physical indicators
are not optimistic.

222
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,070
What's the matter with you?

223
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,150
I just feel like

224
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,150
she's changed a lot recently.

225
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,000
It's nothing.

226
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,310
I'm just overthinking.

227
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,310
Since she is seriously ill now,

228
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,920
it's better to be safe

229
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,240
and change the checkup
back to once a week.

230
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,200
Understood.

231
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,040
However,

232
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,310
regardless of whether
there are any clues

233
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,830
left by An Yemi about the child,

234
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,310
we can't delay Ms. Xu's
surgery any longer.

235
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,280
If, as you said,

236
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
that child is still alive,

237
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,310
we need to find her as soon as possible.

238
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,830
I know.

239
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,070
I will hurry up.

240
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,150
Ms. Xu.

241
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,480
Get out, stop following me.

242
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,590
I'm sorry, Miss.

243
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,630
These are all Mr. Xu's orders.

244
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,310
Do you think there's any
difference between how

245
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,110
Lu Jinyan treated me before
and after the car accident?

246
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,680
I think whether it was before

247
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,630
or after the car accident,

248
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,870
Lu has always been
absolutely responsible for you.

249
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,760
He is the benchmark for our learning.

250
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,390
It's just that

251
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,520
Lu would be more
popular now than before.

252
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,870
Even netizens say that

253
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,590
Lu is a textbook
of the bodyguard industry.

254
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,680
What does that mean?

255
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:53,710
(Xu Xixi VS Handsome Bodyguard)

256
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,520
You're awake.

257
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,200
Breakfast is ready.

258
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,760
You can have it when you get up.

259
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,830
I'll go to Xu's house later.

260
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,760
Don't worry.

261
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,790
I'll behave and not reveal
my identity while staying at home.

262
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,630
Once we find out the truth,

263
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,150
we will bring those who
harmed my dad to justice.

264
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,590
Then we'll leave this place
and live the life we want.

265
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,550
(We need to discuss what to do next.)

266
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,390
(Ask An Yue to wait
for me at the company.)

267
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,310
(I want to see her.)

268
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,390
She wants to see you.

269
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,920
Who made you angry

270
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
so early in the morning?

271
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,920
Since when I'm happy
after a physical examination?

272
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,310
Hey, Xixi.

273
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,240
Let me tell you.

274
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,520
I'm fine.

275
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,070
If you're not tired of saying these,
I am tired of hearing them.

276
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,070
If you really want to make me happy,

277
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,870
just promise me one thing.

278
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,830
What is it?

279
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,070
I want to give Lu Jinyan a break.

280
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,550
He's been with me all these days.

281
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,550
It's too hard on him.

282
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,960
I want him to rest.

283
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,150
Okay.

284
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,150
But you have to promise me

285
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,040
to go for check-ups
every week from now on.

286
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,550
Okay.

287
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,590
But I don't want to affect my work.

288
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,960
Well...

289
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,870
This is too hard.

290
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,790
Your body can't handle it.

291
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,310
It's nothing.

292
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,520
I'm bored staying at home.

293
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,040
No worries.

294
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,280
I won't let work affect my health.

295
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,960
Okay.

296
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,520
From now on,

297
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,720
you have to get my permission

298
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,680
for all your whereabouts

299
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,590
and schedule.

300
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,350
Good girl.

301
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,070
Good morning, Mr. Xu.

302
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,760
Ms. Xu, the car is ready.

303
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,720
Old man, I'm going to the company.

304
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,680
Don't you forget

305
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,040
what you promised me earlier.

306
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,630
I've forgotten about
your conditioned reflex.

307
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,350
Let's go.

308
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,070
Xu Xixi insisted on
meeting at the company,

309
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,550
but I didn't expect

310
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,630
that you're so good at
disguising yourself.

311
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,390
I didn't recognize you at first glance.

312
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,720
That's fine.

313
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,440
How was last night's experience?

314
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,390
What experience?

315
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,040
Really?

316
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,070
Lu Jinyan,

317
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,240
strong on the outside,
but weak on the inside.

318
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,520
So those family planning products
were bought by you?

319
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,150
Of course.

320
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,000
I secretly put them in there

321
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,310
under Ding Beifan's nose.

322
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,920
Otherwise, who do you
think bought them, Ding Beifan?

323
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
He would even object to

324
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,000
you going to Lu Jinyan's house.

325
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,920
So,

326
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,350
did you end up using them?

327
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,000
How many

328
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,000
did you use?

329
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,790
You guys seem to be having a good chat.

330
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,200
We're discussing what things need to

331
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,110
be handed over to you.

332
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,040
So that you can be yourself again.

333
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,960
It also allowed An Yue to exit smoothly.

334
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,870
Since we're all here,

335
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,000
let's make sure we're on the same page.

336
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,200
So that we don't make
any mistakes in public in the future.

337
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,200
Don't bother.

338
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,200
As long as I share
Xu Xixi's identity with her,

339
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,520
she'll be responsible
for socializing and liaising.

340
