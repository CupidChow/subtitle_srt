1
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,479
A new week at the end
of this winter has started.

2
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,148
This is Weekly News,
let's look at last week's events.

3
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,066
(Following)

4
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,692
On the 4th of this month,

5
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,780
the government announced
it will increase its budget

6
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,866
on street security cameras
by over 40 percent.

7
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,986
One human rights group
criticized it

8
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,063
for invading privacy.

9
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,625
Security cameras and
its ability to prevent crimes...

10
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:43,254
For more, we'll speak later
with Mr. Kim Ji-seok

11
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,156
from Seoul Video
Surveillance team.

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,701
See you.

13
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,769
Hello, I'm Koo Jung-tae.

14
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:00,929
I work as a realtor,

15
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,773
and my hobby is peeping.

16
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,842
(So frigging funny lolol)

17
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:11,240
I don't peep high school chats
because they're so childish,

18
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:13,201
but I did it today

19
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:14,493
because it was there.

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,978
Just what I thought...

21
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:18,272
It was childish.

22
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:22,985
Good morning.

23
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,964
"Love the work you do."

24
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,592
An American business mogul
said that once.

25
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:30,843
(Realtor Koo Jung-tae)

26
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,161
It's a great quote.

27
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,805
I only have one rule for my job:

28
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:37,934
keys that my clients
trusted me

29
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,126
with are holy.

30
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:43,948
Next step is
an incredibly hard job.

31
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:48,110
Even the smallest detail
could have massive results...

32
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:49,428
Wait a minute.

33
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,973
This could have been bad.

34
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,725
(:))

35
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:56,827
(God of Investing:
Real Estate Academy)

36
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:57,995
It's perfect.

37
00:02:58,062 --> 00:03:00,080
(Ant Daddy,
thank you for insight)

38
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,166
(That was a great read,
I'd love to visit you)

39
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,360
(Hero of Real Estate Academy.
Ant Daddy!)

40
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:08,864
Do you know what's more
important than money to us?

41
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:13,644
Reputation,
it's all about reputation.

42
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,359
- What's up?
- Holy cow...

43
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,521
Reading something good?

44
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:25,923
Not at all.

45
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:31,137
Why did you come
so early, Ji-hee?

46
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,405
You told me to.

47
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:35,683
Where's the
cost break down report?

48
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,576
That was due today?

49
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:39,328
I told you last week.

50
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,147
I'll try to get it done today.

51
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,275
And a great employee.

52
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,152
Perfect.

53
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,468
You're insane,

54
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:54,927
I told you
to sell the car and pay the debt!

55
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:58,222
I'll pay it back,
I'll take care of it!

56
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,266
Couple Kang Mi-young and
Noh Young-seung.

57
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,060
They've been fighting like that
everyday since last week.

58
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,980
He bought a car

59
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:06,297
without
telling his wife on loan.

60
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,599
I know, this looks weird, right?

61
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:19,326
Call it a reconnaissance mission.

62
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,730
Something like
a corporate espionage.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,153
But I never do anything bad.

64
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:30,946
I just peep.

65
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,893
So this is
the problematic car key.

66
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:42,525
This is really what I do,
I just peep.

67
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:48,230
And fix stuff like this too.

68
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:51,008
One, two...

69
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,513
Okay.

70
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,116
As my payment,

71
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:01,727
I take the most
useless thing from the house.

72
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,147
One, two!

73
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,760
Where do I use these?

74
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,150
I don't normally pick

75
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:56,175
just one person to peep.

76
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:59,011
I like to peep
on a variety of people.

77
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:01,222
I even have a jinx too.

78
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,768
Anyways,
but she was an exception.

79
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:09,205
Han So-ra, social media star,

80
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:12,107
so-called 'influencer'.

81
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:16,820
It was 5 months ago,
142 days to be precise.

82
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,924
When I first saw her,

83
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:22,284
I had no idea who she was.

84
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,293
She looked normal at first.

85
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,046
But...

86
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:41,028
(Vegan salad for today's lunch)

87
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:43,072
She posted a vegan salad

88
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,166
while eating a sausage.

89
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:49,937
I found that interesting.

90
00:07:55,693 --> 00:07:58,837
I started to get
curious about her.

91
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:01,198
(Peeping day 1)

92
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:09,999
3rd floor.

93
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,527
No security cams,
and no cars mean no dashcams.

94
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,490
Doesn't she live in
a bad neighborhood?

95
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,448
(Han So-ra)

96
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,183
Han So-ra...

97
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,078
(Han So-ra)

98
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:34,998
Let's see,
So-ra, So-ra, Han So-ra.

99
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,208
Here she is.

100
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,276
Han So-ra.

101
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,004
She loves luxury bags,

102
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:42,382
she'll wait hours in line

103
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:44,825
to get into trendy restaurants.

104
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,387
She'll go to exhibitions

105
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:49,663
and always takes a selfie.

106
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,335
At least she used to...

107
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,630
But now she's different.

108
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:03,218
Good reputation,
plenty to look at.

109
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,364
She definitely likes to show off.

110
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:09,324
(Peeping day 5)

111
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,644
But I'm not satisfied
with that.

112
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:15,064
I have to see
her real side.

113
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:24,114
Tuna.

114
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,951
I brought you some treats.

115
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,204
Come here.

116
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,108
No, don't go!

117
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,935
So-ra.

118
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:40,314
I'll leave the treat here,
take some later.

119
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,066
Are you really a good person?

120
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,319
(Peeping day 62)

121
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,763
Peeping day 62,
walking her dogs.

122
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:51,183
Is this her real daily life?

123
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,703
Peeping day 112.

124
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,038
She got all dressed up

125
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:57,189
and took
a selfie at a cafe.

126
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:01,719
This cannot be her real self.

127
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:05,781
Peeping day 119,
heading out to pilates.

128
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,425
I have to go inside
her house

129
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:09,702
to see the real So-ra.

130
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:13,647
Inferring her passcode
with precise logic.

131
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,208
It's not working.

132
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:29,237
Life is never easy.

133
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:32,282
(Present time)

134
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,826
But I think
I'll get in today.

135
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:37,245
I found a way.

136
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:38,814
(Forgot my door lock passcode,
please help asap!)

137
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:56,665
Finally!

138
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:01,503
Finally!

139
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,070
If the passcode consists of
4 digits,

140
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:10,654
that's 24 combinations,

141
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:12,532
if it's 5, then 120 combos,

142
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,408
which can be done in 3 hours.

143
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:15,992
All right, be calm, Koo Jung-tae.

144
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:19,354
Relax, keep it together,
one, two, three!

145
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,027
What's this?

146
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:28,030
Who uses that many digits
for their passcode?

147
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:34,828
Boys, what should I do?

148
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,529
I really want to get in there.

149
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,233
Welcome...

150
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:06,527
Oh my god...

151
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,862
She...

152
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,032
came...

153
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:17,396
Hello, I'd like to put up
my place on the market.

154
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:23,335
Sir?

155
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:28,715
Hello, I'm Koo Jung-tae.

156
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:31,927
- Please sit down.
- Sure.

157
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:34,489
It's chilly outside,

158
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:37,032
would you like
something warm to drink?

159
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:38,700
Yes, I'd love some green tea.

160
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:39,726
Green tea.

161
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:42,037
Who are you? Koo Jung-tae.

162
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:43,663
Where is this?
My office.

163
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,799
Get it together, man!

164
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,155
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

165
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:53,866
Why didn't
the homeowner come...

166
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:55,801
Get it together.

167
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:57,035
and you came instead?

168
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:01,807
Why? I don't look like
a homeowner?

169
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:03,768
My apologies,

170
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:06,686
I thought
you were a college student.

171
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,505
What did you say?

172
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,402
The homeowner is away
at the moment.

173
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:17,030
I just happened to move out
before the lease expires,

174
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,308
so she told me to
look into it myself.

175
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,351
Did you bring the contract?

176
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,020
Of course.

177
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,151
Here it is.

178
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:31,737
Let's see...

179
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:36,366
You only lived here for a year?

180
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,593
Is the apartment haunted?

181
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,290
No, I've been transferred
to a different region.

182
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:45,183
Liar.

183
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,778
I thought about it a lot
before signing this.

184
00:13:48,587 --> 00:13:50,355
If it was
a bachelor or a condo...

185
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:51,857
So-ra, why are you lying?

186
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:54,109
Don't lie to me,
why are you moving?

187
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,052
Wait a minute.

188
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:58,513
So I finally get to go inside.

189
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:01,041
I can't keep paying rent...

190
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:05,879
Anyway, please find someone
to take over the lease ASAP.

191
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,623
How soon can
we view the place?

192
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,567
Will you be home after work?

193
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,221
That's the thing...

194
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:23,997
This is insane...

195
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:26,441
I love my work.

196
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:33,282
I actually wanted to leave this
to a woman realtor.

197
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:36,802
I'll trust you with it,
please take care of it.

198
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,154
Thank you.

199
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,822
I'll do my best.

200
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,250
Of course, So-ra, trust me.

201
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:45,644
I'm not a bad guy.

202
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,299
That's all it took.

203
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:01,326
The scent of this home...

204
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:03,604
is perfect.

205
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,754
That's where she took photos
of the dishes she cooked.

206
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,048
Seen that a lot.

207
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,108
It's all disconnected.

208
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,945
36W ballast.

209
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:54,947
I'll bring it next time.

210
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:09,811
What's this?

211
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:13,840
Contact lenses down the drain?

212
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,658
That feels good.

213
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,511
Tuna injured her leg,

214
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:27,429
so I'm heading to the vet.

215
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:29,723
She never approaches people...

216
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,208
Tuna.

217
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,878
Tuna!

218
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:38,256
Tuna will be fine.

219
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,484
I hope she recovers soon

220
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,011
and gets adopted
to a loving family.

221
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:44,989
I'll foster her for a while,

222
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:46,281
so I'll post some pics.

223
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:47,782
(You deserve so much love)

224
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:50,669
Thank you, whoever you are.

225
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,757
That's really encouraging.

226
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,069
Oh my god...

227
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,007
(Peeping day 152)

228
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:06,217
Today marks my 3rd visit
to So-ra's house.

229
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,286
The ballast delivery
took too long.

230
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:11,398
I'll just install this
and come right out.

231
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:13,500
It'll only take 10 minutes.

232
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,795
Each day is too perfect.

233
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:39,364
She...

234
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,087
(Ms. Han, I can't reach you
on the phone)

235
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:27,199
(I'll be dropping in
with clients soon)

236
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:32,164
Mr. Koo!

237
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:34,977
Evening, sorry for such
a late showing.

238
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,432
A good apartment
just popped up.

239
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:37,807
- It's okay.
- All good.

240
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:39,144
- Shall we?
- Sure.

241
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:41,147
They're the types who won't panic

242
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:42,714
and call 911 upon seeing the body.

243
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,926
Two would be better than one,

244
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:47,844
right, So-ra?

245
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:55,085
Ms. Han?

246
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,496
I called her earlier,
I don't think she's home.

247
00:18:58,563 --> 00:18:59,673
I see.

248
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:06,471
Let's go inside.

249
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,469
Oh my!

250
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:15,034
Don't touch anything!

251
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,727
This place is so clean!

252
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,295
Incredible!

253
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:24,589
So adorable...

254
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,024
What the hell?

255
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:44,551
Was the killer on a
corpse-carrier shopping?

256
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:48,755
He probably thinks
it was a perfect crime,

257
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:50,682
but I'm a witness!

258
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:55,870
Wait.

259
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:01,568
Could he have seen me?

260
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:06,381
(Dobong Police Station)

261
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:09,075
Good morning.

262
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:18,701
What? What is it this time?

263
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:21,663
You sent Det. Jang again.
It was my case.

264
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,332
Desk work is important too,
Det. Oh.

265
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,960
I spotted his location
by triangulating the car.

266
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:29,387
But Jang was sent
to arrested him.

267
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:31,907
When I did
all the work, right?

268
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:34,300
Well, Jang is an expert.

269
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,970
He's already good at
what he does,

270
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:40,398
why should I risk it
by sending you?

271
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:49,941
So why did you apply
to Criminal Affairs?

272
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:54,070
Why don't you ask Jang
to let you join his team?

273
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:55,364
His men die or get injured

274
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:58,866
if there's a girl in his team.

275
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,519
I should get exorcized
or something.

276
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:07,083
- Come on!
- Damn it!

277
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,167
Hold still, relax!

278
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,152
Get out!

279
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,929
Take him.

280
00:21:12,864 --> 00:21:15,658
If a case comes up,
I want heads up first.

281
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:20,663
(Murder of woman in her 20s)

282
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:26,183
(Neighbor in his 30s
turns himself in)

283
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,797
(after murdering
"woman in her 20s")

284
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,205
It's been 4 days.

285
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,291
The body hasn't been found.

286
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:42,210
Should I report it?

287
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,331
Good morning.

288
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:47,290
Ji-hee, what's this?

289
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:48,666
(Mr. Koo Jung-tae)

290
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:51,386
I don't know,
it was on the door.

291
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:57,450
(It was you, right?)

292
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:04,704
Why? What is it?

293
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,543
Nothing.

294
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,482
Who sent this?

295
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:14,342
I don't know, why?

296
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:29,633
Could this be my hair?

297
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:46,099
Hello?

298
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,184
I don't know what to tell you,

299
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,624
I sincerely apologize.

300
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,324
Sir, could you continue later?

301
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:59,654
(Rest in peace
Bang Hye-sook)

302
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,474
We will replace the glass,

303
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,794
but thankfully, your mother's
urn wasn't harmed.

304
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,396
Did you say "thankfully"?

305
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:09,923
My apologies, sir.

306
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:12,354
We will move her urn

307
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:15,002
to a VIP room.

308
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,113
It has security camera coverage,

309
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:19,508
and we won't charge you anything

310
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:22,785
for the next 30 years.

311
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:25,371
I'm sorry.

312
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,374
- Give me a tape.
- Pardon?

313
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:30,777
A box tape.

314
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:34,230
Why do I get the feeling
that it was him?

315
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:37,575
Mom, please say something.

316
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,779
Careful, be careful!

317
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:43,973
Truck on the loose!
Get out of there!

318
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:46,974
Mom!

319
00:23:48,314 --> 00:23:49,064
Mom!

320
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:08,181
Someone call 911!
Call 911!

321
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:09,916
Your driving...

322
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:17,215
Wait a minute!

323
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:18,841
This man.

324
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:21,235
Can't really tell who it is...

325
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:24,238
Have you asked your employees
about him?

326
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:25,448
Yes.

327
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:27,250
They all said it wasn't them...

328
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,785
Mr. Hong, did you make sure
you engaged the parking brake?

329
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:31,663
I did!

330
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,081
How many times
do I have to tell you?

331
00:24:34,148 --> 00:24:38,127
We'll look for any witnesses

332
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:39,003
and get back to you.

333
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,614
Yes, thank you.

334
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:49,931
- No, please don't!
- Let me take one pic!

335
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:51,682
- Just one!
- You can't do that!

336
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:53,443
Social media star went missing?

337
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:56,772
Her friend went missing

338
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,924
and is unreachable for 4 days.

339
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:01,192
Why is she so hyper?

340
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,819
Some streamer or something...

341
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:06,864
What was her username?
It's Holugi.

342
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:08,641
She doesn't
look like something.

343
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,978
You wanted any missing
adult women cases.

344
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:14,814
Then I'll send this one up
to the committee.

345
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:20,836
I really got a phone call.

346
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:23,389
And then...
wait a minute.

347
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:26,614
Here, look at this.

348
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,305
(Answer the phone!
Where are you?)

349
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:32,557
No replies.

350
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:33,933
She's missing, right?

351
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,084
So what did Ms. Han So-ra
exactly say?

352
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:41,174
If she's ever unreachable,

353
00:25:41,883 --> 00:25:44,214
she told me to report it
to the police...

354
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:47,863
Who'd take that seriously.

355
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,624
She was
a major attention seeker.

356
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,826
She's an attention seeker?

357
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:53,227
She's no joke.

358
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:56,831
Everyone goes to hospital
and gets treated,

359
00:25:56,898 --> 00:25:58,997
or receives luxury bag gifts
once in their lifetime.

360
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:01,169
But she takes selfies

361
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:03,671
and posts them
on her social media.

362
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:07,659
Then are you one too?

363
00:26:08,743 --> 00:26:09,510
No...

364
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:12,272
Why are you snooping around?

365
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:19,353
I can say this
because we're best friends.

366
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,864
BFF, BFF.

367
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:24,409
Anyway, this looks like
a major case.

368
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,495
When girls go missing,

369
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,656
they're found in a ditch

370
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:31,117
with their limbs all twisted up.

371
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:32,784
What if So-ra's that case?

372
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:34,660
That'd be a major scoop.

373
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,963
Can I tell my viewers
on my stream?

374
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:43,252
Did you look into it?

375
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,214
Yes, Han So-ra, 29,
lives in Dobong district,

376
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:50,034
her entire family is unreachable,
and this.

377
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,955
There's no evidence of her alive
since her disappearance.

378
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:55,773
- Completely?
- Yes.

379
00:26:56,374 --> 00:26:57,643
No credit card transactions,

380
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,069
call logs, GPS,
ER records, nothing.

381
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:02,572
Maybe she really went missing.

382
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:08,428
Ji-hee! Ji...

383
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,615
- Hello.
- Mr. Koo Jung-tae?

384
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:16,077
We're from Dobong Police,
I have some questions.

385
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:17,662
Please sit down.

386
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:18,438
Sure.

387
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:20,915
Missing?

388
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:22,942
Yes, we received a report.

389
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:25,274
Do you remember
when you last saw her?

390
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:29,757
So that's why
she wasn't reachable.

391
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:32,574
You have her house key, right?

392
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:36,727
Yes, it's in the safe,
like most of my clients do.

393
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:39,704
Was she normally home
when you went for showings?

394
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:42,770
I'm a normal realtor,
a normal man.

395
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:45,657
How would
a normal person normally respond?

396
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:48,634
She was away more
than she was home.

397
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:53,740
I texted her when I had to
do a showing

398
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,783
while she was away.

399
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,703
I had her permission to do so,
of course,

400
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,380
but she was away
most of the time.

401
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:03,708
I blabbered on,
was that a fair answer?

402
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:05,593
Or am I screwed?

403
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,696
What did you do
on February 19th?

404
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:11,657
I'm so doomed...

405
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:19,899
Uh, what...
did I do that day?

406
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:23,102
One moment.

407
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,229
How do they know
the exact date?

408
00:28:25,296 --> 00:28:26,397
Does this make sense?

409
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:29,358
I had a showing at her home
with newlyweds.

410
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:30,764
What time was that?

411
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:33,947
About 7 PM.

412
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:35,394
Was she home at the time?

413
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,643
No, she wasn't home.

414
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:42,104
You were here all afternoon?

415
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,899
Of course.

416
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:47,944
Thank you for your cooperation.

417
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,638
I may be in touch
a few more times.

418
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:54,654
And could I get a list
of everyone who saw her home?

419
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,164
One second.

420
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,515
- Detective...
- Yes?

421
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:03,768
That Han So-ra...

422
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:05,584
Did anything bad happen to her?

423
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:07,572
For example, dead?

424
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:12,744
- We don't know yet.
- Gosh.

425
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:14,570
- Mr. Koo?
- Yes?

426
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:16,405
Could I get her key?

427
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,082
I talked to the
homeowner already.

428
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:19,459
Of course.

429
00:29:26,858 --> 00:29:28,150
Here it is.

430
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:29,886
Oh, yes.

431
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:36,100
Was that enough?

432
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:46,652
No, of course not.

433
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,089
On her social media,

434
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:16,632
it looked like
she travels quite often.

435
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:18,267
Maybe she went away
for a few days.

436
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:20,637
Some people these days
only use cash

437
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:22,263
not to leave any trace.

438
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,166
Think about it.

439
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,353
A young woman goes away

440
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,520
for 3 days leaving all cosmetics?

441
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:31,147
There's a suitcase in the storage,

442
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:32,464
closet is full of clothes.

443
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:35,514
She could've had
even more clothes.

444
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:42,500
And multiple suitcases.

445
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:45,353
Hey!

446
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:47,563
What is it?

447
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:51,525
Blood? Where?

448
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:29,434
There wasn't anything
missing at her home.

449
00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:34,110
It was cruel.

450
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,680
It has to be someone
who loathes her.

451
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:43,686
I could be framed
for everything.

452
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:47,348
There must be some traces
on her social media.

453
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:49,141
I must find it.

454
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,644
That wraps up my response

455
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:53,129
to that accusation from Holugi.

456
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:55,277
I know it's lacking,

457
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:59,427
but I tried
to be very transparent,

458
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:01,804
and I realized

459
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,866
that this can make
some of you disgusted.

460
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:07,747
Some people accused her

461
00:32:07,814 --> 00:32:09,745
of misusing the donation.

462
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:12,247
Even after she had
the perfect response.

463
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,566
My poor So-ra,

464
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:15,501
how bad she must've felt.

465
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,528
(Holugi entered the chat)

466
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:19,046
(Holugi: "This crazy wench is
at it again")

467
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:20,130
(Holugi: "Fake tears, obviously!
Did you poke your eye?")

468
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,632
(Holugi: "Breakdown of
Han So-ra's nonsense")

469
00:32:21,699 --> 00:32:23,008
Holugi...

470
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,218
Look at this wench.

471
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:26,346
Instead of addressing the issue,

472
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:28,722
she went to eat vegan brunch.

473
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:30,766
I bet she had bloody steaks
after posting this.

474
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:31,834
Guys,

475
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,397
Han So-ra sued me for defamation.

476
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:38,148
Dammit, I'll countersue.

477
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:39,441
You think only you can do that?

478
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:40,609
Guys, see this account?

479

(Counter lawsuit funding)

480
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:44,738
A wench like her
needs to be judged!

481
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:47,308
Wait, who is this woman?

482
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:51,224
Clothes, hair, make-up, nails...

483
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:53,957
She claims to hate her
but mimicked her a lot.

484

(A vegan's devouring pizza lol)

485
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,583

494
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,903
I was angry because
my appointment broke today.

495
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,363
But looking at the sky,

496
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,742
Dammit, look at this micro dust
in the air.

497
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,661
You'll drop dead if you
go out in this condition.

498
00:33:32,728 --> 00:33:34,163
Damn, what should I eat?

499
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,354
Got it.

get that angle?

512

an investigation.

reported missing on the 23rd,

00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:45,367
(Lick that wine glass,
I want to see your tongue)

548
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:46,456
(Lean in more)

549
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:48,275
(Looks delicious, so am I)

550
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,237
(Did you go with a man?
I will kill you)

551
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,840
(So pretty, where is it?)

552
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:55,866
(I'm coming over today)

553
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,054
(Let's die together, wench)

554
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:02,039
(Why aren't you replying?)

555
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:03,724
It's him.

556
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:05,626
(Where are you?)

557
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,657
Lee must be the perp.

558
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:23,877
But why was the red envelope
in Holugi's home?

559
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:28,924
Wait, are they accomplices?

560
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,726
Who is it?

561
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:38,969
Who is it?

562
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:41,705
This is...

563
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:55,694
What the hell?

564
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:15,923
Help me!

565
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:32,205
I need help!

566
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:33,649
Mom! Mom!

567
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:10,118
Lee Jong-hak! Lee Jong-hak!

568
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:11,478
Lee Jong-hak!

569
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,231
Help me!

570
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,027
Detective! Det. Oh!

571
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:22,139
- It's them?
- Yes.

572
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:26,827
So one of the two
is Lee Jong-hak, the stalker,

573
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:29,680
and they killed Han So-ra,

574
00:41:29,747 --> 00:41:31,598
is that what you're saying?

575
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:33,767
Lee is a lunatic who stalks girls.

576
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,310
Seems to have a connection
with Holugi.

577
00:41:35,377 --> 00:41:36,311
Wait a minute.

578
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:40,757
Then why are Han's killers
after you?

579
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:44,224
Best friends?

580
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,738
Holugi was the one
who reported Han missing.

581
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:48,698
She couldn't reach
her best friend.

582
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:49,866
You believe that?

583
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:52,410
Why'd best friends
attack each other like that?

584
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,087
They sued each other
and fought like crazy.

585
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:56,165
If she's the suspect,

586
00:41:56,232 --> 00:41:58,550
why would she report Han?

587
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:02,154
That's too easy,
to evade suspicion.

588
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:04,364
Divert the investigation.

589
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,825
Be careful.

590
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:09,161
He might still be inside.

591
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,586
Be careful.

592
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,049
I'll turn on the light.

593
00:42:52,454 --> 00:42:54,539
Detective... that's...

594
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:19,381
Hi, I'm Detective Young-ju.
One body found.

595
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,579
Don't touch anything,
it's all evidence.

596
00:43:37,207 --> 00:43:39,359
Is that him? Lee Jong-hak,
the one you talked about.

597
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:43,797
His accomplice
must've killed him.

598
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:53,490
Hello?

599
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:56,077
One body found.
Come over.

600
00:43:56,144 --> 00:43:58,353
The victim's name is
Lee Jong-hak...

601
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,945
I said don't touch anything.

602
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:20,709
Mr. Koo.

603
00:44:21,543 --> 00:44:23,312
Didn't you say you were

604
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:25,547
at the office all day
on February 19th?

605
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:29,009
February 19...

606
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:31,553
I went out for lunch...

607
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:33,655
Why?

608
00:44:33,722 --> 00:44:34,824
Have you ever sneak into

609
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:36,683
Han's house when she's away?

610
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:40,161
Why are you asking me that?

611
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:42,314
Are you acquainted with
Mr. Lee Jong-hak?

612
00:44:42,856 --> 00:44:45,497
No, no, I don't know him.

613
00:44:45,564 --> 00:44:48,470
I first saw him on Han So-ra's
social media...

614
00:44:53,784 --> 00:44:56,469
This is a misunderstanding,
it's been doctored.

615
00:44:56,536 --> 00:44:57,257
That...

616
00:44:57,324 --> 00:44:58,967
It's been Photoshopped,
I don't know him!

617
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:01,557
Did you kill Han So-ra
and Lee Jong-hak, Mr. Koo?

618
00:45:01,624 --> 00:45:02,892
Why would I kill him?

619
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:05,437
If I did, why would I
bring you here?

620
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:06,563
That's easy,

621
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,754
to evade suspicion,
divert the investigation.

622
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:11,067
To make me into your witness.

623
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:12,485
Think rationally and logically,

624
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:15,031
you saw the security cam

625
00:45:15,098 --> 00:45:16,030
and the two accomplices.

626
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:18,367
One of them killed Lee

627
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:19,325
and is trying to frame me!

628
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:21,494
- I didn't kill...
- Are you framed for

629
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:22,796
breaking and entering her home?

630
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:30,303
Let's go talk at the station.

631
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:32,948
Come on, detective!

632
00:45:34,825 --> 00:45:36,114
It's not me, Detective!

633
00:45:47,587 --> 00:45:49,731
This is 911,
what is your emergency?

634
00:45:49,798 --> 00:45:52,734
A woman passed out,
she injured her head.

635
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:54,761
I'm at...

636
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:06,882
Young-seung!

637
00:46:16,658 --> 00:46:18,343
How's your head?

638
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,874
Is Koo's APB out?

639
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:23,023
Yes, his car is in the shop.

640
00:46:23,498 --> 00:46:24,849
He must've taken off on foot.

641
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:25,834
Victim ID?

642
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:27,611
Here.

643
00:46:29,462 --> 00:46:32,191
Lee Jong-hak, 30s, unemployed,

644
00:46:32,258 --> 00:46:33,592
he closed down his photo studio.

645
00:46:34,593 --> 00:46:36,369
He had a few reports on file.

646
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:40,406
- Stalking.
- Yes.

647
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:43,993
He paid some fine for
online stalking,

648
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,479
but do you know
who reported Lee for stalking?

649
00:46:47,188 --> 00:46:48,148
Han So-ra?

650
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:49,624
No.

651
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:50,734
Holugi.

652
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,377
Guys, it's blowing up.

653
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:55,923
So-ra trusted a realtor
with her key

654
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,465
before she went missing.

655
00:46:57,532 --> 00:46:58,926
Cops were suspicious

656
00:46:58,993 --> 00:47:00,927
and visited him too.

657
00:47:00,994 --> 00:47:03,304
What's even more dope is...

658
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:07,183
you know that biggest
online real estate blog?

659
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:11,087
There's a username
called "Ant Daddy",

660
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:13,924
I'll repay this favor,
Young-seung.

661
00:47:14,841 --> 00:47:17,197
There's a chance

662
00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:19,028
that Ant Daddy killed So-ra.

663
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:20,823
At the risk of getting sued
for defamation,

664
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,949
I'll reveal his identity.

665
00:47:23,016 --> 00:47:25,494
Those who entrusted their keys

666
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:26,786
to
Koo Jung-tae of Hanbit Realty,

667
00:47:26,853 --> 00:47:29,037
get your keys back ASAP.

668
00:47:29,104 --> 00:47:31,875
Detective, I'm sorry...

669
00:47:31,942 --> 00:47:34,611
Why did I flee...

670
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:38,907
I should've explained...

671
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:41,092
(Ant Daddy, is this for real?)

672
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,385
(Then Ant Daddy killed Han So-ra?)

673
00:47:42,452 --> 00:47:44,345
(He had that stone cold look)

674
00:47:44,412 --> 00:47:46,957
I'm so doomed, so doomed...

675
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,753
Detective!

676
00:47:52,624 --> 00:47:53,834
We got blood.

677
00:47:56,049 --> 00:47:58,468
(Lee Jong-hak)

678
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:08,328
Ma'am!

679
00:48:08,395 --> 00:48:09,579
Have you seen this man?

680
00:48:09,646 --> 00:48:11,165
I live here but found his ID,

681
00:48:11,232 --> 00:48:13,091
I'd like to return it to him.

682
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:16,027
Ma'am.

683
00:48:17,946 --> 00:48:22,826
I really have to
meet this person.

684
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,595
Could you try to remember?

685
00:48:25,662 --> 00:48:28,331
Have you seen him
in the neighborhood?

686
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,101
It's that place,
I saw girls come and go.

687
00:48:32,168 --> 00:48:33,737
- Just now too.
- Now?

688
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:35,797
Girls?

689
00:49:10,874 --> 00:49:14,924
(Haesol Charnel House-128)

690
00:49:19,964 --> 00:49:21,714
(Rest in peace
Bang Hye-sook)

691
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:38,734
Sir?

692
00:49:44,741 --> 00:49:48,244
See? Everything's fine.

693
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,038
Let's leave.

694
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:52,524
Let me have a moment alone.

695
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:57,562
I understand you,
but I could get fired.

696
00:49:57,629 --> 00:50:00,407
I have something
to say to my mom, please.

697
00:50:05,095 --> 00:50:07,372
- 5 minutes, okay?
- Thank you.

698
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:19,718
Sorry, mom.

699
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,469
Hey, hey! What was that?

700
00:50:29,536 --> 00:50:31,512
I didn't hear anything...

701
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:34,182
- What are you holding?
- Nothing...

702
00:50:34,249 --> 00:50:36,726
Wait a minute!

703
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:38,102
Sorry!

704
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:40,505
Stop right there! Stop!

705
00:50:41,756 --> 00:50:42,857
Damn it!

706
00:50:42,924 --> 00:50:44,592
- Stop, stop!
- I'm sorry.

707
00:50:45,426 --> 00:50:47,653
Hey, no! No!

708
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,113
No! Open this door!

709
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,765
Open up! You jerk!

710
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:54,269
You prick! Stop right there!

711
00:50:55,061 --> 00:50:57,917
Gosh. You jerk!

712
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:05,947
I'm sorry, mom.

713
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:19,961
Mom...

714
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:11,179
(If cops find your hideout,
it'd be bad, right?)

715
00:53:15,827 --> 00:53:18,512
Let me know when the blood
DNA analysis comes out.

716
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:19,664
Okay.

717
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,875
Excuse me.

718
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:26,337
Are you the cop in charge
of the Han So-ra case?

719
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:29,032
Yes, who are you?

720
00:53:29,757 --> 00:53:32,785
I'm her sister.

721
00:53:33,886 --> 00:53:37,531
I'm getting tons of scoops
about Ant Daddy.

722
00:53:37,598 --> 00:53:39,117
If he sues me for defamation,

723
00:53:39,184 --> 00:53:42,411
you guys have to help me fund it.

724
00:53:42,478 --> 00:53:43,496
I got a delivery.

725
00:53:43,563 --> 00:53:47,375
Today's eating stream
is mala chicken!

726
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:50,153
I'm coming, stop banging!

727
00:53:52,947 --> 00:53:53,714
Holugi!

728
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:54,991
Wait a minute.

729
00:53:55,908 --> 00:53:57,426
- Why did you do that to me?
- You're Ant Daddy, right?

730
00:53:57,493 --> 00:54:00,721
Why did you come after me?
Why me, damn it?

731
00:54:00,788 --> 00:54:03,641
I'm streaming,
we're live right now!

732
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,850
Guys, please call the cops!

733
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:06,361
You dug into my mother's ashes,

734
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:07,979
you call yourself human?

735
00:54:08,046 --> 00:54:09,630
Hey, don't touch that!

736
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:13,737
That's expensive!
Leave it alone!

737
00:54:13,804 --> 00:54:16,404
If you kill me too,
you're going straight to jail!

738
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:17,781
You went to Lee Jong-hak's home,

739
00:54:17,848 --> 00:54:18,906
did you kill Han So-ra?

740
00:54:18,973 --> 00:54:20,697
Why did you kill her? Why?

741
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:23,286
Wait, who did I kill?
You crazy jerk!

742
00:54:23,353 --> 00:54:24,604
Crazy jerk?

743
00:54:26,064 --> 00:54:27,398
Hold on!

744
00:54:28,107 --> 00:54:29,233
Speak up!

745
00:54:30,443 --> 00:54:31,361
I just...

746
00:54:31,694 --> 00:54:34,864
introduced Lee Jong-hak
to Han So-ra!

747
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,553
(Unblock)

748
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,537
(Unblock Bewithyou1984?)

749
00:54:43,915 --> 00:54:45,725
Lee stalked me for

750
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:47,835
a few months,

751
00:54:48,294 --> 00:54:50,771
I thought he was
going to kill me.

752
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:52,773
I felt bad for So-ra,

753
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,401
but introducing
her was the only way.

754
00:54:55,468 --> 00:54:56,819
That's all!

755
00:54:56,886 --> 00:54:57,887
(She wants to be friends,
but online first)

756
00:54:59,305 --> 00:55:01,741
I was afraid that
Lee harmed her,

757
00:55:01,808 --> 00:55:03,619
so I reached out to her,

758
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:05,770
and even reported her missing.

759
00:55:06,396 --> 00:55:07,271
You did?

760
00:55:08,648 --> 00:55:09,957
You were worried about her?

761
00:55:10,024 --> 00:55:11,460
You were going for her throat,

762
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:13,252
you sued each other!

763
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:14,654
Tell me the truth!

764
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:20,217
Dammit, she and I
schemed that together!

765
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:21,494
So-ra...

766
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:24,038
is a major psycho.

767
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:29,017
No wonder...

768
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:30,144
(Loan & repayment agreement)

769
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:33,147
My parents swore her off
for a reason.

770
00:55:33,214 --> 00:55:34,983
Because of her debt,

771
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,634
we've been in hiding for 4 years.

772
00:55:38,261 --> 00:55:42,515
So you disowned
her over money?

773
00:55:43,015 --> 00:55:44,394
You think we went overboard?

774
00:55:44,892 --> 00:55:48,813
My baby brother
has mental disability...

775
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:51,065
Do you know...

776
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:53,551
what that wench did for money?

777
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:56,672
People loved her more

778
00:55:56,739 --> 00:55:58,005
when I attacked her,

779
00:55:58,072 --> 00:56:00,466
and she gained Likes
with her angelic image.

780
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:01,967
And I'd take 20% cut.

781
00:56:02,034 --> 00:56:05,262
But she was unreachable
on my pay day.

782
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,139
I thought she ran off
with my money,

783
00:56:07,206 --> 00:56:09,004
but damn,
she went missing.

784
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:19,552
Look.

785
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:21,094
What about it?

786
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,032
This!

787
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:26,417
Where did you get that?

788
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,274
This! This! This!

789
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:32,916
These are yours,

790
00:56:32,983 --> 00:56:34,604
I knew you stored them here.

791
00:56:35,276 --> 00:56:36,364
These are So-ra's.

792
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:41,173
So-ra... What?

793
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,864
She pays me
in those envelopes.

794
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:49,482
They're So-ra's?

795
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:54,687
How did you know
these were here?

796
00:56:54,754 --> 00:56:56,384
Did you sneak into
my place too?

797
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:20,655
She...

798
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:37,321
Living my life isn't living.

799
00:57:38,172 --> 00:57:39,699
My life is screwed.

800
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:44,320
Are you out of your mind?

801
00:57:44,387 --> 00:57:45,696
I was loner from the beginning.

802
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:47,807
How could you sell
your brother?

803
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,826
He's your brother!

804
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:53,312
Everything's about other siblings.

805
00:57:54,021 --> 00:57:56,023
I'm never part of the equation.

806
00:57:57,817 --> 00:58:00,570
I really was going to
bring him back soon.

807
00:58:01,153 --> 00:58:02,764
Honestly, he wasn't injured.

808
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:06,492
Did I deserve this much
hate for it?

809
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,377
I was gonna put them in
a luxury nursing home

810
00:58:16,752 --> 00:58:18,237
when I get rich,
but nevermind.

811
00:58:20,715 --> 00:58:22,149
Forget this hillbilly town.

812
00:58:22,216 --> 00:58:23,301
Girls, go on.

813
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,653
Greet the gents.

814
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,199
Being poor is a crime,
cancer itself.

815
00:58:30,266 --> 00:58:32,077
She's learning the ropes,

816
00:58:32,144 --> 00:58:34,274
but you know, she's fresh!

817
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:41,844
Abandoned by her family,

818
00:58:42,445 --> 00:58:44,680
a poor girl who doesn't
belong anywhere.

819
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:52,480
Some said it gets better,

820
00:58:53,122 --> 00:58:55,233
and that this job
has some good sides too.

821
00:58:56,204 --> 00:58:57,443
Damn wench!

822
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:04,634
But in the end,

823
00:59:05,635 --> 00:59:06,903
people drag down those

824
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:08,888
who do not belong
in the same group.

825
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:19,023
(Drew blood:(
#hospital #pain)

826
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:30,324
Is there anyone
more miserable than me?

827
00:59:31,494 --> 00:59:33,496
What did I do so wrong?

828
00:59:33,996 --> 00:59:38,067
There's only one choice left.

829
00:59:45,884 --> 00:59:51,344
(Did you donate blood too?
You are so kind)

830
00:59:52,848 --> 00:59:55,976
(Blood donation campaign)

831
01:00:12,368 --> 01:00:14,979
Right, why should I die?

832
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,875
(Puppy rescue donation
surpasses $100,000!)

833
01:00:20,543 --> 01:00:22,770
I needed to create a new me.

834
01:00:22,837 --> 01:00:24,614
People favor those
who have changed.

835
01:00:26,298 --> 01:00:28,901
A girl, who used to decorate
herself

836
01:00:28,968 --> 01:00:30,953
with luxury goods,

837
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:35,327
receives enlightenment

838
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:37,814
and dedicates her life to a cause.

839
01:00:42,064 --> 01:00:43,424
Perfect So-ra.

840
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:46,402
Successful So-ra.

841
01:00:49,363 --> 01:00:52,700
Everything was a prep
for success.

842
01:01:04,295 --> 01:01:08,632
(I'd like to donate to your cause,
what's your bank info?)

843
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:20,728
(Seoul Volunteers Association)

844
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:26,064
People don't think too much
when judging others.

845
01:01:27,067 --> 01:01:29,862
Especially when they're
well-judged by others.

846
01:01:31,197 --> 01:01:32,364
($40,800
Funding complete)

847
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,124
If a despicable streamer
goes after me?

848
01:01:40,873 --> 01:01:42,766
I'll receive all the sympathy.

849
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,060
Even though they've never
talked to me,

850
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:48,105
they believe they know
everything about me.

851
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:50,174
Chauvinism at work.

852
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:05,123
I just had to count my money,

853
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,008
and get rid of the dogs.

854
01:02:11,111 --> 01:02:13,014
Until that jerk came along.

855
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:21,914
Tuna.

856
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:26,460
Come here.

857
01:02:48,357 --> 01:02:51,126
She was whining
with a bloody paw,

858
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:53,471
it broke my heart...

859
01:02:58,868 --> 01:03:00,928
I'm on the way to the vet.

860
01:03:00,995 --> 01:03:03,555
She normally doesn't
approach humans,

861
01:03:03,622 --> 01:03:06,292
she was whining
with a bloody paw...

862
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:30,299
He was there.

863
01:04:32,962 --> 01:04:34,046
He was

864
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:37,508
there every moment.

865
01:04:40,552 --> 01:04:41,954
What if he saw that too?

866
01:04:50,896 --> 01:04:53,174
What do I do, what do I do?

867
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,823
Too bad..

868
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:04,143
He should die!

869
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:20,134
First, I have to understand
his daily pattern.

870
01:05:21,301 --> 01:05:24,205
His habits, house passcode,
his routes,

871
01:05:24,763 --> 01:05:26,332
everything I can find out.

872
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:30,227
Use what I learned.

873
01:05:38,652 --> 01:05:40,721
Devious jerk...

874
01:05:49,163 --> 01:05:50,539
Happy?

875
01:05:57,379 --> 01:05:58,839
I can't do this
without an assistant.

876
01:06:00,674 --> 01:06:02,701
Someone who'll do anything
with a little affection.

877
01:06:04,344 --> 01:06:05,929
First part of the plan.

878
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,574
Walk past the convenience store
a day

879
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:10,251
before I go missing.

880
01:06:11,727 --> 01:06:13,187
Confirm the death pose.

881
01:06:14,313 --> 01:06:16,215
How do corpses lie down?

882
01:06:25,532 --> 01:06:27,614
The police need to find the blood,

883
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:29,979
so draw just enough.

884
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:33,454
Spill it appropriately,

885
01:06:37,002 --> 01:06:39,446
and make the rest,
like a movie protagonist.

886
01:06:40,672 --> 01:06:41,949
I just need to fool that jerk.

887
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,843
What if he reports?

888
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:06,056
There's no way he will.

889
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,218
He won't even touch me

890
01:07:09,285 --> 01:07:11,994
in fear of leaving traces of him.

891
01:07:28,554 --> 01:07:30,414
I almost died for real.

892
01:07:35,144 --> 01:07:37,271
And take my death photo.

893
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:42,793
My head looks huge.

894
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,278
(Delete photo?)

895
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,794
One more photo to freak him out.

896
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:07,275
No blood at first glance,

897
01:08:07,342 --> 01:08:09,634
but a few spots
when inspected closely.

898
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:35,664
What a goddamn psycho.

899
01:08:51,303 --> 01:08:52,913
Come back soon.

900
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,079
Then I need to methodically ruin

901
01:09:00,146 --> 01:09:01,814
everything he ever loved.

902
01:09:02,444 --> 01:09:03,944
Just like what he did to me.

903
01:09:10,697 --> 01:09:11,882
I need to frighten him...

904
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:13,954
Be careful! Watch out!

905
01:09:15,202 --> 01:09:16,912
But I can't kill him just yet.

906
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:25,145
Help me!

907
01:09:25,212 --> 01:09:29,783
Because he needs to
look like he killed himself.

908
01:09:31,424 --> 01:09:33,328
And I'll be found by the police,

909
01:09:33,804 --> 01:09:36,874
the perfect, beautiful victim.

910
01:09:40,227 --> 01:09:42,229
Lee Jong-hak!

911
01:09:44,773 --> 01:09:45,498
Help me!

912
01:09:45,565 --> 01:09:47,067
Lee Jong-hak?

913
01:09:49,111 --> 01:09:50,487
Dammit...

914
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:54,883
What do we do?

915
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:56,727
What am I supposed to do?

916
01:09:57,327 --> 01:10:00,497
That jerk knows who I am!

917
01:10:01,373 --> 01:10:03,125
Don't worry,

918
01:10:04,626 --> 01:10:07,562
we can stick to the plan
when he comes back.

919
01:10:07,629 --> 01:10:10,982
Stick to what plan?
He could go to the police!

920
01:10:11,049 --> 01:10:12,234
Damn, I knew this would happen,

921
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:14,203
I goddamn knew
it would not work!

922
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:18,957
Nothing in my life
ever goes right!

923
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:23,870
If I'm ever caught,
I'll spill everything.

924
01:10:23,937 --> 01:10:27,499
That you planned this,
and I was a pawn!

925
01:10:27,566 --> 01:10:29,551
I'll spill everything!

926
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:37,492
Baby,

927
01:10:38,452 --> 01:10:40,245
why are you so worked up?

928
01:10:40,787 --> 01:10:42,064
Come here.

929
01:10:42,581 --> 01:10:43,899
Come.

930
01:10:45,584 --> 01:10:46,960
Come here.

931
01:10:50,589 --> 01:10:52,966
You have me,

932
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:56,470
isn't that enough?

933
01:10:56,928 --> 01:11:00,432
Let's stop this revenge,

934
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,367
and come live with me.

935
01:11:02,434 --> 01:11:06,438
We'll have a good life.

936
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,607
Baby.

937
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,762
Don't you want to get back
at the jerk who ruined me?

938
01:11:15,947 --> 01:11:17,465
You said you loved me.

939
01:11:17,532 --> 01:11:20,227
I do, I love you so much...

940
01:12:18,677 --> 01:12:21,079
It's okay, there are other ways.

941
01:12:22,347 --> 01:12:25,267
(Get rid of accomplice)

942
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:43,744
See you soon, Koo Jung-tae.

943
01:12:52,794 --> 01:12:54,045
Hideout?

944
01:12:54,838 --> 01:12:56,006
Hideout...

945
01:13:02,929 --> 01:13:04,907
This is Dobong Police,
Criminal Affairs.

946
01:13:04,974 --> 01:13:06,958
Yes, I'm the detective in charge,
please go ahead.

947
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,187
What?

948
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:14,065
Yes, I see.

949
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:15,567
And your name?

950
01:13:19,696 --> 01:13:21,948
- Should I get Det. Oh?
- Get lost.

951
01:13:22,449 --> 01:13:25,660
It's So-ra's last known address,
check it out.

952
01:13:25,727 --> 01:13:26,803
(Music bar)

953
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:29,374
Why didn't you report it
even after she stole that much?

954
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:33,568
Money that she took off with

955
01:13:34,836 --> 01:13:38,632
was mainly made by
scheming with her.

956
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:43,224
So, she just took everything.

957
01:13:45,514 --> 01:13:47,117
You won't arrest me, right?

958
01:13:47,184 --> 01:13:48,375
Oh, yes.

959
01:13:49,518 --> 01:13:51,728
Was she close to anyone else?

960
01:13:53,855 --> 01:13:55,774
She had someone close?

961
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,774
Oh, you could say
she was closest to Hye-ran.

962
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:02,755
That's right!

963
01:14:02,822 --> 01:14:06,257
Back then, Hye-ran mentioned
something fishy about So-ra.

964
01:14:06,324 --> 01:14:08,553
Fishy? Like what?

965
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:11,164
Who knows, she disappeared.

966
01:14:13,544 --> 01:14:15,961
Who? Hye-ran?

967
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:19,130
She was all over the news,

968
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:20,949
the Mia district case last year.

969
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:26,237
The young karaoke singer
who went missing?

970
01:14:26,304 --> 01:14:27,363
Yeah.

971
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,575
Police were coming in and out

972
01:14:29,642 --> 01:14:32,037
getting witness testimonies.

973
01:14:32,104 --> 01:14:34,787
What about Han So-ra?
Was she interviewed as well?

974
01:14:34,854 --> 01:14:38,175
Sure, she was the last person
who talked to Hye-ran.

975
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:45,924
Yes, ma'am

976
01:14:45,991 --> 01:14:47,635
Hey, Han was the last person

977
01:14:47,702 --> 01:14:49,427
who talked to Cho Hye-ran.

978
01:14:49,494 --> 01:14:51,021
They've worked
in the same karaoke.

979
01:14:51,997 --> 01:14:52,597
What?

980
01:14:52,664 --> 01:14:55,266
She was released because
there wasn't a body,

981
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:56,727
but she was under
investigation for a long time.

982
01:14:56,794 --> 01:14:58,211
(Karaoke singer Cho Hye-ran
missing case)

983
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,322
Something's fishy, no?

984
01:15:01,047 --> 01:15:02,233
Why are you digging dirt

985
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,217
on the victim?

986
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:39,502
She found out about here?
She's so dead.

987
01:15:51,222 --> 01:15:53,433
Why are lights always
going out at my place?

988
01:16:00,482 --> 01:16:02,150
I can hear you breathing.

989
01:16:09,157 --> 01:16:10,283
Come out!

990
01:16:19,376 --> 01:16:20,585
Han So-ra!

991
01:16:22,295 --> 01:16:23,755
But why?

992
01:16:28,426 --> 01:16:29,886
Don't hit me!

993
01:16:34,516 --> 01:16:35,934
What's wrong with you?

994
01:16:48,029 --> 01:16:49,989
Why are you doing this to me?

995
01:16:54,619 --> 01:16:56,021
You saw everything.

996
01:16:57,497 --> 01:16:58,815
What? But...

997
01:17:02,293 --> 01:17:03,378
Over here!

998
01:17:04,337 --> 01:17:06,397
Please help me!

999
01:17:06,464 --> 01:17:08,842
What is wrong with you?

1000
01:17:12,554 --> 01:17:13,763
No!

1001
01:17:14,389 --> 01:17:15,224
Don't move!

1002
01:17:17,642 --> 01:17:18,947
Get up.

1003
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,495
Please help...

1004
01:17:20,562 --> 01:17:21,434
Get off of her!

1005
01:17:23,106 --> 01:17:24,232
Hands up!

1006
01:17:25,275 --> 01:17:26,668
Now!

1007
01:17:26,735 --> 01:17:28,486
You pervert...

1008
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:31,698
Don't move.

1009
01:18:00,852 --> 01:18:02,228
Koo Jung-tae!

1010
01:18:03,354 --> 01:18:04,606
Stop right there!

1011
01:18:06,441 --> 01:18:08,860
Open this door, you jerk!

1012
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,529
Open up, Koo Jung-tae!

1013
01:18:18,036 --> 01:18:18,886
What is it?

1014
01:18:18,953 --> 01:18:20,304
- Hey...
- Det. Oh!

1015
01:18:20,371 --> 01:18:21,973
- Easy, easy.
- Buddy!

1016
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:22,977
- You wench!
- Hey, hey!

1017
01:18:23,044 --> 01:18:24,308
This is my case!

1018
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,270
She returned unharmed,

1019
01:18:26,337 --> 01:18:27,424
who cares who did what?

1020
01:18:28,671 --> 01:18:31,065
You still let him slip through!

1021
01:18:31,132 --> 01:18:32,567
Did you cuff him properly?

1022
01:18:32,634 --> 01:18:34,361
You never check that

1023
01:18:34,428 --> 01:18:35,611
because you're strong!

1024
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:37,739
That's what caused this mess!

1025
01:18:37,806 --> 01:18:40,783
Chief, that blood found
at Han's house,

1026
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:43,746
the forensics say that much blood

1027
01:18:43,813 --> 01:18:45,413
from a head wound is fatal.

1028
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,458
But she came back alive!

1029
01:18:48,525 --> 01:18:50,126
Are you out of your mind?

1030
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:52,028
Now you're suspecting
the victim?

1031
01:18:52,362 --> 01:18:55,177
Chief, this needs to be
investigated further!

1032
01:18:55,244 --> 01:18:57,408
Look, just look at it!

1033
01:19:03,164 --> 01:19:05,187
This blood came from
Koo's shoes at his house.

1034
01:19:05,254 --> 01:19:08,424
It's Han's!
That's the smoking gun!

1035
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:12,940
Give this to the victim.

1036
01:19:13,007 --> 01:19:14,964
We just need to get Koo.

1037
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,553
Take it!

1038
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:26,078
He thought he could
seduce anyone,

1039
01:19:26,145 --> 01:19:27,790
he was like a dog in heat,

1040
01:19:27,857 --> 01:19:29,707
drooling while
looking at Han So-ra.

1041
01:19:29,774 --> 01:19:30,958
It was disgusting.

1042
01:19:31,025 --> 01:19:34,796
My hands and legs tremble
by thinking about it.

1043
01:19:34,863 --> 01:19:37,340
My voice trembles now.

1044
01:19:37,407 --> 01:19:39,384
Koo could've come into my room

1045
01:19:39,451 --> 01:19:42,270
while I was sleeping and peeped.

1046
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:50,487
I'm just thankful that
I came back alive...

1047
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,508
I'm so thankful,
I'm all right.

1048
01:19:56,301 --> 01:19:59,120
I keep getting teary
looking at the chat.

1049
01:20:00,184 --> 01:20:01,556
It's okay.

1050
01:20:03,975 --> 01:20:05,287
(Real Estate Academy)

1051
01:20:05,354 --> 01:20:08,788
(Who wants to go terror
Ant Daddy's office?)

1052
01:20:08,855 --> 01:20:12,275
(What if he's framed?
He's a really good man,)

1053
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:16,420
(very kind and friendly,)

1054
01:20:16,487 --> 01:20:17,797
(and very caring to his clients)

1055
01:20:17,864 --> 01:20:19,741
(Seemed like a good man...)

1056
01:20:24,162 --> 01:20:25,371
It's okay...

1057
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:28,983
Snap out of it, Jung-tae.

1058
01:20:40,094 --> 01:20:42,764
Detective, it's Koo Jung-tae.

1059
01:20:44,015 --> 01:20:45,533
I broke into other people's homes.

1060
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,407
(Pervert)

1061
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:48,044
I abused my job.

1062
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:53,458
I thought it wasn't wrong

1063
01:20:53,525 --> 01:20:56,653
if no one got harmed.

1064
01:21:02,533 --> 01:21:05,119
But now I get it.

1065
01:21:05,995 --> 01:21:07,830
I ruined everything.

1066
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:12,777
I think it was the sense of
superiority at first.

1067
01:21:13,294 --> 01:21:16,489
Knowing something
that others don't.

1068
01:21:17,966 --> 01:21:21,411
It's like peering into people
behind their masks.

1069
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:27,392
Wanting to be a member of
society who could help others,

1070
01:21:27,894 --> 01:21:31,814
my guilt slowly vanished,
I'm so sorry.

1071
01:21:33,272 --> 01:21:35,216
I'll be waiting for you.

1072
01:21:36,067 --> 01:21:38,170
Even if you arrest me,

1073
01:21:38,237 --> 01:21:40,863
I won't flee like last time.

1074
01:21:42,115 --> 01:21:44,976
But there's something
I have to tell you.

1075
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:49,765
You have every right to arrest me
on the spot,

1076
01:21:49,832 --> 01:21:51,207
but give me a chance,

1077
01:21:54,919 --> 01:21:57,380
I'll leave it up to you to decide.

1078
01:22:20,074 --> 01:22:24,194
(Thanks to your concern,
I'm discharging from hospital)

1079
01:22:26,617 --> 01:22:27,952
Let me check first.

(Ms. Han So-ra)

1081
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:54,270
What's that?

1082
01:22:58,733 --> 01:22:59,984
Something personal.

1083
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,628
Will you be okay here?

1084
01:23:02,695 --> 01:23:04,797
Yes, I'm comfy at home.

1085
01:23:04,864 --> 01:23:06,266
All right.

1086
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:15,683
My men are guarding front

1087
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:16,794
and back of the building.

1088
01:23:17,627 --> 01:23:19,104
If anything happens,

1089
01:23:19,171 --> 01:23:21,506
call me, I'll be around.

1090
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,634
Thank you for everything,

1091
01:23:25,576 --> 01:23:26,636
detective, I'll be okay.

1092
01:23:27,053 --> 01:23:28,053
Sure.

1093
01:23:52,411 --> 01:23:55,373
(Come to Lee's house
to get the photo back)

1094
01:24:40,501 --> 01:24:41,874
Where's the photo?

1095
01:24:44,755 --> 01:24:46,090
Where could it be?

1096
01:24:46,632 --> 01:24:48,301
You don't have it.

1097
01:24:48,759 --> 01:24:52,330
You got rid of it,
no chance that you still have it.

1098
01:24:53,014 --> 01:24:54,698
A chicken like you?

1099
01:24:54,765 --> 01:24:56,334
Why did you send it to me?

1100
01:24:57,143 --> 01:24:59,128
Your plan could've been ruined
if someone else saw it.

1101
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:02,590
It's fun.

1102
01:25:03,608 --> 01:25:05,927
You should've seen your face.

1103
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,679
Let me ask you something.

1104
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:11,994
Those puppies you
found homes for...

1105
01:25:13,492 --> 01:25:15,895
did you really get them adopted?
Or did you kill them?

1106
01:25:16,621 --> 01:25:17,954
I found it peculiar.

1107
01:25:18,623 --> 01:25:19,977
You were constantly
bringing puppies home,

1108
01:25:20,044 --> 01:25:22,668
but why were there
only 5 at home.

1109
01:25:23,794 --> 01:25:26,239
Puppies went up
but none came down.

1110
01:25:30,635 --> 01:25:33,121
Why were there so much
antifreeze at your home?

1111
01:25:37,642 --> 01:25:40,014
Did you really kill them all
to get donations?

1112
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:44,507
You never pitied them?

1113
01:25:46,901 --> 01:25:47,969
Pity?

1114
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:52,784
I'm the most pitiful of them all.

1115
01:25:56,327 --> 01:26:00,539
Did you think I had fun
killing them?

1116
01:26:03,501 --> 01:26:05,002
I cried too.

1117
01:26:06,045 --> 01:26:08,364
But there were too many
for me to handle.

1118
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:11,400
But I had to do something
for living. What could I do?

1119
01:26:11,467 --> 01:26:12,844
Christ...

1120
01:26:13,344 --> 01:26:15,163
Just say you were mistaken.

1121
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:17,807
Lee is the real perp,

1122
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:19,514
but framed me instead.

1123
01:26:23,312 --> 01:26:25,331
Then you'll get rid
of the photo?

1124
01:26:25,398 --> 01:26:27,209
You can stay as a victim,

1125
01:26:27,276 --> 01:26:29,793
and I'm a good Samaritan.

1126
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,237
Problems solved.

1127
01:26:33,572 --> 01:26:34,949
Why should I?

1128
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:37,894
You being dead would
solve everything.

1129
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,484
You up?

1130
01:26:53,551 --> 01:26:55,569
I wrote a suicide note for you.

1131
01:26:55,636 --> 01:26:56,988
Guilt drove you to suicide

1132
01:26:57,055 --> 01:26:59,265
at your accomplice's home,

1133
01:27:00,099 --> 01:27:02,018
and I'm an innocent victim.

1134
01:27:03,602 --> 01:27:04,879
You're amazing.

1135
01:27:07,982 --> 01:27:11,027
Why did you kill Lee?
Did he want to live with you?

1136
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:12,737
Lee Jong-hak?

1137
01:27:13,863 --> 01:27:15,337
You killed him.

1138
01:27:15,404 --> 01:27:16,716
None of this would've happened

1139
01:27:16,783 --> 01:27:18,017
if you didn't follow me.

1140
01:27:18,826 --> 01:27:20,719
It's all because of you.

1141
01:27:20,786 --> 01:27:22,138
If it wasn't for you,

1142
01:27:22,205 --> 01:27:24,857
I wouldn't
even say a word to that jerk.

1143
01:27:26,959 --> 01:27:30,564
If I didn't catch your lies,

1144
01:27:30,631 --> 01:27:32,673
you'd have continued

1145
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:36,884
to kill dogs and cats
and live off the donations.

1146
01:27:38,095 --> 01:27:39,038
You call that life?

1147
01:27:42,183 --> 01:27:44,418
You really got thick skin.

1148
01:27:48,314 --> 01:27:51,592
You lived like that too.

1149
01:27:52,693 --> 01:27:53,837
Did anyone know about you

1150
01:27:53,904 --> 01:27:56,530
peeping around like pervert?

1151
01:27:57,114 --> 01:27:59,092
You were also acting fake

1152
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:00,659
to only show your good side.

1153
01:28:03,788 --> 01:28:04,772
Okay.

1154
01:28:10,628 --> 01:28:13,614
So you did kill Lee?

1155
01:28:16,675 --> 01:28:17,618
Right?

1156
01:28:26,185 --> 01:28:27,336
You got something.

1157
01:28:33,234 --> 01:28:34,402
Dammit...

1158
01:29:05,182 --> 01:29:06,434
This was your plan?

1159
01:29:14,733 --> 01:29:16,878
I don't know who Lee Jong-hak is

1160
01:29:16,945 --> 01:29:18,387
and I didn't kill him.

1161
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:44,288
How long do you think
I stalked you?

1162
01:29:47,016 --> 01:29:49,118
Even if Han's DNA is
extracted here,

1163
01:29:49,185 --> 01:29:51,407
this is not an evidence
that she killed Lee.

1164
01:29:51,474 --> 01:29:55,627
If a woman was going to
kill a man in close range...

1165
01:29:55,694 --> 01:29:57,568
She probably kissed him?

1166
01:29:58,277 --> 01:29:59,111
Yes.

1167
01:29:59,528 --> 01:30:01,489
Lee wasn't the first one, right?

1168
01:30:02,615 --> 01:30:05,914
Have you seen Cho Hye-ran
around Han?

1169
01:30:06,827 --> 01:30:07,954
I've never seen her, why?

1170
01:30:08,287 --> 01:30:10,744
She was Han's colleague,
but she's currently missing.

1171
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:13,025
We haven't found her body yet,

1172
01:30:14,126 --> 01:30:17,571
but I'm 100% certain
this is related to Han So-ra.

1173
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,591
Who could be buried

1174
01:30:21,344 --> 01:30:22,927
in the Choan Mountain?

1175
01:30:24,929 --> 01:30:26,138
Cho Hye-ran?

1176
01:30:31,435 --> 01:30:34,371
What? Cho Hye-ran?

1177
01:30:34,438 --> 01:30:36,915
Who'll take the fall
for her death?

1178
01:30:36,982 --> 01:30:41,278
You think she was some
sympathetic, innocent victim?

1179
01:30:52,498 --> 01:30:55,017
I'll shut the hell up for $20,000.

1180
01:30:55,084 --> 01:30:58,112
Or I'll plaster all over social
media that you were a bar girl.

1181
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:01,816
She acted all friendly,

1182
01:31:01,883 --> 01:31:03,525
only to stab you in the back!

1183
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:05,786
People are putting you
on a pedestal, right?

1184
01:31:06,345 --> 01:31:08,389
You think they like you?

1185
01:31:08,889 --> 01:31:10,908
You're so naive.

1186
01:31:10,975 --> 01:31:14,562
They want you to fail
on the inside, you know that?

1187
01:31:14,879 --> 01:31:16,539
When I mention the bar,

1188
01:31:16,606 --> 01:31:18,624
they'll fill in the rest.

1189
01:31:18,691 --> 01:31:19,858
Should I do it?

1190
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:43,607
- Det. Oh!
- Yeah?

1191
01:31:43,674 --> 01:31:44,608
We got something.

1192
01:31:44,675 --> 01:31:45,926
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

1193
01:32:16,707 --> 01:32:18,876
You can't take pity on me?

1194
01:32:20,628 --> 01:32:23,634
You know all about me,
you understand me.

1195
01:32:24,465 --> 01:32:26,367
So look the other way
on this one, please?

1196
01:32:28,802 --> 01:32:30,679
You're just a psycho

1197
01:32:31,956 --> 01:32:32,957
who kills people.

1198
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:48,389
You and Cho Hye-ran
are the same.

1199
01:32:49,698 --> 01:32:52,726
You are all trash that
meddles with others' lives.

1200
01:32:54,578 --> 01:32:55,771
Just die.

1201
01:33:23,107 --> 01:33:24,709
I just need you gone,

1202
01:33:24,776 --> 01:33:26,126
you have to disappear!

1203
01:33:26,193 --> 01:33:27,386
Just you!

1204
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:32,284
Just need you gone!
Just disappear!

1205
01:33:32,658 --> 01:33:36,203
Die! Die! Die! Die!

1206
01:33:37,624 --> 01:33:38,430
Die! Die!

1207
01:33:38,497 --> 01:33:39,374
Han So-ra.

1208
01:33:43,754 --> 01:33:44,586
Get up.

1209
01:33:52,886 --> 01:33:54,471
What are you doing?

1210
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:56,406
Ms. Han So-ra.

1211
01:33:56,473 --> 01:33:58,447
You're under arrest
for the murder of Cho and Lee

1212
01:33:58,514 --> 01:34:00,961
and attempted murder
of Koo Jung-tae.

1213
01:34:01,979 --> 01:34:04,539
You're arresting me instead of
the suspect on the run?

1214
01:34:04,606 --> 01:34:06,124
I'm the victim.

1215
01:34:06,191 --> 01:34:07,109
Victim?

1216
01:34:09,528 --> 01:34:12,337
Mr. Koo, you're arrested for
break-and-enter,

1217
01:34:12,404 --> 01:34:14,199
larceny and evasion.

1218
01:34:14,783 --> 01:34:17,928
Why, why, why should I
be punished?

1219
01:34:17,995 --> 01:34:20,472
He's the one
who broke the law!

1220
01:34:20,539 --> 01:34:21,973
Koo Jung-tae, tell her!

1221
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:25,461
If you did not stalk me
none of this would've happened!

1222
01:34:28,797 --> 01:34:30,674
I'm sorry, So-ra.

1223
01:34:38,265 --> 01:34:39,558
Sorry?

1224
01:34:40,058 --> 01:34:41,769
You prick!

1225
01:34:42,227 --> 01:34:43,830
It's all your fault,

1226
01:34:43,897 --> 01:34:47,694
because of your eyes!

1227
01:35:22,726 --> 01:35:28,707
(1 year later)

1228
01:35:28,774 --> 01:35:30,759
Do you know
what's really scary?

1229
01:35:33,904 --> 01:35:36,173
When something
bad happens to you,

1230
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,299
(The fall of SNS star)

1231
01:35:37,366 --> 01:35:39,184
and you talk to people about it,

1232
01:35:39,993 --> 01:35:43,764
you think
they'd console you, right?

1233
01:35:43,831 --> 01:35:45,082
Not at all.

1234
01:35:46,333 --> 01:35:48,352
They just imagine

1235
01:35:48,419 --> 01:35:52,230
how bad
you have it and get curious,

1236
01:35:52,297 --> 01:35:53,940
(The fall of famous influencer)

1237
01:35:54,007 --> 01:35:55,133
that's all.

1238
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:59,279
You think people envy
those who are successful?

1239
01:35:59,346 --> 01:36:02,040
Inside, they want them
to fail, that's a human.

1240
01:36:08,522 --> 01:36:11,550
They're desperate to see me
in the worst possible light.

1241
01:36:13,443 --> 01:36:15,713
They just want to feel superior

1242
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:17,656
by seeing other people suffer,

1243
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,725
that's human nature.

1244
01:36:20,659 --> 01:36:22,427
Am I right?

1245
01:36:22,494 --> 01:36:23,604
Sure.

1246
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:27,165
How do you maintain
your physique in here?

1247
01:36:38,969 --> 01:36:40,596
Be well.

1248
01:36:41,054 --> 01:36:42,556
I got paroled.

1249
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:44,951
It's a system in which prisoners

1250
01:36:45,018 --> 01:36:46,627
with good behavior is released

1251
01:36:47,269 --> 01:36:49,129
before completion of a sentence.

1252
01:36:54,067 --> 01:36:55,794
(Thanks to your advice,
my home tripled in value!)

1253
01:36:55,861 --> 01:36:56,753
(Tell me when I should sell,
Ant Daddy!)

1254
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:58,004
(I'm desperately waiting for you)

1255
01:36:58,071 --> 01:36:59,698
It looks like my reputation

1256
01:37:00,557 --> 01:37:02,518
survived the ordeal.

1257
01:37:03,243 --> 01:37:04,703
I'm so glad.

1258
01:37:11,335 --> 01:37:12,586
Get off!

1259
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,229
Let's go.

1260
01:37:14,296 --> 01:37:15,781
Listen to me!

1261
01:37:16,506 --> 01:37:20,151
Take him away,
there you go.

1262
01:37:20,218 --> 01:37:21,470
Det. Oh!

1263
01:37:22,054 --> 01:37:22,971
Ma'am!

1264
01:37:23,764 --> 01:37:25,432
Good afternoon.

1265
01:37:26,099 --> 01:37:27,809
What brings you here,
Mr. Koo?

1266
01:37:28,477 --> 01:37:30,420
I was released today, so...

1267
01:37:31,939 --> 01:37:34,091
I wanted to speak to you.

1268
01:37:35,984 --> 01:37:39,346
You trusted me...

1269
01:37:44,493 --> 01:37:45,936
and listened to my story.

1270
01:37:47,287 --> 01:37:50,040
I could've been in real trouble,

1271
01:37:50,774 --> 01:37:51,984
but you saved me, thank you.

1272
01:37:54,628 --> 01:37:56,046
No need to thank me.

1273
01:37:56,755 --> 01:37:57,438
Pardon?

1274
01:37:57,505 --> 01:37:59,616
I was just doing my job.

1275
01:38:01,218 --> 01:38:03,787
I have to get back inside,
take care.

1276
01:38:05,597 --> 01:38:06,582
Detective.

1277
01:38:07,184 --> 01:38:10,310
Ma'am, have I done
something wrong to you?

1278
01:38:14,272 --> 01:38:16,650
Mr. Koo, you're not a victim,

1279
01:38:17,734 --> 01:38:19,386
you're a criminal, a stalker.

1280
01:38:20,074 --> 01:38:22,681
You think you received
all your punishment?

1281
01:38:24,741 --> 01:38:26,268
Open your eyes.

1282
01:38:27,327 --> 01:38:30,689
See what you did to
your own life.
