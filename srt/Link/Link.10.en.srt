LINK

2
00:00:16,623 --> 00:00:18,503
I came back because…

3
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:21,424
for some reason…

4
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:25,174
I had this strange feeling.

5
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:06,614
This isn't why I returned…

6
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:10,664
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:12,994
For what?

8
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:15,794
-What?
-What?

9
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:17,084
I mean…

10
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,044
What's there to be sorry about?
You did well.

11
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,174
-What?
-What?

12
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,424
I mean… The kiss was nice.

13
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:31,014
It was indeed nice. Well done.

14
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:31,824
<i>What's wrong? You know everything too.</i>

15
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:38,034
<i>When did I first come</i>

16
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:40,874
<i>into your life?</i>

17
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:46,134
<i>At times,
a memory hits you out of nowhere.</i>

18
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:50,504
<i>Just like right now.</i>

19
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,634
<i>We met</i>

20
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:37,184
<i>right in this alley a very long time ago.</i>

21
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:40,014
<i>Right here in this neighborhood.
Don't you remember?</i>

22
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,294
Dahyun, hurry up.

23
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:08,544
Lee Jingeun?

24
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,274
Dahyun, hurry up.

25
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:26,524
Wait for me!

26
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:33,194
<i>The moment I saw Jingeun and me as kids,</i>

27
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,284
<i>a memory hit me.</i>

28
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:53,214
<i>In my dream…</i>

29
00:05:57,974 --> 00:05:59,724
<i>I wasn't alone.</i>

30
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:03,144
What is this?

31
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:06,724
Why now?

32
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:10,984
<i>In what may have been
the happiest moment of my life,</i>

33
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:15,194
<i>the scariest memory resurfaced.</i>

34
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:44,474
Hello?

35
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,854
What's going on? Are you okay?

36
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,734
-What?
-Is everything okay?

37
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:56,074
Of course. Why wouldn't it be?

38
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:57,784
That's good.

39
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:01,324
Thanks.

40
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:04,284
But we just parted ways.
Isn't it too soon to call?

41
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:07,624
Well… That's not why I called.

42
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:08,544
<i>Then?</i>

43
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:11,374
Never mind.

44
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,084
It's fine as long as you're okay.

45
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,424
<i>-Good night.</i>
-Wait.

46
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:20,014
Can we talk until I get--

47
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,184
Can we talk until I fall asleep?

48
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:26,604
Sure.

49
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:28,514
You can talk.

50
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:30,524
Can you talk instead?

51
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:31,894
What…

52
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:34,694
should I say?

53
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:36,654
Anything.

54
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:39,404
Well…

55
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:42,784
I'm not the type who calls
without anything to say.

56
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:45,164
I don't think I've ever tried.

57
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:49,794
Then just keep the phone
next to your ear. Can you do that?

58
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:52,834
Sure. I can do that.

59
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,184
Are you still not sleepy?

60
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:13,394
I'm almost sleepy.

61
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,774
<i>Thanks to you, I'm not scared anymore.</i>

62
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:21,484
Are you in your room right now?

63
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,074
Yes. Why?

64
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,834
I think we can hang up now.

65
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:33,374
<i>Good night.</i>

66
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:34,914
Good night.

67
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:00,654
THE RED GATE

68
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:14,454
<i>Was it a lost memory or just a nightmare?</i>

69
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:18,584
<i>Lee Jingeun and I were there together.</i>

70
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,424
Hi, I'm Eun Gyeyoung.

71
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:22,594
GYEYOUNG

72
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:26,924
<i>Maybe I knew Gyeyoung from the start.</i>

73
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:29,184
<i>What's wrong? You know everything too.</i>

74
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:32,304
What is it that I know?

75
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:38,854
He could've been provoking me.

76
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:41,024
GYEYOUNG, RED GATE

77
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,734
Or…

78
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:47,784
<i>Could there be a link
between Gyeyoung's case and me?</i>

79
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:51,414
Forget it.

80
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:54,034
There's no solid proof
to back that up as of yet.

81
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:59,334
They said thinking too much
was harmful to your body.

82
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:07,094
Think about only the things
you know for certain, Dahyun.

83
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,764
The good things.

84
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,934
The good things.

85
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,794
<i>I thought about it all night long.</i>

86
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:47,174
EPISODE 10

87
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:49,264
Has he really been single all his life?

88
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:50,844
How is he so good?

89
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:53,934
-At what?
-Kissing.

90
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:57,354
-Who?
-Not just me, but him--

91
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:59,144
-What?
-What?

92
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:02,564
Who's the guy? Who's that good kisser?

93
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:04,024
It was in my dream.

94
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:05,484
Dream, my foot!

95
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,074
When you're desperate for something,
you dream about it.

96
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:09,824
Has that never happened to you before?

97
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,744
Don't try to shift focus on me.

98
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:17,124
-Answer me.
-Why won't you believe me?

99
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:19,584
-Would you if you were in my shoes?
-I would not--

100
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:23,624
Thank you for the meal.

101
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:25,424
Is it that chef?

102
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,134
That cocky guy? Over my dead body.

103
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:32,304
It's not him.

104
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:34,724
I better not catch you two!

105
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:38,064
Darn it. Why is this soup so salty?

106
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:39,354
You made it.

107
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,144
But why not?

108
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:46,444
So it is him.

109
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:48,694
No, it's not.

110
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:51,784
I just don't get it.

111
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:55,574
Why are you so against that?
What's your reason?

112
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,954
I told you. He's cocky.

113
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:03,214
-That's it?
-Yes.

114
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:24,644
What was that? What's wrong with her?

115
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:30,864
It's time to go to work.

116
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,904
Why is everything so rusty?

117
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:38,954
Expired in 2019?

118
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,494
I should give this to Mom.

119
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:52,004
One's hairstyle can make or break a look.

120
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:08,354
Sweatpants are a no-go.

121
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:10,614
Isn't this Mom's?

122
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,944
Pants. Skirt? Pants.

123
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:20,074
I would've had nothing to wear
if Eunjung didn't get me this.

124
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:24,084
You look so pretty. How soft.

125
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:27,214
Let's go!

126
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,314
LEE JINGEUN

127
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:49,484
You're here.

128
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:54,024
Hello…

129
00:13:59,034 --> 00:13:59,994
Hey--

130
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:01,454
Is your hand okay?

131
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:05,624
That was nothing.

132
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:12,044
<i>I think…</i>

133
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:15,304
We're really going to open
this time, right?

134
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:17,554
Yes, as long as
no one's wielding a knife again.

135
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,974
Don't say that.
I could really have a heart attack.

136
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:23,054
We won't be marketing on social media.

137
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:25,764
I don't want to grovel and give free food

138
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:28,564
to those so-called celebrities
just to promote our restaurant to say…

139
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:30,604
<i>He has chosen to run away.</i>

140
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:31,774
"That place is nice."

141
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:33,564
If not, who'll come all the way here?

142
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:35,944
All that we have here
is a hair salon, a hardware store,

143
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:37,824
a tacky restaurant with bad food--

144
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,284
I'm sorry.

145
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:43,454
Even those who enjoy
the retro vibe wouldn't come here.

146
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:44,624
How about we change the style…

147
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:47,044
<i>He must have no courage</i>

148
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:49,204
<i>to become happy.</i>

149
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,834
Then they'll come out of curiosity.

150
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,714
Where's my phone?

151
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,924
I'll call you.

152
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,344
Okay.

153
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,224
<i>And to him, I'm…</i>

154
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:08,064
<i>Stew Place?</i>

155
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:24,784
You look like a grandpa.

156
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,794
Are you finally back to work?

157
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,254
You looked so out of it.

158
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,504
Your mind was miles away.

159
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:37,794
I'm glad you're back.

160
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:40,384
You shouldn't abuse your paid vacation.

161
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:43,014
Then you should hurry up and open--

162
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,144
You couldn't because of me.

163
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:50,854
By the way,

164
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:54,564
have you heard
about Lee Jingeun's whereabouts?

165
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:59,444
Seeing how the police
are still looking for him,

166
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:01,404
he must be in hiding once again.

167
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:04,784
There are only two possibilities.

168
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,534
Either he's hiding,
or something happened to him.

169
00:16:08,624 --> 00:16:10,584
I'm with someone right now.

170
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,714
I coincidently ran into this person
after such a long time.

171
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,254
This person has a question for you.

172
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:17,674
Eun Gyehoon,

173
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:21,134
how is your father?

174
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:23,174
What do you mean?

175
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,884
What could've happened to him?

176
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,514
I'm just saying we need to find him soon.

177
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:30,644
Hey, Chef Lee.

178
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,894
What is this dog doing here?

179
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:35,814
-Are you guys raising him here?
-Yes.

180
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,904
It just barged in here like someone.

181
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:40,024
Does it have a name?

182
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:42,654
Not yet. How about Sta?

183
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:45,364
-Sta? How adorable.
-And its surname, Pa.

184
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:47,164
In Korean, it's Pa Sta.

185
00:16:47,244 --> 00:16:48,824
In English, that's Sta Pa.

186
00:16:48,914 --> 00:16:51,124
Sta Pa. Pa Sta.

187
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,164
I like that, but any other names?

188
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:54,454
Gaehoon.

189
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,924
Not "gye", but "gae".

190
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,754
"Gae". Gaehoon.

191
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:17,234
Why are you so mad?

192
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:19,524
Mad? Who me?

193
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:21,904
Gaehoon?

194
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:24,654
She wanted to hear suggestions,
so I gave her one.

195
00:17:31,914 --> 00:17:34,914
Don't just stand there. Talk.
I already know everything.

196
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:37,624
What do you mean?

197
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:41,674
You rejected me once again.

198
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:46,804
Option one.
I'll brush it off and let you go.

199
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:50,344
Option two. I'll curse you
for being a coward after kissing me.

200
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:51,724
What's your pick?

201
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:55,144
There's also option three.
I'll spray you with this.

202
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,224
Wait.

203
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:58,444
It's definitely not option three.

204
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:02,864
I should've just hit you first
and rejected you.

205
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:06,784
What can you do?

206
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:10,864
You don't dare to be happy
because you feel bad for your family.

207
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,664
So just be a coward and run away.

208
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,624
So you know that I'm a coward.

209
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,164
I've known that for a while now.

210
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:28,724
As you know,

211
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:31,724
I came here to find my dad.

212
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:36,264
"What in the world happened to him

213
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:40,024
and my sister?"

214
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:41,774
Finding out the answer

215
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,944
was going to be my top priority.

216
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,654
And I had no intention
of becoming close to anyone.

217
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,824
However, something unpredictable happened.

218
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:01,964
You came into my life.

219
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:05,794
You'll still see the coward in me

220
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,594
from time to time.

221
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,934
I'll probably think
about my family and feel guilty

222
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:14,894
whenever I eat something tasty
or go somewhere nice.

223
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:16,814
But…

224
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:20,564
I'll try my best

225
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:24,484
not to feel that way
or make it so obvious.

226
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:28,074
If you're okay with that…

227
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:35,164
Then I'll continue

228
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:38,374
to make delicious food

229
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,124
for you.

230
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,054
You call that a love confession?

231
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:56,184
You kept frowning
and avoiding eye contact,

232
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:58,184
so I thought
you were pushing me away again.

233
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,564
That was because Jinhoo was there.

234
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:03,774
I was embarrassed.

235
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:05,524
Plus…

236
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:07,114
Plus?

237
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:09,654
You're quite…

238
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:14,284
beaming today.

239
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:21,544
You do have good taste.

240
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:31,134
I accidentally cut off a leaf.

241
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:33,724
It's okay.

242
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:35,134
It's for you.

243
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:42,064
Have you smelled lavender before?

244
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:44,064
<i>Once spring came into my life…</i>

245
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:45,814
Should I cut that too?

246
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:47,984
<i>It was spring in the world as well.</i>

247
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:23,184
That's hot.

248
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,514
<i>Let me tag along and work out with you.</i>

249
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,434
What if that fridge guy comes back?

250
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,024
He's in hiding right now.

251
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:09,394
Hiding?

252
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:11,314
Yes. It's a long story.

253
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:15,534
And you know what?

254
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,244
I'm going to dig into it.

255
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:18,574
Dig into what?

256
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:20,614
My nightmare.

257
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:26,374
Letting my imagination run wild

258
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:29,004
makes me want to run away
in fear even more.

259
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,584
I'm done with that.

260
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:34,044
I'm going to take the bull by the horns
and see if it's real or not.

261
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:37,304
-Go on.
-Okay. I'll be back later.

262
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:39,724
-All right.
-Bye!

263
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,050
It looks similar.

264
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,480
It's not this one.
It's the wrong color too.

265
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,030
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

266
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,330
Goodbye.

267
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,540
I heard

268
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,790
you were the last person
to see Gyeyoung alive.

269
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,540
I was waiting for you to recognize me.

270
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,550
-We met when you were a kid.
-I know.

271
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,090
I guess you didn't come here for the fish.

272
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,970
Not the only reason, I guess.

273
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,760
If it's all right with you,
could you tell me what happened?

274
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,100
-Well--
-I'm busy today.

275
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,730
Do I need to wait for long?

276
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,270
I wouldn't let a valuable customer wait.

277
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,860
I'll stop by your restaurant later.

278
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,820
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

279
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,570
What would you like?

280
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,450
-I'd like a flatfish.
-Sure.

281
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,450
LEE JINGEUN

282
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,880
<i>The call can't be connected.
Transferring to voicemail…</i>

283
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,380
Grocery shopping?

284
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,430
Yes. Were you exercising?

285
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,720
-Yes.
-I see.

286
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,230
You're smiling from ear to ear.

287
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,360
That can't be.

288
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,530
You're the one
with a big smile on your face.

289
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,030
Really?

290
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Let's go.

291
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,000
It's finally spring.

292
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,580
You're right. It is.

293
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,760
The weather is lovely.

294
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,010
You're right.

295
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,430
It's lovely.

296
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,540
Dahyun, can you hand me the sugar?

297
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,970
-Dahyun, can you put this in the oven?
-Sure.

298
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,240
I'll upload them
to our restaurant's social media.

299
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,740
Stop taking photos and have a bite.

300
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,580
Okay.

301
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,880
Is it just me, or do we keep adding
sweet desserts to the menu?

302
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,800
I think it's just you.

303
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,390
Are you guys seeing each other?

304
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,760
-Yes.
-No.

305
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,810
Then are you official?

306
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,890
-Yes.
-No.

307
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,980
Aren't you guys leaving?

308
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,730
Why is no one leaving?

309
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,860
Jeez. Are you waiting for me?

310
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,820
Let's go.

311
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,620
Gyehoon, want to grab a drink?

312
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,660
Then we should hurry.

313
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,910
The bars close early these days.

314
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,460
Follow me.

315
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,670
Where?

316
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,180
We need to go.

317
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,930
-Where?
-Anywhere.

318
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,510
-But I live here.
-Just follow me.

319
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,980
How could you say that we're official?

320
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,940
What? You were the first one
to admit that we were seeing each other,

321
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,070
so I thought we could.

322
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,860
I was only trying to cover up
a bigger lie with a small one.

323
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,860
Seeing each other and being official
are totally different.

324
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,240
Everything you say is a lie--

325
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,580
Let's just tell everyone--

326
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,670
No. Never.

327
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,840
It'd be a headache if my mom finds out.
You know that, right?

328
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,490
Thanks.

329
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,420
-Have some coffee.
-Thanks.

330
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,710
It's been a while
since I got a part-time translating gig.

331
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,340
Then I won't bother you.

332
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,510
This is a raspberry tart.

333
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,760
And this is
a lemon madeleine with icing on top.

334
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,850
And this one is custard cream.

335
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,850
I like it.

336
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,980
How does it taste?

337
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,740
Are you eating well on time?

338
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,960
I'm going to stop by and check
if you've been having my side dishes.

339
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,170
What about your medication?
Make sure you take them on time too.

340
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,800
Why would you be sorry, Mom?

341
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm the one who should apologize.

342
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,140
Why are you crying again? Please don't.

343
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,490
What's with that deep sigh? What's wrong?

344
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,320
It's about Eun Gyehoon.

345
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,330
I'm not comfortable about how
he and Dahyun are close.

346
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,410
What if…

347
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,540
Never mind.

348
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,630
Everything will go the way it should.
There's nothing we can do.

349
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,380
Then what's wrong with you?

350
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,220
You were dancing halfheartedly back there.

351
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,030
Mom.

352
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,570
What?

353
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,700
Be honest with me.

354
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,660
You're concerned too, aren't you?

355
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,430
What are you doing?

356
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,430
You startled me.

357
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,060
-What's that?
-It's nothing.

358
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,730
Are you coming back from aerobics?

359
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,940
Yes.

360
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,320
Jeez. I told you
not to carry around tools.

361
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,410
Oh, this? This isn't a tool.

362
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,510
What's this for?

363
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,880
I finally found out

364
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,260
the reason why you two
were carrying around those tools.

365
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,140
So a guy was stalking Dahyun?

366
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,640
Had I known sooner,
I wouldn't have scolded you so much.

367
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,600
I would've taken measures as well.

368
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,900
Took you long enough.

369
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,360
How would I have known
when you didn't report it to us?

370
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,530
It's so good.

371
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
It's so fresh.

372
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,790
-Eat up, Mom.
-Okay.

373
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,120
Is this a token of your apology?

374
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,170
Thank you.

375
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,300
What is this?

376
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,220
I understand your situation,

377
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,140
but it's still illegal
to carry around those tools.

378
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,600
Put them around your necks.

379
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,610
What do I do with this?

380
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,400
Blow it whenever
you feel you're in danger.

381
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,950
I'll run over to you whenever
and wherever you are.

382
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,670
So you'll come if we blow this whistle?

383
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,000
Really?

384
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,960
Come here. Right now.

385
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,510
-Get ready.
-Thanks for the laugh.

386
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,340
I'm serious here, you know?

387
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,180
Thanks. I mean it.

388
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,390
Thank you more for the sushi.

389
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,240
Our food costs shouldn't exceed 20%.

390
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,860
You've been consistently exceeding
your initial budget.

391
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,490
Even if you have sufficient funds--

392
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,030
LEE JINGEUN

393
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
One minute.

394
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,550
What is this? Is this really your phone?

395
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,140
There's no lock on the phone
or any saved numbers.

396
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,640
What's that phone for?

397
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,930
-Don't you have any friends?
-Where did you find this?

398
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,850
In a corner of some alley.

399
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,850
Here. Sign this, and you can go.

400
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,900
-Which alley?
-Does that matter?

401
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,480
It does.

402
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,780
It was near the cart bar. Happy?

403
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,750
-What are you doing?
-It's not mine.

404
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,540
Hey--

405
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,130
We need to talk.

406
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,540
-No, thank you.
-It's important.

407
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,760
Officer Ji.

408
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,760
Han Se--

409
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,900
I'll come by later. Okay?

410
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,580
What happened? Did you find it?

411
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,120
It was a lost phone.

412
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,750
Lost?

413
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,040
The phone was reset
to factory settings and discarded.

414
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,130
That means…

415
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,050
He didn't lose it. He threw it out.

416
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,720
It'll be even more difficult
to locate him.

417
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,230
Gosh, how pretty.

418
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,230
I dragged you here
so you could get some fresh air.

419
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,990
-Me?
-Yes.

420
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,400
You've been looking troubled all day.

421
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,070
Have I?

422
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,700
What's wrong?

423
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,290
Well, you see…

424
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,380
There's something that only I can do.

425
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,750
However,

426
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,170
I don't think I should.

427
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,840
I don't know what to do,
so I'm in a dilemma.

428
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,180
What is it?

429
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,930
You don't need to tell me
if you don't want to.

430
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,360
Let's talk on the way.

431
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,710
That was Lee Jingeun's phone.

432
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,710
And he's nowhere to be found.

433
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,630
So?

434
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,630
We need to check all CCTVs and dashcams
around the area where the phone was found.

435
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,220
-What?
-He met someone afterward

436
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
and disappeared on the night we all met.

437
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,220
I think…
No, I'm sure that person is the culprit.

438
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,270
So…

439
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,730
So you want me to catch that individual?

440
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,980
First of all, it's illegal
to check the CCTV without a warrant.

441
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,610
But sure, I could still check them
if I really wanted to. But…

442
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,580
I don't want to.

443
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,540
I don't care
about what happened in the past.

444
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,420
And I most definitely
don't want to get involved with you again.

445
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,170
When will you stop running away?

446
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,890
-What?
-How long will you remain a coward?

447
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,890
-You know nothing.
-Then what do you know?

448
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,850
Just come with me
and find out for yourself

449
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,480
about what happened

450
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,820
to Mr. Han Euichan, your dad,

451
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,280
eighteen years ago.

452
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,750
<i>Perhaps…</i>

453
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,960
Call me.

454
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,420
<i>…I could find Jingeun.</i>

455
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,430
DO YOU REMEMBER?

456
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,020
YOU TOLD ME TO REACH OUT TO YOU,
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. CALL ME

457
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,860
NEW POST

458
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,700
No.

459
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,240
DELETE

460
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,750
I'm here to meet Chef Eun Gyehoon.

461
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,960
He's away at the moment.

462
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,590
I have a favor.

463
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,050
Could you relay this message to him?

464
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,640
I don't think
I can bear telling him this in person.

465
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:09,100
I may have made a huge mistake.

466
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:18,394
Eun Gyehoon, who do you think you are
telling me to come and go…

467
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:22,274
What?

468
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:24,314
Why is he here?

469
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:33,194
I have some questions
about Mr. Han Euichan's case.

470
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,404
I was wondering why you called.

471
00:40:35,954 --> 00:40:38,244
I fully understand

472
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:41,294
why you think
he's the culprit and resent him.

473
00:40:41,374 --> 00:40:42,584
No, it's actually the opposite.

474
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:45,504
I don't think it was him.

475
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:47,374
What?

476
00:40:54,844 --> 00:40:58,644
First and foremost,
I don't think he did it either.

477
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,144
Why?

478
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:04,474
Why do you think that way?

479
00:41:06,024 --> 00:41:07,234
I have one question.

480
00:41:08,444 --> 00:41:09,774
What is he doing here?

481
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:18,454
I'd appreciate it
if you could just answer.

482
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:30,214
Eighteen years ago,

483
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:33,504
we believed the culprit
must've known your sister.

484
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:36,844
So we interrogated everyone who knew her.

485
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:39,224
And Mr. Han was one of them.

486
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:42,894
He was her piano teacher after all.

487
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,984
Then we received two crucial statements.

488
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:49,144
One statement

489
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:52,654
was from a boy who saw
his dad washing bloody clothes.

490
00:41:53,774 --> 00:41:54,984
The other statement

491
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:58,824
was from an individual
who last saw Gyeyoung.

492
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:04,034
I was

493
00:42:05,244 --> 00:42:07,164
the last person

494
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,254
to see Gyeyoung alive.

495
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:30,854
<i>I told the police that I saw her
going into Mr. Han's car.</i>

496
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:34,154
But to be frank, I wasn't sure

497
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:38,784
whether she did step into his car

498
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:40,704
or not.

499
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:43,624
Then why did you say that?

500
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:52,004
That was because…

501
00:42:57,594 --> 00:42:59,174
You need to be exact.

502
00:42:59,264 --> 00:43:02,634
Your words could either
put him behind bars or acquit him.

503
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:07,064
Did Gyeyoung
get into Euichan's car or not?

504
00:43:08,894 --> 00:43:10,144
Answer me!

505
00:43:14,064 --> 00:43:17,944
<i>And that's how
he became the prime suspect.</i>

506
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:20,744
<i>So we arrested him.</i>

507
00:43:24,324 --> 00:43:27,494
He denied the charges.
He claimed he never put her in his car

508
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,294
or took her with him.

509
00:43:30,704 --> 00:43:32,124
And like he said,

510
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:35,464
we couldn't find her DNA in his car.

511
00:43:35,544 --> 00:43:39,254
The only other lead we had
was the bloody clothing.

512
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:44,554
But he had thrown it away.

513
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:48,434
We were never able to find it.

514
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:51,354
So we asked him about that blood.

515
00:43:51,934 --> 00:43:52,854
"Whose blood was it?

516
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:55,234
Why did you throw it away?"

517
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:57,234
But he remained tight-lipped.

518
00:43:58,114 --> 00:43:59,734
Then later on,

519
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:02,784
we found out what he was up to that day.

520
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:11,124
His piano academy wasn't doing too well.

521
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,604
JAWS ROOM CLUB

522
00:44:42,654 --> 00:44:45,614
-Hello, I'll be serving you today.
-Hey.

523
00:44:45,704 --> 00:44:48,914
-Let's hear some music.
-Go on and sing a song.

524
00:45:02,254 --> 00:45:05,304
<i>He refused to tell us
due to his reputation as a teacher.</i>

525
00:45:07,014 --> 00:45:09,144
He was embarrassed
about working at a karaoke bar.

526
00:45:09,804 --> 00:45:11,144
He was humiliated.

527
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:14,144
But how could he choose that
over being acquitted?

528
00:45:18,274 --> 00:45:19,404
Then what about

529
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:23,194
the bloody clothing that he had?

530
00:45:23,784 --> 00:45:26,534
It's obvious.
He had fought with a customer.

531
00:45:28,114 --> 00:45:30,954
But he couldn't prove it
because too much time had passed.

532
00:45:31,034 --> 00:45:32,584
No one could testify for him.

533
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:34,624
You found nothing in his car,

534
00:45:34,704 --> 00:45:36,504
and his alibi checked out.

535
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:39,334
Then why is he still being treated
as if he's guilty?

536
00:45:41,754 --> 00:45:43,304
People's impressions of others

537
00:45:43,384 --> 00:45:46,384
don't change that easily.

538
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:49,384
Who'd be understanding of a man
who had once been arrested

539
00:45:49,474 --> 00:45:50,764
as a murder suspect?

540
00:45:50,844 --> 00:45:52,224
He should've been vindicated.

541
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:55,434
If you were a true police officer,

542
00:45:55,524 --> 00:45:57,684
you should've told everyone
that he was innocent

543
00:45:57,774 --> 00:45:59,904
and that the police had made a mistake.

544
00:45:59,984 --> 00:46:01,024
I tried.

545
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:05,444
I tried to get him back on his feet.

546
00:46:06,654 --> 00:46:07,824
Darn it!

547
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:12,454
I'm telling you!
Han Euichan is the killer!

548
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:18,334
We had to let go of that cunning scumbag

549
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:21,584
because he had gotten rid of all evidence.

550
00:46:21,794 --> 00:46:23,084
But just wait and see.

551
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,504
I'll catch him at all costs!

552
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:28,804
That's how rumors are.

553
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:32,724
The more widespread it is,
the stronger their impression

554
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,724
of him becomes.

555
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:38,894
Hey, what's your deal today?

556
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:43,944
What's with him?

557
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:46,194
That's Han Sejin.

558
00:46:47,694 --> 00:46:49,194
Mr. Han's son.

559
00:46:49,784 --> 00:46:51,454
What? Officer Ji?

560
00:47:26,364 --> 00:47:27,404
Let's go, Sejin.

561
00:47:52,344 --> 00:47:54,304
Ji Wontak!

562
00:47:56,394 --> 00:47:58,644
Let me go. Let go!

563
00:47:58,724 --> 00:47:59,764
What will you do?

564
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:01,894
What are you trying to do?

565
00:48:02,524 --> 00:48:06,104
I'm going to kill Chief Seo myself.

566
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:09,524
What? Can't I?

567
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:11,324
Hey.

568
00:48:12,904 --> 00:48:14,654
You know that's ridiculous, right?

569
00:48:15,244 --> 00:48:16,364
Do you know

570
00:48:17,824 --> 00:48:19,334
what kind of life I've had?

571
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:24,044
Do you know how I've been treating him?

572
00:48:25,794 --> 00:48:27,504
Do you know…

573
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:32,514
how miserable his life has been?

574
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:34,764
Do you?

575
00:48:39,394 --> 00:48:41,644
I won't let this slide.

576
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:43,484
Step aside.

577
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:46,064
-I can't.
-Move.

578
00:48:48,194 --> 00:48:50,234
Don't do anything you'll regret, okay?

579
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:51,864
Regret?

580
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,074
Regret…

581
00:48:55,154 --> 00:48:56,994
What do you know? Tell me.

582
00:48:57,494 --> 00:48:59,284
What makes you think you can say that?

583
00:48:59,374 --> 00:49:02,414
-What do you know?
-I know one thing for sure!

584
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:06,664
You still have a chance.

585
00:49:07,124 --> 00:49:07,964
What?

586
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:10,594
You can still apologize.

587
00:49:12,504 --> 00:49:16,884
You can still say that you're sorry
and ask for your dad's forgiveness.

588
00:49:18,304 --> 00:49:19,554
You can do that.

589
00:49:25,604 --> 00:49:26,684
As for me…

590
00:49:30,774 --> 00:49:32,734
I really want to do that as well.

591
00:49:35,114 --> 00:49:38,114
But I can't. It's too late.

592
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:44,334
But you still have time.

593
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:51,924
Do you volunteer
to do duty often these days?

594
00:49:52,254 --> 00:49:55,264
Yes, I'm lonely, have a lot of free time,
and want more money.

595
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:56,594
Should I go on?

596
00:49:58,134 --> 00:50:00,184
No, ma'am. That's enough.

597
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:03,434
Why doesn't anyone
want to hang out with me?

598
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:09,524
I'm busy.

599
00:50:11,354 --> 00:50:13,694
-Let's park here tonight.
-Yes, ma'am.

600
00:50:18,824 --> 00:50:22,284
Look at that.
Who'd throw away such an expensive piano?

601
00:50:22,374 --> 00:50:24,284
No one would take that.

602
00:50:24,374 --> 00:50:27,044
-The owner had to pay to dispose of it.
-Right.

603
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:29,164
Let me stop by the restroom.

604
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,374
-Enjoy your time.
-Thank you.

605
00:51:07,204 --> 00:51:10,044
THE PIANO ON THE LAKE

606
00:51:55,424 --> 00:51:59,504
What was that last melody?

607
00:52:00,214 --> 00:52:01,304
I guess it's just

608
00:52:02,844 --> 00:52:03,844
a memory.

609
00:52:11,314 --> 00:52:12,484
Ji Wontak?

610
00:52:16,154 --> 00:52:19,074
Speak of the devil. I was just thinking--

611
00:52:20,194 --> 00:52:22,244
No, I wasn't thinking of you.

612
00:52:22,324 --> 00:52:26,034
I was contemplating music and art.

613
00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:30,994
Wontak.

614
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:35,164
Is everything okay?

615
00:52:39,964 --> 00:52:40,884
I'm glad you're here.

616
00:52:44,424 --> 00:52:47,514
I actually wanted to see you.

617
00:52:48,184 --> 00:52:50,814
What's wrong? What's going on?

618
00:52:58,864 --> 00:53:00,154
Let's stay like this for a while.

619
00:53:39,904 --> 00:53:41,864
He's still not home.

620
00:53:42,734 --> 00:53:43,824
I'm here.

621
00:53:46,744 --> 00:53:47,744
What?

622
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:55,084
Why are you sitting here?

623
00:54:13,394 --> 00:54:15,854
Did something happen?

624
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,274
Yes. Something did.

625
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:21,854
Is it about--

626
00:54:23,444 --> 00:54:25,024
It's not about Lee Jingeun.

627
00:54:25,614 --> 00:54:26,784
Then who?

628
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:29,574
My heart breaks

629
00:54:30,494 --> 00:54:32,164
for a childhood friend of mine.

630
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:36,794
By the way,

631
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:39,334
you dropped the honorifics.

632
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:45,554
Do you dislike it?

633
00:54:46,634 --> 00:54:47,924
No.

634
00:54:48,014 --> 00:54:50,094
I was going to do it gradually.

635
00:54:51,594 --> 00:54:52,764
But I couldn't.

636
00:54:54,184 --> 00:54:55,394
Let's just drop it right now.

637
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:58,474
Let's use honorifics at work

638
00:54:58,564 --> 00:55:01,024
and drop them once we clock out.
What do you say?

639
00:55:01,984 --> 00:55:03,104
Okay.

640
00:55:03,864 --> 00:55:04,774
I like that.

641
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:08,194
I like that you like it.

642
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:26,544
What could've happened? I'm worried.

643
00:55:32,474 --> 00:55:34,554
I'm worried but…

644
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:39,564
He dropped the honorifics.

645
00:55:43,604 --> 00:55:46,024
How is he so good at dating
when I'm his first girlfriend?

646
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,944
What if I'm not?

647
00:55:52,284 --> 00:55:54,284
Thinking about it kept me up all night.

648
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:57,074
Having butterflies isn't always good.

649
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,544
How exhausting.

650
00:56:01,664 --> 00:56:04,214
-Did something else happen in your dreams?
-What?

651
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,294
Nope.

652
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:08,464
Why are you smiling like that?
Are you a pervert?

653
00:56:08,544 --> 00:56:12,724
Mom, I'm not perverted. I'm unpredictable.

654
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:16,144
Unpredictable? What is she spewing?

655
00:56:16,554 --> 00:56:20,264
She's unpredictably perverted
just like you.

656
00:56:24,644 --> 00:56:25,984
Jogging again?

657
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:28,614
Of course. I need to get
to the bottom of this.

658
00:56:29,024 --> 00:56:31,324
-Bye.
-Be careful.

659
00:57:14,694 --> 00:57:17,414
I haven't seen a single red gate yet.

660
00:57:24,004 --> 00:57:25,964
<i>Could it just have been a nightmare?</i>

661
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:44,814
<i>I'm busy doing a translating gig.</i>

662
00:57:45,104 --> 00:57:47,444
<i>I'll finish up and go home safely,
so don't worry.</i>

663
00:57:53,864 --> 00:57:55,404
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

664
00:58:33,064 --> 00:58:34,234
Lee Jingeun.

665
00:58:40,744 --> 00:58:41,994
I'm going to scream.

666
00:58:42,074 --> 00:58:43,784
Do it, and you'll regret it.

667
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:48,584
Let's get rid of those.

668
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:50,044
People will come.

669
00:58:50,124 --> 00:58:52,584
Of course, they will.
This won't take long.

670
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:55,964
First of all, you're the one
who reported me, wasn't it?

671
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:57,844
What?

672
00:58:57,924 --> 00:59:01,054
I decided to finally go home,
and I saw cops there.

673
00:59:01,634 --> 00:59:02,684
It was you, right?

674
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,474
I would've reported you sooner
if I was going to. Why now?

675
00:59:07,684 --> 00:59:09,274
It has to be you.

676
00:59:10,274 --> 00:59:12,694
Because you're the only one
who's still alive.

677
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:15,614
Forget about that.

678
00:59:16,194 --> 00:59:19,404
I'll cut to the chase.
Why did you want to see me?

679
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:22,244
I'm excited to find out why.

680
00:59:26,914 --> 00:59:27,994
You saw that?

681
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:30,874
Of course. It was you of all people.

682
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:35,424
What happened that night?

683
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,264
You disappeared
right after speaking with Gyehoon.

684
00:59:40,214 --> 00:59:42,514
Why did you have
to get rid of your phone and run away?

685
00:59:44,054 --> 00:59:47,014
Who did you meet that night?

686
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,184
Was all this because of Gyehoon?

687
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:51,984
Did you reach out to me

688
00:59:52,064 --> 00:59:55,654
to tell Gyehoon
about the person I met that day?

689
00:59:55,734 --> 00:59:57,864
Tell me who it was.

690
01:00:16,924 --> 01:00:18,094
You know what?

691
01:00:19,134 --> 01:00:21,634
You and Eun Gyehoon can never be together.

692
01:00:22,924 --> 01:00:24,474
There's a reason for that.

693
01:00:26,264 --> 01:00:27,724
You'll find out soon enough.

694
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:34,854
Lee Jingeun.

695
01:00:39,824 --> 01:00:41,284
Eighteen years ago,

696
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:45,574
did we go to a certain house together?

697
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:55,254
No, right?

698
01:00:57,544 --> 01:00:59,004
Do you finally remember?

699
01:01:10,394 --> 01:01:11,564
The red gate.

700
01:01:15,314 --> 01:01:17,394
<i>Dahyun, hurry up.</i>

701
01:01:25,074 --> 01:01:27,404
This is getting interesting.
See you around.

702
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:46,634
We'll be able to easily locate him
with the CCTV footage,

703
01:01:46,724 --> 01:01:48,384
so don't worry. We will catch him.

704
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:50,684
Are you hurt?

705
01:01:51,724 --> 01:01:52,564
No.

706
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:56,524
Why did you drop the honorifics?

707
01:01:58,564 --> 01:01:59,404
We were schoolmates.

708
01:02:02,774 --> 01:02:04,364
Here comes another one.

709
01:02:23,844 --> 01:02:28,014
I had no idea
Lee Jingeun was still after you.

710
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:31,434
I thought he had disappeared,
so I let my guard down.

711
01:02:31,844 --> 01:02:32,724
It's all my fault.

712
01:02:35,814 --> 01:02:39,354
-From now on--
-No. Don't apologize.

713
01:02:40,854 --> 01:02:41,944
I'm at fault.

714
01:02:44,524 --> 01:02:45,904
To be honest,

715
01:02:48,574 --> 01:02:51,244
I had left him a message
on my social media.

716
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:58,794
While debating whether to post it or not,
I accidentally posted it.

717
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:01,174
I panicked and deleted it right away.

718
01:03:01,424 --> 01:03:03,424
But I think he saw it.

719
01:03:06,004 --> 01:03:07,304
You reached out

720
01:03:08,964 --> 01:03:09,804
to him?

721
01:03:11,474 --> 01:03:12,644
I'm sorry.

722
01:03:19,354 --> 01:03:20,314
Because of me, right?

723
01:03:21,814 --> 01:03:23,904
You knew I was looking for him,

724
01:03:23,984 --> 01:03:25,614
so you wanted to help. Right?

725
01:03:26,444 --> 01:03:27,484
That's not why.

726
01:03:28,074 --> 01:03:29,494
It's okay.

727
01:03:31,244 --> 01:03:33,244
It's my fault. I was being careless.

728
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:34,624
That's really not why.

729
01:03:34,704 --> 01:03:37,374
Then why would you reach out to him?

730
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:49,174
I had my reason.

731
01:03:52,424 --> 01:03:53,764
It was because…

732
01:03:56,514 --> 01:03:57,974
I know your sister.

733
01:04:02,814 --> 01:04:03,814
What?

734
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,024
I think I know her.

735
01:04:08,574 --> 01:04:09,904
What do you mean?

736
01:04:11,364 --> 01:04:12,904
Lee Jingeun once said

737
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:16,534
that he was the last one
to see Gyeyoung alive.

738
01:04:18,664 --> 01:04:20,044
Perhaps

739
01:04:20,794 --> 01:04:22,834
I also saw.

740
01:04:25,964 --> 01:04:26,924
Saw what?

741
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:31,804
Your sister alive for the last time.

742
01:04:35,724 --> 01:04:37,554
I might have witnessed it as well.

<i>Something so horrendous occurred
in this small neighborhood.</i>

746
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:54,094
<i>So how's it possible that I don't remember
a single thing? Isn't it strange?</i>

747
01:05:54,174 --> 01:05:57,174
<i>I don't want to look for my sister
if it means you'll be in danger.</i>

748
01:05:57,264 --> 01:05:58,434
I'll kill them all.

749
01:05:58,514 --> 01:06:00,394
<i>Only the first time was hard.
I can do it again.</i>

<i>I'm certain something happened to me.</i>

<i>After I met you and Lee Jingeun showed up,</i>

752
01:06:05,684 --> 01:06:08,444
<i>I'm regaining my memory bit by bit.</i>

753
01:06:08,524 --> 01:06:10,854
<i>I already know that Dahyun
was a possible witness as well.</i>

754
01:06:10,944 --> 01:06:14,364
<i>What? Dahyun wasn't a witness.</i>

755
01:06:14,824 --> 01:06:17,034
I'm asking you what happened!
