00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:13,634
Eun Gyeyoung?

3
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:18,054
Gyeyoung.

4
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,374
I wasn't a witness.

5
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:29,294
I was a victim just like she was.

6
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:29,274
Gyeyoung, hang in there, okay?

7
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:45,414
It was just me…

8
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,204
who got out of there.

9
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:54,254
I was the only survivor.

10
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,674
It was just me…

11
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:06,094
I'm sorry.

12
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:10,184
I'm sorry.

13
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:12,894
I'm sorry…

14
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:26,074
And you call yourself human?

15
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,334
Do you?

16
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:32,044
How could you do that to her? How?

17
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:36,254
How could you do that to her?

18
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,924
-How?
-Hold on.

19
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:42,464
There's something you need to know.
Your sister didn't make it out.

20
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:44,804
So how did Dahyun survive?

21
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,684
Hey, will you be okay?

22
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:53,104
Now every time you see Dahyun,
you'll remember your sister.

23
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:55,234
Will you be okay with that?

24
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:08,664
That's enough.

25
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:12,244
Just tell me who ordered you
to bring Gyeyoung there.

26
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:13,874
Who was he?

27
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:17,084
The person…

28
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:20,544
The person you're looking for is…

29
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,094
<i>It's just like then.</i>

30
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:09,054
<i>It feels unfamiliar and strange.</i>

31
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,264
<i>Did something</i>

32
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,564
<i>happen to Gyehoon?</i>

33
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:41,214
STEW PLACE

34
00:06:57,724 --> 00:06:59,434
<i>The number you have dialed cannot--</i>

35
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:40,354
STEW PLACE

36
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:48,574
<i>Hello?</i>

37
00:07:48,654 --> 00:07:50,904
Where are you?
Do you know how many times I called?

38
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:53,114
Are you okay?

39
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,414
Why won't you answer me?

40
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:58,834
Give me some time to answer.

41
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:01,334
I was worried sick.

42
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,504
I'm sorry.
I had something to take care of.

43
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,834
What was it?

44
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:07,174
<i>Don't worry and go home.</i>

45
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,964
I'll call you back again.

46
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:10,254
Wait--

47
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:36,494
THE PREMONITION

48
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:39,784
EPISODE 12

49
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:43,794
You were blindsided by someone
while speaking to Lee Jingeun?

50
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:47,714
Yes. I was knocked unconscious
and just came to.

51
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:50,964
The both of them had disappeared by then.

52
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,554
Does Lee Jingeun have an accomplice?

53
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,634
That could be possible, but I think--

54
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:59,724
It could be the very person
I've been looking for.

55
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,064
No, I'm sure it was him.

56
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:04,274
I'll look around.

57
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:06,274
Let me help.

58
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:08,234
Don't bother. You're not well.

59
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,364
You won't be of any help in that state.

60
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,034
It's all my fault.

61
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:19,914
You're not the only one after him.
I am too.

62
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,454
I can't wait to catch him myself.

63
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:25,004
So, don't be sorry.

64
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:50,864
I thought something had happened to you.

65
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:54,534
I told you not to worry.

66
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,574
I felt something ominous.

67
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:01,914
It felt like
something had happened to you.

68
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:05,454
Is that so?

69
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:10,254
You were with Lee Jingeun, weren't you?

70
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:13,134
Yes.

71
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:17,474
You're insane.
Why would you follow him? He's dangerous.

72
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:19,304
You know he's not
in his right mind, right?

73
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:22,644
Now every time you see Dahyun,
you'll remember your sister.

74
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:23,894
Will you be okay with that?

75
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,314
Are you listening to me?

76
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:30,274
Are you?

77
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:33,364
Yes.

78
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:46,544
I'm sorry.

79
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:48,544
What's this?

80
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:51,924
It's all my fault.

81
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:53,714
If you apologize like that
out of the blue,

82
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,634
I don't know what to say.

83
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:58,344
I'm sorry.

84
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,274
Hey, Mom.

85
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:15,574
I told you not to worry.

86
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:18,694
I'm at the restaurant.

87
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:20,864
Okay. Bye.

88
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:28,164
I've been updating her
for the past hour at ten-minute intervals,

89
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:29,334
letting her know I'm safe.

90
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,924
An hour? You weren't home?

91
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,214
Well…

92
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:39,884
I was…

93
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,684
-What happened to your neck?
-What?

94
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:48,104
Well…

95
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:50,144
It's nothing.

96
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:53,274
Jingeun, that bastard.

97
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:56,734
I can't believe
he did the same thing to you.

98
00:11:57,524 --> 00:11:58,614
Me neither.

99
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:08,084
Did he give you
the answer you were looking for?

100
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:11,294
Half of it.

101
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,544
I see.

102
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:19,094
It's raining.

103
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:28,554
Do you want a hot cup of tea?

104
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:31,354
Sure.

105
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:45,404
<i>I need to tell him…</i>

106
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:51,044
<i>that I regained parts of my memory</i>

107
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:53,794
<i>and that</i>

108
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:57,174
<i>I was the only one who made it out alive.</i>

109
00:12:58,754 --> 00:12:59,924
<i>I should apologize.</i>

110
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:10,054
<i>I need to tell her</i>

111
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:12,934
<i>that she was a victim
just like Gyeyoung was</i>

112
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,774
<i>and that she was hurt.</i>

113
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,024
<i>Also,</i>

114
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:21,984
<i>I need her to know
that I don't want her to get hurt.</i>

115
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:29,244
Here you go.

116
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:46,674
-Look. Gyehoon--
-Dahyun.

117
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:52,054
I'm a bit tired today.

118
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,604
Can we talk tomorrow?

119
00:13:58,644 --> 00:14:00,654
Okay. Sure.

120
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:02,904
Tomorrow sounds good.

121
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:22,004
I can't believe
we don't have any umbrellas.

122
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:24,344
I live right across the street.

123
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:29,724
Let's run across together.

124
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:32,144
You don't need to come with me.

125
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:33,104
Bye.

126
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:53,704
I'm sorry.

127
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:58,414
I'm sorry, Gyehoon.

128
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:11,304
I couldn't hear you.

129
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:16,604
I said happy birthday.

130
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:19,854
It's not midnight yet,
so I still had time to say it.

131
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:22,734
Thanks.

132
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:26,274
-Bye.
-Bye.

133
00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:53,554
<i>In the end,</i>

134
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:56,304
<i>I failed to tell him.</i>

135
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:13,744
<i>Eventually,</i>

136
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:17,704
<i>I couldn't tell her.</i>

137
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:32,884
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

138
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:35,804
Have some bellflower roots, Mom.

139
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:36,934
They're too bitter.

140
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:38,974
No, they're not.

141
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:41,474
You can have them all.

142
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:43,894
I think it's just you.
They taste fine to me.

143
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:45,274
Then you can have them all.

144
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,234
<i>Do you two remember
that missing child case?</i>

145
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,534
We had just moved here at the time,
so we aren't too familiar with it.

146
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,364
-Right?
-Right.

147
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:57,914
-Bitter means it's good for you.
<i>-Why did they hide the fact</i>

148
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:00,954
<i>that I had gone missing?</i>

149
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:03,374
Is it really that bad?

150
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:10,134
<i>Simply because I had lost my memory?</i>

151
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:12,714
<i>I'll take care of everything,</i>

152
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:15,474
so just do as I say.

153
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:19,974
<i>I'll kill them all.</i>

154
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:21,514
One or two makes no difference.

155
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:24,104
Only the first time was hard.
I can do it again.

156
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:30,024
<i>What in the world happened to them?</i>

157
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,364
Why are you staring at us?

158
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:33,534
Do you have something to say?

159
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:36,364
What? Oh, it's nothing.

160
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,454
Don't lie. Your face says it all.

161
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,244
Gosh, I'm walking on eggshells
nowadays because of her.

162
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:43,334
Maybe you feel guilty about something.

163
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:46,124
Not at all.

164
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:50,174
Just say it.

165
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:04,394
I have one question
I'm dying to ask you two.

166
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:07,734
Can I?

167
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:09,354
What is it?

168
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:12,114
Don't be so serious. You're scaring me.

169
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,114
Go on.

170
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:17,614
Well…

171
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,324
Did you guys…

172
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,674
Forget it.

173
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,004
I'm too scared to find out the truth.

174
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:36,344
Thank you for the meal.

175
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:39,764
Hey, you're piquing our curiosity.

176
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,474
What is it? Hey.

177
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:44,604
What's with her?

178
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:47,814
She's going to be the death of me.
I'm going to meet an untimely death.

179
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:52,104
You're going to live a long life. Eat up.

180
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:59,404
The soft opening is finally
around the corner.

181
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:03,164
I'm so nervous. Everything will pan out
this time around, right?

182
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:05,454
Right, Gyehoon? Right, Gaehoon?

183
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:07,584
I'm not sure.

184
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:10,124
Don't jinx it. Take that back.

185
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:11,674
Are you really our boss?

186
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,424
By the way,

187
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:15,344
what will we do with that?

188
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:17,254
-With what?
-The fridge.

189
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:18,924
Should we just sell it?

190
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:20,884
Sell that?

191
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:23,594
To be honest, people are eyeing it.

192
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:27,064
-What?
-It was a hectic day yesterday.

193
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:36,694
It's nice and big.

194
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,994
Can you put this in a normal family home?

195
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:43,824
Your house is tiny.
This won't fit in there.

196
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:46,624
-My house is better.
-Yours is no different.

197
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:48,954
Maybe I should put it in my office.

198
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:52,544
Well… I think I could place it
in my living room.

199
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,124
It's pretty nice.

200
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:56,004
-It is.
-It's quite nice.

201
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:24,284
What I'm getting at is
that we should get rid of it soon.

202
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:25,994
I'll sell it.

203
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:28,994
Don't bother.

204
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:30,874
They can take it if they want.

205
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:33,624
Why would you give it away for free?
We need all the money we can get.

206
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:34,924
Are you broke?

207
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:37,384
He's spending all the money he has.

208
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:39,674
Be quiet and walk the dog.

209
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,384
Let's go, Gaehoon.

210
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:44,224
That little…

211
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:46,554
-That's his name?
-No.

212
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:49,054
Gaehoon!

213
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:53,894
Gaehoon, let's go.

214
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:04,034
I looked for him all night long
but to no avail.

215
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:05,364
Good work.

216
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:06,784
Sit down.

217
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,504
I need a warrant to check the CCTVs,

218
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,664
so I'm looking for other options.

219
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:18,964
I'm checking all the nearby dashcams.

220
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,424
But as you already know,
there aren't many cars around.

221
00:21:24,174 --> 00:21:25,264
Right.

222
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,774
Where in the world

223
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,274
could Jingeun be?

224
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,769
Why are you still here?
You haven't left yet?

225
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:06,689
I was checking the dashcams.

226
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:09,949
You must be tired.

227
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:13,619
But… what are you doing?

228
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:16,579
I pulled an all-nighter yesterday
thanks to someone.

229
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,289
And it wasn't even my shift.

230
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:21,419
Do you think it's easy
to maintain such good skin?

231
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:22,999
I put in all this hard work

232
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,209
for people to compliment my skin
and say that I look young.

233
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,049
The latter is a surprise to me.

234
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,679
You've just offended me enough
to keep me awake.

235
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:33,969
I'm just kidding.

236
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,139
You're plenty beautiful.

237
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,099
That's enough.

238
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,059
I've been going too easy on you.

239
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,099
I meant what I said.

240
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:02,079
I'll tell him today no matter what.

241
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,679
We'll be doing a deep clean for two days.

242
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,719
Then I'll check our final menu.

243
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:21,769
Jinhoo, double-check and make sure
our ingredients are coming on time.

244
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:24,559
I'll go to the morning market
for the flowers and seafood a day before.

245
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,059
All right, let's get going.

246
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:27,149
-Okay.
-Okay.

247
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,989
-Okay. One, two, three.
-Three.

248
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:01,679
I'm going grocery shopping later.
Come with me.

249
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:02,889
Okay.

250
00:25:11,189 --> 00:25:13,529
I have a few things to buy.
Who wants to come with me?

251
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:15,739
-I will--
-Okay.

252
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:23,949
We'll be back.

253
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:38,009
I have something to tell you.

254
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,179
I do as well.

255
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,929
About meeting Lee Jingeun yesterday?

256
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:46,939
Yes.

257
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,269
I'll go first.

258
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,319
I…

259
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:00,989
If it's too difficult to talk about,
you don't need to.

260
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:03,539
Let's just do that.

261
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:06,369
Let's not force ourselves
to talk about uncomfortable things.

262
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:09,079
Are you saying
we should just keep it a secret?

263
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,419
Are we to play dumb

264
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:14,749
and feign ignorance?

265
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,839
-If I could, I'd like that.
-Me too.

266
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:20,969
But would it work?

267
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,929
I'll just go first.

268
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,389
No.

269
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,479
I need to take you somewhere first.

270
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,779
SEWOON-SI, JIHWAMADANG-RO

271
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,269
<i>It's the place</i>

272
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:10,019
where Gyeyoung and I were 18 years ago.

273
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,089
NAKYANG STATIONERY

274
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,759
Let's go.

275
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,099
Okay, let's go.

276
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:29,449
GOMI BREAD

277
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:33,829
-No regrets?
-No. I have a good feeling about this.

278
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,169
We'd like to buy these.

279
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:51,509
What a bummer. What about you?

280
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,269
What is it? What did you get?

281
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,519
Ta-da!

282
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,689
Let's switch.

283
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:59,439
-No. Why should I?
-Come on.

284
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,979
-Let's switch.
-I don't want to!

285
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,899
Gyehoon, let's go. They're playing soccer.

286
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:05,029
Okay.

287
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:08,069
I'll be back soon. Keep this.

288
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,319
I won't be long!

289
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:12,779
Wait for me!

290
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:57,539
This…

291
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:01,879
This was it.

292
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:04,839
You were here, Gyeyoung.

293
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:29,859
Eun Gyehoon.

294
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:31,989
Why are you here?

295
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:33,989
What brings you here?

296
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,579
Do you want me to take you to your mom?

297
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:38,659
Yes.

298
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,629
I have something to ask.

299
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,769
I'm sorry for asking,

300
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,979
but may I ask when you first moved here?

301
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:09,779
Why?

302
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:11,529
Am I being too rude?

303
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:15,279
I remember it being 2005.
I'm probably right.

304
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:17,829
-In 2005?
-Yes.

305
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,289
<i>Gyeyoung had gone missing in 2004.</i>

306
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:28,669
Then do you know
who used to live here before then?

307
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:30,919
I'm not too sure.

308
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:35,389
From what I know,
this house used to be vacant for a while.

309
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:40,009
Can you tell me why you're interested

310
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,559
in this house?

311
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:47,399
I remembered something

312
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:49,689
from my past.

313
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:53,569
I remember my sister and I…

314
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:58,619
coming here

315
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:01,539
before.

316
00:33:18,969 --> 00:33:20,139
Do you

317
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:23,139
remember my sister?

318
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:25,889
I had to go on business trips often,

319
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:28,189
so I don't remember much
about you nor her.

320
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,189
I see. I'm sorry for barging in here.

321
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,389
LOG IN OR PROCEED AS A NON-MEMBER

324
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:57,279
OWNER
CHO DONGNAM

325
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,369
I'm back.

326
00:35:12,169 --> 00:35:14,419
I met the current owner of the house

327
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,129
and checked the house registration.

328
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:19,009
But he didn't own the place 18 years ago.

329
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:23,049
Now, I need to find out
who the former owner was.

330
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:27,019
Are you okay?

331
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,639
To be frank, I was scared.

332
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,229
Even a grown-up like me felt afraid.

333
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:33,729
I can't even fathom

334
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:36,439
how you two must've felt.

335
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:39,649
I'm okay.

336
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:42,949
I'm glad to hear that.

337
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:45,619
I wish I could remember it all.

338
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:48,749
But I just don't remember
the culprit's face.

339
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:53,539
All that I remember

340
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:58,299
<i>is his damp touch…</i>

341
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:01,719
<i>and the sound of his breath.</i>

342
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,469
I have to remember.

343
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:07,809
Anything at all.

344
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:10,349
-Dahyun.
-I must…

345
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:11,849
Noh Dahyun.

346
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,559
Yes?

347
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:17,609
Are you all right?

348
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:19,479
I'm sorry.

349
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,199
I'm sorry I can't remember.

350
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:26,699
Why would you apologize?
That's nothing to be sorry about.

351
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:28,619
Don't you ever feel that way again, okay?

352
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,289
Okay.

353
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:34,119
<i>That's what I told her,</i>

354
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,379
<i>but all I could think about was…</i>

355
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:39,459
Your sister didn't make it out.
So how did Dahyun survive?

356
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:53,389
Let's go. I'll cook you something tasty.

357
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:57,359
I promised that
I'd always cook you delicious food.

358
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:02,189
No matter what,
nothing will change between us.

359
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:05,609
Let's go.

360
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:29,139
You should fold your own laundry.

361
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:30,469
You're no longer a kid.

362
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:33,309
Just leave them there,
and I'll do it eventually.

363
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:35,019
Sure, you will.

364
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:41,189
You're acting weird these days.
You know that?

365
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:44,149
You're always acting weird. You know that?

366
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:48,359
You always have to have the last word.
Gosh, seriously.

367
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:49,569
Jeez.

368
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,619
But I think

369
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:55,159
I can understand why you're so weird.

370
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:56,459
What are you getting at?

371
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,829
You and Dad got a divorce
when I was little.

372
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:04,209
I was always alone
because you had to work to make ends meet.

373
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:06,839
I didn't have many friends

374
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,929
and waited for you all day long.

375
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:12,219
I really hated you back then.

376
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:14,719
But come to think of it,
you were my age back then.

377
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:17,559
You were too young.

378
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:22,109
So I'd like to sincerely apologize

379
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:24,609
for how I felt back then.

380
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:29,779
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?
Don't act like you're all grown up now.

381
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,239
I know I was lonely back then,

382
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:36,329
but you also went through so much
at such a young age.

383
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:39,039
That's why

384
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:42,499
I think I can understand
anything that you went through

385
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:46,299
no matter what it was.

386
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:50,719
What do you mean?

387
00:38:57,979 --> 00:38:59,939
I've regained my memories, Mom.

388
00:39:05,149 --> 00:39:06,529
Not completely.

389
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:09,069
But a big part of it.

390
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:11,909
That's why I'm asking you this.

391
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:15,029
Is there really nothing
that I need to know

392
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,289
about you and Grandma?

393
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:25,589
Not at all. There's nothing.

394
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:31,799
All right, then.

395
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:34,639
-Where are you going?
-What? The grocery store.

396
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,559
-Do you need anything?
-No.

397
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:05,499
What's wrong, Bokhee?

398
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:06,749
Mom.

399
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:11,969
Dahyun regained her memory.

400
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:15,679
I see. Did she?

401
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:19,139
She asked me if I had anything to say

402
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:23,479
or if there was anything
she needed to know about us.

403
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:26,059
So did you tell her?

404
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,229
How could I?

405
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:32,449
How could I possibly tell her

406
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,489
about that heinous incident?

407
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:44,829
Bokhee, you just did everything
you could do at the time.

408
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:47,539
It's okay.

409
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:50,839
It's okay.

410
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:53,549
It's okay.

411
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,799
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

412
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,659
Hello.

413
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:31,339
Do you need to speak with Dahyun?

414
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:35,629
-Jeez.
-Excuse me.

415
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:42,719
I just asked you a question.

416
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:47,099
I don't have to answer you.

417
00:41:47,189 --> 00:41:48,689
I'll be frank with you.

418
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:52,069
I don't like your expression.

419
00:41:52,149 --> 00:41:54,239
It looks like you're up to no good.

420
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:58,409
-Is that so?
-Yes.

421
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,049
<i>You know what?</i>

422
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:15,799
<i>You and Eun Gyehoon can never be together.</i>

423
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:17,929
<i>There's a reason for that.</i>

424
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:27,309
<i>Now every time you see Dahyun,
you'll remember your sister.</i>

425
00:43:08,139 --> 00:43:10,729
What was it
that you were talking about last time?

426
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:12,099
What?

427
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,609
You were considering leaving Jihwa-dong.

428
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:16,569
Oh, that?

429
00:43:16,649 --> 00:43:19,569
I've lived here long enough.

430
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:23,819
I had only planned
to stay for a while because I liked you.

431
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:25,199
Exactly.

432
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:28,409
Why would you consider leaving
when I'm still here?

433
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:30,709
I've done many wrong deeds here.

434
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:32,249
Is this about Mr. Han?

435
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:34,589
That and then some.

436
00:43:38,169 --> 00:43:39,719
We're in the same boat.

437
00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:41,719
I feel the same way.

438
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:44,469
Why would you?

439
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:48,139
No one in this world is fully innocent.

440
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,019
We're all just carrying our guilt with us.

441
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,599
You're doing well compared to me.

442
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:54,099
So don't worry.

443
00:43:57,649 --> 00:43:58,569
Thanks, Jungho.

444
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:07,449
Hey.

445
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,619
-Hey.
-You're here early.

446
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,829
-Yes, we are.
-What took you so long?

447
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:13,869
Come on, now.

448
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:16,499
-Here.
-You know what?

449
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:20,209
I thought spring was around the corner,
but it already feels like summer.

450
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:23,469
The weather is crazy, I tell ya.

451
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:29,009
Jeez, I'm sorry.

452
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,689
Filling up empty glasses
is second nature to me.

453
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:36,359
Let me have a glass.

454
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:37,939
-What?
-What?

455
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:40,859
I'll drink a bit today. Please.

456
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:44,529
Sure, then.

457
00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:48,619
Hey, this is the first time
I'm seeing you drink.

458
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:51,199
-So what?
-Are you sure? You quit drinking.

459
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:54,579
It's okay. I'm going to give myself
a free pass just for today.

460
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:55,869
-Sure, why not?
-Let's drink.

461
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,749
That won't be a problem.

462
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:04,379
Gosh, that's refreshing.

463
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:06,179
That's good.

464
00:45:06,759 --> 00:45:08,679
-You drink well.
-He's right.

465
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:27,699
-Let's go.
-Thank you for the meal.

466
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:33,699
Younghwan,
what has been on your mind today?

467
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:37,369
Well, you see…

468
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:39,589
Last time…

469
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:53,309
Never mind. Don't mind me.

470
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:56,559
What? You got us all curious. Jeez.

471
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:54,259
Have you been well?

472
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:09,899
Don't forget our promise.

473
00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:25,959
You've done enough.

474
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:28,379
Let me go.

475
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:31,129
Fine. You're right.

476
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:33,919
I did make a promise back in that alley.

477
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:35,969
I'm sorry I failed to keep it.

478
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:43,479
I promise never to set foot
in Jihwa-dong ever again, okay?

479
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:46,229
I won't come back here again,

480
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:47,939
so just let me go.

481
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:52,779
Also, I won't tell anyone
about what happened in the past.

482
00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:56,909
Yesterday,
I was just teasing Gyehoon a bit.

483
00:47:57,489 --> 00:48:01,119
Why would I tell him the truth?

484
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,409
It would do me no good. Right? So--

485
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:06,669
The past?

486
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:10,709
You know…

487
00:48:12,669 --> 00:48:14,419
About Eun Gyeyoung.

488
00:48:15,669 --> 00:48:16,879
It was you.

489
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:18,389
Who said that?

490
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:20,679
It wasn't me.

491
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:24,179
All right.

492
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:26,389
Let's say it wasn't you then.

493
00:48:27,479 --> 00:48:29,939
So just let me go!

494
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:33,359
It's not like you can do anything to me.

495
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:35,189
Isn't that right?

496
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:38,159
You don't want to leave
any incriminating evidence by doing that.

497
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:41,239
That's true. You're right.

498
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:43,659
But you know what?

499
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:47,459
Objectively speaking,
you're completely right.

500
00:48:48,419 --> 00:48:49,879
But the problem is…

501
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:56,259
my instincts tell me otherwise.

502
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:04,009
Good judgment should come
before your instincts.

503
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:05,389
That's what you call "civilized."

504
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:07,059
I agree with you.

505
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:09,649
That's how
I've been lying low all this time.

506
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:10,649
Right?

507
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:12,819
But for how long?

508
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:25,949
How long should I have to keep that up?

509
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:36,669
One day, you'll cave into your instincts.

510
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:39,969
But I'm certain that it's not today.

511
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:42,219
-Is that so?
-Yes.

512
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:46,719
You've grown up well.

513
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:50,189
You…

514
00:49:51,439 --> 00:49:54,649
I still remember the boy
from 18 years ago.

515
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:58,359
I gave you a game console,
and you demanded a game cartridge.

516
00:50:00,529 --> 00:50:02,239
You were adorable back then.

517
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:07,159
It's a pity you turned out like this.

518
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:10,619
What…

519
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:12,249
What do you mean?

520
00:50:13,379 --> 00:50:14,339
How?

521
00:50:38,979 --> 00:50:41,989
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

522
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:54,209
If it's too difficult to talk about,
you don't need to.

523
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:57,589
Let's not force ourselves
to talk about uncomfortable things.

524
00:50:58,749 --> 00:51:00,879
Can I really do that?

525
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:04,389
Do I really not need
to tell him everything?

526
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:12,559
<i>Come with me to the morning market?</i>

527
00:51:17,689 --> 00:51:20,189
CHEF EUN GYEHOON
SURE

528
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:31,449
How about this one?

529
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:32,789
-This?
-Yes.

530
00:51:33,209 --> 00:51:35,119
I prefer one of these two.

531
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:37,749
How often do I need to water these?

532
00:51:38,459 --> 00:51:41,049
-Once a week is enough.
-Once?

533
00:51:43,089 --> 00:51:44,679
Don't these look so pretty?

534
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:46,089
Yes.

535
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,479
-Look at this.
-Take a look.

536
00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:04,449
-How about this one?
-Sure.

537
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:08,489
Look, snappers. Don't we need any?

538
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:11,329
-How much is it?
-It's 20,000 won.

539
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:12,449
Twenty thousand?

540
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:18,329
<i>I can't help but feel…</i>

541
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:22,049
<i>something bad is going to happen.</i>

542
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:29,179
Thank you.

543
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:36,439
Should we drop them off
at the restaurant and play hooky?

544
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:38,649
That's not something
the boss should be saying.

545
00:52:38,729 --> 00:52:40,859
A short stroll should be fine.

546
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:42,399
All right.

547
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:56,709
Darn it. Our fridge is broken.

548
00:52:56,789 --> 00:52:57,959
It's not cold.

549
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:01,669
I doubt our budget can cover a new fridge.

550
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,959
Jeez. This summer
is going to be pretty painful.

551
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,009
Right, the fridge.

552
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,179
Someone threw away
a pretty nice fridge outside.

553
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:12,429
Who?

554
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:15,429
Where?

555
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:19,189
Jeez, look at that.

556
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:20,599
Let's take this.

557
00:53:21,649 --> 00:53:23,019
Isn't it too big?

558
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:25,109
Don't you know how many of us there are?

559
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,239
-It's perfect.
-It sure is.

560
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:28,569
Indeed.

561
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,659
Wontak, go borrow that thing.

562
00:53:32,739 --> 00:53:36,289
That thing you can pull.
What's it called again?

563
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:37,869
A handcart?

564
00:53:37,959 --> 00:53:40,039
That's right. A handcart.

565
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:41,959
Where could I possibly find one?

566
00:53:43,419 --> 00:53:45,669
There's one over there.

567
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,179
Nice.

568
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:08,189
Hello.

569
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,029
Excuse me.

570
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:18,869
May I borrow your handcart?

571
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,919
It's not for me.
My superior ordered me to get one.

572
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:27,499
It's over there. Feel free to use it.

573
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:34,219
Thank you.

574
00:54:42,439 --> 00:54:45,939
Check this out.

575
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:47,609
It's perfect.

576
00:54:47,689 --> 00:54:49,739
-It's wonderful.
-It is.

577
00:54:50,689 --> 00:54:53,409
We should clean it first
since it was disposed of.

578
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:55,699
Wait. You better not order

579
00:54:55,779 --> 00:54:58,039
the youngest member
or the only female to do it.

580
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:00,159
Let's do it fair and square.

581
00:55:00,249 --> 00:55:01,619
-Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!
-Shoot!

582
00:55:01,709 --> 00:55:03,669
-Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!
-Thank you!

583
00:55:03,749 --> 00:55:05,169
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

584
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:07,419
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

585
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:11,379
Real men always go with their fists.

586
00:55:12,419 --> 00:55:15,339
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

587
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:24,899
Didn't he say men use their fists?
God damn it.

588
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:26,359
Talking to me?

589
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:28,769
No, I was talking to myself.

590
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,439
Right? Okay.

591
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:34,109
I feel great.

592
00:55:35,489 --> 00:55:36,569
All right.

593
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,889
All the flowers are gone.

594
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:07,899
It must've been due to the rain.

595
00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:09,609
I guess so.

596
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:12,479
But they'll always bloom again.

597
00:56:19,779 --> 00:56:20,619
Gyehoon.

598
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:27,579
Why won't you ask me?

599
00:56:29,169 --> 00:56:29,999
About what?

600
00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:32,629
Why won't you ask me
why I was the only one

601
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,219
who made it out alive?

602
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:20,929
Be careful.

603
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:29,559
Don't cry.

604
00:57:43,279 --> 00:57:45,619
Gyeyoung, hang in there, okay?

605
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:00,679
<i>Her hand slipped through mine.</i>

606
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:07,849
<i>I ran away by myself.</i>

607
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:16,399
I left her behind, Gyehoon.

608
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:21,319
I'm sorry.

609
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:27,789
And then?

610
00:58:30,249 --> 00:58:31,959
What happened after that?

611
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:36,629
I don't know. I just can't remember.

612
00:58:39,879 --> 00:58:41,009
I'm truly sorry.

613
00:58:44,299 --> 00:58:45,259
It's okay.

614
00:58:47,009 --> 00:58:48,719
I understand. You were little.

615
00:58:49,979 --> 00:58:51,439
Is that what you really believe?

616
00:58:53,189 --> 00:58:54,019
Yes.

617
00:58:56,229 --> 00:58:57,899
I'm fine. I mean it.

618
00:58:58,439 --> 00:59:00,109
I'm reminded of it
every time I look at you.

619
00:59:02,529 --> 00:59:06,449
I can't forget the fact
that I left your sister behind.

620
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:10,829
It was a memory
I had forgotten for the past 18 years.

621
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:13,459
And though it just came back to me…

622
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:17,959
it's so vivid

623
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:21,299
that I'm consumed by it.

624
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:24,889
So how could you be any different?

625
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:29,179
How would you feel
every time you look at me?

626
00:59:29,259 --> 00:59:32,099
-I said I was fine.
-Don't lie. I know you're not fine.

627
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:37,399
-So?
-So…

628
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:40,939
Don't say it.

629
00:59:42,649 --> 00:59:44,449
Don't say another word.

630
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:47,739
<i>Our premonitions</i>

Let's break up,

634
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:04,719
Gyehoon.

635
01:02:09,509 --> 01:02:11,429
I can't hold myself back anymore.

642
01:02:57,849 --> 01:03:00,269
Lee Jingeun.
He probably didn't see this coming.

<i>Looking back to that time 18 years ago…</i>

644
