00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:20,425
I think that man…

3
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:26,095
is still alive.

4
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:32,275
Are you okay?

5
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:35,525
<i>To my foolish question, she responded…</i>

6
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:45,785
Am I dreaming?

7
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:50,625
I've been having so many nightmares.

8
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,645
<i>He comes back to life</i>

9
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:10,265
<i>again</i>

10
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:12,525
<i>and again in those dreams.</i>

11
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:17,155
They were terrifying, but I was okay.

12
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:20,025
Because they were just nightmares.

13
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:21,775
But…

14
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:27,995
do you mean that nightmare
has come true now?

15
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:31,585
Perhaps.

16
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:26,305
Bring it on.

17
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:30,765
Keep coming if you dare.

18
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:33,895
I won't let a scumbag like you
trample over me.

19
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:36,725
I'll never give in.

20
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:49,455
-Look at my posture.
-What?

21
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,745
-Is this how you do it?
-So annoying.

22
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:54,705
-Come on, man. Don't laugh.
-Look at him.

23
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,875
-Do it properly.
-It's so hot.

24
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:01,425
It really wasn't you two who beat him up?

25
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:02,925
What?

26
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:05,845
By the time we got there,
he was already beaten to a pulp.

27
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,515
-Yeah.
-Then who was it?

28
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:09,805
I'm telling you
he was completely knocked out.

29
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:13,305
-Knocked out?
-What are you guys whispering over there?

30
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:15,975
It's rude to leave us out of it.

31
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:20,105
Why are you swinging your arm?
Did you get a frozen shoulder again?

32
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,905
I told you to do
some stretching like this.

33
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:29,115
My goodness.
She thinks stretching is a cure-all.

34
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:30,285
Just try it, okay?

35
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,955
Here he comes. The cure-all.

36
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,995
-There must be a survivor.
-Seriously.

37
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:39,755
Come on, man.

38
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:44,295
Would you like some honey water?

39
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:45,925
No, I'm okay.

40
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:48,845
-Do you like pine nuts?
-I do, but no thank you.

41
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,475
-Would you like to join our resident--
-No.

42
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:54,145
-He's so rude.
-His parents must be so proud, right?

43
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:56,055
They must not need anything else.

44
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,265
Of course not.

45
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,025
-They wouldn't even need to eat.
-Totally.

46
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:01,185
They would die then.

47
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,485
-Jeez.
-What?

48
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:06,155
I'm sure your parents are great too.
What do they do for a living?

49
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:09,195
-We don't know anything about you.
-That's right.

50
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:10,745
They're going to interrogate him now.

51
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,365
-Got a girlfriend?
-How tall are you?

52
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:14,365
-How old are you?
-What are your hobbies?

53
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,785
What are you good at?

54
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,955
What's your name, Mr. Chef?

55
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,805
Eun Gyehoon.

56
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,395
My name is Eun Gyehoon.

57
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:41,725
<i>What's the real reason?</i>

58
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:44,395
Was it really to find your sister?

59
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:47,445
No.

60
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:49,025
Then?

61
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,325
<i>Perhaps,</i>

62
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:54,455
<i>the one I'm trying to find…</i>

63
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:56,705
<i>is one of them.</i>

64
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:12,675
THE CHILD RETURNS

65
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:15,765
EPISODE 5

66
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:18,765
I'm going to eat a lot from now on
and become strong and healthy.

67
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:20,015
But you've always eaten a lot.

68
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,225
That's one thing
that you've always done well.

69
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:25,945
I'm speaking metaphorically.
I don't mean just eating,

70
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:28,315
but what eating represents.

71
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:30,905
Like courage, determination,
and resolution.

72
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:33,075
-What is she saying?
-Beats me.

73
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:36,155
I guess she's determined now.

74
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:37,495
I see.

75
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:43,495
Mom, Grandma. By any chance…

76
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:44,505
By any chance?

77
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:47,295
That scum--

78
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,675
-What scum?
-Who's bothering you this time?

79
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:53,255
Never mind.

80
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:56,425
<i>Well, I'm not 100% sure yet
that he's alive.</i>

81
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:02,435
I said never mind.

82
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:05,065
I mean it.

83
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:08,315
Stop glaring and eat.
I'm going to have indigestion.

84
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:13,115
-By the way, you.
-What about me?

85
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:15,365
You're no longer a teenager.
Stop rebelling, okay?

86
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:18,245
Quit that chef's restaurant at once
and find a new job.

87
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:22,245
Or else, I'll meet with him myself
and duel it out.

88
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:24,245
-Come on, Mom.
-How could he make you work for him

89
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:25,705
when we have a restaurant too?

90
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:27,125
He has no business ethics.

91
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:28,795
I'll handle this right now--

92
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,505
But he has the upper hand.

93
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:32,595
What?

94
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,425
We need to get on his good side.

95
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:36,805
Why?

96
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:40,015
It's okay. Just tell us.

97
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:42,095
The thing is that…

98
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:47,145
I kind of shared my secret with him.

99
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:50,145
I think he has something on me.

100
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,905
No way.

101
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,775
He knows everything.

102
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:55,485
About what?

103
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:58,785
That I killed someone

104
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:02,245
and hid the body in the refrigerator.

105
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,875
How?

106
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:05,915
I told him everything.

107
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:09,375
Did he threaten you to tell him?

108
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:10,715
We were just eating.

109
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,465
He threatened you while you were eating?

110
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,795
Well, I had a drink too.

111
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:18,635
I was buzzed, so I spilled everything
even though he didn't ask--

112
00:07:18,715 --> 00:07:20,765
Darn, you little…

113
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:21,725
Use your words!

114
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:24,605
You've really lost your mind!

115
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,605
-I didn't tell him everything.
-Why would you tell him about that?

116
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:29,985
I just said I killed someone,
but he figured it out.

117
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:31,815
-Grandma!
-Let go, Mom.

118
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,275
-It turns out that he's very smart.
-You're complimenting him

119
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:36,485
in the middle of this?
How could you tell him that?

120
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,365
-Darn it. Come here!
-Grandma!

121
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:39,865
Grandma, I'm going.

122
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:41,535
Hey, come back here!

123
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:43,785
Come back here now!

124
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:29,125
<i>Dear heart, stop beating so fast.</i>

125
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,375
<i>And remember this.</i>

126
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:33,415
I've never been concerned about you.

127
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:35,425
I do admit
that I sympathized with you at times.

128
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,085
But that's it.

129
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:39,305
<i>Don't forget.</i>

130
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:41,965
<i>His kindness means pity.</i>

131
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:43,515
Is everything all right?

132
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:45,725
Yes, chef.

133
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,145
That's good…

134
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:50,605
to hear.

135
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,815
Everyone is late today.

136
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,235
I'm just early.

137
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:00,155
Oh.

138
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:02,535
Can you help me prep then?

139
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:04,825
Of course. I'm at your beck and call.

140
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:10,705
I'll help you tie it.

141
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:12,245
No thank you.

142
00:09:14,715 --> 00:09:16,925
Dahyun, are the onions ready--

143
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,555
Dahyun, let me do it.

144
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,395
You cut the onion in half.

145
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:35,185
And then…

146
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,395
Dahyun,

147
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:38,195
can you check the taste?

148
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:43,235
It tastes good.

149
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:55,875
Have I done something today

150
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,715
that offended you or made you upset?

151
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,385
-No.
-I think I have.

152
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:01,635
Not at all.

153
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:03,215
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

154
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:04,465
Good morning!

155
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,765
Dahyun, you're smiling
even brighter today.

156
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:12,645
-Am I?
-He's right. Having a good day so far?

157
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:13,765
Yes, I am.

158
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:15,605
-I like your necklace.
-Do you like it?

159
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,855
They have many pretty things.
Do you want to go with me?

160
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:19,655
My mom will scold me if I go shopping.

161
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,365
Then I'll go. Bring me with you.

162
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,985
Butt out, Jinhoo.
Stop trying to hang out with us.

163
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:27,285
I'm not trying to hang out.
I just want to look too.

164
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:28,205
He's upset.

165
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:31,825
Excuse me, Ms. Noh.
The sauce we made earlier…

166
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:33,665
Yes, chef. The sauce?

167
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,305
So he knows everything?

168
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:50,345
Who?

169
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,935
Our lives depend on him.

170
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,395
Then…

171
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:10,575
we need to get on his good side.

172
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:17,915
Did you have breakfast?

173
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:21,425
If you haven't,
would you like a pot of stew?

174
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,925
Koreans need Korean food,
not Italian food.

175
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,965
Tell us any time
if you want Korean food, okay?

176
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:29,135
We consider our neighbors family.

177
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:31,095
Of course, they are.

178
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,315
Darn it, that kid.

179
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:42,105
Why do I have to brownnose up to him?

180
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:45,615
Go along with it for now and we'll see
about what to do next. That hurts.

181
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,735
It's humiliating. I want to die.

182
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:50,695
I'll do the dishes

183
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:53,535
-since I lost.
-I got some pictures.

184
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:56,875
Its belly is filled with eggs.

185
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,045
It is, indeed.

186
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,835
Looks like it's going to pop.

187
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:07,005
-You don't have another one?
-It's not just full. It popped.

188
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:08,215
What about…

189
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,855
Eun Gyehoon.

190
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:30,905
Eun Gyehoon. My goodness.

191
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,535
What in the world…

192
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,705
Jeez, this guy.

193
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:40,955
-What's wrong?
-What is he doing over there?

194
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:45,795
He's always peeking in from there.

195
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,385
Why?

196
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:48,465
I wouldn't know.

197
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:52,675
Perhaps because he misses
peeing everywhere.

198
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:57,725
-Gosh.
-What an oddball.

199
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:06,405
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

200
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:30,425
<i>I think that man…</i>

201
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:33,265
is still alive.

202
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:45,775
I'm not scared at all.

203
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,995
Don't drop crumbs.

204
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,035
Sorry.

205
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,705
Oh, no.

206
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,795
Clean it up now.

207
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:11,175
Come on, give me a break.
You're in a good mood these days.

208
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:15,095
Am I? How would you know that?
I wasn't even aware.

209
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:16,635
Because Dahyun seems happy.

210
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,935
She's always smiling
and very cheerful lately.

211
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,895
That means you must feel happy too.

212
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,185
Dahyun's feelings are
directly transferred to you.

213
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:32,825
I guess she seems fine on the outside.

214
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,325
But not on the inside?

215
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,205
You startled me!

216
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,745
-Why do you keep getting startled?
-What's wrong with you today?

217
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,125
Gosh, seriously.

218
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:07,935
<i>Because…</i>

219
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:13,115
<i>Watch the video and follow slowly</i>

220
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,275
<i>-step by step.
-Noh Dahyun is fighting her fears.</i>

221
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:17,575
<i>Good. From this position,</i>

222
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,535
<i>swing your arm and lock his arm.</i>

223
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:26,335
<i>She's trying to appear brave</i>

224
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:28,585
<i>and pretending to be fine.</i>

225
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:47,015
<i>And acting cold…</i>

226
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,185
-Hello.
-Hi, Dahyun.

227
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,065
When are you getting married?

228
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:53,195
<i>…only towards me.</i>

229
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:11,965
I heard you'll be discharged soon.

230
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:14,295
Yes, in a day or two.

231
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:24,475
But you really don't remember anything?

232
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:26,975
<i>You know who I am, don't you?</i>

233
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:28,435
Make sure you file a report.

234
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:30,975
Then I'll give up my badge…

235
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,945
and follow you wherever you go
for the rest of your life.

236
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:42,695
You really don't remember?

237
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:44,455
I told you I don't. Must I repeat myself?

238
00:16:44,995 --> 00:16:46,995
I'm not a broken record.

239
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:55,925
Okay, sir. Give us a call
if anything comes to mind.

240
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:58,885
One more thing.

241
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,135
Nice face.

242
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,645
-We'll be back.
-Okay. See you later.

243
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,235
I don't want your pity.

244
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:01,275
-What do you mean pity?
-Don't be unnecessarily kind.

245
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:03,655
-I'm not trying to be kind--
-It's not kindness or pity,

246
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:05,575
and you weren't concerned.
What was it then?

247
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:11,165
Oh, I see.
I guess you're just nice to everyone.

248
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:15,045
It's called…

249
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:17,255
humanism.

250
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,645
-It's because…
-What was that for?

251
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,065
That car almost ran us over.

252
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:45,115
That car looked like it was coming
straight at us and run us over.

253
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:47,195
Why am I so strong?

254
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,615
I think I practiced self-defense too hard.

255
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:53,995
Oh, no.

256
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:56,835
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:02,545
It's okay.

258
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:27,035
Oh, no.

259
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:33,825
Are you all right?

260
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,255
Don't be unnecessarily kind to me either.

261
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:42,085
I'm just being… humanistic.

262
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:07,115
Let's call it even and put an end to it.

263
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,745
Put an end to what, sir?

264
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:12,035
Being extremely polite,

265
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:14,035
being cold, and talking formally.

266
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:17,245
This isn't the military.
I'm too scared to work with you.

267
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,335
What's it to you if I talk that way?

268
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:22,795
I don't like it.
It's prohibited at my restaurant. Got it?

269
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:25,255
That's what you call, "bullying."

270
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,555
I'd say I'm the pitiful owner
who gets bullied by his employees.

271
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,175
No way.

272
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:31,385
That's my line.

273
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:33,305
Wow, this one is so big.

274
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:36,355
Just because it's big,
it doesn't mean it's good.

275
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:40,435
The skin has to be smooth.

276
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:41,685
That one has better color.

277
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:43,565
What do you think?

278
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:46,445
Looks good. Find one not as skinny.

279
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,655
This one is good enough.

280
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:50,285
-How about this one?
-Potatoes with sprouts…

281
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:52,945
I prefer larger ones.

282
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:54,745
My mom prefers ones like this.

283
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,875
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

284
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,005
-Let's buy this too.
-Looks tasty.

285
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:07,715
This is a popular ingredient these days.

286
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:12,385
Here you go. Enjoy.

287
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:16,475
Are they dating?

288
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:17,595
They look chummy.

289
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:18,685
Eggs.

290
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:20,515
Here you go.

291
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:22,775
You've got lots of strength. Use it.

292
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,355
-That's chummy?
-I guess not.

293
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,195
That's delicious.

294
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:31,115
It's good indeed.

295
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:49,635
Are you the one who beat him up?

296
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:54,425
You can't answer me right away.
I guess I'm right.

297
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:58,225
-Why do you think that?
-Because…

298
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:02,605
you would do that.

299
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:17,495
You bastard!

300
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:24,545
Stop it. I'm fine now. That's enough!

301
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:26,335
Darn you!

302
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,795
Please stop. Please! Stop!

303
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:35,425
Please don't do this.

304
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,635
Please don't.

305
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,595
I said, don't!

306
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:41,685
Ji Wontak!

307
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:00,825
I feel… a bit sad.

308
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,125
That's all you remember?

309
00:23:04,995 --> 00:23:07,455
That scumbag kept hounding you

310
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,585
and he deserved a beating.

311
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:12,465
Don't you remember that?

312
00:23:12,545 --> 00:23:13,965
But you can't cross the line.

313
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:16,715
An ordinary person wouldn't be so violent.

314
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:20,305
Besides, it's not your job to punish him.
Leave it to the law.

315
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,805
I don't really believe in the law.

316
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:25,855
Ji Wontak.

317
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,695
-Officer Ji.
-I'll still follow the law.

318
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:33,525
And more importantly, it wasn't me.

319
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:34,815
-Hey.
-If…

320
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:38,155
you find me guilty,
I'll readily accept the punishment.

321
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:42,285
So, you try to catch the culprit.

322
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:49,335
<i>But you won't be able to catch me.</i>

323
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,125
<i>I just need to keep his mouth shut.</i>

324
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:09,355
If that man is still alive,

325
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:12,065
you have no reason
to hide from the police.

326
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:14,065
You're not a murderer.

327
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,365
You're right.

328
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:22,365
That's irritating.

329
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:25,165
That's so irritating.

330
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:48,105
I'll take it.

331
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,695
Are you…

332
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:58,155
Eun Gyehoon?

333
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:02,745
Eun Gyehoon, the son of Dr. Eun?

334
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:06,705
Yes, I am.

335
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:15,005
This is so tedious.

336
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:18,135
I guess you'd never feel hungry.

337
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,965
You keep eating something.

338
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:22,055
I know. It's fascinating.

339
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:25,555
Hi, there.

340
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:28,765
Did you not get a bite to eat?

341
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:30,395
You look pallid.

342
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:37,195
You're all blind.

343
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:39,155
Why are you provoking us?

344
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:40,575
Your brains don't work.

345
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:42,235
-Are you picking a fight?
-Gosh.

346
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:48,075
That kid is him.

347
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:50,625
Who?

348
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:52,665
Eun Gyehoon, Dr. Eun's son.

349
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,555
Oh, my gosh! How in the world?

350
00:26:07,595 --> 00:26:10,765
So that young man is…

351
00:26:10,855 --> 00:26:14,725
See? Didn't I tell you
that you'll be in trouble?

352
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:19,065
No, you didn't!
Did anyone hear her say anything?

353
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:21,565
It'll take a few more deaths
for you to come to your senses.

354
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:23,235
Watch what you say.

355
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:24,575
Darn you.

356
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:27,535
You lost your mystic power.
You're just selling wigs now.

357
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,035
Stop that nonsense!

358
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:31,375
She thinks she's still a shaman.

359
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:34,915
Why does the <i>doenjang</i> stew
smell like shoes?

360
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:41,755
That's nice.

361
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:44,845
Why don't you have a glass too?

362
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:48,935
You know that I've been
battling addiction my entire life.

363
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:50,055
Please go ahead.

364
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:52,435
SOLYI'S MOM

365
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:54,815
Hello?

366
00:26:56,025 --> 00:26:57,025
Yes.

367
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,065
What?

368
00:27:02,695 --> 00:27:03,735
Okay.

369
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:09,955
What was that? You basically said nothing.

370
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:12,245
You know that new place opening up

371
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:15,035
in front of the stew place?

372
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:19,165
The one in front of that awful stew place?

373
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,425
Yes, I do.

374
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:22,965
That kid…

375
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:26,845
is him.

376
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:27,765
What?

377
00:27:41,985 --> 00:27:43,985
God of war told me. I'm sure of it.

378
00:27:44,485 --> 00:27:46,155
It's one of you!

379
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:49,115
One of you is the culprit!

380
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:53,415
DR. EUN'S SON HAS RETURNED

381
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:56,535
<i>There's more than one!</i>

382
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,625
The whole neighborhood…

383
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:42,465
is stirred up.

384
00:28:45,085 --> 00:28:46,795
<i>He came back to take revenge.</i>

385
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:49,845
Revenge?

386
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:52,345
It's so obvious.

387
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:55,515
He has no other reason to come back
to this backward neighborhood.

388
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:58,725
Do you think
he is trying to kill that suspect?

389
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:03,235
He was just a suspect.
You can't be sure that he was the culprit.

390
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:05,735
Of course not. So many were investigated.

391
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:07,945
He is the culprit!

392
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,285
He is the one.

393
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:17,745
December 4th, 2004.

394
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:20,745
I even remember the date of the incident.

395
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:23,335
I'll go home now.

396
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,595
The weather,

397
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:32,885
the scent in the air…

398
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:37,395
I remember everything from that day.

399
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:46,565
<i>Around 2:30 p.m.,
Eun Gyeyoung was confirmed to be missing.</i>

400
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,155
Gyeyoung!

401
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:51,075
<i>Approximately 30 minutes later,
at around 3 p.m.,</i>

402
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:52,985
<i>she was last seen.</i>

403
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:57,165
Since then, 18 years have gone by.

404
00:29:57,245 --> 00:30:00,625
But no one has seen
Eun Gyeyoung even until now.

405
00:30:01,705 --> 00:30:05,335
The owner of that car was the suspect?

406
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:10,635
<i>It was Han Euichan,
Eun Gyeyoung's piano teacher.</i>

407
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:15,055
<i>The victim knew him, however…</i>

408
00:30:15,135 --> 00:30:18,595
There is a witness, I tell you!

409
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:20,435
Let me ask you again.

410
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:26,065
From 3 p.m. until midnight of the 4th,
where were you and what were you doing?

411
00:30:27,735 --> 00:30:29,905
<i>I've never seen anyone so stubborn.</i>

412
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:33,325
<i>He held out without confessing,</i>

413
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:35,745
<i>and in the end…</i>

414
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:09,605
FOUR SEASONS PIANO

415
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:11,525
Where is Gyeyoung?

416
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:21,325
Say it.

417
00:31:21,955 --> 00:31:23,915
I said, say it!

418
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:26,915
Please tell me!

419
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:30,255
Say it!

420
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,335
Say it!

421
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:35,635
I said, say it!

422
00:31:55,985 --> 00:31:57,785
Why do you keep lingering around here?

423
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,245
Do you have something to tell me?

424
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:10,795
I'm sorry.

425
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:16,465
About what?

426
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:18,635
Because of me,

427
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:21,345
Gyeyoung died.

428
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:31,065
That day…

429
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:32,235
What in the world…

430
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:35,405
happened that day?

431
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:42,943
It's okay,

432
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:44,443
so please tell me.

433
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:49,323
Gyeyoung wanted to ride my car.

434
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:54,043
And?

435
00:32:55,793 --> 00:32:58,923
I was supposed to take Gyeyoung with me…

436
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:06,803
I'm so sorry.

437
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:11,013
You must've been in so much pain.

438
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:14,603
It must've been hard for you too.

439
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:19,523
She wanted to ride your car.

440
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,273
You were supposed to take her.

441
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:24,943
What happened next?

442
00:33:25,943 --> 00:33:27,403
I don't know either.

443
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:32,203
What did you say?

444
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:33,703
I just wanted to tell you

445
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:37,623
that I'm sorry.

446
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:39,673
I let Gyeyoung die--

447
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:42,093
Stop the nonsense and tell me straight.

448
00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:43,883
What happened next?

449
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:46,713
What in the world happened that day?

450
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:50,893
Please.

451
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:54,103
Just this once…

452
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:59,443
Can you please tell me
what happened this once? Please?

453
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:03,653
Say it.

454
00:34:04,193 --> 00:34:05,693
Say it.

455
00:34:05,783 --> 00:34:07,323
I said, say it.

456
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,533
Say it. Say something!

457
00:34:09,653 --> 00:34:11,533
-Say something!
-What are you doing?

458
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:12,533
Get off!

459
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:17,163
Please go now.

460
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,383
I said, go now!

461
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:33,643
Taking personal revenge
is a serious crime.

462
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:40,853
Personal revenge? Says who?

463
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:46,153
I guessed it right then.

464
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:49,903
What about you?
Were you carrying out official duties?

465
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:53,953
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

466
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,373
I'll be watching you.

467
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:16,853
Chef Eun's sister's name is Eun Gyeyoung?

468
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,143
Yes. Why do you ask?

469
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:20,643
Have you heard of her name?

470
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:23,233
No, I haven't.

471
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:24,693
I see.

472
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:28,903
You haven't.

473
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:33,863
Eunjung.

474
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:37,493
That's why he said that.

475
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:39,583
<i>I know…</i>

476
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:41,203
who you are.

477
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:47,093
Are you… also back to kill me?

478
00:35:47,673 --> 00:35:48,593
What if I am?

479
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:51,763
Of course, he should kill him.

480
00:35:53,723 --> 00:35:56,053
If anyone hurts my little brother,
I wouldn't have any mercy.

481
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,103
I'd punish them brutally.

482
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:01,183
Until they cry and beg
saying they'd rather die,

483
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:03,563
I'd grind, chew, and tear them to pieces

484
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:06,313
making every single cell
in their body scream in pain.

485
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:09,273
I'd dedicate my entire life
to getting revenge.

486
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:16,973
I'll go now.

487
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:53,003
-Two, three, four.
-Let's get that apple butt.

488
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:56,013
Breathe out. One more time!

489
00:37:56,093 --> 00:37:57,013
Breathe out.

490
00:37:57,093 --> 00:37:58,933
Blow out.

491
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:01,223
-That hurts.
-Breathe in.

492
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:25,623
Thank you for everything.

493
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:28,123
Take care now.

494
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,713
They're leaving this place after all.

495
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:38,013
I'm going to catch the culprit myself.

496
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:41,883
I'm going to come back

497
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:44,353
to catch the culprit

498
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:48,183
<i>and kill anyone
who took my sister Gyeyoung!</i>

499
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:01,073
For an apple butt!

500
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,323
Thank you.

501
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:11,583
We meet again.

502
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:15,503
No way.

503
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,003
The third floor. I'm moving in today.

504
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:22,843
You said you'll be watching me.
But isn't this a bit too close?

505
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:26,143
Don't make things up. I signed the lease
without knowing you lived here.

506
00:39:26,223 --> 00:39:28,353
Now that you know,
why don't you break the contract?

507
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:31,103
I want to, but I can't afford the penalty.

508
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,063
I can consider lending it to you.

509
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:35,153
Why would you go that far?

510
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:36,523
That's how much I'm against it.

511
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,613
I bet I hate the idea more than you do.

512
00:39:39,823 --> 00:39:42,573
Then let's try not to run into each other.

513
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:44,073
Or just ignore each other.

514
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:45,323
-Deal.
-Deal.

515
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:04,843
Do you two remember
that missing child case?

516
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:13,603
We had just moved here

517
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:17,523
at the time,
so we aren't too familiar with it.

518
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,073
-Right?
-Right.

519
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:22,233
Is that right?

520
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:24,653
What I could remember…

521
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,333
<i>I hadn't made any friends
in the neighborhood yet.</i>

522
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:37,293
<i>I felt like an outcast,
and she played with me.</i>

523
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,133
Do you want to play with us?

524
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:46,263
<i>I have a dim recollection
of the kids' faces and voices.</i>

525
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:50,433
<i>I remember the boys I hated…</i>

526
00:40:55,023 --> 00:40:56,813
<i>and the boy I liked.</i>

527
00:40:58,103 --> 00:40:59,193
<i>And…</i>

528
00:40:59,943 --> 00:41:01,113
<i>And…</i>

529
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:06,703
How is it that I can't remember
the missing child case at all?

530
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:09,703
Do you want more rice?

531
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:12,543
No thanks.
I don't have much of an appetite today.

532
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:14,123
May I be excused first?

533
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:15,703
-Okay.
-Sure.

534
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:26,843
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

535
00:41:27,303 --> 00:41:28,553
And you?

536
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:08,013
Why are you leaving?

537
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:13,053
Come inside.

538
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:21,023
You got here early.

539
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,943
Yes. I wanted to water them.

540
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:26,283
The sun rises earlier now.

541
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:31,453
You're right.

542
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:32,993
It sure does.

543
00:42:36,413 --> 00:42:37,753
What should I do?

544
00:42:50,883 --> 00:42:51,973
Ask away.

545
00:42:56,763 --> 00:42:58,273
This is rosemary, isn't it?

546
00:42:59,183 --> 00:43:00,023
It's lavender.

547
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:04,403
-This one is mint.
-Lemon balm.

548
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:06,693
Chicory?

549
00:43:08,113 --> 00:43:09,493
Rucola.

550
00:43:11,703 --> 00:43:13,283
I got them all wrong.

551
00:43:13,783 --> 00:43:14,993
No kidding.

552
00:43:16,913 --> 00:43:18,333
I was wrong about this too.

553
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:24,463
I truly thought you liked me.

554
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:26,633
But that wasn't it.

555
00:43:26,713 --> 00:43:29,463
You just thought
I could've been your sister, didn't you?

556
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:33,433
That's why you said that.

557
00:43:34,093 --> 00:43:35,343
<i>Keep your word.</i>

558
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:38,603
Don't let your heart flutter
and fall for me or like me like in soaps.

559
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:41,183
-Promise.
-I promise. Satisfied?

560
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:42,393
Even if I treat you so well--

561
00:43:42,483 --> 00:43:45,103
I won't fall for you or like you. But--

562
00:43:45,193 --> 00:43:47,863
<i>How can I keep that kind of promise?</i>

563
00:43:48,323 --> 00:43:49,533
<i>I already like…</i>

564
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:55,783
Darn it.

565
00:43:56,453 --> 00:43:58,993
The sunshine is glistening.

566
00:43:59,743 --> 00:44:03,503
That wasn't directed to you.
The sun feels so hot.

567
00:44:07,173 --> 00:44:08,213
I made you

568
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:10,843
get the wrong idea.

569
00:44:12,923 --> 00:44:14,933
I can't say I'm not upset at all,

570
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:17,183
but it's okay.

571
00:44:19,563 --> 00:44:22,603
Anyway, I guess
your little sister was really pretty.

572
00:44:24,813 --> 00:44:27,613
-She was.
-I guess she looked a lot like me?

573
00:44:27,693 --> 00:44:28,943
Not really.

574
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:30,823
Okay.

575
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:33,903
Let's go downstairs.

576
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:37,533
I'm not good at consoling people.

577
00:44:39,073 --> 00:44:40,833
But sometimes people feel comforted

578
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:43,793
by seeing others who are
in a worse position than they are.

579
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:47,213
-So look at me and cheer up.
-Why would you say that?

580
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:49,173
My life is the worst.

581
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:52,053
Making a living is difficult enough,

582
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:54,213
but on top of it,
I nearly got killed by a stalker

583
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:57,263
and almost ended up a murderer.

584
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:02,723
Now I'm living in fear each and every day
thinking he might show up any moment.

585
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,853
And why does the sun keep shining
making me feel more confused?

586
00:45:06,563 --> 00:45:09,653
I must've done something terrible.
Maybe I committed treason in a past life.

587
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:11,273
Don't do that.

588
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:16,323
Even if you lower your guard a little,
people jump on to blame you.

589
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:19,203
"It's all your fault."
"It's all because of you."

590
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:20,823
But,

591
00:45:21,663 --> 00:45:23,243
if you blame yourself too…

592
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,503
it would be unbearable.

593
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:32,003
I hope you don't do that, Ms. Noh.

594
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:34,763
Although I've failed.

595
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:38,683
Look at this. Step aside!

596
00:45:38,763 --> 00:45:39,723
What?

597
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,853
Stop it! Leave him alone.

598
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:45,023
It's his fault.
Why is he taking it out on us?

599
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:46,813
It's all because of you.

600
00:45:47,643 --> 00:45:49,443
Don't stop me. Let go.

601
00:45:50,603 --> 00:45:54,113
Isn't it true? Your sister is missing
because you didn't look after her.

602
00:45:54,193 --> 00:45:57,243
Everyone is saying it's your fault.

603
00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:58,823
It's all because of you!

604
00:46:19,133 --> 00:46:21,143
The mood in the neighborhood
is quite gloomy.

605
00:46:21,723 --> 00:46:23,393
Because everyone is
thinking about the past.

606
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:25,013
I feel like we're all guilty.

607
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:27,603
What do you mean?
Why should we feel guilty?

608
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:30,023
-What I'm trying to say is--
-To put it bluntly,

609
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:31,733
we're all victims.

610
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:33,903
After that,
the whole neighborhood was in turmoil,

611
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,233
and so many people got investigated.
Don't you remember?

612
00:46:38,323 --> 00:46:39,863
Who wouldn't remember that?

613
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:44,623
He should've
kept an eye on his little sister.

614
00:46:44,703 --> 00:46:47,703
It was their fault. Why doubt
and bother other innocent people?

615
00:46:49,963 --> 00:46:51,293
Are you breaking something?

616
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:53,003
What is she doing over there?

617
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,133
Who knows?

618
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:57,213
Dahyun! Are you going to get a job?

619
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:01,343
Of course, she is. Very soon.

620
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:03,013
I already have a job.

621
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:05,103
Large corporations aren't
the only place to work.

622
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:08,973
Youngsters are all like that nowadays.
Dahyun isn't the exception.

623
00:47:09,063 --> 00:47:10,433
That's the problem.

624
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:13,603
They quit their jobs on a whim.
They're not determined.

625
00:47:14,653 --> 00:47:16,063
It's because they're spoiled.

626
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:19,443
Back in the day,
students studied to death at school

627
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:21,323
and workers worked themselves to death.

628
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:23,663
Our hearts were overflowing
with love for our school,

629
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:26,033
love for our company,
and love for our country.

630
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:27,873
Youngsters are different nowadays.

631
00:47:27,953 --> 00:47:29,453
Our generation is different.

632
00:47:29,953 --> 00:47:31,583
Why would you die for your company?

633
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,923
And you always talk badly
of our country. Patriotism, my foot.

634
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:37,003
She talks badly about it
because she cares!

635
00:47:37,093 --> 00:47:38,003
That's right!

636
00:47:40,053 --> 00:47:43,553
Gosh, seriously.
This darn, nosy neighborhood!

637
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:46,603
Have you lost your mind?

638
00:47:50,143 --> 00:47:52,813
You see?
I really care about our neighborhood.

639
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,783
My little brother, where are you?

640
00:48:21,303 --> 00:48:22,593
Where are you?

641
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:31,853
Jingeun will turn up.

642
00:48:32,353 --> 00:48:34,563
He will eventually
if I wait by Noh Dahyun.

643
00:48:35,143 --> 00:48:37,313
He was with her
right up to his disappearance.

644
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:40,323
If he doesn't?

645
00:48:44,493 --> 00:48:47,203
I'll choke that wench if I have to

646
00:48:48,243 --> 00:48:50,783
and make her spill where she hid him.

647
00:49:01,343 --> 00:49:02,463
Did they go out of business?

648
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:15,563
There it is. Choonok Stew.

649
00:49:16,693 --> 00:49:19,023
We have nothing to offer
even though we run a restaurant.

650
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,403
-Please.
-Thank you.

651
00:49:21,903 --> 00:49:23,613
-Thank you for that.
-Sure.

652
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:25,493
I came to give her this.

653
00:49:27,993 --> 00:49:30,953
I researched some companies
Dahyun can work again.

654
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,583
My goodness. Thank you so much.

655
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:38,293
Thank you.

656
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,213
Did you go to college with Dahyun?

657
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:45,013
Yes, I'm her friend from college
as well as her former supervisor.

658
00:49:45,593 --> 00:49:46,923
-Really?
-Yes.

659
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:50,183
When Dahyun got fired, had nowhere to go,
and was a total mess,

660
00:49:50,263 --> 00:49:51,393
I took her in.

661
00:49:51,473 --> 00:49:54,183
My goodness. Thank you so much.

662
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:57,023
It wasn't an easy decision,

663
00:49:57,103 --> 00:49:59,313
ever since I was little,

664
00:49:59,903 --> 00:50:01,903
I was taught to help the needy

665
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:03,733
and be warm-hearted and generous.

666
00:50:06,153 --> 00:50:07,323
Oh, I see.

667
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:10,573
Please tell Dahyun to apply at least.

668
00:50:11,163 --> 00:50:12,283
Sure, okay.

669
00:50:12,373 --> 00:50:14,033
I know Dahyun's my senior, but

670
00:50:14,123 --> 00:50:18,083
she shouldn't have her youth and future
held hostage at a place like this, right?

671
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:33,183
I just remembered.
Have you met that person?

672
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,513
-Pardon?
-Who do you mean?

673
00:50:36,643 --> 00:50:38,313
The person who went into that restaurant.

674
00:50:39,893 --> 00:50:42,233
She is Mr. Lee Jingeun's family.
She came to look for him.

675
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:44,403
Lee Jingeun?

676
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,873
<i>That dead guy.</i>

677
00:51:02,923 --> 00:51:05,713
How long do I have to stay like this?

678
00:51:07,173 --> 00:51:08,513
They're coming out.

679
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:14,643
Oh, that's her! That person--

680
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:17,063
Ma'am? Wait--

681
00:51:35,453 --> 00:51:36,783
<i>I'm on my way to buy seedlings.</i>

682
00:51:37,413 --> 00:51:39,243
<i>That's too bad. See you next time.</i>

683
00:51:39,703 --> 00:51:41,463
<i>Okay, Dahyun.</i>

684
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:44,253
<i>By the way, your mother
and grandmother are very strange.</i>

685
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:45,673
<i>They're like you.</i>

686
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:47,293
What?

687
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:48,253
Pardon?

688
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:50,303
It's nothing.

689
00:51:56,853 --> 00:51:57,973
I'm sorry.

690
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:25,373
That darn humanism.

691
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:32,053
I didn't say anything. Thank you.

692
00:52:34,423 --> 00:52:35,683
MOTHER

693
00:52:39,813 --> 00:52:42,063
-Hello?
<i>-Gyehoon?</i>

694
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:43,773
I saw Gyeyoung.

695
00:52:45,273 --> 00:52:46,773
It was definitely Gyeyoung.

696
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:50,523
What do you mean, you saw Gyeyoung?

697
00:52:52,323 --> 00:52:53,743
What on earth are you talking about?

698
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:57,863
<i>That picture you have. I saw it.</i>

699
00:53:09,173 --> 00:53:11,633
<i>It was definitely Gyeyoung!</i>

700
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:14,053
-It looks pretty on you.
-You wear it.

701
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:15,883
Just try it on.

702
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:18,143
Go put it on. I'll pick out some pants.

703
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:19,343
Go put it on, okay?

704
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:38,743
Dahyun, I'm sorry.
Please take a taxi and go back.

705
00:53:40,453 --> 00:53:42,373
I'll look for her with you. I can help.

706
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,530
Aunt, she isn't there either?

707
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,200
Where is she?

708
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,700
I found her.

709
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,830
Okay, I'll hang up now.

710
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,380
Gosh, seriously.

711
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,690
Mom.

712
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,400
Mom.

713
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,360
Please get up.

714
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:09,880
I'll take you home.

715
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,050
This is all because of you.

716
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,340
What did I tell you?

717
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:20,010
I told you to look after Gyeyoung.

718
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,770
I asked you repeatedly
to look after your little sister!

719
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,020
It's my fault.

720
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,980
You did that to her.

721
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,030
It's all because of you.

722
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,320
You took my daughter away from me!

723
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,910
Go now.

724
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,830
Go away.

725
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,000
Not you. My daughter Gyeyoung.

726
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:52,460
Bring back my daughter Gyeyoung.

727
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,460
Gyeyoung.

728
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,880
Gyeyoung.

729
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,010
Gyeyoung!

730
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,690
Gyeyoung.

731
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,400
FAILURE IS THE 5G TO SUCCESS

732
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,700
LEE JINGEUN: LONG TIME NO SEE

733
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,540
What are you doing?

734
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,790
I'm making a late-night snack.

735
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:54,710
A late-night snack?

736
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,460
What in the world are you making?

737
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:06,010
I stole some rice cakes and fish cakes
from my mom's restaurant.

738
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,350
I haven't met anyone who hates <i>tteokbokki,</i>

739
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:09,970
so I wanted to bring you some.

740
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,430
Me?

741
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,020
Why?

742
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:17,020
When I was feeling down before,

743
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,900
you cooked me Michelin-level
late-night snacks every night.

744
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,320
I felt much better after eating good food.

745
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,950
So I wanted to return the favor.

746
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,040
But you put chopped onions in <i>tteokbokki</i>?

747
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,170
You taught me how to chop.

748
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,000
I like to use what I learn.

749
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,210
But…

750
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,550
are you supposed to put
bell peppers in <i>tteokbokki</i>?

751
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,380
I'm not sure.

752
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,100
Well, I tried chopping that too.

753
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,100
-You know how to make it, right?
-I can't say I do for sure.

754
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,810
But there is a first time for everything,

755
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,730
and it's good to challenge oneself.
So I try various things--

756
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,770
-So you don't know how.
-Bingo.

757
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,280
Would you be upset if I were to help you?

758
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:04,690
What do you mean?

759
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:07,700
I've been waiting for you to say that.

760
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:12,200
-Did you taste it properly?
-Yes.

761
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,710
You can't dump them all…
Should we add some more water?

762
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:18,710
I'll manage it.

763
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:20,340
-I should put in noodles, right?
-Yes.

764
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,630
-How much? This much?
-A little more, please.

765
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:30,300
Put some over here too.

766
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:43,780
What do you think?

767
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,320
Given my career, I'm particularly picky
when it comes to taste.

768
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,700
It's surprisingly good. It's delicious.

769
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,080
-Try it.
-It's good, right?

770
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,210
Yes.

771
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:24,480
Did something bad happen?

772
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,570
Why do you ask?

773
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,110
Just asking.

774
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,240
No, nothing happened.

775
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,370
I'm relieved.

776
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,620
<i>That's a lie.</i>

777
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:46,750
<i>The feeling I've been sensing from you
for a while now is…</i>

778
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,760
<i>sadness.</i>

779
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:58,640
<i>I was right.</i>

780
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,270
I'm sorry. I keep remembering something.

781
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,770
It's my fault.

782
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,610
It's all because of you.

783
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:11,110
You took my daughter away from me!

784
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,370
Are you okay?

785
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,080
How about you?

786
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,500
I'm fine.

787
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,840
How could you be fine? You shouldn't be.

788
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,890
You don't have to worry.
It happens all the time.

789
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,730
I'm used to it.

790
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,900
I'm perfectly fine.

791
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,230
That's even more heart-breaking.

792
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,570
Dahyun--

793
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,760
<i>It's just because
her feelings are linked to me.</i>

794
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,050
<i>She's crying because of me,</i>

795
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,510
<i>and her feelings are
just being transferred to me.</i>

796
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,850
<i>I'm definitely not crying</i>

797
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:23,390
<i>because I feel sad.</i>

798
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,310
<i>Because I…</i>

799
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,480
<i>am fine.</i>

Why is my heart fluttering again? Why?
