LINK

2
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,526
I'm busy right now.

3
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,462
Are you feeling better now?

4
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,091
What about you?

5
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,586
Let me just make this clear.

6
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,217
I'm totally fine.

7
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,851
And…

8
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,558
If you think I was crying
just a while ago, I--

9
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,733
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

10
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,072
What is it?

11
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,493
<i>Where are you?
You're with that chef, aren't you?</i>

12
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,334
Lower your voice. I'm--

13
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,448
Yes, I'm with him.

14
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,124
We're not doing anything.

15
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,495
Nothing's going on.
We only held hands once.

16
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,924
Just hang up.

17
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,797
Jeez.

18
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,101
-Wine?
-Yes, let me drink myself to death.

19
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,939
I'm sorry, but this isn't that strong.

20
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,983
Then I guess
I'll just have to die of humiliation.

21
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,534
It's okay. I'm used to it.

22
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,998
What's her problem?
My mom is going to be the death of me.

23
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,205
You're just like her.

24
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,100
We were crying and now we're laughing.
Hilarious, right?

25
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,231
Not really.

26
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,019
Don't you feel better after crying?

27
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,229
-Not at all.
-Really?

28
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,018
Whenever I cry,

29
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,438
it feels liberating because I can vent
all my pent-up emotions.

30
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,447
Let me repeat what I just said.
I'm totally fine all the time.

31
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,281
So there's nothing to vent.

32
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,036
Plus, I didn't even cry.

33
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,662
I see. You're embarrassed.

34
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,122
Right. You didn't cry.
I didn't see anything.

35
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,711
I understand.

36
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,712
It's true that I was shedding tears,
but I wasn't crying…

37
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,796
What?

38
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,764
I know this sounds crazy,

39
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,142
but I…

40
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,514
can feel

41
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,602
your emotions.

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,890
What?

43
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,437
I know it's hard to believe.

44
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:54,233
But whenever you feel
upset, sad, or happy,

45
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,817
I also feel

46
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,413
upset, sad, or happy.

47
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,076
But please don't misunderstand.
It doesn't happen all the time.

48
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,542
It comes and goes. It's very irregular.

49
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,750
Actually, that's not true.

50
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,964
It happens quite often.

51
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,206
I feel

52
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,466
your emotions quite often.

53
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,724
Why?

54
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,888
Beats me. I'm curious as well.

55
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,233
I know you can't believe me.
And you don't have to.

56
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,148
But in any case, I came clean.

57
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,407
You have a superpower.

58
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,452
Fine. You can tease me.

59
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,157
Can you fly too?

60
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,453
I'll practice.

61
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,495
That's enough.

62
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,134
Fine. Then guess
what I'm thinking right now.

63
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,592
If you do, I'll take you seriously.

64
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,132
I just told you that I sometimes feel
your emotions, not read your thoughts.

65
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,587
Whatever the case may be, try it. Okay?

66
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,385
All right.

67
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,553
<i>It was all fun and games.</i>

68
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,553
<i>I was just going to tease him</i>

69
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,719
<i>for his childish joke
about feeling my emotions.</i>

70
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,572
<i>Now, it's the lighting
that's shining down on him.</i>

71
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,281
<i>I didn't want to have any butterflies.</i>

72
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,235
<i>I wasn't going to fall for him again.</i>

73
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,406
FLUTTER

74
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:20,589
FLUTTERING

75
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,411
<i>You're in no position
to feel such emotions.</i>

76
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,953
<i>You just said that you wouldn't
get involved with another man.</i>

77
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:56,171
So why is my heart fluttering again? Why?

78
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,632
Mommy…

79
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,003
Should we tell Dahyun…

80
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,258
EPISODE 6

81
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,049
…about that fridge guy's sister?

82
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,345
Or should we not?

83
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,306
Look at you.

84
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,234
Same goes for you.

85
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,108
You're right.

86
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,445
What's wrong with you today?

87
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,799
Hey.

88
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,675
I think I've gone crazy.

89
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,798
What's wrong this time?

90
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,925
<i>But is it so wrong to feel this way?</i>

91
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,893
<i>Isn't everyone like this?</i>

92
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,813
I tend to be fickle, don't I?

93
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,022
That's right.

94
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,981
<i>Yes. It's much better
to have butterflies for someone</i>

95
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,812
<i>than to hate them.</i>

96
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,568
That's right. What's so wrong
about having feelings

97
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,490
for another human being?

98
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,819
It's just my love for mankind.

99
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,494
That's what it is. Of course, it is.

100
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,330
Has she gone insane?

101
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,096
Jeez.

102
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,889
You're terrifying.

103
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,031
<i>In any case,
there's one thing I know for sure.</i>

104
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,087
<i>After crying and laughing
together last night…</i>

105
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,519
<i>we bonded even more.</i>

106
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,061
Did--

107
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,490
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

108
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,122
The weather is lovely. Right?

109
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,495
Yes.

110
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,916
Is there anything I can do?

111
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,003
No.

112
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,965
-The sweet corn arrived.
-Yes.

113
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,600
Look at that beef.

114
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,517
Yes.

115
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,447
Did I do something?

116
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,157
No.

117
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,831
Then why are you acting like that?

118
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,503
Isn't it common courtesy to look
at someone when they're talking?

119
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,630
Good?

120
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,756
Are you being petty
because I was cold to you last time?

121
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,879
Then I get it.

122
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,178
What do you take me for?

123
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,679
Actions speak louder than words.

124
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,851
I'm not the petty type.

125
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,678
But you act like one.

126
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,191
It feels like you blocked my number
and didn't reply to my text

127
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,061
without telling me why.

128
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,741
You know what?
I thought we bonded a bit last night.

129
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,525
Was I mistaken?

130
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,623
You see…

131
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,707
I didn't start this business
to make friends.

132
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,456
And I have no plans
to become closer to anyone either.

133
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,915
I didn't come here to make friends either.

134
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,587
I'm glad we're on the same page.

135
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,965
But I didn't come here
to work like a dog either.

136
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,635
I'm not a robot or anything.

137
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,765
Sure. We work to make money.

138
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,232
Who joins a company
with the intention of finding a boyfriend

139
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,773
or new friends?

140
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,236
But you still chat with your colleagues
and sometimes even befriend them.

141
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,778
Do you go to school solely to study?

142
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,990
You make new friends there too.

143
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,832
You sometimes go to church or a temple
to pray and end up finding your love.

144
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,535
<i>What am I spewing?</i>

145
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,502
Darn it.

146
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,003
<i>She's gone insane.</i>

147
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:54,087
My one and only daughter has gone crazy.

148
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,301
Lucky you.

149
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:56,972
What?

150
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,760
That's just one daughter for you.

151
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,894
But both my daughter
and granddaughter are crazy.

152
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,892
I'm not that crazy.

153
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,152
You're hurting my feelings.

154
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,029
Mom! It's her!

155
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,115
Who?

156
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,514
Have you been well?

157
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,876
I guess so.

158
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,795
What a relief. I was worried
since you didn't look so well.

159
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,557
What's wrong with my face?

160
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,523
It's pale as if you're sick
or guilty about something.

161
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,478
It probably looks that way
because I have very fair skin.

162
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,112
I have pretty good skin.

163
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,741
I see.

164
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,330
I thought you were avoiding me,
so I thought you had done something wrong.

165
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,660
What are you? A cop?

166
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,827
What's it to you
if I did something wrong or not?

167
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,630
Is that a no then?

168
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,295
Oh, my. The way you two
are glaring at me is frightening.

169
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,045
That was a compliment.

170
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,257
You have sparkling, powerful eyes.

171
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,098
Why are you explaining yourself?

172
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,936
Have you still not seen him?

173
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,399
Of course not.

174
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,992
Look at that. You replied
without even looking at the photo.

175
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,565
Only our regulars come here to eat.

176
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,954
We never have new customers.

177
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,245
I see.

178
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,335
In that case…

179
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,345
Has she caught on?

180
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,855
Let's say that's the case.

181
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,146
No. You're right.

182
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,777
But we don't have time for this.

183
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,947
As you know, I have my own matters--

184
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:27,912
You're right.

185
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,412
And I have mine.

186
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,406
I haven't forgotten.

187
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,132
How could I
when the fridge is still there?

188
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,841
Fridge?

189
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,591
But I want to forget about it.

190
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,795
I don't want to cry about what happened
every time I look at that fridge.

191
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,061
Lee Jingeun is going to come back anyway.

192
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,231
I don't want to wait
while trembling in fear.

193
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,851
I refuse to be intimidated.

194
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,940
I'm going

195
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,611
to live my life the way I want to.

196
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,744
Let's be honest. I have nothing to fear.

197
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,161
-I've already killed--
-Jeez.

198
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,833
I tripped and fell on my way in.

199
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,127
Come in and help us.

200
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,748
Okay.

201
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,675
You!

202
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,348
How much did you hear?

203
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,234
From the part
where you acted very obnoxiously

204
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,312
till right before Dahyun
was going to spew nonsense.

205
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,187
That's right.

206
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,196
It's nonsense. Do you understand?

207
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,778
Don't worry.

208
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,155
Eunjung didn't hear anything either.

209
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,446
But…

210
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,333
But?

211
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,291
You were being a scumbag to Dahyun.

212
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,632
I'm pretty sure I wasn't that mean.

213
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,460
Yes, you were. You were awful.

214
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,553
It's better that way.

215
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,102
Does it really torment you
that much to feel her emotions?

216
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,428
Yes. It's annoying. I hate it.

217
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,024
What do you hate so much about it?

218
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,349
Everything.

219
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,022
Every time…

220
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,646
<i>she cries, laughs, and is startled,</i>

221
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,398
it annoys me.

222
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,110
But most of all…

223
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,052
Most of all?

224
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,684
What is it?

225
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,295
Look closely at my face.

226
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,845
Come on. Take a good look.

227
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,357
How do you feel? Is your heart fluttering?

228
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,605
Am I really that handsome?

229
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,041
Why are you so nosy?

230
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,238
I wasn't being nosy.

231
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,947
Are you a reporter? A cop?

232
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,618
-Are you interrogating me?
-When did I?

233
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,540
What's with that gaze? I don't like it.

234
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,165
-You complimented my eyes before.
-When did I ever do that?

235
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,213
Every night.

236
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,586
When, where, what time?

237
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,273
<i>How could I
when the fridge is still there?</i>

238
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,533
What's the matter?

239
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,695
Nothing.

240
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,865
I was wondering why he didn't use this.

241
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,164
I see.

242
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,998
I guess he doesn't need it for now.

243
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,133
Right.

244
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,920
He doesn't need it.

245
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,187
<i>Lee Jingeun is going to come back anyway.</i>

246
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,769
<i>I don't want to wait
while trembling in fear.</i>

247
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,779
<i>Let's be honest. I have nothing to fear.</i>

248
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,794
I don't like the way…

249
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,461
that girl's looking at Dahyun.

250
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,171
Are you that irritated?

251
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,140
Yes.

252
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,800
Are you irritated because she is?

253
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,257
Or is that your own emotion?

254
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,311
Can you even differentiate them?

255
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,305
How can you tell
whose emotions you're feeling?

256
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:10,977
I know this for sure.

257
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,695
This desire to sew your mouth shut
comes from me.

258
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,870
Like I said before,
I have no time to think about that.

259
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,252
I'm not here
to do something like that with her.

260
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,170
Something like that? What exactly?

261
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,035
My top priority right now is…

262
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,633
What if that kid's
colluding with that fridge guy's sister?

263
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,337
Just smile for now.

264
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,983
Hello.

265
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,029
Gyehoon, the ladies are acting strange.

266
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,281
Maybe they feel guilty about something.

267
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,213
Hey.

268
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,868
I'm glad you're here.

269
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,996
We're not here to see you.

270
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,963
We just came
to have some noodles over there.

271
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,882
We're busy people, you know?

272
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,763
Still, you should try some of this.

273
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,220
Yellowtail season will be over soon.

274
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,931
This just came from Jeju Island.

275
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,181
Here.

276
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,559
How is it?

277
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,351
Make sure you charge him for that.

278
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,644
Of course.

279
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,397
It's so fresh.

280
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,859
I just need some rice and <i>gochujang</i>.

281
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,277
Of course, we've got some rice here.

282
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,989
Do you think they feel guilty too?

283
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,963
Yes.

284
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:53,126
Even if that wasn't the case,
I'm still not welcome here.

285
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,553
I think that cop
is happy to see you, though.

286
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,097
I heard you're that kid.

287
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,597
You remember me, don't you?

288
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,021
-It's me.
-Wait.

289
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,562
Hello.

290
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I knew it. So you do remember me.

291
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,065
We met at the patrol unit a few days ago.

292
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,530
No, we also met before that.

293
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,411
A very long time ago.

294
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,117
Right.

295
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,409
Yes. It's me.

296
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,657
Your Mr. Policeman. Your hero.

297
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,866
Your Iron Man! Your John Wick!

298
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,550
I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that.

299
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,926
I was the one who caught the suspect.

300
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,547
-That makes me a hero.
-He was let go soon after.

301
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,939
No one was as dedicated
to the case as I was.

302
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,645
I solved everything singlehandedly!

303
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,068
The culprit is still at large.

304
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,909
<i>Requesting rescue.</i>

305
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,582
<i>Girl. Age, ten. Height, about 130cm.</i>

306
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,411
<i>She didn't come home from school.</i>

307
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,956
<i>Red skirt. Carrying a pink backpack.</i>

308
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,288
Is it a missing case?

309
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,626
Let's go.

310
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,974
It would've been better

311
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,677
had the kid's family and school
taken better care of her.

312
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,890
Don't you agree?

313
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,400
Bye.

314
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,241
They even have radish here.

315
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,121
Weren't you buying potatoes?

316
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,036
What?

317
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,495
Right.

318
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,424
They're very fresh.

319
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,379
<i>Is it a missing case?</i>

320
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,934
<i>Age, ten. Height, about 130cm.</i>

321
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,548
<i>Red skirt. Carrying a pink backpack.</i>

322
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,635
-I need to go.
-What?

323
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,856
Red skirt. Pink backpack.

324
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,033
Red skirt. Pink backpack.

325
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,912
Gyeyoung.

326
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,343
<i>Eun Gyeyoung.</i>

327
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,340
<i>Where are you?</i>

328
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,394
Gyeyoung, where are you?

329
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,390
Come on out.

330
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,809
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,805
Gyeyoung!

332
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,062
I'll…

333
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,187
Who are you? Get your hands off of her.

334
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,867
You're okay now.

335
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:19,964
<i>Gyehoon.</i>

336
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,096
Why couldn't you find me?

337
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,101
Why haven't you been able to find me?

338
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,065
Mister, are you okay?

339
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,206
What? Yes, I'm fine.

340
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,213
Are you okay?

341
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,924
He offered to take me to my mom.

342
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,473
I'll take her to the police.

343
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,102
If you're worried, you can come with us.

344
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,266
<i>Dr. Eun's son…</i>

345
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,346
<i>has returned.</i>

346
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,316
WIFE
DR. EUN'S SON HAS RETURNED

347
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,003
SAFETY FIRST

348
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,338
Leaving already?

349
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,046
We're extremely busy at the moment.

350
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,887
Why did you tell me to come here?

351
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,481
Did you see him?

352
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,108
-Answer me.
-Cut that nonsense.

353
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,938
Fine. Drive safely.

354
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,604
Dahyun!

355
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,602
Have you seen her?

356
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,935
What…

357
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,898
What the hell are you doing?

358
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,320
-Are you okay?
-What was that? Are you okay?

359
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,083
I think I could sue you for assault.

360
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,407
Oh, no.

361
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,542
He was teaching me
self-defense techniques.

362
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,143
I won't sue you, so get out of the way.

363
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,635
This time, I'll grab you from the back.

364
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,018
-I know how to do it.
-Do you?

365
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,193
-I'll begin. I'll grab you--
-Okay.

366
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,816
That's enough.

367
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,736
What's it to you?

368
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,360
What's it to me? I'm her--

369
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,908
I'm her boss.

370
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,959
Ms. Noh,
shouldn't you be working right now?

371
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,211
Yes. But I don't have anything to do.

372
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,804
I don't know when we'll open

373
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,339
or if we ever will,
but I should still work nonetheless.

374
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,887
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

375
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,641
Free up your schedule some time,
and I'll give you a full course

376
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,523
without your power-tripping boss
interrupting us.

377
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,679
Power-tripping?

378
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,113
We're going to have
a soft opening at the end of this month.

379
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,402
That means we will be extremely busy.

380
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,117
We'll come up with a few more dishes.

381
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,118
Yes, sir.

382
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,753
Jinhoo, check the kitchen equipment,
dishes, oven,

383
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,408
and grill for the last time.

384
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,746
And we're going to see
if our movements don't clash.

385
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,882
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

386
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,878
And…

387
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,549
Continue updating the menu guide

388
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,973
and revise the service manual
to befit our restaurant.

389
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,012
Frequently check
the tables, chairs, floor,

390
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,596
ceiling, and lights for any dust.

391
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,982
Keep practicing folding the napkins.
You're still terrible at it.

392
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,729
Look up more menu designs.

393
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,191
Have you studied the basics of wine?

394
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,981
You'll need to study the ingredients
to explain them to our customers.

395
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,145
Which means you'll be reading quite a bit.

396
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:42,364
And call all the farms we purchase from
and write down their harvest seasons.

397
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,697
I'll be planting a few more
edible flowers in the rooftop garden,

398
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,833
so don't forget to water them
every morning when you show up to work.

399
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,843
Hey. Mister.

400
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,310
Stop right there.

401
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,526
A girl went missing, Mr. Han.

402
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,662
She's ten and about this tall.

403
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,409
Doesn't she remind you of someone?

404
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,334
Eun Gyeyoung. The girl you kidnapped.

405
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,671
They just happen to be the same age.

406
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,995
What a huge coincidence, don't you think?

407
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,675
Thank you.

408
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,805
You're in trouble if your alibi is fake.

409
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,850
Jeez. There he goes again.

410
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,774
Does he not know
that we already found the girl?

411
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,903
Does he do that often?

412
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,730
Just answer me, will you?

413
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:03,779
Now that I know the story, I understand.
You'd question the most suspicious first.

414
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,532
It's pretty difficult
for someone to turn over a new leaf.

415
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,122
Culprits tend to do
the same evil deed over again.

416
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,123
Get branded once, and it's over for good.

417
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,365
Just like me.

418
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,091
You've already branded me

419
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,842
as a lost cause.

420
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,218
Where is the girl? Tell me.

421
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,560
Where is she? Come on.

422
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,270
It…

423
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,104
wasn't me.

424
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,557
Mr. Han,

425
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,479
do you know who I ran into today?

426
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,106
Eun Gyeyoung's older brother, Eun Gyehoon.

427
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,025
He told me
about how we let go of the suspect

428
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,615
and how the culprit was still at large.

429
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,334
So…

430
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,423
just come clean, Mr. Han.

431
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,578
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

432
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,630
Was it me? Did I kidnap her?

433
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,013
The girl was found.

434
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,930
I just got a text
that she was reunited with her parents.

435
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,636
You can go, Mr. Han.

436
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,481
Saved by the bell once again.

437
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,619
Don't think you're off the hook just yet.

438
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,544
I'll see to it that you go behind bars.

439
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,134
You're still here?

440
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,394
No one's waiting for me at home anyway.

441
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,064
Let's go.

442
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,976
I need to buy some writing supplies.
I'll walk you to the subway station.

443
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,372
Did you know we just walked 200 meters
without saying anything?

444
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,750
How do you even go on dates?

445
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,079
You must've been bored.

446
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,877
What dish do you enjoy making the most?

447
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,513
Is this an interview?

448
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,182
You're terrible
at making small talk, aren't you?

449
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,599
I'm not good at chatting casually.

450
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,147
But you do fine with Dahyun.

451
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,572
Do I?

452
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,530
Speaking of which,
what do you think of her?

453
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,701
She's pretty and cute.

454
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,949
She's still new to this job,
but she seems hard-working.

455
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,990
Is that so?

456
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,908
Don't tell me you guys are already dating.
Dating in secret?

457
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,172
No. Not at all.

458
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,545
That's ridiculous.

459
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,628
Really?

460
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,092
Then I'm relieved.

461
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,106
SKELETAL REMAINS FOUND
IN A MOUNTAIN IN GUYANG, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

462
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,198
REVEALED TO BE A JANE DOE

463
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,384
You can go ahead.

464
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,969
You're too boring to walk together.

465
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,434
I'll get going then.

466
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:15,197
<i>That friend of yours gave this to us.</i>

467
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,369
They're places
you can apply for another job.

468
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,908
Just take a look at them.

469
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,331
LOOKING FOR CAPABLE TALENT

472
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,934

473
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,641
to live my life the way I want to.

474
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,465
My life.

475
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,394
The way I want.

476
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,395
TO YOU WITHOUT DREAMS, LIFE IN THE GUTTER,
ARE YOU LOST?, IT'S OKAY TO BE PITIFUL

477
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,483
<i>Life in the Gutter.</i>

478
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,073
That hits home.

479
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,165
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

480
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,132
This door is always a nuisance.

481
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,228
Why isn't she home yet?

482
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,192
What is it? Did something happen again?

483
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,949
Myungsook, tell your mom
to stop by the restaurant. Okay?

484
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,282
-Make sure you tell her.
-Yes, ma'am.

485
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,371
Where is she?

486
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,964
What time is it?

487
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,169
Darn it. What was that for?

488
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,512
Why were you following my daughter?
What were you going to do to her?

489
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,008
Are you afraid I'd do something?

490
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,057
What's wrong?
Feeling guilty about something?

491
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,061
I have nothing to feel guilty about.

492
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,847
What? Do you want to crush my skull?

493
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,767
Are you curious?
Then keep following her, and you'll see.

494
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,818
Don't you dare touch my family.

495
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,106
Or I will crush that skull of yours.

496
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,486
Look who's talking.

497
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,035
If I find you at fault for anything,
I will kill you all.

498
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,698
What nonsense are you spewing?
Have you gone insane?

499
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,044
Are you picking a fight with me? Are you?

500
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,629
You're just impossible!

501
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,959
Goodness. Why are you fighting?

502
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,206
Jeez.

503
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,679
You're two adults fighting in public.

504
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,426
What if someone reports you to the police?

505
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,849
Look at that.
Afraid of the police, are you?

506
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,274
Unlike you, I'm not because I'm innocent.

507
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,774
Are you crazy?

508
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,438
I don't have that many years to live,

509
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,197
so I was worried about dying alone.

510
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,621
But I found my partner.

511
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,327
Bury us together.

512
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,664
Are you crazy?
Why would I be buried with you?

513
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,577
Goodness.

514
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,287
Would you like that?

515
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,995
Or will you shut up

516
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,300
and go quietly on your way?

517
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,056
I'm home.

518
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,142
Are they asleep already?

519
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,110

How could I
when the fridge is still there?

524
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,176
I don't want to cry

525
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,261
about what happened
every time I look at that fridge.

526
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,947
Why are they messaging me
when I barely go on my social media?

527
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,004
Jeez. There are so many ads.

528
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,043
No, thanks.
I don't want to make money on the side.

539
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,418
What's wrong?

540
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,470
My mom and grandma are gone.

541
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,931
They're neither home nor here.

542
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,506
They must've gone somewhere.

543
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,057
They're strong individuals.

544
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,060
They can always hold their own.

545
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,352
The fridge.

546
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,435
Lee Jingeun messaged me.

547
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,856
He said that he wanted to meet
my family and friends.

548
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,862
He said he was watching from nearby.

549
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,833
Have you tried calling them?

550
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,119
Yes, but they left their phones at home.

551
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,497
Then I'll look around this neighborhood.

552
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,924
Stay home and lock the door.

553
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,673
No, let me go with you.

554
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,175
Okay. That would be safer.

555
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,102
Okay.

556
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,021
Mom.

557
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,061
Grandma.

558
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,445
What's wrong?

559
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,123
Did something happen to them?

560
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,543
Well…

561
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,538
She's a little shook up
because they're nowhere to be found.

562
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,131
Don't worry.

563
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,712
If anything, they're the ones
who'll do others harm.

564
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,126
Calm down. I'll help you find her, okay?

565
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,098
What's going on?

566
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,820
You seriously shouldn't
carry around those tools.

567
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,649
That little brat.
She left us behind and ran away.

568
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,985
Shut up and apologize.

569
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,450
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

570
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,570
This won't happen again.

571
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,327
This isn't your first time either.

572
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,238
What's wrong?

573
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,077
Grandma.

574
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,292
-Mom.
-Are you okay?

575
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,333
They were bored,
so they came out for a walk

576
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,497
with their tools.

577
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,797
Is that really that precious to you?
Why are you always carrying it around?

578
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,509
Huh?

579
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,344
Why?

580
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,179
Are you sure you're okay?

581
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,895
What's wrong with your face?

582
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,519
Exactly. Something happened to you, right?

583
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,824
What's wrong with--

584
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,570
Hold on. Why were you even together?

585
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,698
Are you guys dating or something?

586
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,083
Lee Jingeun is alive.

587
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,325
What?

588
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,584
He messaged me.

589
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,764
LEE JINGEUN

590
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,130
LEE JINGEUN
DIAGNOSIS: CONCUSSION

591
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,393
<i>Long time no talk.</i>

592
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,064
<i>What should I talk about first?</i>

593
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,022
<i>I'm trying to sort out my feelings.</i>

594
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,275
<i>The things you did
and your incomprehensible actions</i>

595
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,822
<i>hurt me pretty badly.</i>

596
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,790
BEFORE TAKING OFF MY MAKEUP

597
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,921
<i>I know I slightly hurt you.</i>

598
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,628
<i>But you hurt me first.</i>

599
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,922
<i>Don't you agree?</i>

600
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,295
<i>Will I truly be able to forgive you?</i>

601
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,223
<i>Good news.</i>

602
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,431
-How are you feeling?
<i>-I decided to forgive you.</i>

603
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,642
<i>You're all that I have.</i>

604
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,102
<i>I think I'll be discharged soon.</i>

605
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,354
<i>It won't take long.</i>

606
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,609
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

607
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,231
<i>But…</i>

608
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,858
<i>why aren't you checking my messages?</i>

609
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,204
<i>But why aren't you checking my messages?</i>

610
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,030
<i>But why aren't you checking my messages?</i>

611
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,235
<i>But why aren't you checking my messages?</i>

612
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,696
<i>But why aren't you checking my messages?</i>

613
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,754
<i>I'm getting discharged today.</i>

614
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,255
<i>I'm going to go see you.</i>

615
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,835
<i>Wait there.</i>

616
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,391
In the last message,

617
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,228
he said he was watching from nearby.

618
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,692
He said he wanted to meet
my family and friends.

619
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,489
-Thank you.
-Mom.

620
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,201
Thank you, Lord.

621
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,991
Mom. Grandma.

622
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,288
You're not a murderer.

623
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,909
You have nothing to worry about anymore.

624
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,667
Exactly. You have nothing to hide anymore.

625
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:23,722
You can live holding your chin up high.

626
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,507
Don't cry, you guys.

627
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:33,983
It's all over now.

628
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,989
Why are you crying?

629
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,158
Sorry?

630
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,950
Oh, him? He cries when others do.

631
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,331
That's not true.

632
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,334
Really? That's strange.

633
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,502
But you guys have to be
really careful from now on.

634
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,957
Don't worry about that.

635
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,916
We'll teach him a lesson
if he dares to appear.

636
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,216
Oh, dear. Had I known this would happen,

637
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,055
I would've told that lady so.

638
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,481
You're right.

639
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,518
What lady?

640
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,146
I don't know why you stayed behind

641
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,743
and watched our family cry.

642
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,243
But anyway,
thanks for looking for us with her.

643
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,243
Thank you. Thank you so much.

644
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,622
Please go in.

645
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,876
-Go in first.
-Why?

646
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,802
-Don't take too long.
-I won't. Don't worry.

647
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,892
Right away.

648
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,978
Thank you.

649
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,397
About…

650
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,491
Right.

651
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:12,914
Don't worry.

652
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,000
I'd like to stop here.

653
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,745
Unintentionally asking for so many favors.

654
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,303
I don't want to do that anymore.

655
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,259
This morning, you told me

656
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,183
that you didn't have time for this.
That you didn't want us to become closer.

657
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,352
<i>Your mom, your grandma…</i>

658
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,311
<i>and your new friends.</i>

659
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,522
<i>I plan on meeting them all soon.</i>

660
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,984
I don't want…

661
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,951
to get close to you anymore.

662
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,659
Good night.

663
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,930
<i>What lady?</i>

664
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,937
That crazy-looking colleague of yours.

665
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,570
She's Lee Jingeun's older sister.

666
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,203
<i>Of course, he should kill him.</i>

667
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,623
If anyone hurts my little brother,
I wouldn't have any mercy.

668
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,462
Until they cry and beg
saying they'd rather die,

669
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,289
I'd dedicate my entire life
to getting revenge.

670
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,759
His phone.

671
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,576
<i>Hello?</i>

672
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,167
<i>Hello?</i>

673
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,501
<i>Who are you?</i>

674
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,166
<i>Is it you, Dahyun?</i>

675
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,520
Just ignore it.

676
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,150
It's not me who's afraid.

677
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,080
Gyehoon, don't forget this.

678
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,365
You have to be good to me no matter what.

679
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,584
Imagine if I was a crybaby.

680
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,333
Imagine if I was in a bad mood.

681
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,964
Imagine if I was scared.

682
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,921
Then what would happen to you?

683
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,551
You'll become a crybaby
and a scaredy-cat just like me.

684
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,012
That's exactly why
you should always make me feel happy.

685
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,928
I'm not doing this for you!

686
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,984
I'm doing this for me!

687
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,178
Got that?

688
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,787
STEW RESTAURANT

689
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,879
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

690
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,221
Hello?

691
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,262
I'm not trying to be friendly or nosy.

692
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,766
But please trust me this once.

693
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,148
Cooking is the best way
to clear your head.

694
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,819
I need a large amount of pickle juice.

695
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,567
And I forgot that I had
to use all the beef tenderloin by today.

696
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:20,741
You learning a few simple recipes
will benefit the restaurant anyway.

697
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,155
<i>Right. I just received
some high-quality butter too.</i>

698
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,345
Eunjung.

699
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,477
I'd like to speak in private with her.

700
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,765
Sure. I think that would be good.

701
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,822
This is my responsibility anyway.
Don't worry.

702
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,825
I can see that you finally know

703
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:07,825
who I am.

704
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,615
I do.

705
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,117
Yes.

706
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,460
I'm here to find my brother.

707
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,875
He vanished one day,
and I couldn't track him down at all.

708
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:24,586
At first, I thought it was just a joke.
A prank.

709
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,425
But he never returned.

710
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,354
"What if something happened to him?"

711
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,812
"Was he scared? Did it hurt?"

712
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,193
"Did he resent me for not saving him?"

713
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,024
These questions torment me
every single day.

714
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,607
I can't even breathe.

715
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,188
I'm suffocating.

716
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,526
I think you can help me.

717
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,753
Please help me find him dead or alive.
Okay?

718
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,460
Why won't you answer me?

719
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,634
Why won't you say that you'll help me?

720
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,264
What if he's still alive?

721
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,971
What?

722
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,762
I'm sorry, sir.

723
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,644
We're not open yet.

724
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,934
It's okay. I'm just here to look around.

725
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:57,693
Sorry?

726
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,436
It's a long story.

727
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,111
You see,

728
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,822
this restaurant holds
special meaning to me.

729
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,538
I think you should leave--

730
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,711
This place looks much better
with the lights on.

731
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,250
It would be the best dating spot.

732
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,875
-When are you opening again?
-Excuse me.

733
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,922
My girlfriend lives across the street.

734
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,430
Who knows? I could be a regular.

735
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,680
So you should treat me nice.

736
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,524
We'll have to see
if you become a regular or not.

737
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,139
But for now, please leave.

738
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,306
Jeez.

739
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,444
How will you run a business like this?

740
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,817
Fine, fine.

741
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,281
Jeez. What a temper.

742
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,277
By the way…

743
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,084
I guess you're throwing it away.

744
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,292
Sorry?

745
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,752
I'll see you around.

746
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,011
<i>They said</i>

747
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,103
he could still be alive.

748
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,148
They all say that.

749
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,480
"I'm sure he's alive.
He probably just left home."

750
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,936
"He's probably okay somewhere."

751
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,275
That's not true.

752
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,610
He would've let me know
if he was still alive.

753
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,276
Maybe he had his reasons

754
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,494
for not contacting you.

755
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,538
So just wait.

756
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,294
And once he comes back,

757
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,036
we can talk.

758
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,421
I have a lot to say to you too.

759
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,337
Things you must hear.

760
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,902
What could this be?
What is this ominous feeling?

761
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,980
<i>Our sixth sense warns us
of imminent danger.</i>

762
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,986
This restaurant holds
special meaning to me.

763
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,780
<i>We feel anxious for no apparent reason
and sense an ominous feeling.</i>

764
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,236
<i>My girlfriend lives across the street.</i>

765
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,752
<i>I guess you're throwing it away.</i>

766
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,785
Lee Jingeun messaged me.

767
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,289
<i>He said he wanted to meet
my family and friends.</i>

768
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,535
I'll see you around.

769
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,297
<i>He said he was watching from nearby.</i>

770
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:28,964
You idiot!

771
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,640
<i>Where are you?</i>

772
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,351
Don't worry.
We talked, and I'm going home now.

773
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,595
<i>So where are you?</i>

774
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,817
I'm in an alley.

775
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,530
<i>Use the main road. Avoid the alleys.</i>

776
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,829
<i>This ominous feeling.</i>

777
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,130
No. Just stay there.

778
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,211
<i>I'm on my way, so don't hang up--</i>

779
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,069
<i>Dahyun.</i>

780
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,689
Dahyun.

781
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,111
Noh Dahyun!

782
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:47,634
<i>My entire body is emitting
an inexplicable signal.</i>

783
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,670
<i>A warning, perhaps.</i>

784
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,697
<i>"Run!"</i>

785
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,233
LINK

786
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,395
<i>Had I known he was still alive,</i>

787
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,864
<i>I would've made sure he was dead for good.</i>

788
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,531
<i>Dahyun's nightmares are back.</i>

789
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,743
<i>I hope you won't have
any nightmares tonight.</i>

790
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,001
<i>Why would your stalker come after him?</i>

791
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,370
<i>He must think
we have a special relationship.</i>

792
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,707
<i>-Like what?
-Lovers.</i>

793
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,843
<i>Don't shove your face in front of me.</i>

794
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,010
<i>This is all because
of that scumbag, Eun Gyehoon.</i>

795
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,554
<i>Lee Jingeun won't stop
until he gets what he wants.</i>

796
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,354
<i>Grandma.</i>

797
