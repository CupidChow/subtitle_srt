Dahyun. Stay with me, okay? Dahyun.

00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,647
<i>I finally get it, Gyehoon.</i>

4
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,018
<i>I finally understand
why we're linked together.</i>

5
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,529
<i>I had forgotten the promise</i>

6
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,025
<i>that I had made decades ago.</i>

7
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,370
Gyehoon.

8
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,663
She wanted me to tell you this.

9
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,798
<i>Gyehoon. Remember this.</i>

10
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,635
It's not your fault.

11
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,926
It's really not your fault.

12
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,144
So stop crying.

13
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,805
<i>Promise me.</i>

14
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,990
Jungho.

15
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,502
Jungho! Are you in there?

16
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,706
An Jungho!

17
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,244
Lt. An.

18
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,251
Jungho.

19
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,876
Jungho, open your eyes.

20
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,708
Please open your eyes.

21
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,389
I came too late. I'm so sorry, Jungho.

22
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,677
-It's damp in here.
-Oh, my goodness.

23
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,267
Hey, you scumbag.

24
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,903
Hey. Were you alive?

25
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,480
I almost died. Happy?

26
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,397
Thank you.

27
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,281
Thank you so much for being alive.

28
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,117
You're suffocating me.

29
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,622
Jungho, let me untie you. Hold on.

Dahyun is okay.

32
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,794
That's what the doctor said.

33
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,457
He said she needs surgery
but it's not life-threatening.

34
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,166
He said not to worry.

35
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,802
He said Dahyun is fine.

36
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,465
I'm sorry. I…

37
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,429
I should've gotten there sooner.

38
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,846
Don't be sorry.
I'm thankful you were there.

39
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,058
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

40
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,236
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,557
Should we be worried
that she's sleeping so much?

42
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,024
Some people take longer to recover.
She'll be fine.

43
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,234
Thank you.

00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,338
The body in the fridge.

47
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,880
The owner of that fish store
killed that guy and put him in the fridge.

48
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,835
Look.

49
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,878
He even kidnapped Lt. An.

50
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,008
And he was the one who hurt Dahyun.

51
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,392
How could someone be this two-faced?

52
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,772
He looked like a good man.

53
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,309
That's not all.

54
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,613
Rumor has it that he was
the killer from 18 years ago.

55
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,901
Seriously?

56
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,857
Did he confess to it?

57
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,703
No.

58
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,621
Eighteen years ago,
Eun Gyeyoung was kidnapped…

59
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,791
<i>The man didn't confess
to the incident from 18 years ago.</i>

60
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,838
<i>The boy who acted out because
he thought his dad was a murderer</i>

61
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,467
<i>finally started to reconcile</i>

62
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,556
<i>with his dad and himself.</i>

63
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,177
So what you're saying is…

64
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,469
Father probably passed away.

65
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,280
This was his.

66
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,287
I'm sorry

67
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,621
for not telling you sooner.

68
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,342

anything anymore.

FINAL EPISODE

77
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,060
Near-death experience, was it?

78
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,114
Those who experience that

79
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,192
have this great realization about life.

80
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,988
Imagine how I feel

81
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,372
after almost having killed someone
and being killed myself.

82
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,659
I agree.

83
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,332
I've become very understanding
of all things in life.

84
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,832
I've reflected on myself
and learned from it.

85
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,245
I'm willing to forgive
everything and anything.

86
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,705
Me too.

87
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,835
After what happened to you,

88
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,092
I didn't see the point in trying so hard

89
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,344
to succeed in this short lifetime.

90
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,262
Everything else doesn't matter.

91
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,807
You just need to be healthy and safe.

92
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,557
-Mom.
-My daughter.

93
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,685
Goodness.

94
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,065
Look at you two.
This must be why ordeals are important.

95
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,990
I'm so proud of you.

96
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,117
But these side dishes…

97
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,120
Vegetables are good for you.

98
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,207
I know that.

99
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,037
But you should feed
your recovering daughter some meat.

100
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,168
It's just this once.

101
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,303
I've always prepared good food for you.

102
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,012
The vegetables are half-cooked.

103
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,095
They're cooked enough.

104
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,310
Did you expect porridge or something?

105
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,636
Don't raise your voice.

106
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,436
I'm sorry.

107
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:20,158
By the way, didn't you say
you were going to start studying today?

108
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,869
-I thought I just needed to be healthy.
-Even still,

109
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,582
you should find a job
and support yourself.

110
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,707
How can I buy any meat
if we don't have any money?

111
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,838
Understanding and short lifetime, my foot.

112
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,505
I will. I'm going to study today.

113
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,016
I don't think
that's where you got stabbed.

114
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,988
Not that leg. The other leg.

115
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,613
-Pardon?
-The other day,

116
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,106
you were limping on the other leg.

MIJIN REAL ESTATE

118
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,885
What do you do when you miss someone?

119
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,099
I picture them in my head.

120
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,261
I'm okay.

121
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,681
Because…

122
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,805
<i>What if I still miss them?</i>

123
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,929
I imagine that they're by my side.

124
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,856
Aren't you hungry? Wait just a little bit.
I'll make you something.

Cheers.

00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,135
<i>I imagine us being together.</i>

129
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,133
It's been a while.

130
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,600
Right.

131
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,309
Let's go.

132
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,153
Coming home from the library?

133
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,940
Yes.

134
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,645
Are you the real Eun Gyehoon?

135
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,362
Is there a fake me?

136
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,994
Yes, there is.

137
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,569
What?

138
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,617
Dahyun!

139
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,871
You'll get wet.
Summer colds are the worst.

140
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,132
If you were that worried about me,
how could you disappear for a month?

141
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,048
I'm sorry for being late.

142
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,603
There's nothing to be sorry about.

143
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,599
I just…

144
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,311
I understand. But…

145
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,900
I'm thankful that you're here.

146
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,440
But do you think…

147
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,362
we can meet now?

148
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,372
We broke up.

149
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,790
I thought long and hard.

150
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,295
I thought so much about it
that it almost drove me insane.

151
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,216
And I just couldn't do it.

152
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,516
It's true that we're intertwined
by a complicated matter.

153
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,017
But there's only one thing
that I can't endure.

154
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,282
Not having you in my life.

155
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,565
Without you…

156
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,372
I'm nothing.

157
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,211
What a jerk.

158
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,498
Can't you use complete sentences?

159
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,302
-What?
-You scared me to death

160
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,670
when you said you couldn't do it.

161
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,008
How was I to know

162
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,136
if that meant you couldn't have me
in your life or you could?

163
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,020
-I'm sorry.
-I hate it.

164
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,860
So what? Do you want to get back together?

165
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,606
Yes.

166
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,992
But…

167
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,946
if you don't want that--

168
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,161
Then will you give up?

169
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,241
Of course not.

170
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,577
If you want to get back together…

171
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,624
Yes, I'm listening.

172
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,881
Win me over if you can.

173
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,886
Win you over?

174
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,477
I'll do it right now.

175
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,604
What? Right now?

176
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,765
EQUAL

177
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,783
What if I imagine them
and still miss them?

178
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,988
Then…

179
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,993
What can you do?

180
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,290
You'll just have to see them.

181
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,850
Going somewhere?

182
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,936
Yes, for a bit.

183
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,472
Hey, Mom.

184
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,045
Hey.

185
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,523
How's Dahyun? Is she doing well?

186
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,807
You're still a dad after all.

187
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,896
Yes, she's doing very well. Don't worry.

188
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,903
How could she not visit me even once?

189
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,395
You never visited either.

190
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,117
Of course not. I'm unwelcome there.

191
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,702
And you deserve it.

192
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,078
Be good to your current wife.

193
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,214
-That's all you need to do.
-Fine.

194
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,003
Noh Minkyu.

195
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,381
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.

196
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,884
I said okay.

197
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,010
I don't do that anymore.

198
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,466
But why are you not living with me?

199
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,941
It's been almost 20 years
since Bokhee and I got a divorce.

200
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,441
She's not your daughter-in-law anymore.

201
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,478
I'm telling you. You're not sane either.

202
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,567
Is that so?

203
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,291
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

204
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,641
<i>I knew my son would mistreat you,</i>

205
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,024
<i>but I kept my mouth shut.</i>

206
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,439
<i>I'm greatly at fault, Bokhee.</i>

207
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,480
<i>That's why I let you go.</i>

208
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,740
<i>But one day, you called me
and said Dahyun was missing.</i>

209
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,145
Mother, it's me.

210
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,567
What are you talking about?
What do you mean, Dahyun is gone?

211
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,576
Mother, I don't know what happened.

212
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,408
What do you mean, Dahyun is gone?

213
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,618
-Dahyun.
-Dahyun.

214
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,172
Dahyun!

215
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,674
<i>Then Dahyun lost her memory.</i>

216
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,763
<i>That's when I made up my mind.</i>

217
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,851
<i>I decided to stay by Dahyun's side
and act like your mother.</i>

218
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,278
Mom.

219
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,620
-You're back.
-Of course, I am.

220
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,080
Were you waiting for me?

221
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,923
Not really. I was just around the area.

222
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,499
-I was passing by.
-I see. Let's go.

223
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,101
Excuse me.

224
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,810
Are you serious?

225
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,440
This is a non-smoking area.
Who said you could smoke here?

226
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,778
What did you just say?

227
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,322
Why would you approach me like this?

228
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,574
What did you say?

229
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,366
Yap at me again.

230
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,832
Hey!

231
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,206
How comfortable
would my life have been without you?

232
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,293
What?

233
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,588
But it would've been boring.

234
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,465
Of course.

235
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,693
<i>Gyehoon returned to our neighborhood.</i>

236
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,149
Gaehoon!

237
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,238
There you are, cutie! I really missed you!

238
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,530
She missed Gaehoon more.

239
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,615
Hey.

240
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,076
Eunjung!

241
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,870
I can't believe it.

242
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,710
-Have you been well?
-I missed you.

243
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,459
I missed you too. You've become prettier.

244
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,000
I truly missed--

245
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,091
There's Gaehoon. Gaehoon!

246
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,759
-Gaehoon!
-How pretty!

247
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,758
Have you been well?

248
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,010
Didn't you miss us?

249
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,972
I missed you so much.

250
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,512
-They like Gaehoon more than us.
-How pretty.

251
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,926
-I think you've grown.
-What a good dog.

252
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,561
We're finally back here
and will open our restaurant.

253
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,435
It's really quite fascinating.

254
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,991
We moved for absolutely
no reason whatsoever.

255
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,494
I wonder if we'll successfully open
our restaurant this time around.

256
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,410
I'll see to it that we do no matter what.

257
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,130
I truly hope that there will be
no murder or knives being thrashed about.

258
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,336
-I'll keep that in mind.
-Me too.

259
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,981
<i>And once again, our everyday lives began.</i>

260
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,110
Smile more naturally.

261
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,237
Get closer.

262
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,568
Closer.

263
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,080
Which one should I put up
as my profile photo?

264
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,325
They all look similar to me.

265
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,875
I think you can pick
whichever one you want.

266
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,131
How can I do that
when this is our first photo together?

267
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,128
Pick one.

268
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,337
-This one looks nice.
-What?

269
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,693
<i>What could that smile mean?</i>

270
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,609
I was able to read
Dahyun's feelings thanks to our link.

271
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:41,072
But now, I can't read her at all.

272
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,954
She looked at me,

273
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,784
and I didn't know why.

274
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,577
"Is she mad? Is she not? Is she happy?"

275
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,211
"Does she want me to talk or not?"

276
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,078
I have no idea
if she wants me to stay or leave.

277
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,336
<i>-Perhaps only after our link got severed</i>
-It's too hard.

278
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,458
<i>did we finally get to know each other.</i>

279
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,224
Waiting in line for some delicious food

280
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,763
was on your bucket list.

281
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,307
<i>At times, he's a bit slow.</i>

282
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,729
It's nice.

283
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,693
And you just had to pick the gloomiest
and most humid day of all. It's nice.

284
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,981
<i>But it's fun to tease him too.</i>

285
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:21,992
Is it that humid?

286
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,994
Yes, so why would you fan me?

287
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,195
<i>He's cute.</i>

288
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,197
It helps.

289
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,495
SUSHI SANGMU

290
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,593
This is really good. I'm on cloud nine.

291
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,092
I'm glad waiting in line paid off.

292
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,644
On a gloomy and humid day.

293
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,305
Honey.

294
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,436
I don't think
I could ever do that in a public--

295
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,277
I'll just have it.

296
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,036
No. I can do it. I really can.

297
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,079
I even kissed you in public.
I'm not afraid of anything.

298
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,619
Please let me eat it.

299
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,756
-Isn't it tasty?
-Yes.

300
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,386
<i>She's scary at times.</i>

301
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,350
It's delicious.

302
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,732
Eat up.

303
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,268
<i>But she's adorable.</i>

304
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,574
Dating…

305
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,617
is really complicated.

306
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,159
It's not easy.

307
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,959
<i>He's cute.</i>

308
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:11,262
But after the link got severed,
we don't sync that well.

309
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,014
That's the downside.

310
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,020
Is she bad-mouthing or bragging about him?
Isn't she so annoying?

311
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,311
Let her be. All lovebirds brag like that.

312
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,516
Right. We went
to a karaoke room last time.

313
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,067
He said he didn't like singing in public,

314
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,201
but he sang all the songs
I wanted to sing.

315
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,948
-Why isn't he honest?
-This is really good and pretty-looking.

316
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,951
-You judge food by its look first.
-He lied that he couldn't sing.

317
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,294
-You're right.
-He should've been a singer.

318
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,749
I think the coffee tastes
even better because of the cup.

319
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,289
He could pass as an idol,
don't you think so?

320
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,373
Should he debut?

321
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,287
Stew, stop talking and start eating.

322
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,007
Come on.
Police, how's it going with you guys?

323
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,263
Stew, we'll take care of that,
so don't you worry about us.

324
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,662
We need to be careful.

325
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,964
If our seniors find out that we're dating,
it'll only be a headache for us.

326
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,041
Don't you worry.

327
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,205
What should we do today?

328
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,383
I'm not sure. What do you want to do?

329
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,843
How about a movie? Or a drink?

330
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,974
A drink in broad daylight?

331
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,471
Do you not like that?

332
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,812
Of course, I do.
I like everything you like.

333
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,059
I like that answer.

334
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,096
I knew it.

335
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,897
Is she doing the right thing?

336
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,649
What do you mean?

337
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,147
We should let her go, right?

338
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,319
Be happy, Minjo.

339
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,454
FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
CORRECTION OF HOPE

340
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,774
You look good.

341
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,104
How's the food?

342
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,017
How is it in there?

343
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,277
Won't you tell me?

344
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,865
If you tell me where Gyeyoung is,

345
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,199
I'll do everything I can.

346
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,746
I'll do everything you want me to do.

347
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,971
I should get going now.

348
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,017
Stop visiting me.

349
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,106
Don't come back here.

350
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,444
I'm sick and tired of this.

351
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,451
No, I'll come back.

352
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,027
I'll keep coming back.

353
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,828
I will find her at all costs.

354
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,116
See you later.

355
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,575
Why are you going this far?

356
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,706
Because it was all my fault.

357
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,008
It was me who brought you to Jihwa-dong.

358
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,513
And it was also me
who failed to save her when I could have.

359
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,723
I'm to blame.

360
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,604
Do you seriously think

361
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,805
I'll tell you?

362
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,444
Yes. Perhaps.

363
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,731
You didn't kill me.

364
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,567
You had your chance, but you chose not to.

365
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,454
So maybe…

366
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,819
you'll tell me.

367
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,495
Where did it go wrong?

368
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,287
I truly thought the world of you.

369
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,085
I can't believe that you've done
all those horrible things.

370
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,050
And I had no idea.

371
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,892
I'm going to treat you well

372
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,182
because this is the only way

373
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,979
I'll ever find her.

374
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,240
Jungho.

375
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,326
Do you remember the place
we used to hang out as kids?

376
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,747
I miss those days.

377
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,634
I suddenly miss them, Jungho.

378
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,390
So…

379
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,433
don't come back here.

380
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,687
I'm…

381
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,146
going to look for your sister.

382
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,119
I'm not certain,
but I think she's in my hometown.

383
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,584
I'll find her myself. Just tell me where.

384
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,536
Fine, you can find her. But I'll join you.

385
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,323
This is what finding a needle
in a haystack looks like.

386
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,111
I never asked you to come.

387
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,618
I'm jobless. I have nothing to do anyway.

388
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:55,615
Who knew you'd keep up
your promise with Wontak and resign?

389
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,785
You see, I'm a man of my word.

390
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:07,432
I'm going to get an excavator
and dig up this entire area

391
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,596
until I find her.

392
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,970
It'll cost you a hefty sum.

393
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,187
You'll have to borrow an excavator
and get permission from the land owner.

394
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,058
That's not all. You'll have to return
everything to its original state.

395
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,606
I know. I'm willing to spend
all the money I have.

396
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,650
If that's not enough,
I'll even borrow money

397
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:23,939
to find her.

398
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,532
Darn it.

399
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,037
My retirement savings.

400
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,503
I'm with you.

401
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,258
JIHWA WESTERN CUISINE

402
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,260
Eight bags of pasta.

403
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,054
Three cartons of whipping cream.
It's right.

404
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,387
-I'll take the pork neck.
-Okay.

405
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,124
JIHWA WESTERN CUISINE

406
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,740
They look good.

407
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,368
Pick out the ones
that are open or cracked.

408
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,921
-How is the sous vide?
-It's good.

409
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,264
-Pork neck?
-Sure.

410
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,470
It's good.

411
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,268
JIHWA WESTERN CUISINE

412
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,279
You look good.

413
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,528
But I think
it'd be better to tuck your hair in.

414
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,454
A seam came undone.

415
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,571
I see.

416
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,660

MANAGER NOH DAHYUN

417
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,506
I'm really nervous. What if no one comes?

418
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,098
-What if this place gets crashed again?
-Come on.

419
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,928
We've promoted enough on our social media.

420
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,426
They'll come to see our crybaby chef.

421
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,984
Don't worry. It'll pan out well.
I have a good feeling about this.

422
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:27,692
Then let's open our restaurant
while she's feeling hopeful.

423
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,896
Are you ready?

424
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,146
-Yes, chef.
-Yes, chef.

425
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,662
JIHWA WESTERN CUISINE

426
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,498
Hello.

427
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,329
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

428
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,714
Chef.

429
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,587
-Congratulations on the soft opening.
-What is this?

430
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,509
-You came all the way here?
-It wasn't that far.

431
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,258
-What's this?
-When's the official opening date?

432
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,970
It'll be one week after the soft opening.

433
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,341
-How are you?
-I'm famished.

434
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,387
-Sit down.
-Okay.

435
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,970
-The food will be out soon.
-Sit down.

436
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,101
-Hello.
-Is Eunjung here?

437
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,233
Oh, Eunjung.

438
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,099
-Eunjung.
-No way!

439
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,943
-Thank you so much for coming!
-Congratulations.

440
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,400
Thank you. Come again.

441
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,068
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

442
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,415
-We'll get it ready soon.
-Okay.

443
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,090
Okay. "Sherry, tartare, basil,
and scallops."

444
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,629
-"Sherry, tartare, basil, and scallops."
-"Sherry, tartare, basil, and scallops."

445
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,144
Here are your dishes.

446
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,716
This is tomato and bocconcini salad
with Sherry wine dressing.

447
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,152
<i>The opening was a success.</i>

448
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,687
<i>I spent my time working, dating,</i>

449
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,451
<i>and…</i>

450
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,532
<i>here.</i>

451
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,284
You didn't need to do this.

452
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,413
You can stop. I'll take over.

453
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,908
It's okay.

454
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,330
-I'm doing this because I want to.
-Not me.

455
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,451
I don't want to do this.

456
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,996
Digging isn't the problem.

457
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,750
Restoring the ground to its original state
is much more exhausting.

458
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:51,593
Even when I was up against
12 culprits at once,

459
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,130
it was a cakewalk.

460
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,474
But look at me now.
I'm kneeling on the ground.

461
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,386
Then don't bother restoring it.
You don't need to.

462
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,056
Hey, what gives you the right to say that?

463
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,731
Are you the landowner or something?

464
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,809
That's right.

465
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,112
I bought this land.

466
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,278
Wasn't that extremely annoying?

467
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,815
It sure was.

468
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,751
<i>Then came…</i>

469
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:28,995
<i>that day.</i>

470
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,569
<i>Some days…</i>

CHOONOK STEW

472
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,327
<i>…you open your eyes,</i>

473
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,285
<i>and something just feels off.</i>

474
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,676
Did you sleep well?

475
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,678
LIEUTENANT AN JUNGHO

FORENSICS

477
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,436
We found the remains

478
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,318
of a child and an adult male.

479
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,290
They'll need to carry out an inspection

480
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,616
to identify them.

481
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,007
<i>Finally,</i>

482
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:58,386
<i>I was reunited with my long-lost family.</i>

483
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:15,990
I'm sorry.

484
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,627
I'm sorry for being so late.

485
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,918
I'm sorry. I'm…

486
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,952
Get along well until we come home.

487
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,954
Gyehoon, make sure
to take care of your sister.

488
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:55,913
Did you hear that?

489
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,921
Hey, wait for me!

490
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,551
<i>Gyehoon.</i>

491
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:13,391
That's exactly why
you should always make me feel happy.

492
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:16,926
<i>No!</i>

493
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,024
-We're hungry.
-We're hungry.

494
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,269
-We're hungry.
-Okay.

495
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,811
No!

496
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,982
<i>Three!</i>

497
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:38,993
<i>Are you that happy?</i>

EUN CHULHO
EUN GYEYOUNG

499
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:43,893
Let's go.

500
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,436
Gyehoon.

501
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:55,947
After Gyeyoung went missing,

502
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,525
I hated the fact that I was still sane.

503
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,869
Despite losing my daughter,
I still ate on time,

504
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,037
took care of my looks,

505
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,418
and forced myself to smile
in front of others.

506
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,922
I felt like a monster.

507
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,432
So I forced myself to be insane.

508
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,721
It actually worked.

509
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,267
And I made you grow up all alone.

510
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,397
I was…

511
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,228
wrong.

512
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,989
I'll try.

513
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,283
It'll take some time.

514
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:46,196
But I'll take my medication
and receive counseling.

515
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,582
I'll try.

516
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,051
I'll try to get better.

517
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,010
Thank you.

518
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:03,311
<i>I hope both Mom and I</i>

519
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:08,439
<i>will stop blaming me
and put this behind us</i>

520
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,151
<i>just like you had hoped for.</i>

521
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,065
<i>Gyehoon. Remember this.</i>

522
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,820
It's not your fault.

523
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,818
It's really not your fault.

524
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,321
So stop crying.

525
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,566
Promise me.

526
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,130
<i>Okay. I will.</i>

527
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,163
Welcome back.

528
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,243
Thanks.

529
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,167
Let's go.

530
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,428
<i>Like so, things were back to normal.</i>

531
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,274
<i>It felt as if nothing had happened.</i>

532
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,613
<i>And time just flew by.</i>

533
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,189
Why are you doing this?
This is unlike you.

534
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,608
Don't you dare drink. Got that?

535
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,987
Have a sip, and you'll pay.

536
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,290
Fine.

537
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,912
And eat well.

538
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,748
Right. Honey.

539
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,748
-What is it this time?
-Come here.

540
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,258
You little…

541
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,256
Why did you tell me
to come here when it's so hot?

542
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:14,893
What is it?

543
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,188
They're divorce papers.

544
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,773
DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE

545
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,900
What's this? Is this why
you made me come all the way here?

546
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,994
Yes. This was why.

547
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,865
So stamp the papers.
I'll get this divorce this time around.

548
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,582
What did you say? You little…

549
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,375
That startled me.

550
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,800
The knife…

551
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,748
Have a safe trip.

552
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,119
Drive carefully.

553
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:20,498
How about some <i>makgeolli</i>
and beef ribs tomorrow?

554
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,780
Unlike our empty restaurant,

555
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,494
theirs is teeming with people.

556
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,197
Exactly.

557
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,873
Koreans should have rice,
not some western food.

558
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,205
Exactly.

559
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,504
But then again,

560
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,213
that restaurant is pretty much Dahyun's.

561
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,169
Who knows?

562
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,262
And what's hers is mine.

563
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,184
There was a fly.

564
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,154
-Drink up.
-Thanks.

565
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,573
Good work.

566
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,780
You too.

567
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,624
<i>Gyeyoung and Father taught me</i>

568
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,421
<i>that regretting something
means it is already too late.</i>

569
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,212
<i>I should tell her when I can.</i>

570
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,490
You're all done.

571
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,663
-I'll pay with this.
-Thank you.

572
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,950
Thank you.

573
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,665
Thank you so much.

574
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,134
Me too.

575
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,667
What's this about?
What were you two talking about?

576
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,052
Did you guys talk about
how much you love each other?

577
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,392
Then me too.

578
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,475
I want in.

579
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,690
It wasn't like that.

580
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,479
Don't lie. I'm totally right.

581
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,534
I made a reservation
at a tasty restaurant. Let's go eat.

582
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,398
Let's go eat!

583
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,107
Remember when you asked me

584
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,528
why I helped you?

585
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,912
That's because…

586
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,176
Bokhee.

587
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,311
It's you, right?

588
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,606
Jungho.

589
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,188
Do you live here?

590
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,399
What about you?

591
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,195
We just moved here.

592
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,029
It's nice to see you again.

593
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,618
Hello.

594
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,332
Hi.

595
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,212
Why are you staring at me like that?

596
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,587
You see,

597
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,343
for a very long time…

598
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,098
What?

599
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,559
Say it.

600
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,102
What an idiot.

601
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,110
All right, we're here.

602
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,614
You can either cross the street
or just go back home.

603
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:05,911
What do you want to do?

604
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,536
I'm not sure.

605
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,621
What should we do?

606
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:30,854
SEWOON POLICE STATION

607
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,202
Is that for our staff meal?

608
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:47,946
But it's my turn today.

609
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,578
You looked tired.

610
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,081
Seriously?

611
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,838
You seem like a pretty decent guy.

612
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,556
You too.

613
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,692
I don't think
you're all that scary or evil.

614
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,491
Are you done?

615
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,326
<i>There was one thing I realized
after my near-death experience.</i>

616
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,133
<i>A simple truth that everyone knows.</i>

617
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,387
<i>Tomorrow may be too late.</i>

618
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,272
<i>So I have to say it right now.</i>

619
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:52,979
I love you, Dahyun.

620
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,019
You beat me to it.

621
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,449
I love you too.

622
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:31,968
Hurry up.

623
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,892
Let's eat!

624
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,515
What are you doing?

625
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,402
Let's eat.

626
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,027
What?

627
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,662
Let's go.

628
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,780
Jeez.

629
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:35,829
Here.

630
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,424

631
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:26,185
