00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,024
Everything that is born dies

3
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,557
and all relationships come to an end.

4
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,812
That's the way life goes.

5
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,653
So you may grieve, but do not be sad.

6
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,239
The Buddha once said,

7
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,447
"Do not grieve. Do not lament.

8
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,411
All things must pass

9
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,412
-and everything vanishes. Therefore, you…"
<i>-Yes. Some are like that.</i>

10
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,035
<i>They overcome their grief and strive on.
They're admirable.</i>

11
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,713
"The mind is everything."

12
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,497
Bull… What a joke.

13
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,432
But it is.

14
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,260
Don't grieve? It's not like we'll all live
till we're 80 like Buddha did.

15
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,518
Am I wrong?

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,679
<i>Some are the opposite.</i>

17
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,517
<i>They struggle in pain
and can't get over it.</i>

18
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,857
<i>They're weak losers.</i>

19
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,277
<i>Just like me.</i>

20
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,909
Are you busy this weekend?

21
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,238
Yes.

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,830
<i>That's why I wasn't going to let anyone</i>

23
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,251
<i>or anything…</i>

24
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>get close to me ever again.</i>

25
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,772
<i>I didn't want to feel</i>

26
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,016
<i>so terrified like this…</i>

27
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,152
<i>ever again.</i>

28
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,017
Dahyun. Noh Dahyun!

29
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,931
Where are you going?

30
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,224
It's me.

31
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,853
Didn't you miss me?

32
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,571
I missed you so much.

33
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,992
Don't be scared. I'm not here to hurt you.

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,610
The things you did…

35
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,740
to me, I'm partly responsible for them.

36
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,787
They're all in the past.

37
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,580
You lunatic.

38
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,962
Don't be like that again.

39
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,339
All couples get into little fights,

40
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,708
so I completely understand. Okay?

41
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,255
Stop that nonsense.

42
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,509
We never dated.

43
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,549
Gosh, seriously.

44
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,223
I'm… trying to be understanding. Right?

45
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,137
I'm letting you win, got that?

46
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,113
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,697
I'm trying to reconcile things.

48
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,494
You just need to say one thing.

49
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,212
"I was too mean last time, right?
I'm sorry."

50
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,212
I guess that's two things. Whatever.

51
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,924
In any case, easy enough, isn't it?

52
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,303
You stubborn little…

53
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,217
Apologize now.

54
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,604
I can't.

55
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,385
What?

56
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,097
I mean, I won't.

57
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,153
Actually, I've been regretting it so much.

58
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,899
-About what?
-I should've made sure to end it then.

59
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,486
I should've gotten rid of you
once and for all.

60
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,531
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

61
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,794
So listen carefully.

62
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,413
There is nothing between us.

63
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,746
You scumbag. From the moment
you came into my life until now,

64
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,634
you never meant anything to me,
not even for a moment. You're nothing!

65
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,172
When was it?

66
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,467
What?

67
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,470
When did I first come into your life?

68
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,232
What are you talking about?

69
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,850
Do you remember it?

70
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,896
Are you sure you remember it correctly?

71
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,654
Dahyun.

72
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,356
We didn't meet for the first time at work.

73
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,198
We met right in this alley
a very long time ago.

74
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,911
Right here in this neighborhood.
Don't you remember?

75
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,208
Noh Dahyun!

76
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,625
Noh Dahyun!

77
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,483
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

78
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,272
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

79
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,069
That's good.

80
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,572
Stay here for a second.

81
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,254
It's okay.

82
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,381
Lee Jingeun.

83
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,303
It's you again.

84
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,763
Lee Jingeun…

85
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,425
What do you want?

86
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,351
I asked what you wanted. Answer me!

87
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,283
What's up? You're being all scary.

88
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,027
What?

89
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,950
I'll get going.

90
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,794
I'm pretty much done
with my business for the day.

91
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,999
Bye, Dahyun. See you again soon.

92
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,255
You're going to regret it.

93
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,426
If you ever come back,
I'll make sure you regret it.

94
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,647
How sad.

95
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,321
This isn't how
I imagined us meeting again.

96
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,698
<i>Back then</i>

97
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,282
and even now…

98
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,343
you're the problem.

99
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,183
Are you okay?

100
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,900
-Chef.
-Why did you have to go by yourself?

101
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,364
-Sorry?
-You shouldn't have gone with Chef Lee.

102
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,914
Something could've happened.
Why are you so fearless?

103
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,740
Also, why did you hang up on me?

104
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,615
I looked everywhere for you.

105
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,407
I wandered from alley to alley
like a headless chicken feeling terrified.

106
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,668
I seriously…

107
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,629
What if I didn't find you?

108
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,169
What if something happened to you?

109
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,165
Why does this darn neighborhood
have so many little alleys?

110
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,126
There hasn't been any progress at all.

111
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,386
Gosh, seriously.

112
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,311
Why?

113
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,015
-Why what?
-Why did you look for me so hard?

114
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,030
Is this also

115
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,026
because of humanism?

116
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,010
She isn't home or out here.
Where on earth did she go?

117
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,680
Something must've come up.

118
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,057
-Hey.
-What?

119
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,431
Over there.

120
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,439
Darn, that little…

121
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,784
Are you crazy?

122
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,489
Why do you keep luring
my precious daughter to hang out with you?

123
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,111
This isn't the time for this.

124
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,697
-That crazy scumbag might show up--
-He already did.

125
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,163
See? He showed up already--

126
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,714
-What did you say?
-Lee Jingeun showed up,

127
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,041
and Chef Eun found out somehow and came.

128
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,166
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.

129
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,014
In other words, he saved my life.

130
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,970
Thank you always.

131
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,446
I think I should go now.

132
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,995
Please drink this before you go.

133
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,712
Here you go. It's <i>sikhye.</i>

134
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,970
If that scumbag dares
to show his face again,

135
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:45,807
I'll strike him with a shovel
or crush him with a claw hammer.

136
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,435
I'm not joking. I won't let him off.

137
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,862
How about I just report him to the police?
It was self-defense.

138
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,282
But we tried to store his body
in the refrigerator.

139
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,029
There is no evidence.

140
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,029
Do you think they'll believe us
if we insist we never did such a thing?

141
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,865
What do you think, Chef?

142
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,343
She went to turn herself in alone,
then you all went to do so as a group.

143
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,546
You avoid and hide
every time you see the police.

144
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,677
You keep carrying around tools
and get arrested by the patrol unit.

145
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,765
No matter how you look at it,
you look suspicious.

146
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,812
But you still want them to believe you?

147
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,148
Let's do this.

148
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,650
Until we come up with a good plan,
let's all be careful

149
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,356
and protect each other
as much as possible.

150
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,446
Good idea.
Let's stay together day and night.

151
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,993
-Exactly.
-Fantastic.

152
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,576
Wow. Great.

153
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:49,125
Now that you have a fantastic plan,
I'll excuse myself.

154
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,328
Wait.

155
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,048
The three of us have each other,
but you're all alone.

156
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,677
You've also become his target
because of me.

157
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,551
My goodness.
Why don't you stay over at our place?

158
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,307
-No.
-Then should we stay over at yours?

159
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,519
No thank you.

160
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,392
-Why not?
-You'll be alone.

161
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,942
I said, I'm not staying over.

162
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,492
What?

163
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,574
I no longer want to thank you.

164
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,239
Anyway, thank--

165
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,456
Go on in.

166
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,257
You're welcome.

167
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,693
Thank you.

168
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,068
<i>Perhaps that day,</i>

169
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,525
<i>we all</i>

170
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,201
<i>had the same thought.</i>

171
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,709
<i>Exactly</i>

172
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,974
<i>this thought.</i>

173
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:04,966
Should I…

174
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,886
just kill him?

175
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,891
<i>Should I just kill him?</i>

176
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,019
POKE

177
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,553
-Don't look. Just look straight ahead.
-Okay.

178
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,668
Let's go, Grandma.

179
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,888
Just run over that chef with a car.

180
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,470
What did you say?

181
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,728
Just hit him with your taxi

182
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,980
and kill him.

183
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:39,809
Jeez…

184
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,517
I can't do that.

185
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,438
You've done it before.
Don't act all innocent.

186
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,317
Don't you remember?

187
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,183
Sir…

188
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,641
<i>You ran me over with your car.</i>

189
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,226
I'm sorry. It's my…

190
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,228
It's my… Please forgive me.

191
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,902
I really didn't mean to.

192
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,481
I swear. I'm sorry.

193
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,153
Please rest in peace.

194
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,534
Please rest in peace.

195
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,039
Sir,

196
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,712
why are you burying me?

197
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,463
<i>You tried to bury me.</i>

198
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,383
That's because I thought you were dead--

199
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,801
Exactly my point.

200
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,722
Why did you drive drunk?

201
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,854
Is that from my dash cam?

202
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,184
Run him over and just insist
you accidentally hit the gas pedal

203
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,557
because you're a clumsy driver.

204
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,686
You don't want to do that?

205
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,318
Then should I report you to the police?

206
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:13,283
<i>Do you want to go to jail for
corpse abandonment and attempted murder?</i>

207
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,562
Bokhee, enough already.
You'll tear a muscle.

208
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,814
-What muscle?
-Hey, she can hear you.

209
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,607
Dahyun, come work out your arms.

210
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,981
Show me.

211
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,778
She'll keel over laughing.

212
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,453
Hello?

213
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,119
What accident?

214
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,366
Who did you hit?
Why are you spewing gibberish?

215
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,914
What about the chef?

216
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,501
You smashed what?

217
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,246
Okay, I'll be right there.

218
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,799
What's going on?
He hit the chef with his car?

219
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,381
I'm not sure.
He hit the chef or something.

220
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,554
What did she say? Did something happen?

221
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,756
I'm not sure. An accident.

222
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,805
Solyi's dad hit that chef with his taxi.

223
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,890
She said it got smashed.

224
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,733
What?

225
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,270
Hey. Where are you going? Darn it.

226
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,936
Don't go by yourself!

227
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,737
Where is the chef?

228
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,657
Inside.

229
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,245
Are you all right?

230
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,126
Come on. Stand up. Let me look.

231
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,721
Are you hurt? You're fine, right?

232
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,643
What a terrible prank.

233
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,427
Why did they say you're hurt when you're
totally fine? You didn't get hit at all.

234
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,150
I did almost get hit.

235
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,397
Seriously? You must've been startled.

236
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,191
Yes.

237
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,579
You must be in shock.

238
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,160
Wait a second.

239
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,381
Can you see this?

240
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,816
Don't shove your face in front of me.

241
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,114
That's good. You seem okay.

242
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,081
Wait, shouldn't you be downstairs?

243
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,042
It's totally smashed.

244
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,062
Mom.

245
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,925
Grandma, what happened here?

246
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,135
CHOONOK

247
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,687
I can't believe this.

248
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,863
-I guess this isn't a dream.
-Oh, no. Our restaurant.

249
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,744
Fortunately, it's not
completely destroyed.

250
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,572
Only about a quarter of it, you know?

251
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,247
What if it happened to your house?
Would you really say it was fortunate?

252
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,543
I see how it is.

253
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,970
Come on. Wait, man.

254
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,058
I'm sorry about this.

255
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,063
Are you okay?

256
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,938
Luckily, he came out unscathed.

257
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,398
That's good to hear.

258
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,025
Thank you, Bokhee.

259
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,624
I suppose he can
get scathed a little then.

260
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,963
-My goodness, Bokhee!
-Bokhee!

261
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,329
It's still morning. You're drunk already?

262
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,127
How dare you destroy our restaurant!

263
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,010
I ran a breath test on him.
It turns out he didn't drink.

264
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,168
-I didn't drink.
-Let go of him. Come on.

265
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,087
-He didn't even drink? Then why?
-Pardon?

266
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,546
Do you hold a grudge against me?

267
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,926
-No.
-Bokhee.

268
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,474
I didn't mean to crash into it.

269
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,097
I was trying to avoid hitting a person.

270
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,773
What did you say? Say it clearly.

271
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,982
He made a drastic turn
right before he was about to hit someone.

272
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,484
I saw it from up there.

273
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,440
Or else, the owner of this restaurant
could've been crushed.

274
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,447
-My goodness.
-Oh, I see.

275
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,741
Sir, that's…

276
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:08,948
a good thing.

277
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,455
Darn, you little…

278
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,958
But he can't hit a person.
Don't hit me, Mom.

279
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,764
It should be covered by your insurance.
So don't worry too much.

280
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,019
Oh, no. Where will
all our neighbors eat now?

281
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,886
My goodness.

282
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,265
Tell me about it.

283
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,861
"You don't have to give us business."
"You can eat somewhere else."

284
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,820
I kept saying those things, but everyone
insisted on eating at our restaurant.

285
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,413
What are we going to do? Darn it.

286
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,825
My goodness.

287
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:57,832
This means we don't have to eat
at Choonok Stew for a while.

288
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,798
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

289
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,301
-My goodness.
-We're in trouble.

290
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,014
See? Look at them.

291
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,390
I'm sorry.

292
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,932
-It's okay.
-Don't worry.

293
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,308
-Thank you for your understanding.
-Sure. See you later.

294
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,904
-No worries.
-We're going. Bye.

295
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,236
Where will they eat now?

296
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,674
You want me to stay by Gyehoon?

297
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,342
Can you stay by his side
for the time being?

298
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,259
-Why?
-There's a stalker.

299
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,089
-Someone's stalking him?
-No, me.

300
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,894
Then why protect him?

301
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,889
The stalker might come after him.

302
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,011
Why would your stalker come after him?

303
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,388
-There's been a misunderstanding.
-About what?

304
00:23:56,101 --> 00:24:00,481
He must think
we have a special relationship.

305
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,019
Like what?

306
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,531
Lovers.

307
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,953
Are you guys dating?

308
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,244
-That's why he's mistaken.
-What did you do to cause that?

309
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,868
Nothing in particular.

310
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,041
Think carefully.

311
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,041
Well…

312
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,044
<i>Noh Dahyun!</i>

313
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,416
What did you do?

314
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,630
Are you interrogating me?

315
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,797
Why are you being so nosy?

316
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,140
Something is going on between the two.

317
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,733
He almost had me.

318
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,989
It's a message from Chef Lee.

319
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,490
<i>I think my little sibling returned.</i>

320
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,157
<i>I need to take a few days off. I'm sorry.</i>

321
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,617
POWER OFF

322
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,067
CHOONOK STEW

323
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,382
Sorry, we're not open today.

324
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,553
What happened here?

325
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,675
-Who…
-Who did this?

326
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,064
And who are you?

327
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,345
Did someone die here?

328
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,606
Why would anyone die?

329
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,399
What? My goodness.

330
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,322
I thought they said someone died.

331
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,861
Who said that?

332
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,613
Maybe someone just got hurt.

333
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,949
What are you talking about?
No one got hurt.

334
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,198
I guess that didn't happen either.

335
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,140
<i>Pull yourself together!
I'll take care of everything,</i>

336
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,273
<i>so just do as I say.</i>

337
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,281
Why don't you just come in and eat?

338
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,122
Our restaurant's ironclad policy

339
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,329
is not to turn down any customers
who come to eat at our restaurant.

340
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,621
It looks like a mess,

341
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,170
but the refrigerator still works.

342
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,010
CHOONOK STEW

343
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,444
So you like the food.

344
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,194
I'm not picky about food in general.
I eat everything.

345
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,070
Okay. Eat as much as you'd like.

346
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:41,412
Even death-row convicts get fed a feast
before they're executed.

347
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,250
Do you know who I am?

348
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,705
Yes, I do.

349
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,341
And you are?

350
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,513
I'm Dahyun's mom.

351
00:27:58,968 --> 00:27:59,888
I see.

352
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:01,967
You're not surprised?

353
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,215
I guessed as much.

354
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,690
I see.

355
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,056
Let me get straight to the point.

356
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,766
Don't linger around

357
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,229
Dahyun anymore.

358
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,158
-Why not?
-You really don't know?

359
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,988
No, not really.

360
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,453
What a scumbag.

361
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,878
Don't you remember…

362
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,712
what you did to her that day?

363
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,715
That day?

364
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,429
I was so dumbstruck that day.

365
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,306
I collapsed right about here.

366
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,563
When I regained consciousness,
it was so cold and dark all around me.

367
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,234
So I thought I'd died.

368
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,605
But I was inside a refrigerator.

369
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,080
That was so absurd.

370
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,575
By the way,

371
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,497
who put me…

372
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,378
in there?

373
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,336
I did.

374
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,101
So, it was you.

375
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,221
You did such an awful thing
to my daughter.

376
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,313
You deserve to die a hundred times.

377
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,604
That's going a little too far, Mother.

378
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,356
Don't call me that.

379
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,480
You're making me angry.

380
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,151
I was alive and well.

381
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,410
You shouldn't have put me
in the refrigerator, Mother.

382
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,592
That would be my fault.

383
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,208
I checked to see
if you were still breathing.

384
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,091
It really seemed like you were dead.

385
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,383
I see. That's why you put me in there.

386
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,758
Had I known you were still alive,

387
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:10,055
I would've made sure
you were dead for good.

388
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,851
I'm quite clumsy because of my age.

389
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,442
-That's quite funny.
-So,

390
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,154
you plan to keep lingering around here?

391
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,860
-Yes.
-You won't give up on Dahyun?

392
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,158
Mother, I love Dahyun with all my heart.

393
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,663
You've completely lost your mind.

394
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,332
Stop spewing nonsense!

395
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,043
I hear that quite often.
People tell me that I'm crazy,

396
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,634
and that if things go awry,
I might kill a few people.

397
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,383
So in general, to not irritate me,

398
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,180
people tiptoe around
and act carefully in front of me.

399
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,219
But you're not like that, Mother.

400
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,637
Damn you.

401
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,231
Stop calling me that.
I'm not your mother, punk.

402
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,544
Hello.

403
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,299
What are you doing at this hour?
A late-night snack?

404
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,097
What brings you here so late?

405
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,929
Well, I had some business with him.

406
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,641
What? Are you surprised
to see me unscathed?

407
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,897
-What do you mean?
-I know you orchestrated the accident.

408
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,903
What should I do?
Get you arrested for inciting murder?

409
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,486
Do as you wish.

410
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,779
We can all go together. Attempted murder
and corpse abandonment charges

411
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,248
for Dahyun, Grandmother, and Mother.

412
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,000
I told you not to call me that!

413
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,634
Take your hand out of your pocket.

414
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,504
You should…

415
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,128
get out of here alive while you still can.

416
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,295
And don't ever show your face again.

417
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,258
Next time, I'll really…

418
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,931
get rid of you by whatever means.

419
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,235
Thank you for the food.

420
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,885
What's your name, chef?

421
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,345
You know my name,

422
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,890
but I don't know yours.

423
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,687
What? Are you scared to tell me?

424
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,744
Eun Gyehoon.

425
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,949
Satisfied?

426
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,197
Eun Gyehoon.

427
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,411
If you have no other business, get lost.

428
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,542
Don't act like you're all that,

429
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,094
Eun Gyehoon.

430
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,601
<i>When did I first come into your life?</i>

431
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,185
We didn't meet for the first time at work.

432
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,282
Right here in this neighborhood.

433
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,490
What in the world was he talking about?

434
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,913
Forget it.

435
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,583
Let's not dwell over
something that scumbag said.

436
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,422
Mom!

437
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,545
It's so late. What were you doing
at this hour of the night?

438
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,128
Sorry, we lost track of time.

439
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,634
We said we'll all be careful and guard
and protect each other day and night.

440
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,887
Have you forgotten already?

441
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,229
What's going on?
Did something happen again?

442
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,100
What are you talking about?

443
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,687
Nothing happened.

444
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,019
Don't deny it. Something did happen.

445
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,477
-Look at me.
-No.

446
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,987
Why can't you look me in the eye?

447
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,320
If she were my mother,
she would've been the death of me.

448
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,565
No kidding.

449
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,038
What happened?

450
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,252
Eun Gyehoon.

451
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,088
Eun… Gye…

452
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,730
I see, he's that Eun Gyehoon.

453
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,703
What now?

454
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,750
Dahyun's nightmares

455
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,909
are back.

456
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,347
<i>What are you doing still up?</i>

457
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,702
<i>I just woke up.</i>

458
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,162
<i>You can't sleep well?</i>

459
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,832
<i>No.</i>

460
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,535
Because of you.

461
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,412
<i>Why not?</i>

462
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,666
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

463
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,919
Because of you.

464
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,292
<i>Am I the only one hungry?</i>

465
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,591
STEW PLACE
AM I THE ONLY ONE HUNGRY?

466
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,804
She wants me to cook for her.

467
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,111
Jeez, that scared me.

468
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,194
Darn it.

469
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,161
Let me.

470
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,498
It's okay. Step aside.

471
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,383
What's all this?

472
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,263
I snuck it out of our restaurant.

473
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,337
Since we can't open,
they'll just go to waste.

474
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,925
You're cooking,
so I should provide ingredients at least.

475
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,391
You were going to ask me to cook?

476
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,927
Weren't you going to cook for me?

477
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,059
We have so much to do
before the soft opening,

478
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,484
yet you just want to relax?
What kind of an employee are you?

479
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,834
Dahyun, straighten your back
and pull your right foot back a little.

480
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,790
That's it. You have to cut like this
not to strain yourself.

481
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,421
All done.

482
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,092
I'll show you how to make a bouquet garni.
Watch carefully and try it yourself.

483
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,392
All done.

484
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,433
-Again.
-Ta-da.

485
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,225
-Again.
-How about this one?

486
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,148
Again. Again.

487
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,688
All done.

488
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,570
You have to stir it as hard as you can
as if you're scooping it up.

489
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,374
Try it.

490
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,537
Again. As hard as you can.

491
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,469
Darn it.

492
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,453
What do you think?
There is no time to get distracted, right?

493
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,945
Thanks to you, my mind has gone blank.

494
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,075
I hope you won't have
any nightmares tonight.

495
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,287
How did you know that
I've been having nightmares?

496
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,419
Well…

497
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,047
I'm on friendly terms with nightmares.

498
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,388
There is a nightmare
that I repeatedly have every night…

499
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,098
Never mind. Let's drop this boring topic.

500
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,063
Why did you decide to become a chef?

501
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,074
Because my mother became too gaunt.

502
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,170
<i>I started cooking to make my mother eat
even if it was just a bite.</i>

503
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,843
DOENJANG STEW

504
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,967
DOENJANG STEW, INGREDIENTS

505
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,722
<i>Then I started to like it.</i>

506
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,151
<i>My mind used to be cluttered
no matter what,</i>

507
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,399
<i>but it got cleared.</i>

508
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,650
<i>Because you can cut your finger</i>

509
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,994
or burn yourself so easily,

510
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,869
my mind stopped wandering.

511
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,382
Okay.

512
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,291
Shall we cook then?

513
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,210
I've been waiting for you to say that.

514
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
It's a given.

515
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,077
That's awesome.

516
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,584
-You're overreacting.
-Do it again.

517
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,913
I guess I dozed off.

518
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,710
Wait just a little longer.
It's almost done.

519
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,597
It's so delicious.

520
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,100
Thank you.

521
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,688
What are you doing here?

522
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,743
You don't remember him?

523
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,360
He's the one that kept peeing out front.

524
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,277
I think he's been abandoned.

525
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,985
He started coming here
a few days for food.

526
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,293
We should take care of him.

527
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,582
Why should we? He peed everywhere.

528
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,962
By the way, what's going on
between you and Dahyun?

529
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,170
You looked chummy
with each other this morning.

530
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,086
Are you two a thing?

531
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,636
You're not denying it.

532
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,890
I'm so dumbfounded that I'm speechless.

533
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,773
Ms. Noh Dahyun is
like that dog to me, that's all.

534
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,349
She barges in
whenever she wants and asks for food.

535
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,558
I'm tired and annoyed by her.

536
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,242
Don't come near me. I don't want
any of them, dogs, humans, or cats.

537
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,565
Go away.

538
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,699
Hey, clean up these bowls now.

539
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,755
Come here.

540
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,341
You're so cold-hearted.

541
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,997
Here you go.

542
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,759
I was so out of it.

543
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,889
I'm sorry.

544
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,520
Someone came by last night.

545
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,394
It seemed like he came to check
if anyone had died

546
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,399
after getting hit by a taxi.

547
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,864
You know Lee Jingeun, don't you?

548
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,951
It's my fault.

549
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,254
It's all my fault.

550
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,208
So please forgive me just this once.

551
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:17,458
If you forgive me just this once,
I'll… I'll do anything.

552
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,045
Sir… Mr. Chef.

553
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,719
Please don't report me. Please?

554
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,353
I was going to pay. Thank you.

555
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,062
Hey.

556
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,903
I'll be good from now on.

557
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,320
I'm actually a nice, typical,

558
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,070
ordinary person.

559
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,781
A typical ordinary person
wouldn't bury someone so easily.

560
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,692
CCTV IN OPERATION

561
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:34,009
Why does he keep
hurting Eun Gyehoon instead of me?

562
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,861
What's that?

563
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,241
What's with this thing?

564
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,408
What's wrong?

565
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,212
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

566
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,339
Should I turn myself in

567
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,258
and ask for help?

568
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,676
Or not?

569
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,021
VACANT

570
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:29,937
What?

571
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,025
That little…

572
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,046
Hey. Why did you go to the patrol unit?

573
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,586
-Pardon?
-What did you report?

574
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,546
Me? Did you report me?

575
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,684
What if I did?

576
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,636
You said you wouldn't.

577
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,556
That chef promised me he wouldn't.

578
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,731
What are you talking about?

579
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,647
What?

580
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,864
You don't know about it?

581
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,034
What are you talking about?

582
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,051
Where is Ms. Noh? Is she on the terrace?

583
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,643
No, she isn't.

584
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,684
I told you not to leave her alone.

585
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,774
Why are they taking it out on me?

586
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,499
Ms. Noh.

587
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,004
You can't go around by yourself like this.

588
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,253
Until you come up with a good plan,

589
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,586
I thought you were staying together
to protect each other.

590
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,342
Did you forget
that fantastic idea of yours?

591
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,684
Why aren't you reacting--

592
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,351
You didn't see that scumbag, did you?

593
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,932
You're nagging.

594
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,515
I'm not nagging. That's the rule.

595
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,823
If I let you go alone, your scary mother
and grandmother will scold me.

596
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,032
Do you not hear me?

597
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,366
<i>Lee Jingeun made me do it.</i>

598
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,080
I did it because
Lee Jingeun threatened me to kill him.

599
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,884
But still, how could you try to hit him?
That's nonsense.

600
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,498
But I…

601
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,672
Where is he?

602
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,974
<i>I have no idea.</i>

603
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,893
<i>But he'll turn up.</i>

604
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,555
<i>He'll turn up for sure.</i>

605
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,928
-And we don't need celebrities…
<i>-Lee Jingeun won't stop</i>

606
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,517
<i>until he gets what he wants.</i>

607
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,766
<i>He's insane.</i>

608
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,504
I finished my tasks for the day.

609
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,041
The soil condition is good
and I removed the weeds too.

610
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,375
What's going on?

611
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,255
Something happened, didn't it?

612
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,642
Let's end it.

613
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,015
I want to end things between us.

614
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:00,736
There is nothing between us.
What's even there to end?

615
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,109
Humanism.

616
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,121
Let's put an end to that.

617
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,041
Why did you look for me so hard?

618
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,252
Is this also

619
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,250
because of humanism?

620
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,130
<i>Perhaps.</i>

621
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,840
Stop saying, it's humanism perhaps.

622
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,804
Don't go around looking for me,
don't help me,

623
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,715
don't cook for me,
and don't butt in my life.

624
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,556
Let's go back to the time

625
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,730
before we knew each other

626
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,609
and not meddle in
each other's lives, okay?

627
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,226
-Why do we have to do that?
-Because I want to.

628
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,396
-Why do you want to do that?
-Does it matter?

629
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,395
Yes, it does.

630
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,617
There is nothing between us
to put an end to it.

631
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,701
So I'm dumbfounded,
but let's set that aside for now.

632
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,664
I don't recall
doing something to offend you.

633
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,043
Why are you so upset and annoyed?

634
00:54:56,126 --> 00:55:00,006
Why are you saying all this to me?
You owe me an explanation at least, right?

635
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,218
Because you keep lying to me.

636
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,429
-Sorry?
-I like you.

637
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,514
I mean, I liked you.

638
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,770
See? You aren't even surprised.

639
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,641
You knew it all along.

640
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,994
How about this then?

641
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,445
The guy that I used to like
almost got killed because of me.

642
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,077
But I had no idea like a fool.

643
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,544
Thanks to you, I was so carefree.

644
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,750
-Dahyun, that's because--
-You told me I lied about everything.

645
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,087
You pretended not to know
and tried to hide what happened.

646
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,206
That's a lie in a way.

647
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,094
And I can't stand such lies anymore.

648
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,507
I'll work here
until you find my replacement.

649
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:52,636
Bye.

650
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,587
<i>Eunjung, it's me again.</i>

651
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:32,176
CHEF LEE EUNJUNG

652
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,433
RÉSUMÉ
LEE JINGEUN

653
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,556
Why do you want to see
Mr. Lee Jingeun's résumé?

654
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,603
Nothing unusual. Here you go.

655
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,516
In case it has any clues.

656
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,685
This isn't the time for you
to go around looking for a man.

657
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:45,689
Tell me about it.

658
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,490
I'll get going.

659
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,735
Already? You haven't even had any tea.

660
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,164
I'm not in any mood
to put up with your snobbery today.

661
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,535
FANTASTIC EVENT

662
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,710
<i>Who did this to you?</i>

663
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:07,668
Answer me.

664
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,427
What's wrong? Are you okay?

665
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,389
You're afraid of him. You're scaring her!

666
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,389
Noh Dahyun!

667
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,096
Ms. Noh.
You can't go around by yourself like this.

668
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,691
<i>I looked everywhere for you.</i>

669
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,859
What if something happened to you?

670
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,518
<i>But it's amazing.</i>

671
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,437
<i>You always manage to find me
when I'm feeling this way.</i>

672
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,897
<i>Would you like some food?</i>

673
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,909
<i>Why are you so concerned about me?</i>

674
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,200
I've never been concerned about you.

675
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,865
I do admit
that I sympathized with you at times.

676
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,413
<i>But that's it.</i>

677
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:42,206
<i>You know what?
I thought we bonded a bit last night.</i>

678
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,212
<i>Was I mistaken?</i>

679
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,668
Are you all right?

680
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,676
<i>Even if going forward, I treat you well,</i>

681
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,468
don't like me. Ever.

682
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,302
I like you.

683
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,185
I just had a crush on him for two months.
Get over yourself.

684
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,386
Go over there, okay?

685
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,372
-Hello?
<i>-Are you looking for me?</i>

686
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:07,878
Yeah.

687
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,133
I'm looking for you.

688
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,303
Why?

689
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,764
Come with me.

690
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:16,723
Where?

691
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,599
To turn ourselves in.

692
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,644
I'll get my punishment,
so you get yours too.

693
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,348
Why are you saying that?

694
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,935
I said I'll forgive you.

695
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,693
But I can't forgive you.

696
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,775
I still don't understand.

697
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,948
You were never even in my sights.

698
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,702
How did you become so delusional
that things have come to this?

699
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,155
Bring it on.

700
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,418
I'll give it to you real good.

701
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,218
<i>I told you already.</i>

702
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,591
Our relationship isn't

703
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,797
that short-lived and casual.

704
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,637
Even if that's true, so what?

705
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,393
<i>Let's say we were a couple</i>

706
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,484
in a past life and you were my love
of a thousand years. So what?

707
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,981
I don't like you now.

708
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,572
You need to get lost if I say so.
That's just common sense.

709
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,320
Because of Eun Gyehoon?

710
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:16,701
Hey. Don't be a coward and threaten me
by using others around me.

711
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,159
Only deal with me.

712
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:23,162
If you dare mess with
anyone else around me,

713
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,250
I'll shove you back
into a refrigerator if I have to.

714
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,996
I swear on my life that I'll kill you.

715
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,442
NOH DAHYUN

716
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,678
This is all

717
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,306
because of that scumbag, Eun Gyehoon.

718
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,568
Hello?

719
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,534
It's me.

720
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,229
Eunjung!

721
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,897
I missed you so much.

722
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:48,237
Come on in. We're having
a soft opening in a few days.

723
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,454
We can't do it without you.
Don't you agree, Gyehoon?

724
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:53,909
I'm glad you're here.

725
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,032
Eunjung…

LINK

727
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,890
<i>-I'm going to kill you.
-Long time no see.</i>

728
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,226
Don't stop me, Mom.

729
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,311
Don't stop me either.

730
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:44,015
<i>Why did Eunjung
try to stab Dahyun's stalker?</i>

731
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,687
<i>She must've had her reasons.</i>

732
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,185
<i>Lee Jingeun may have lived
in Jihwa-dong when he was little.</i>

733
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,237
<i>Do you finally remember who I am?</i>

734
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,951
<i>I asked you not to meddle in my affairs</i>

735
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,831
<i>especially if it was about Lee Jingeun.</i>

736
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:58,619
<i>If something happens to you
while I'm away, I'd feel bad.</i>

737
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,371
<i>You act friendly one minute
then ice-cold another.</i>

738
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,827
<i>You can't keep making me feel confused.</i>

739
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,248
<i>Do you like me?</i>

740
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:06,666
<i>What if I am?</i>

741
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,416
It's too late.

742
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,166
<i>It's over between us.</i>
