LINK

2
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,941
So here you were.

3
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,318
Mom!

4
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,449
Dahyun! Oh, gosh!

5
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,696
Dahyun. Wake up, sweetie.

6
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,617
<i>My mom killed the culprit to save me.</i>

7
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,174
<i>However…</i>

8
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,668
There is more than one person.

9
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,133
<i>There was more than one culprit.</i>

10
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,325
<i>And they're among us.</i>

11
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,995
<i>Disguised as normal people.</i>

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,220
AN ORDINARY EVIL

13
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,518
<i>It's just one matter.</i>

14
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,820
<i>It keeps lingering in front of me.
That thing.</i>

15
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,357
Do you see her?

16
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,034
No, I don't see her.

17
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,202
But I think I know who she is.

18
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,541
Eun Gyeyoung, right?

19
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,708
You're seeing her, aren't you?

20
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,050
Was it you?

21
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,262
Were you…

22
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,341
the one who killed her?

23
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,349
Answer me. I'm asking if you did it.

24
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,601
She left.

25
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,609
She was definitely there
until just a while ago.

26
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,031
But she left.

27
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,355
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
Who was there?

28
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,454
It's nothing.

29
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,671
Wait.

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,514
Didn't you come here
because you had something to tell me?

31
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,934
Why would I?

32
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,609
<i>What about Eun Gyeyoung?</i>

33
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,241
Mom, what happened to Eun Gyeyoung?

34
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,069
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,079
But I don't know.

36
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,747
What?

37
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,832
I had no idea that she was there as well.

38
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:15,086
I should've turned myself in.

39
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,087
If I turned myself in,
we could've found her too.

40
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,051
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,425
I'm truly sorry.

42
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,960
Hey, it's been a while.

43
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,926
Hello.

44
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,603
Is something wrong? Are you okay?

45
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,465
It's nothing. I'm okay.

46
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,927
Sorry, I shouldn't have said hi.

47
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,982
I should've just passed you by.

48
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,975
Do you really not need me to walk you home
with everything that's been going on?

49
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,486
It's okay.

50
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,533
Then let me just
walk with you until there.

51
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,708
What brings you to this neighborhood?

52
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,416
Do you live nearby?

53
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,707
No, I don't.

54
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,506
I just came by to check something.

55
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,813
<i>Dahyun's memories are almost all back.</i>

56
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,732
She'll remember you soon enough.

57
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,941
Or maybe…

58
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,524
she already does.

59
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,066
Someone I knew told me something.

60
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,032
So I came here to check

61
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,241
if they were telling the truth.

62
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,325
I see.

63
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,915
Your shoelaces have come undone.

64
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,512
You can go first.

65
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,356
They'll come undone again
if you tie them like that.

66
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,780
I can do it.

67
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,489
They won't come undone
if you tie them like this.

68
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,536
This way, you'll be able to run

69
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,753
if you need to.

70
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,762
Thank you.

71
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,180
I should get going now.

72
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,347
I think that person lied.

73
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,350
I did expect it though.

74
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,230
Go home safely then.

75
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,230
Goodbye.

76
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,324
By the way…

77
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,541
Have we…

78
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,966
ever met in the past?

79
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,965
As in when you were little?

80
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,316
Never mind.

81
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,775
Goodbye.

82
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,449
It's unlike you to call me first.

83
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,174
What's wrong?

84
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,959
What's going on?

85
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,143
Grandma.

86
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,970
Where's your mom?

87
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,142
She's still drinking.

88
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,094
That can't be.

89
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,166
How could Dahyun and Gyeyoung
have been together?

90
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,087
That's ridiculous.

91
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,926
It doesn't make any sense.

92
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,598
How's Dahyun?

93
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,942
We don't know yet.
The doctor needs to watch her for now.

94
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,269
Brace yourself for
what I'm about to tell you.

95
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,898
That man died.

96
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,744
What?

97
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,565
He's dead.

98
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,663
Did I… kill him?

99
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,792
What should I do?

100
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,076
Just don't do anything.

101
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,707
What do you mean?

102
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,134
Answer me.

103
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,884
I got rid of his body.

104
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,929
What?

105
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,720
So pretend like nothing happened.

106
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,063
No, that's not right.

107
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,484
That's not right, Jungho.

108
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,977
Just arrest me. I'll tell them everything.

109
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,654
He attacked us first.

110
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,282
Don't be ridiculous.

111
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,529
No one would deem your murder

112
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,485
as an act of self-defense.

113
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,621
-Still.
-You'll be put behind bars.

114
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,253
You'll be incarcerated,

115
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,615
and Dahyun will be all alone.

116
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,839
What's it to you?

117
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,550
This had nothing to do with you,
so why did you do that?

118
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,721
Of course, I'm involved in this.
I did it all for you.

119
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,340
I never asked you to!

120
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,257
No. I'm going to do it.
I'm going to turn myself in.

121
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,267
What about me then?

122
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,313
What'll happen to me?

123
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,187
Your decision will affect all of us.

124
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,521
It'll be the end for you, me, and Dahyun.

125
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,115
Then what about her?

126
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,575
Dr. Eun's daughter.

127
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,461
That case is irrelevant to this.

128
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,166
I found no trace of her anywhere.

129
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,205
So let's put an end to this.

130
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,587
Let's forget everything, okay?

131
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,427
I searched everywhere for Gyeyoung.

132
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,354
I searched his house, workplace,

133
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,563
and everywhere else he went.

134
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,355
His alibi even checked out.

135
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,069
But we were still wrong.

136
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,647
Had we reported it
and done a thorough search,

137
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,321
we could've found her.

138
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,466
Bokhee, come here.

139
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,892
Let me go.

140
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,811
We caught the culprit.

141
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,517
-What?
-The kidnapper was apprehended.

142
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,563
I told you that Gyeyoung's case
had nothing to do with Dahyun's.

143
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,284
So stop trying to turn yourself in, okay?

144
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,065
I…

145
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,695
will never forgive myself. And…

146
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,292
I'll never forgive you either.

147
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,746
You shouldn't have dissuaded me.

148
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,669
You should've let me be.

149
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,462
-It was all for you.
-Why would you do that?

150
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,087
Who do you think you are?

151
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,756
Never mind.

152
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,386
This isn't your fault.

153
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,470
It's all mine.

154
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,853
You see,

155
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,767
karma always bites back.

156
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,693
We're paying for what we did in the past.

157
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,487
Your mom

158
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,908
only found out later,
and she tormented herself.

159
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,418
She tried to turn herself in
several times but always couldn't.

160
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,839
Dahyun.

161
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,680
You must be struggling so much.

162
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,764
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,847
I'm truly sorry.

164
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,265
Don't be.

165
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,062
Why would you apologize?

166
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,072
And I don't resent Mom either.

167
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,121
But I don't know what to tell Gyehoon.

168
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,712
Even I'm in so much pain.

169
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,627
I can't imagine how he must be feeling.

170
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,503
That's why I feel terrible for him.

171
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,021
What in the world is going on?

172
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,569
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

173
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,623
Dahyun, are you okay?

174
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,662
Why are you
suddenly asking me if I'm okay?

175
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,750
I was worried about you,
so I called to check.

176
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,594
Why would you worry about me?

177
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm…

178
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,796
always worried about you.

179
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,387
I'm always concerned about you.

180
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,603
Yes. I'm okay.

181
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,308
<i>Don't lie.</i>

182
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,307
You're not okay.

183
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,316
<i>What's wrong?</i>

184
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,316
<i>Let's meet right now. Are you outside?</i>

185
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,532
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

186
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,319
There's no need.

187
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,241
I'm really fine.

188
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,367
<i>No.</i>

189
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,212
You're…

190
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,461
crying right now.

191
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,224
<i>What's going on, Dahyun?</i>

192
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,705
Have you been waiting for me?

193
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,854
Here. Drink this.

194
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,345
Thanks.

195
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,104
You don't look too well.

196
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,696
You don't have a fever.

197
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,620
Do you want to eat something?

198
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,489
Do you crave anything?

199
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,294
It's okay. Don't bother.

200
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,171
These days, I often think that I was born

201
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,039
to cook for you.

202
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,957
I'll make some soup.

203
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,429
I don't know what's going on.

204
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,931
But if you force yourself to eat

205
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,642
no matter how much pain you're in,

206
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,681
you can endure it one day at a time.

207
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,901
I have something to tell you.

208
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,026
It's about my mom.

209
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,332
<i>This was what she told me.</i>

210
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,252
<i>Her mom killed one of the culprits</i>

211
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,801
<i>and kept the case a secret</i>

212
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,133
<i>so she wouldn't get caught.</i>

213
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,545
<i>That means…</i>

214
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,640
Had she reported it back then…

215
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,305
Had I not lost my memory…

216
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,561
Are you saying

217
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,319
we could've found Gyeyoung?

218
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,066
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,447
I really am.

220
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,076
I'm sorry, Gyehoon.

221
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,338
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

222
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,424
<i>Should I be mad at you?</i>

223
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,255
<i>Or should I wipe away your tears?</i>

224
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,534
Hey.

225
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,069
Hey.

226
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,198
Hey, are you okay?

227
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,699
Thanks.

228
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,161
You don't look too well.

229
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,497
-Have you checked out some neighborhoods?
-What?

230
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,931
-I'm going to close down this restaurant.
-What?

231
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,549
Once I'm done taking care of some matters,

232
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,005
let's leave right away.

233
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,136
Why?

234
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,810
What do you mean?
You've been eager about moving.

235
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,896
But still.

236
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm just sick and tired
of this neighborhood.

237
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,397
Everything here disgusts me.

238
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,987
In hindsight,

239
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,496
it was wise to leave this place.

240
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,254
Coming back was the worst decision ever.

241
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,593
Then what about Dahyun?

242
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,838
Speaking of which,
she's late to work today.

243
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,892
Did something happen to her?

244
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,139
What is she doing right now?

245
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,691
<i>She's crying.</i>

246
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,867
Hey, is that her?

247
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,239
What?

248
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,539
Hello.

249
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,223
Well done.

250
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,103
I don't deserve

251
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,306
to say anything.

252
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,607
Then don't.

253
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,609
I've already heard everything.

254
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,702
And I don't see the need
or have the desire to hear more.

255
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,292
You killed someone and covered it up?

256
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,497
It doesn't surprise me.

257
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,711
I've always thought
you'd be capable of doing that anyway.

258
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,546
-I just--
-If you're going to

259
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,299
justify your actions
on the pretext of motherly love,

260
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,222
I don't want to hear it.

261
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,813
I came here to apologize,
not to justify myself.

262
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,734
Apologize?

263
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,475
Why?

264
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,567
-Is the guilt eating away at you?
-That's not why.

265
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,033
Don't you even dare.

266
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,780
I have no desire

267
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,412
to alleviate your guilt.

268
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,368
If I shouted and expressed
my resentment toward you right now,

269
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,127
that would only make you feel better.

270
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,462
That's why I won't do that.

271
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,134
I want you to live forever…

272
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,510
with regret and guilt.

273
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,017
So…

274
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,902
please leave.

275
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,770
Okay.

276
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,584
What is it?

277
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,058
Ji Wontak.

278
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,267
Officer Ji.

279
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,565
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

280
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,399
Do you think this would cut it?

281
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,114
Of course not.

282
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,356
I won't run away.

283
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,617
Feel free

284
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,031
to sue or arrest me.

285
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,126
I'm sorry, sir.
Please cut him some slack this once.

286
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,795
What's it to you? Why would you apologize?

287
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,854
I failed to teach him properly
as his mentor.

288
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,429
-So--
-Hwang Minjo!

289
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,024
He should apologize to me first

290
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,731
if I were to even forgive him.

291
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,482
You think I have no pride?

292
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,443
I'm sorry, sir.

293
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,398
Darn it.

294
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,490
Wontak, wait!

295
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,670
Are you really going to be like this?

296
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,537
Sorry.

297
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,957
Let's ask him for his forgiveness.

298
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,548
I'll apologize too, okay?

299
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,384
That'll never happen.

300
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,138
Why are you doing this?

301
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,849
What in the world happened?

302
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,061
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,935
-Hello, ma'am.
-Did something happen again?

304
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,315
I had something important to ask.

305
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,485
What is it?

306
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,907
I'm sorry,
but can I talk with Dahyun for a minute?

307
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,249
First of all,
I'd like to say that I'm sorry.

308
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,134
I'm truly sorry, Dahyun.

309
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,046
I heard you and Gyeyoung
were together that day.

310
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,056
-That's right.
-Can you tell me what you remember?

311
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:09,646
I'd like to compare
your answers to the things I know.

312
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,645
Sure.

313
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,071
Do you remember where you girls

314
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,446
were locked up?

315
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,743
<i>We were in the basement of a house.</i>

316
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,750
<i>And right now,</i>

317
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,127
<i>Ms. Yang lives there.</i>

318
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,891
It was Ms. Yang's basement?

319
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,181
That's the house
from your nightmares, right?

320
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,266
Do you know that house?

321
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,061
Yes. You started having nightmares

322
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,858
not too long after the incident.

323
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,150
You kept dreaming of a red gate,
so I looked for the house,

324
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,195
<i>just in case it existed.</i>

325
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,337
<i>But it didn't seem like
anyone was living there.</i>

326
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,093
<i>It was empty.</i>

327
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,220
I see.

328
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,511
I'll go upstairs now.

329
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,766
Eat something.
You haven't had anything all day.

330
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,679
That's okay.

331
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,057
By the way,

332
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,146
what about you and Gyehoon?

333
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,493
I know you two are dating.

334
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,655
I don't have the right to choose.

335
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,727
Don't abandon me.

336
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,770
I don't mean to abandon you…

337
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,861
<i>I can't abandon you.</i>

338
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:23,107
<i>And I can't hold onto you either,
even if you abandon me.</i>

339
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,700
<i>Do you remember the day</i>

340
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,906
<i>we almost broke up then reconciled?</i>

341
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,418
<i>I do.</i>

342
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,836
I only realized this
after deciding to break up.

343
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,675
There isn't much that we've done.

344
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,556
I have so many things
that I want to do with you.

345
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,772
Then let's do them.

346
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,060
I want to sing at a karaoke room.

347
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,227
I rarely sing.

348
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,154
I want to play tag
by the ocean like they do

349
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,073
in movies and dramas.

350
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,738
I hate cheesy things.

351
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,661
And I also want to go
to an amusement park.

352
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,030
I'm terrified of those rides.

353
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,697
I want to wait in line
and eat delicious food.

354
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,246
But I'm a chef myself.

355
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,869
We haven't taken any selfies either.

356
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,416
I really hate taking photos.

357
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,048
But I'm going to do all of them.

358
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,801
Of course, I will.

359
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,176
What do you want to do?

360
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,064
I really liked arcade games growing up.

361
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,818
I want to go to an arcade together.

362
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,072
What else?

363
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,775
I also want to go to a cart bar

364
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,945
and have udon and soju.

365
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,874
Sounds good. Let's do them all.

366
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,875
We can do anything we want
as long as we don't break up.

367
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,957
You're right.

368
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,468
<i>Will we really be able to do them all?</i>

369
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,057
<i>Yes.</i>

370
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,098
<i>As long as…</i>

371
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,731
<i>we don't break up.</i>

372
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,253
Are you here, sir?

373
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,206
What bad timing.

374
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,052
He must be around here.

375
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,598
Hey.

376
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,732
What was that last melody?

377
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
I guess it's just

378
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,226
a memory.

379
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:52,049
Gosh, I repeatedly told you
that public urination is prohibited here.

380
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,139
Can you believe the guy
who urinates publicly did it?

381
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,468
A suspect of a cold case?

382
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,265
It's pretty difficult
for someone to turn over a new leaf.

383
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,519
Get branded once, and it's over for good.

384
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,231
In this neighborhood,

385
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,151
do you accuse people without any evidence?

386
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,360
Where were you and what were you doing
yesterday and the day before that?

387
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,480
Come on. Say it!

388
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,028
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

389
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,112
Why can't you just tell me?

390
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,544
So that was why.

391
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,213
You scumbag.

392
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,304
You jerk.

393
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,846
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,516
SEWOON POLICE STATION

395
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,544
Excuse me, sir. I'm here to testify.

396
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,122
This way, please.

397
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,134
The current time is 2:23 p.m.

398
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,260
The interrogation will commence now.

399
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,723
First, tell us about your relationship
with Mr. Lee Jingeun

400
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,852
and how you got to know him.

401
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,314
What brings you here at this hour?

402
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,863
I just wanted to see you.

403
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,904
Come in.

404
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,657
How are you?

405
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,197
Good.

406
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,702
Is everything really okay?

407
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:58,092
I just missed you and Dad.

408
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,505
You sound like a little kid.

409
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,420
Do I?

410
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,390
-Gyehoon.
-Yes?

411
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,686
You can call Dad if you want.

412
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,862
You don't need to worry about me.

413
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,778
I don't.

414
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:31,326
Your dad and I aren't on good terms
since we fought so much.

415
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,410
But it's okay.

416
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,955
Don't worry about me.
You can contact him as much as you want.

417
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,587
-Really?
-Of course.

418
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,132
So call him.

419
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,929
Okay. I'll call him later.

420
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,747
Didn't we search

421
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,751
all the vacant houses that day?

422
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,758
What are you talking about?
Be more specific.

423
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,051
I'm talking about that day 18 years ago
when Eun Gyeyoung went missing.

424
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,966
Didn't we search
all the empty houses in Jihwa-dong?

425
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,266
Why are you suddenly bringing that up?

426
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,019
Just tell me. I'm curious.

427
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,812
Yes, we did. We all split up
and searched all the areas.

428
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,107
Why are you asking?

429
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,070
Dongnam's house
was in Jihwa 3-dong, right?

430
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,243
Who was in charge of that area?

431
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,735
-Dongnam's house?
-Yes.

432
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,992
I can't remember that.

433
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,003
-Is that so?
-What is it?

434
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:42,667
Why do you ask?

435
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,840
I'd like to take the day off.
Please process my leave.

436
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,209
What?

437
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,301
I'm not your secretary.

438
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,471
Do you want to drink?
I need to or else I'll go insane.

439
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,971
Unbelievable. No, thanks.

440
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,759
Bye.

441
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,055
That little…

442
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,686
What's this about?

443
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,617
I'm the one to blame.

444
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,911
I'm the jerk.

445
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,253
I don't deserve to live.

446
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,380
What is it this time?

447
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,303
What's going on?

448
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,722
I deserve everything
that I'm going through.

449
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,096
I'm getting punished
for doing something I shouldn't have.

450
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,076
It's even raining.

451
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,963
What a great day to get drunk and die.

452
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,288
Jeez.

453
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:36,066
JURISDICTION MAP

454
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,841
CHIEF SEO

455
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,297
What is it?

456
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,755
<i>It was you.</i>

457
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,845
What?

458
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:05,429
You were the one
who searched Dongnam's area.

459
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,694
<i>It was you. Don't you remember?</i>

460
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,358
Are you positive?

461
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,149
Yes. I just checked.

462
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,742
<i>By the way, what are you up to right now?</i>

463
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,448
<i>Are you really taking a leave?</i>

464
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,196
I'm having a drink with Younghoon.

465
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,372
I'll process my leave then.

466
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,502
Who was that?

467
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,171
What's going on?

468
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,130
Let's go.

469
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,958
Jungho, are you okay?

470
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,755
Jeez.

471
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,425
-Excuse me.
-I…

472
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,354
I was the one who searched that house?

473
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,726
Stay there. I'll help you walk.

474
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,895
Jeez.

475
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,282
Let me help you.

476
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,663
Sober up, will you?

477
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,665
<i>Jungho.</i>

478
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,247
Let me help you.

479
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,587
Younghoon.

480
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,130
I heard.

481
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,763
You can't search
all the vacant houses by yourself.

482
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,930
Let me help, okay?

483
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,177
I'll search that house.

484
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,222
Okay. I'll move on to the next alley.

485
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,266
Shout if you find anything, okay?

486
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,269
-Don't worry.
-Okay. Go on.

487
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,118
Jungho, come here.

488
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,794
What?

489
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,294
What are you doing there? Come here.

490
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,506
Hop in.

491
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,604
Hurry up. The seat's getting drenched.

492
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,020
I'm okay. I can walk home.

493
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,099
I didn't drink
because I wanted to drive you home.

494
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,439
Go on.

495
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,107
Okay.

496
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,091
Younghoon.

497
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,218
You know I love you
and think the world of you, right?

498
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,431
I love you a lot too.

499
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,221
After all, I moved here because of you.

500
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,977
I was also really glad

501
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,475
when you moved here.

502
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,450
Jungho.

503
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,285
Yes?

504
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,331
You remembered, didn't you?

505
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,976
You shouldn't have remembered.

506
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,498
That's enough.

507
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,329
Please stop!

508
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,792
Stop torturing me.

509
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,666
Stop showing yourself in front of me!

510
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,113
Please…

511
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,066
Please help me.

512
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,792
I'm sorry.

513
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,871
But I have no energy
or desire to talk to anyone

514
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,418
at the moment.

515
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,720
Your sister…

516
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,548
She just won't disappear.

517
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,681
I beg of you.

518
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,058
Please…

519
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,271
Please get rid of her for me.

520
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,608
What brings you here at this hour?

521
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,863
I'm sorry for barging in this late,

522
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,776
but can I speak with Dahyun?

523
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,084
-What?
-What? Why her?

524
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,958
Dahyun, didn't you come
to our house last time?

525
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,171
Well…

526
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,053
-Yes.
-Why did you?

527
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,264
Why do you ask?

528
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:36,144
Was it because of my husband?

529
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,767
You know something, don't you?

530
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,942
Your husband?

531
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:52,243
Is it too difficult to talk about?
Then let me ask you instead.

532
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,661
Did you come that day

533
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,913
because of Eun Gyeyoung?
You did, didn't you?

534
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,077
What are you talking about?

535
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,214
I think

536
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,884
my husband…

537
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,628
killed her.

538
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,555
What do you mean?

539
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,517
My sister won't disappear?

540
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,147
What does that mean?

541
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,741
It means exactly that.

542
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,198
She just won't disappear.

543
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,082
So exactly what are you talking about?

544
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,461
My wife told me to come clean with you.

545
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,745
She said that would help me.

546
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,052
So I'm going to tell you everything.

547
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,630
Go on.

548
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,813
The day your sister disappeared

549
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,935
eighteen years ago,

550
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,781
people thought I wasn't in Jihwa-dong.

551
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,775
But I was.

552
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,381
I'm home.

553
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,593
<i>I was always away from home due to work</i>

554
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,216
<i>and had returned home after a month.</i>

555
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,434
<i>But my wife wasn't home,
and I couldn't reach her either.</i>

556
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,386
Where is she? It's getting late.

557
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,057
<i>The house was a mess.</i>

558
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,443
<i>I was about to explode.</i>

559
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:50,901
<i>Then suddenly…</i>

560
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,283
Hello?

561
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,491
You should've told me in advance
if the machines were faulty.

562
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,889
Hey!

563
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,350
Darn it.

564
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,848
Come on. Who is it?

565
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,563
-What?
-Please help me.

566
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,687
What?

567
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,783
Sir, please help me.

568
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,435
<i>Back then,</i>

569
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,065
I didn't know who she was.

570
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,369
I only found out later
that she was your sister.

571
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,998
And then?

572
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,618
What happened after that?

573
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,756
Why?

574
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,717
Why would you?

575
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:06,927
Younghoon.

576
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,981
Tell me why!

577
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,653
I'm sorry.

578
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,975
Deny it. Tell me it wasn't you.

579
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,611
Tell me you didn't do it.

580
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,163
You may have taken the girls.

581
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,241
But you didn't harm them, right?

582
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,294
They ran away.

583
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,871
Dahyun returned home, and Gyeyoung…

584
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,506
Gyeyoung…

585
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,219
What in the world happened that day?

586
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,393
Then who was that man that I buried?

587
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,313
That guy…

588
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,942
was just a scapegoat of mine.

589
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,185
I was going to
dispose of him later anyway.

590
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,324
But you did me a favor.

591
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,735
Also,

592
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,952
as for Gyeyoung…

593
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,575
You're right.

594
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,079
<i>-She had escaped.</i>
-Are you okay?

595
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:20,724
Darn it.

596
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:26,434
-Soonchul, hurry up.
-What is it?

597
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,763
-What's wrong?
-Hey.

598
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,807
They ran away! Darn it!

599
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,227
We can find them.

600
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,279
Gyeyoung.

601
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,116
Girls.

602
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,470
Where are you?

603
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,551
I will find you.

604
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,478
Where are you?

605
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,940
Where could you be, Gyeyoung?

606
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,991
Come on. Who is it?

607
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,199
Please help me.

608
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,331
-What?
-Sir, please help me.

609
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,288
What did you say?

610
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,706
A bad man is following me.

611
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,680
Dongnam and Gyeyoung were together?

612
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,473
Yes.

613
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,717
So I thought it was the end for me.

614
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,558
But there was a surprising twist.

615
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,360
What did you do with her?

616
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,566
I…

617
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,080
left her there.

618
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,000
I didn't help her

619
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,166
and just left her behind.

620
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,646
-What?
-He just left.

621
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,070
Despite her plea for help,
he just left her there.

622
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:45,989
<i>A bad man?</i>

623
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,614
Where is he?

624
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,155
Where is that bad man?

625
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:56,203
He was following me until just now.

626
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,537
Jeez, just my luck.

627
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,673
Please help me.

628
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,959
Please let me get in your car.

629
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,173
Please take me home.

630
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,474
Come on.

631
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,679
Darn it.

632
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,481
Please let me go.

633
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,555
Please let me go, sir.

634
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,106
Please, sir.

635
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,990
So?

636
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,741
Did you harm her?

637
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,337
Let me ask you

638
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,296
just one question.

639
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,300
You went into that house instead of me.

640
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,139
That day when you offered to help.

641
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,345
If it was me…

642
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,518
who had gone in there instead,

643
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,645
would she have lived?

644
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,533
Would I have saved her?

645
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,248
Why are you curious about that?

646
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,289
Just tell me!

647
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,996
She was alive.

648
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,131
Kill me.

649
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,392
Kill me, Younghoon.

650
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,114
How…

651
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,242
How could you do that?

652
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,538
That little girl was begging
for your help, but you…

653
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,037
How? How could you?

654
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,210
Why should I have helped?

655
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,342
Do you even know
how tired I was that night?

656
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,877
Why should I have helped her

657
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,257
when I was going through hell myself?

658
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,479
Why are you looking at me like that?

659
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,232
What did I do so wrong
for you to judge me?

660
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,566
All I did was mind my own business.

661
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:17,741
So why does your sister
torture me all the time?

662
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:21,332
And why are you looking at me
with those judgmental eyes?

663
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,712
<i>It felt like the world</i>

664
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,264
<i>had abandoned me.</i>

665
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,428
Darn it.

666
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,736
Is he sleeping already?

667
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,237
I need to tell him.
