(Episode 11)

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,440
The dust has finally settled down.

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,520
You guys may not know,

17
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,120
but the rumours are outrageous.

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,600
They said that the Marquis brought four warlocks

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,520
from Northern Xinjiang to exorcise ghosts.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,600
The patients in the clinic were weak and feeble.

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,800
But when they talked about this,

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,240
they looked so lively.

23
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,800
Young Master,

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,479
I still feel worried.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,800
The maids in this palace

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
committed suicide.

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
I think this is not as simple as it seems.

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,920
This is a palace affair.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,040
We don't even know

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,480
who was involved in this case.

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,720
Just do your part and catch the culprit.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
You can't do anything about the rest.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
It's only been a few days.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
It seems that
you understand the politics better now.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,040
Don't think I don't know that

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,640
you're mocking me for being ignorant.

37
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,560
I don't dare to do so.

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,880
We're finally done with Xu Zhi's case.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,840
But we have no clues
about the wedding dress suicide case.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,320
It has been unsolved for so many years.

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,640
And the culprit didn't leave any clues behind.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,520
It's normal that you can't solve the case.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,640
Brother Su,

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,240
don't stress yourself out.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,120
You should relax sometimes.

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Maybe then you can get the answers.

47
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,520
Yeah.

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,200
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll make some food for everyone.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,680
We can celebrate together.

51
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,800
-Great.
-This is great.

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,570
(Huanjin Shop)

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,240
Fei Yuan,

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,560
are you buying them for Little Su and the gang?

55
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,200
Or are you buying them for yourself?

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,800
Of course I bought for them.

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,760
It's rare for us to gather together

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,720
and celebrate this festival.

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,040
Of course I need to buy extras.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Look at them. They're great.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
Have a look.

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
How much is this?

63
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,200
Eight copper coins.

64
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,480
Eight copper coins?

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,880
Look at the weaving technique

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,840
and its design.

67
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,080
This is cheap.

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,960
I'm sure you can't find another stall
as cheap as mine.

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,920
Give me a discount.

70
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,360
Why is Little Su buying girls' clothings?

71
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,440
We're having a feast today.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,480
They're delicious.

73
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,800
This...

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,360
Slow down.

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,079
Here's the last dish.

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,920
Isn't this my favourite dish?

77
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
Everything is your favourite.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,760
Delicious.

79
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,760
Young Master,

80
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,080
we've spent much on food these days.

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,000
Someone said he's going to pay us for the food.

82
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,320
But I think he hasn't paid us yet.

83
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,560
Little Fei Yuan, we're men, right?

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,920
We shouldn't count on meager fees.

85
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,480
Young Master, here.

86
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,880
Have more of them.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,080
-This is very delicious.
-Fei Yuan, it's my fault.

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,680
I know my fault now.

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,040
How about this?

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,840
Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

91
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,160
I'll treat you guys to a meal
at Sanyuan Restaurant.

92
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,880
What do you think?

93
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,800
Sure!

94
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,840
I thought we would eat at home?

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
I've prepared many foods.

96
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,320
Little Fei Yuan, I'm sure you don't get it.

97
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,320
The streets will be bustling tomorrow.

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,120
We can see

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,720
all types of rare items and toys.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,640
Really?

101
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah.

102
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,320
Little Su,

103
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,640
what do you think?

104
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,480
I still have some work to handle.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,600
I think I'll skip the celebration.

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,160
How could Mingjing Office do that to you!

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,160
They don't even let you rest
during Mid-Autumn Festival?

108
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,280
Brother Su, work is more important.

109
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,720
I'll bring you a gift
for Mid-Autumn Festival.

110
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,840
Thank you in advance.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
You're welcome.

112
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,280
Rushuang, try this.

113
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,080
This is delicious.

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Young Master, try this.

115
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,880
Tomorrow will be
Grandma's Seventh Year Anniversary.

116
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
You must be a good girl, okay?

117
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,760
I thought tomorrow would be Mid-Autumn Festival?

118
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,720
Grandma's death anniversary
was in last month, right?

119
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,600
Silly girl,

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,560
this is a rule of our tribe.

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,520
The seventh Mid-Autumn Festival
after relative's death

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,920
we call it the Seventh Year Anniversary.

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,440
Those who are alive

124
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,880
must embroider the names of the dead

125
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
on their clothes,

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
and pray to the moon with utmost sincerity.

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,160
Pray that their souls can return to our tribe,

128
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,760
and bless the family.

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,520
That's why you must be a good girl

130
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,320
and attend your embroidery lesson, okay?

131
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,600
If not, it'll be embarrassing

132
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,000
if you don't know
how to embroider when we're gone.

133
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,600
You mustn't say that!

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,280
I would rather stay ignorant forever.

135
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Silly girl.

136
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,760
Who's there?

137
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,360
It's me.

138
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,360
Please come in.

139
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Brother Pei, do you need anything?

140
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Here.

141
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,120
Preserved fruits from Fei Yuan.

142
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,840
Moon Lake?

143
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
You...

144
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,360
Do you need my help?

145
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,320
Nothing.

146
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,880
Brother Pei, if you excuse me,

147
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,320
I'll be reading some case records.

148
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,160
Okay.

149
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
I'll leave now.

150
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,120
Let's enjoy the lanterns. Come.

151
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,600
Okay.

152
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,760
Miss, please buy a sky lantern.

153
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,240
Buy it as a blessing for your family.

154
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,120
Look, it only costs three copper coins.

155
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,920
Thank you, Miss.

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,720
Why it's so quiet along the way?

157
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,080

This is my second time seeing your dance.

178
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,440
You're beautiful.

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,960
Did you disperse the crowd?

180
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,920
How did you make it?

181
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,480
I begged Prince Qi.

182
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Prince Qi?

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,560
How did he agree to your proposal?

184
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,520
I told him that

185
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,520
I have a girl whom I like very much.

186
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,360
She said she wanted to

187
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,600
enjoy the scenery at Moon Lake
during the festival.

188
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,520
But,

189
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,840
she's too shy.

190
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,120
She didn't want anyone to see her.

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,960
Although he reprimanded me,

192
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,240
he granted my request since it was

193
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,400
my first time to ask him for help.

194
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,920
You deserved that.

195
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,320
So,

196
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
how did you know I would come here?

197
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
You don't need to know that.

198
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,160
You just need to know that

199
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,240
I won't let you be in danger.

200
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,560
But,

201
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,400
next time,

202
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,560
if you want to take a risk
and act like this time,

203
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,640
please tell me beforehand.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm afraid.

205
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,520
I'm afraid that I'll be too late

206
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,760
and I couldn't protect you.

207
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,160
Believe me,

208
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,520
okay?

209
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,120
Thank you.

210
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,760
So,

211
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,440
let's fly the sky lantern.

212
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,880
Okay.

213
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,360
Make a wish now.

214
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,680
I hope her wish can come true.

215
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,440
I hope my eyes can be healed soon.

216
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,600
So I can enjoy the stars with her.

217
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,480
Brother Pei, what's this?

218
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,880
Change your clothes.

219
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
Let's find Brother Xie and Rushuang.

220
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,520
This is our first time celebrating together.

221
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,520
We shouldn't miss it.

222
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,320
Okay.

223
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,200
They're different!

224
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,360
Fei Yuan, look! There's a huge fish!

225
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,360
Everyone, please be quiet.

226
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,640
The view is much better when Brother Su is here.

227
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,920
Yeah. This is more like it.

228
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,880
Look, some plum blossoms.

229
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,600
Everyone, please be quiet.

230
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,040
Let's go over there.

231
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,440
Last question,

232
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,800
who do you hate the most

233
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,000
in this world?

234
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,160
Wang Chunhua.

235
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,760
Wang Chunhua.

236
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,960
Move aside!

237
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,600
What did you say?

238
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,240
What did you say?

239
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
I'm so furious!

240
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,960
You'll get it later!

241
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,600
Everyone, the trick that

242
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,440
I've performed just now

243
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,600
is the Secret of the Ancient Bell.

244
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,640
Everyone, you shouldn't underestimate

245
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,120
the power of this bell.

246
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,600
This is the bell

247
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,280
that Qin Shi Huang acquired from a mystic.

248
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,800
Not only is it powerful,

249
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,720
it even understands human.

250
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,800
You will never be able to lie
in front of the bell.

251
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,880
Is it that great? I don't believe it.

252
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,920
Rushuang, watch closely.

253
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,640
Boss,

254
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,880
can I have a try? I don't believe it.

255
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,240
Sure.

256
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,240
I'll sit here?

257
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,680
Please.

258
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,480
Mister,

259
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,960
do you have a wife?

260
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,040
Do you have a wife?

261
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,720
Tell us!

262
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,480
Not yet.

263
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,280
That's great.

264
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,400
I'm just worried that

265
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,680
you'll obtain the same result as the last man.

266
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
If that happens,

267
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,760
my business will be done for.

268
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,600
Little Fei Yuan, you...

269
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,480
Let's start now.

270
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,320
-Great!
-Great!

271
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,560
Slowly.

272
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,800
Close your eyes gently.

273
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,920
Let the bell touch your soul.

274
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Please tell everyone.

275
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,480
Do you have a wife or not?

276
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,079
I don't have one.

277
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,079
Do you have someone you like?

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,319
Yes.

279
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,480
Please tell everyone,

280
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,200
is your beloved right here with us?

281
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,440
Please say her name out loud!

282
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,240
She is...

283
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,760
What is this?

284
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,960
You're trying to trick me?

285
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,840
Everyone, watch closely.

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,680
This is

287
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,120
not Qin Shi Huang's bell at all.

288
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,160
It's just some hypnotic drugs.

289
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
He's tricking you guys!

290
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,320
I won't spare you.

291
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,720
Everyone,

292
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,960
remember to take your money back.

293
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,400
Don't let him trick you.

294
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,160
Let's go.

295
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,920
The world is getting worse.

296
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,720
There are so many scammers nowadays.

297
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
Brother Xie, you're amazing.

298
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,160
But what is this?

299
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,120
This is the hypnotic drug.

300
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,000
That scammer learned hypnotism.

301
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,920
And he used this as a ruse.

302
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,800
hypnotism?

303
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,760
Brother Xie, what is hypnotism?

304
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:22,865
(Hypnotism)

305
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,800
Hypnotism is a Western art.

306
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,720
It requires strong mental strength
of the hypnotist.

307
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,040
Only then, they can control people.

308
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,160
As for the street scammers,

309
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,560
they just learned the basics.

310
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,200
If the culprit
of the wedding dress suicide case

311
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,400
hypnotised the victims to kill themselves,

312
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
everything would make sense.

313
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,160
Survival instinct

314
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,320
is the strongest instinct a person has.

315
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
If they could manipulate
it with hypnotism,

316
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
it would be very scary.

317
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,640
I smelled the drug just now.

318
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
It contains Mandragora

319
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,120
and henbane.

320
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,440
These two herbs

321
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,440
serve to numb a person's consciousness.

322
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,080
Because these are rare herbs,

323
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,320
that's why the scammer
only used a little bit of them.

324
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,480
If a huge amount of them are used,

325
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,760
I'm afraid it will work.

326
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,680
That's why we need to
catch the culprit immediately.

327
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,080
If not, more girls will fall victim to it.

328
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,200
By the way, Rushuang,

329
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,320
since you know what it's made of,

330
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,960
can you create an antidote for it?

331
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
This takes trial and error.

332
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
I don't think I can create one
within a short time.

333
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,760
But I do know a formula.

334
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,240
It can reduce the hypnotic effect

335
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
to stay clear longer.

336
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,880
It's effective against most hypnotic drugs.

337
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,480
That will work.

338
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,160
Make me the medicine as soon as possible.

339
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:45,960
Okay.

340
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,240
Let's eat.

341
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,160
Why did the culprit

342
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
only target brides?

343
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,600
They committed suicide wearing a wedding dress.

344
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,680
The culprit longs after a sense of ritual.

345
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,000
It's because

346
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
he wanted to preserve their beauty.

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,240
He's sick in the head.

348
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,320
Brother Xie, what's wrong?

349
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,960
Maybe I inhaled too much of the drug.

350
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,520
I feel like I see a bell in front of me.

351
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,680
I'm giddy.

352
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,600
Wait.

353
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Brother Xie, what did you say?

354
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,520
I feel like I see a bell in front of me.

355
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,840
And I'm giddy.

356
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,480
Fei Yuan, help me out.

357
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
-Brother Xie, here
-Be careful.

358
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,800
Fei Yuan, let's go.

359
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,520
Yes.

360
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,000
Those who had been hypnotised

361
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,920
had impressions of their hypnotism.

362
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
All the victims heard the rain before they die.

363
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,560
That means

364
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
it's connected to water.

365
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,960
Connected to water?

366
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,160
But water is everywhere.

367
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,160
At least

368
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,840
we're getting closer to the truth.

369
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,520
Mister,

370
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Detective Su is here.

371
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,960
Detective Su, please.

372
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,760
Okay.

373
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,240
Detective Su,

374
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
did you have updates about Little Lan's case?

375
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,160
I still have some questions.

376
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,760
Please sit.

377
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,520
Did Miss Du make any
new friends before she died?

378
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,760
Or did she know any mysterious people?

379
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,800
No.

380
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,200
She wouldn't approach people like them.

381
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,160
Is it possible
she had contacts with them by accident?

382
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,080
She rarely went out.

383
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,600
Even if she did go out, I would accompany her.

384
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,520
Detective Su,

385
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,560
why are you asking these questions?

386
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,480
I suspect that Miss Du was hypnotised.

387
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,880
She was hypnotised?

388
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,800
It is also known as magic.

389
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,040
It can control a person's mind

390
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,840
with the help of drugs and others.

391
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,640
I can't believe it. A thing like that existed?

392
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,920
According to my knowledge,

393
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,120
there was no suspicious person

394
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,280
among the people she knew.

395
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,800
It's okay.

396
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,280
Maybe,

397
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,320
you can ask Zizhuo.

398
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,280
Her wedding was near.

399
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,200
She didn't go out.

400
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,880
We met each other

401
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,640
in private a few times.

402
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
Did Miss Du give this to you?

403
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,160
She made it herself.

404
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,000
It seems like Miss Du

405
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,720
was not an expert in embroideries.

406
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,760
Yeah.

407
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,920
Her hands were so beautiful.

408
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,480
She cherished her hands too.

409
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,840
It's rare for her to embroider.

410
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,080
Excuse me, Your Highness.

411
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,960
Why are you risking eliminating the poison

412
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,520
instead of continuing the conservative therapy.

413
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Although it may
heal your wounds completely,

414
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,400
it's too risky.

415
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,960
If something goes wrong,

416
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,840
you may go blind.

417
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,480
I've decided.

418
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,160
Save your breath.

419
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,160
Mr. Zhang, don't worry.

420
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,040
Whatever it ends,

421
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,800
I'll take the responsibility.

422
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,960
You're not to take the blame.

423
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,160
Your Highness, since you've decided,

424
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,640
I'll apply some needles onto you.

425
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I'll let the poison accumulate
in your Tianying Point.

426
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,920
Apply the medicine for 12 hours,

427
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,360
and the poison may be eliminated.

428
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,880
Little Su,

429
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,720
from tomorrow onwards,

430
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,120
I can enjoy the stars with you.

431
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,760
Mr. Physician,

432
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,280
does that mean His Highness

433
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,840
must apply it continuously for 12 hours?

434
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,800
Yes.

435
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,960
Although this treatment is not difficult,

436
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,760
it's not easy either.

437
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,520
We have to remove the poison at one go.

438
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,760
If we stop halfway,

439
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
the poison will seep through the surface.

440
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
And it may cause him to go blind.

441
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,840
Okay.

442
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,240
I'll stay beside His Highness.

443
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,578
(Pei Mansion)

444
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,000
Detective Su.

445
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,600
Are you looking for Young Master?

446
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,120
Yes.

447
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,840
I need to discuss the case with him.

448
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,560
Wait.

449
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
He's undergoing his treatment.

450
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,160
It's best if you don't interrupt him.

451
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,480
Okay.

452
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,880
Just let him continue his treatment.

453
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,800
Brother Su!

454
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,120
Rushuang.

455
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Here.

456
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,440
Take this.

457
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,160
This is the antidote

458
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,440
you've asked me to create.

459
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,280
This is great.

460
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,680
Detective Su,

461
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,680
why do you need this antidote?

462
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,520
Just in case.

463
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,480
If someone was hypnotised again,

464
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,560
this can save them.

465
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,760
Brother Su,

466
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,120
you know who's the culprit already?

467
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,480
I can't say for sure.

468
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,160
I need to think about it.

469
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,920
Young ladies.

470
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,920
Wedding dress.

471
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,480
Very beautiful.

472
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
Suicide.

473
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,720
What's the common denominator

474
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,760
among these attributes?

475
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,680
Look at her lips. They're gorgeous.

476
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,160
Lips.

477
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,960
Her hands were so beautiful.

478
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,800
She cherished her hands as well.

479
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,720
Hands.

480
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,000
Her hair was marvellous.

481
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,200
-I dare say
-Hair.

482
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,720
no one's hair in the capital
can compete with hers.

483
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,920
Neck.

484
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,000
All these ladies have
different attractive features.

485
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,760
What are their connections?

486
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,320
She said the rain was soothing.

487
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
But it didn't rain that day.

488
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,800
She wanted me to listen to the rain.

489
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,920
But the weather was sunny.

490
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,240
The weather was sunny.

491
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,280
Those who had been hypnotised

492
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,320
had impressions of their hypnotism.

493
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,920
All of them heard the rain.

494
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,400
It means that this hypnotism
is connected to water.

495
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,880
She asked her father

496
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,080
to hire a famous painter to paint this.

497
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Qu Linjiang?

498
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,320
Brother Qu wanted to draw a portrait

499
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,040
showing the beauty of the perfect girl.

500
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,760
He has been drawing it for many years.

501
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,520
Brother Qu is very particular about

502
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
every feature of his portrait.

503
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,360
I understand now.

504
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,840
They were the chosen materials.

505
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,720
You're awake?

506
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,040
Did you capture me

507
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,840
because you knew I suspected you?

508
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,640
You're really something.

509
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,720
But I don't care about

510
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,080
the case at all.

511
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,680
I brought you here
because of your beautiful eyes.

512
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,720
They're smart, agile, and beautiful.

513
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,200
Your eyes are what I've been looking for.

514
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,880
You knew I was...

515
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,760
Maybe it's hard for an ordinary person.

516
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,400
But for a painter like me,

517
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,320
it's very easy.

518
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,560
I knew you were a woman

519
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,760
when I first saw you.

520
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,280
That's the sound of rain
the victims had mentioned.

521
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,120
Hypnotic drug?

522
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,760
What should I do?

523
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,280
Rushuang's antidote

524
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,960
is in my clothes.

525
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,240
Is this henbane

526
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,040
or Mandragora?

527
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,200
Detective Su, you're amazing.

528
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,200
You even know what drugs I'm using.

529
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,400
All the victims,

530
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
they committed suicide

531
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,480
because you hypnotised them, right?

532
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,800
They were lucky that

533
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,920
they were chosen by me.

534
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,440
I suggest that you forget it.

535
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,000
Don't worry. It's very comfortable.

536
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,400
It won't hurt at all.

537
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,160
I'm not afraid of you.

538
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,200
But those who are hypnotised will lose focus

539
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,480
and their eyes will be affected.

540
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm afraid that you will lose the eyes you want

541
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,240
if you do hypnotise me.

542
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,520
I'm bounded.

543
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,000
And you've used your hypnotic drug too.

544
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,240
I can't escape anyway.

545
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,360
Yes.

546
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
You're the perfect addition
to my portrait of beauty.

547
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,760
Mr. Qu, as long as you don't hypnotise me,

548
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
I will not move or escape.

549
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,520
I'll let you finish your portrait of beauty.

550
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,960
Great!

551
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,760
Detective Su, you're different
from other women indeed.

552
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,280
No wonder Brother Pei fancies you

553
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,120
and is willing to play alongside your act.

554
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,800
It only concerns me.

555
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,120
He has nothing to do with this.

556
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,240
Don't drag innocent people into this.

557
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,800
So, you guys fancy each other?

558
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,800
Fei Yuan,

559
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
is it going to rain?

560
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,200
Yeah.

561
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
I think it's going to be a downpour.

562
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,160
I wonder if Little Su is back?

563
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,960
Detective Su came back already.

564
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,200
I met him at the door just now.

565
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,040
He asked you to continue your treatment.

566
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,160
He came for me?

567
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,400
He did.

568
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,280
No.

569
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,520
Surely there's something wrong
if she came to me.

570
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,280
I need to go to his room.

571
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,200
Young Master, wait.

572
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,240
You're in no condition.

573
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,440
Take me there.

574
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,400
Young Master, it's late already.

575
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,080
Can't you just find him tomorrow?

576
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
Young Master, am I right?

577
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,800
Enough. Take me there.

578
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,040
Fine. Wait for me.

579
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,240
The weather is quite cold.

580
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,960
All the victims

581
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
went to Puhua Temple before, right?

582
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,160
I don't think that's a coincidence.

583
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,800
Misses love to

584
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,760
pray for love in Puhua Temple.

585
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,880
Don't you think

586
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,080
that's the best place for me to find my prey?

587
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,480
Why did you kill them?

588
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
The most painful thing in the world

589
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,440
is the passing of beauty.

590
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,200
Hair will turn grey.

591
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,800
Lips will become gloom.

592
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,000
Even hands will grow wrinkles.

593
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,520
Even your eyes

594
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,280
will become dead.

595
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,720
How could you stand that

596
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,560
when you know it's going to happen?

597
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,360
When they wear their wedding dress,

598
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,240
time stops at their most beautiful moment.

599
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
They won't turn ugly.

600
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,440
And they won't turn old.

601
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,160
They'll live in my portrait

602
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,120
forever.

603
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,920
You killed so many people

604
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,520
for that ridiculous reason?

605
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,920
You're only the ninth victim.
It's not that many.

606
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,040
Don't worry.

607
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,760
After I'm done,

608
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,560
you'll preserve your beauty forever.
