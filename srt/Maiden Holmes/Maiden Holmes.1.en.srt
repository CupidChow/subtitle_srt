(Episode 1)

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
The Green Dragon Sword on his hand

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,600
was slashing everywhere.

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,080
He forcefully fought his way out

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,120
while surrounded by the enemy forces.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,720
As Tuo Mu, the enemy general,

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,639
got closer to him,

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,880
Tuo Mu took a look

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,240
and found the situation desperate.

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,240
He waved the commanding flag

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,760
and all his guards

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,320
shot poison arrows at Prince Qi.

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,240
Although Prince Qi is young,

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,080
he is highly skilled in martial arts.

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,000
The poison arrows

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,520
never did any damage to him.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,760
Childe.

32
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,000
Over here.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
I got you.

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,200
The peach blossom fragrance on Miss Biyun

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,120
is so refreshing.

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,240
Who is Prince Qi?

37
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,040
He is our dynasty's God of War.

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,000
Every guard who saw him

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,120
was terrified.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,960
Run!

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,200
The God of War is coming!

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,200
We're finished if we don't escape now!

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
Good!

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,440
Good!

45
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,320
My dear audiences, if you want to know...

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,120
Sir, you're here?

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,320
You should inform me earlier.

48
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,280
I have a premium room...

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,240
(Mingjing Office)

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
Mingjing Office is investigating a case.

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,280
Miss Qingshao is the naughtiest.

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
All three of us used the jasmine fragrance.

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
How do you know it's me?

54
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,680
Miss Qingshao

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,600
likes to comb your hair with osmanthus oil.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm here.

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,200
What's wrong?

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,080
Sir.

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,920
There're a few private rooms on top.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,880
Let's go.

61
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,720
Wait, sir!

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
Wait for a minute.

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,520
My decorations are expensive.

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,080
Please be careful.

65
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,360
Who are you?

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,080
What are you doing?

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
-Get out.
-I'm sorry.

69
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,960
Please go on. I'm sorry.

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,160
Officer.

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,280
Childe.

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,680
What are you doing?

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,480
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,560
Don't you know how to knock? Get out!

75
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
Drink.

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,240
Everyone's happy today.

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,960
Don't run.

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,440
Miss Qingshao, I'm going to...

79
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,240
I'm here!

80
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,839
Come.

81
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,880
Pervert.

82
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,280
Officer.

83
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,071
How can I help you?

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
Right-handed.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,800
It's not him.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,880
Officer.

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,120
What do you mean?

88
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Officer.

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,400
This sir

90
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,320
is not a criminal.

91
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,040
Let him go, alright?

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
One last room.

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,640
We have a business to do.

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,760
Who are you?

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
What are you doing?

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
Thousand-faced Man.

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
You are under arrest.

98
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
You're talking about the rapist?

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Where is he?

100
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,760
Rapist?

101
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,040
Are you talking about me?

102
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,800
I'm not talking about you.

103
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,040
It's her.

104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,200
She says it's me.

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,600
Are you kidding me?

106
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,720
How can a weak girl

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
be the rapist?

108
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Stop pretending.

109
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
You will never change your body into a woman

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,040
no matter how perfect your disguise is.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
She is not a woman?

112
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,840
I don't think you are a man too.

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,960
The girls here are always dancing.

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,600
They reveal their ankles and put bells on them.

115
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
They cared about the skin on their ankles.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,240
But your ankles

117
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,200
are rough.

118
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,640
Of course.

119
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,080
You can argue that

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,560
you're not following the rules here.

121
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,080
However,

122
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,520
you're left-handed.

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,560
There are still drugs in your nails.

124
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,560
I think you drugged the woman you replaced

125
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
and hid her somewhere.

126
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,280
He's really a man?

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,480
I even kissed him.

128
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
Yuck.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,560
Bring him away.

130
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,120
Yes!

131
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Go!

132
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,400
Wait.

133
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,120
You won't thank me?

141
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,520

He left.

147
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,760
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

148
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Tell me.

149
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,919
How can being a dandy

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
tougher than leading an army to war?

151
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,760
My lord.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My lord, your eyes.

153
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
I'm used to it.

154
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Don't worry.

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
someone will be targeting
the disaster relief fund soon.

158
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,760
As expected.

159
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,160
Local rumours said that

160
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,280
the silvers were swallowed

161
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,680
due to Dragon King's rage.

162
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,600
Monsters and ghosts are not scary.

163
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,080
It's scary when someone's pretending to be them.

164
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,040
Will you investigate it in person?

165

Of course.

166
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,200
Just tell everyone

167

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
Lead officer.

177
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,160
I should be the one to investigate
the Robbery by Dragon King case.

178
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,360
I've given the case

179
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,360
to Su Ci.

180
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
I was investigating

181
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,880
the Thousand-faced Man case.

182
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,520
But you let Young Officer Su

183
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
handle the arrest.

184
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,040
You're doing it again now.

185
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,480
Are you being biased?

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,720
Young Officer Luo, you've misunderstood.

187
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Thousand-faced Man excels in disguises.

188
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,160
Su Ci is observant.

189
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,520
I think he is more suitable
to handle the arrest.

190
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
I can arrest him as well

191
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,280
if I was given time.

192
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,000
How many innocent females
will get hurt before you find him?

193
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
Will you ignore this to achieve success,

194
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,560
Young Officer Luo?

195
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,440
You...

196
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,320
Alright.

197
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
Stop fighting.

198
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Young Officer Luo.

199
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,440
I have

200
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,200
a case for you that's more important.

201
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,960
Headless female corpse case.

202
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,600
This is already the fifth case.

203
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I depend on you

204
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,840
to arrest this serial killer.

205
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,120
I'll also be leaving then.

206
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,720
Su Ci.

207
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Bring this with you.

208
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:08,095
(The Legend of Prince Qi, Victory at Kunshan)

209
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,200
I've been finding this for a long time.

210
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,480
Thank you, lead officer.

211
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
But,

212
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,920
you bought this book
with your secret stash, right?

213
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,480
What are you talking about?

214
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,080
I'm the head of the family.

215
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,280
I don't need a secret stash.

216
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,720
Yes.

217
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,440
You only get one silver as your pocket money

218
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,320
although your monthly pay is 50 silver.

219
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,040
Go and investigate your case.

220
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,600
Yes. I'll be leaving.

221
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,200
Thank you, Lead Officer.

222
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,560
Qingshui County is in a famine.

223
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,000
Bring more provisions.

224
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
Understood!

225
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,760
Mother!

226
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,400
Mother!

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
Father. Mother.

228
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm going out to investigate a case.

229
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,040
Don't worry.

230
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,080
Take this.

231
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,440
Remember.

232
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,920
Live on no matter how difficult it is.

233
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,440
(Yan)

234
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,600
(Mansion of Prince Qi)
How are Mingjing Office's arrangements?

235
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,320
Officer Su should be on his way.

236
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,120
Make way.

237
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Fei Yuan.

238
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,760
Are you moving?

239
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
You are bringing me on a trip.

240
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,880
I have to

241
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,767
take good care of your daily necessities.

242
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,520
I think

243
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,200
the bed is the only thing you didn't bring.

244
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,360
Oh. I need to bring the pillow.

245
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,760
He isn't used to sleep outside.

246
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,760
Come over here.

247
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,960
I can only

248
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,280
bring you or the carriage.

249
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
Think about it.

250
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,800
What?

251
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,520
Bring me along!

252
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,520
Come out!

253
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,680
Fine.

254
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:10,800
I'll count to three.

255
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,200
One.

256
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,960
Two.

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,120
Three!

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,920
Do you think I can't notice you

259
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,960
with your weak kung fu?

260
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,920
Young Master.

261
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,760
Shut up!

262
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm telling you.

263
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:53,824
I'll be angry

264
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,040
with anyone who follows me

265
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
and interrupts my adventures.

266
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm leaving.

267
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Stand here.

268
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,400
Young Master.

269
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,920
Are you defying me?

270
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,320
It's not the capital out there.

271
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,440
They don't have our bank.

272
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
Take these with you.

273
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
You have a point.

274
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,640
I need this.

275
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,200
Young Master. Bring this as well.

276
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,520
Keep it for yourself.
You are the one who's wounded.

277
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,480
Young Master. Take this.

278
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,800
A book?

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,920
Yes.

280
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,120
The Best Girl-chasing Guide?

281
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,600
I'm going to help people.

282
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,960
Why do I need this?

283
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,600
Get lost!

284
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,040
It's time for me, Xie Beiming to show my skills.

285
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,200
Are you blind?

286
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,200
There's a warrior standing here.

287
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,400
(Qingshui County)

288
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,720
Vegetables.

289
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,600
Come and buy.

290
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,920
Mom, wake up. I brought you food.

291
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,119
Alright.

292
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,560
Come and see.

293
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,800
Fresh vegetables.

294
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,640
(Fuding Tea House)

295
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,680
(Fuding Tea House)
Come again.

296
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,240
Dear guests. This way.

297
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
-Hu!
-Yes.

298
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,280
Clear the beggars down there.

299
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,880
They are affecting our business.

300
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,920
Alright.

301
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,400
Get going.

302
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,480
Don't stay here.

303
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,880
You too. Hurry up and leave.

304
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,480
Please save my child.

305
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
Please save her.

306
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,880
-Let's go and have a look.
-For you.

307
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,920
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

308
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,440
Thank you.

309
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,040
Thank you.

310
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,120
Look. They are coming.

311
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,400
What a grand ceremony.

312
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,280
Yes.

313
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,240
It's amazing.

314
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:08,280
Young Master.

315
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,280
Young Master, look.

316
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
It's so lively.

317
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,200
Brother.

318
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,440
What are they doing?

319
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,680
It's such a grand ceremony.

320
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,600
It's the Dragon King's marriage.

321
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,680
Dragon King's marriage?

322
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,480
Yes.

323
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,760
Sacrifice a female

324
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,000
to serve the Dragon King.

325
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,240
They are sacrificing a human.

326
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,520
A human?

327
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,080
Qingshui County

328
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,320
has a year full of disasters.

329
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,440
There's a flood in the first half

330
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:04,672
and a locust plague in the second half.

331
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,680
All the farms have no produce.

332
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,320
We have no choice.

333
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,760
Yes.

334
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,840
Isn't there a disaster relief fund
from the government?

335
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,800
There is.

336
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,000
But the silvers

337
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
were swallowed by the Dragon King.

338
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,160
Initially,

339
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,760
there was not a drop of rain.

340
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,040
Suddenly, there was a heavy thunderstorm

341
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,360
on the night

342
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,720
the fund was transported here.

343
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,640
A flash

344
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
of lightning

345
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,120
struck the ship.

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
Did you witness it?

347
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,400
I saw it with my eyes.

348
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,680
The Dragon King was occupying the ship

349
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,000
that is transporting silvers.

350
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:37,400
There was a large crack.

351
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,640
Half of the county heard that.

352
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,480
Yes.

353
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,440
I heard it.

354
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,000
The Dragon King struck a hole in the ship

355
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
and it sank.

356
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,080
I didn't see the sunk ship

357
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,600
but I saw the chests that was brought up.

358
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,280
The silvers inside turned into stones.

359
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
They turned into stones?

360
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,840
Please bless us all.

361
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
How do I go to the County Court?

362
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
Head there, it's not far.

363
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,320
Thank you.

364
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,600
Excuse me, how do I go to the County Court?

365
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,720
It's right in front.

366
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,640
Thank you.

367
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Officer Su.

368
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Are you going to make a report?

369
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,720
It's you.

370
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,560
I never offended you.

371
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
I even saved you.

372
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,160
You shouldn't

373
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,360
ignore me no matter what.

374
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
If you hadn't had saved me before,

375
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,960
I would've already arrested you
for interfering with public duties.

376
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,320
Did I offend you in any way?

377
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,440
A dandy won't care
about the sufferings of the people.

378
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,720
But please don't interfere with my duties.

379
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,640
If the court cared about it,

380
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,360
why would they stay silent

381
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,160
up until this point?

382
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,440
Money! Hurry up!

383
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,040
They are mine!

384
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,440
They are mine!

385
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,160
Let's go!

386
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm sure you have a spare key.

387
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't.

388
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,480
All of them got silvers

389
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,280
but I didn't get anything.

390
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,320
I'm hungry!

391
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,320
Let go of me.

392
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
Let go of me, so I can give it to you.

393
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,520
No.

394
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,920
You might escape if I let go of you.

395
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,520
Officer Su.

396
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,040
There are some silvers in my left pocket.

397
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,080
Help me out.

398
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,360
Take them.

399
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,040
Nothing's in there.

400
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,320
Maybe it's further in.

401
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,840
Officer Su, hurry up.

402
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,160
My hand is breaking.

403
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,840
Here you are.

404
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,840
Young Master.

405
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,760
Young Master.

406
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,960
Your hand...

407
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,800
I'm fine.

408
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,080
How's your investigation?

409
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,560
5:45 p.m.

410
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,840
at the city's West Pier.

411
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,080
5:45 p.m.?

412
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,520
5:45 p.m.?

413
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,840
We are late.

414
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,560
You are saving them like this?

415
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,440
What else can I do?

416
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,160
Where are you going?

417
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,960
The pier.

418
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,280
Come back.

419
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,480
You...

420
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,320
How can you save them?

421
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,200
How do you escape after that?

422
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
Where will you put the girl you saved?

423
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,760
Fei Yuan, where's the thing I asked you to find?

424
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,920
It's here.

425
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,840
We're using a surprise attack

426
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,360
and save the girl during the ritual.

427
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,880
There are many citizens there.

428
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,720
We need to escape immediately after the rescue.

429
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
We can't ignite the citizens rage.

430
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,920
Remember.

431
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,680
We escape from this forest.

432
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,680
Fei Yuan.

433
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
Don't participate

434
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,520
in our rescue.

435
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,560
Act as a diversion. Understand?

436
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,600
Yes.

437
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,960
We will rescue the victim.

438
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
Young Master.

439
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,400
This...

440
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,560
We will be late. Let's go.

441
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,200
Today is a good day.

442
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,160
We are offering a girl.

443
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,760
Dragon King, please accept our offering.

444
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,520
Our county had a flood in the first half and

445
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,400
a locust plague in the second half of the year.

446
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,520
Farmers have no produce.

447
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,600
The government's disaster relief fund
was swallowed by the Dragon King.

448
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,280
The Dragon King is blaming us
for not serving him well.

449
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,800
The time has come.

450
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,160
The girl will enter the river now.

451
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,840
Dragon King. Bless us.

452
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,000
Bless us with peace and prosperity.

453
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,480
Light the fire.

454
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,360
Bless us.

455
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,000
Bless us with peace and prosperity.

456
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,560
Dragon King. Please bless us.

457
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
Dragon King. Bless us.

458
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,280
Bless us.

459
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,160
Stop it!

460
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,240
Who are they?

461
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
Stop them!

462
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,720
Oh, no.

463
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,520
Catch them!

464
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm sorry. Father.

465
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,280
Mother.

466
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,680
Brother Su.

467
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,040
Brother Su, are you alright?

468
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,960
I'm just giving you air.

469
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Why are you angry?

470
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,960
I'm not angry.

471
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,200
Hurry up!

472
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,280
Stop them!

473
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,120
They are in cahoots.

474
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,200
Hurry.

475
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,360
Hurry!

476
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,200
Stand there!

477
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,120
Don't run!

478
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,360
Stop!

479
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,720
Hurry!

480
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,800
Who are you?

481
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,560
You brought a fainted girl here.

482
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,800
What are you trying to do?

483
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,480
Why is a brat like you

484
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,000
following a warrior like me?

485
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,560
I'm here to save her.

486
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,440
I need to help whenever there's trouble.

487
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,400
Come.

488
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,200
Hold it right there.

489
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,280
First, I don't fight with kids.

490
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,360
Secondly, I think we are all here

491
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,840
to save this girl.

492
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,760
I won't fight with you.

493
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,480
It's getting late.

494
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
She is wearing so less.

495
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,360
She might catch a cold.

496
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,400
Here.

497
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,040
Kid, you're capable.

498
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,360
Who's a kid?

499
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,720
This way.

500
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,400
They are over there!

501
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,000
Head over there.

502
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,520
Find them out.

503
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,120
Hurry!

504
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,400
This girl,

505
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,240
why hasn't she wake up yet?

506
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
You hit her too hard.

507
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,400
I never hit a girl before.

508
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,920
I couldn't control my strength.

509
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,080
If she becomes retarded,

510
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,280
you have to be responsible for her.

511
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,680
What?

512
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
What do you mean?

513
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,480
Marry her.

514
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,080
It's always like this in books.

515
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,480
How can I simply marry her?

516
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
You are so irresponsible.

517
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,760
If it's my young master, he will...

518
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,080
Where's Young Master?

519
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,040
Why isn't he here yet?

520
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,320
Kid. Where are you going?

521
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,760
-This way.
-Stop!

522
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,120
This way!

523
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,520
Hurry up!

524
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,520
Hurry.

525
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,040
Hurry!

526
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Cold.

527
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,080
So cold.

528
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,200
Cold.

529
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,640
So cold.

530
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,960
Miss, you're awake?

531
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,680
Miss, let me explain.

532
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,720
I am...

533
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,000
Stand there.

534
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,200
Miss.

535
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,280
Don't poison me.

536
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,120
I'm still a child.

537
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,920
Tell me.

538
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,240
Are you two in cahoots?

539
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,120
No.

540
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,000
We aren't.

541
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,720
I was supposed to save you

542
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,240
but this guy appeared suddenly.

543
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,480
I hardly caught up to both of you.

544
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,320
That's fine.

545
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,600
He ruined my plan.

546
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,560
He deserves to freeze here.

547
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,240
Let's go.

548
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Wait.

549
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,480
I'm waiting for my young master here.

550
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,080
Young master?

551
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,560
They are over there!

552
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,920
Someone's coming.

553
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,840
Where are they?

554
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,600
I heard sounds coming from here.

555
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,800
Where are they?

556
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,480
Let's go there!

557
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,880
Alright. Hurry.

558
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,680
You...

559
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,640
I have a sickness.

560
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,960
I can't see clearly at night.

561
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,320
So your sense of smell is good

562
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,960
because of your poor eyesight.

563
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,840
What should we do?

564
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,800
