(Episode 6)

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
Your Highness.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,960
This is Detective Su's identity information.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,320
His mother died in childbirth.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,560
His father passed away
from illness 2 years ago too.

19
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
Detective Su is all on his own now,

20
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,880
renting a house at West YongFu Lane.

21
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,120
Other than these,

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
there's not much special information.

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,040
Those few dishes are really not bad.

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,800
What?

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,840
No rooms available?

26
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,360
young master,

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,200
it's said that Empress Dowager is choosing
a wife for Prince Qi.

28
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,760
Many people are coming into
the city from all places.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,080
Our inn is also full everyday.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,360
We really don't have vacant rooms.

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,160
This... I...

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,080
Brother Xie,

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,000
let's go and check other inns.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,920
No!

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
No way.

36
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm worried if you live in other inn.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
Then...

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,440
Okay.

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,280
Clear Tianzi first room for me.

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,160
According to the rules

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,480
for Tianzi 1st room,
unless it's for special occasion,

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,280
it's not open for public.

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,080
This is a special occasion now.

44
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,600
Oh, she's your future wife!

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,760
I apologise for not recognising.

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,040
I'll go and clear up Tianzi 1st room now.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Go, go!

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
Yes, yes, yes.

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
About the case of the disaster relief fund

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,360
Su Ci has screwed it up.

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,400
I know.

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,200
Tell me, what's the point
of finding back the fund.

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,360
I heard only a mere magistrate was caught

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,400
who was even killed.

55
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,800
Tell me if this isn't considered screwed up.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,320
It's true when you put it that way.

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,880
Young officer Luo!

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,480
Young officer Luo,

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,160
you've done great
in the headless female corpse case.

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,440
Teach me when you have time.

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,840
Read more scroll files if you have time.

62
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,360
Have you found it?

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Yes.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,960
You won't find anything like this.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,480
Please give me advice, young officer Luo.

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,840
Normally this type of totem

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
is commonly used by organisations in jianghu.

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,840
You're searching on penalty tattoo,

69
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,680
naturally you won't find anything.

70
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,280
Thank you young officer Luo.

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,120
Young master, quickly.

72
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,480
You're missing Little Su, right?

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,280
While investigating with Detective Su,

74
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
it's so fun!

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,080
It's so boring now.

76
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,280
Also,

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
didn't I say I wanted to treat Detective Su

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
to a meal?

79
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,040
We can have a meal

80
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,400
but we have to go to a restaurant.

81
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,920
If they follow us home,

82
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,200
he'll find out I'm Prince Qi.

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,240
Alright, alright, let's go.

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,200
Move aside! Move aside!

85
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,880
This...

86
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,080
Who is it? So bossy.

87
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,040
It looks like a carriage
from Mansion of Marquis Yong'an.

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
Let's go.

89
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
Did you hear someone calling for help?

90
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,880
What?

91
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,240
N... No.

92
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,080
Young master,

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,240
are you already obsessed with

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,280
investigating cases with Detective Su?

95
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,560
Let's go now.

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
Young master, faster!

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
It's almost past meal time.

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,520
This is...

99
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,200
You should cover the scar on your neck.

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,120
Little Su's silk handkerchief?

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
It's Little Su!

102
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,960
Chase after it!

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,800
Crown prince, I've caught the person.

104
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
Aren't you a capable one.

105
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Leave.

106
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,640
I'll take my time playing with him.

107
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,880
Yes.

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,640
Who are you?

109
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,680
How dare you kidnap a government officer!

110
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,600
I'll will let you know later.

111
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,640
Son of Marquis Yong'an

112
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,320
is not some minor role like you

113
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
can offend easily.

114
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,640
I've already left some clues,

115
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
people from the Mingjing Office
will arrive soon.

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,520
You'd better let me go!

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,960
A mere Mingjing Office
dares to ask a person from me?

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,680
What do you take me for?

119
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,440
You really don't know my abilities

120
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,080
without some torment.

121
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
You have a secret like this on you!

122
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,720
Interesting!

123
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,440
Let go of me!

124
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,280
My subordinates are too rude.

125
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,080
I'll attend to you well tonight.

126
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,280
Come.

127
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Soft and small, like nature itself!

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,840
Go away!

129
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,880
Such a best one!

130
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,520
Help!

131
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,840
Help!

132
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,640
Open the door!

133
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,760
Help!

134
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,640
Anyone there?

135
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Stop shouting!

136
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,679
This is my private mansion.

137
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,520
No one will save you.

138
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,080
What do you want to do?

139
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,520
I'll let you be a woman once tonight.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Such a beauty like you

141
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,600
wearing guys' outfit,

142
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,000
so unfortunate.

143
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,240
Shameless.

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,960
Release me now!

145
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,560
Detective Su,

146
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,240
besides loving beauties,

147
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,520
I have another problem,

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,080
which is talking nonsense
when I'm in a bad mood.

149
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,760
What if I accidentally

150
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,200
slipped out your secret about cross-dressing?

151
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,480
What do you think

152
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,800
will happen?

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,320
Don't be scared.

154
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,200
As long as you serve me well today,

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,640
serve until I'm comfortable,

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
I'll keep your secret.

157
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,840
Stay with me in the future,

158
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,840
having nightlife together,

159
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,840
isn't it exciting?

160
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,440
It's said the son of Marquis Yong'an

161
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,920
is admirable and charming.

162
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,920
I thought you were good-looking,

163
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
but now,

164
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
aren't you just an ugly

165
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
pathetic person?

166
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,640
If it's not for your ancestors' virtue,

167
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,200
granting you the title Son of Marquis,

168
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,080
which woman is willing to be with you?

169
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Not even nightlife,

170
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,080
I already feel like vomiting
just by looking at you.

171
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,080
You stink!

172
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,360
Get up!

173
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Damn woman.

174
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,520
Refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit.

175
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,080
Come.

176
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,360
Drink a cup of this.

177
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
I assure you'll feel ecstatic.

178
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,400
Let go of me.

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,360
Where is Xiao Junhao?

180
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm asking you where is Xiao Junhao?!

181
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,080
His Highness

182
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,760
is at the backyard.

183
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,240
Let go of me.

184
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,560
You'll be begging me not to go later.

185
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
Let go of me!

186
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,960
Stop pretending.

187
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,600
Don't touch me.

188
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,960
Don't touch me!

189
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,320
Little Su.

190
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,360
Don't touch me.

191
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Don't touch me!

192
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,160
Which bastard

193
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,000
dares to ruin my plan?

194
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,960
Your Highness.

195
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
I'm a good friend of Detective Su.

196
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,480
Your Highness, it's a mistake.

197
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,440
Your Highness. She... She...

198
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,560
Little Su.

199
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,280
Don't touch me.

200
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,960
I came late.

201
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,120
Don't touch me.

202
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't touch me!

203
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,640
Little Su, don't be scared.

204
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,120
Don't touch me.

205
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,640
Don't touch me.

206
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,480
Don't touch me!

207
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,480
It's me.

208
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
It's me!

209
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,640
Move aside.

210
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,840
I'll have mercy on you.

211
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,280
Hot.

212
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Don't worry.

213
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,720
I'll take you away soon.

214
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,560
Since you all want to die,

215
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll do as you wish!

216
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,920
I'll bring you home.

217
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,280
Your Highness.

218
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,880
I came late, please forgive me.

219
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,320
Alright. Deal with the aftermath.

220
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,480
Yes!

221
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,640
Quick!

222
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,400
Yes! Yes!

223
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,680
Little Su.

224
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,760
Don't touch me.

225
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,320
Don't touch me!

226
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,120
Little Su!

227
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,160
Don't you touch me!

228
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,360
Don't touch me.

229
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,360
Don't touch me.

230
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Little Su, open your eyes.

231
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,640
It's me, Pei Zhao.

232
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,120
I feel so hot.

233
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,600
Don't move!

234
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,880

I think

243
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,840

Little Su, are you awake?

261
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,600
Why are you here?

262
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,920
Does your head still hurt?

263
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll pour you a cup of water.

264
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,000
Let go of me.

265
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,080
You'll be begging me not to go later.

266
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,360
Let go of me!

267
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,040
Stop pretending.

268
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,120
Here.

269
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,480
You... knew?

270
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,880
Yes.

271
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
You didn't know it just now.

272
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,080
Yes.

273
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,600
When?

274
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,080
When you disguised as a dancer.

275
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,480
Of course,

276
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,840
you knew about my identity in the beginning,

277
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,480
but you pretended you didn't know

278
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,200
and purposely probed me.

279
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,880
What are you up to?

280
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,720
I have no ill intention!

281
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,360
You watch me act very hard everyday,

282
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,480
just like watching a silly show,

283
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,520
do you think it's interesting?

284
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,520
Little Su!

285
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,480
You know I'm not the kind of person.

286
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,000
Don't touch.

287
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,240
Don't touch.

288
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,720
Do you hear me?

289
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,680
A girl

290
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,120
hiding herself at a

291
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,160
most innocent and simple age,

292
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,560
naturally you have your hardship.

293
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,880
You cross-dressed as a guy

294
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,400
working in the government

295
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,640
is already a crime of deceiving the King.

296
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
Moreover,

297
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,800
everyone in the Mingjing Office
is best at detecting.

298
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,440
Wanting to hide your identity before them

299
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,720
is even more difficult.

300
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
Stop it.

301
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
All these years,

302
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,480
your life must be hard,

303
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
how could I bear to expose you?

304
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,200
Little Su.

305
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,440
Don't worry.

306
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,200
I will keep your secret.

307
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,720
If you don't believe me,

308
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,840
you can kill me right now.

309
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,520
There's another most important reason

310
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
I did not expose,

311
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,400
it's because

312
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,640
I like you.

313
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,440
You can't.

314
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,200
Why?

315
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,960
Yesterday you...

316
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,480
I think

317
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
I fell in love with you.

318
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,200
I was drugged yesterday,

319
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,560
I was unconscious,

320
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,120
it doesn't count!

321
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,040
I can now

322
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,520
clearly tell you

323
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,040
I don't like you.

324
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,520
Do you not like me

325
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,480
or you can't like me?

326
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,760
We can only be friends.

327
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,320
Little Su.

328
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
I understand.

329
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,400
Don't worry.

330
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,040
I'll keep your secret.

331
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Also, don't worry about Xiao Junhao.

332
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,560
I'll take care of it.

333
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,960
You...

334
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
didn't ask me why.

335
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,400
You must have your own reasons.

336
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,120
I will wait until the day you tell me first.

337
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
Brother Pei.

338
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
I will not let you keep my secret for nothing.

339
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,760
I'll give you 3 promises.

340
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,000
You can ask me to do anything.

341
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,520
I won't reject.

342
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,000
I swear.

343
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,880
Do you have to draw the line like this?

344
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,840
Yes.

345
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,440
Okay then.

346
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,400
You have to answer my request.

347
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,720
Do say.

348
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,360
Move in with me.

349
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,720
This...

350
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm worried about you living alone.

351
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,640
It's my request.

352
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,040
You cannot reject.

353
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,120
With you moving here

354
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,880
you can also watch on me

355
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,520
to see if I am keeping your secret.

356
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,280
Are you going to break your promise?

357
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,200
Okay.

358
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,240
These few cases are really troublesome.

359
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,080
Right. Clues are not enough.

360
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,920
Right.

361
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,200
Will everyone

362
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,320
already know I'm a woman.

363
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,400
Have you heard?

364
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,800
The son of Marquis Yong'an is done for.

365
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,120
Done for?

366
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,120
He did so many bad things normally

367
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,120
but he always got away with it.

368
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,960
But he offended Prince Qi.

369
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Prince Qi entered the Palace late night,

370
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,040
took away his hereditary,

371
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,280
and sent him to the North.

372
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,520
He deserved it.

373
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,960
Brother Su.

374
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,960
Rushuang.

375
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,920
You're finally back.

376
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,360
Why are you all here?

377
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,800
Yesterday we heard Fei Yuan said
you were kidnapped.

378
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,800
We were so worried.

379
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,840
Are you okay?

380
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,600
Brother Su, are you hurt?

381
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,400
I... I'm alright.

382
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,040
No, I'm still worried.

383
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,360
Let me check your pulse.

384
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,280
No, it's fine.

385
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,520
I'm really alright.

386
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,800
Don't worry.

387
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,040
If I knew this would happen,

388
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,440
I should not have let those rogues leave.

389
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,880
It's my fault.

390
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,880
I should have insisted on going with you.

391
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,560
Otherwise a handful of poison powder from me,

392
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,640
will have that whatever he's called

393
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,080
crying and begging for help.

394
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,920
Brother Pei too.

395
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,360
He said you needed rest

396
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,000
so he wouldn't tell us where you're staying at.

397
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,800
I could only wait for you here.

398
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,560
Oh right, Brother Su,

399
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,000
that son of Marquis Yong'an was banished.

400
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,240
I already sent words that

401
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,840
as long as he passes through
our property of Feiyun Manor

402
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,360
he will be given a lesson.

403
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,280
Brother Su.

404
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,120
I'll get revenge for you.

405
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,400
Thank you all.

406
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,920
No problem.

407
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,760
No need to thank us.

408
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,040
We're friends right.

409
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,880
Rushuang,

410
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,320
where are you going carrying the baggage?

411
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,280
Your home!

412
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,120
My home?

413
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,920
Right!

414
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,000
From today onwards,

415
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,840
I will live together with you.

416
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,280
If there's no space, I'll sleep in the woodshed.

417
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,640
Anyways, with me around,

418
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,280
you won't be bullied again.

419
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,040
No... No thanks, Rushuang.

420
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,360
I can take care of myself.

421
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,880
No.

422
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,640
Rushuang,

423
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,240
I can send people to guard
at Brother Su's place.

424
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,880
You don't really have to go!

425
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,760
How many times did I tell you?

426
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,680
Don't stop me, don't stop me,

427
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,200
why do you still stop me?

428
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,280
if you go to Brother Su's place,

429
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,400
I'm worried.

430
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,600
What's there to worry about?

431
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,880
You're a girl and he's a man!

432
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,640
You keep emphasizing I'm a girl and he's a man,

433
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,400
so what?

434
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,840
I...

435
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,200
Brother Su's martial arts skills are not good,

436
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,200
he can't even protect himself.

437
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
How can he protect you?

438
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,560
Although you use poison,

439
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
when encountering a master

440
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,400
you will also be vulnerable.

441
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,520
So what's your plan?

442
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,800
Young office Su,

443
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,880
please don't condone your friends making noises.

444
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,560
You...

445
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,040
I still have stuff to do,

446
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,080
you all can leave first.

447
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,120
But I...

448
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,760
Rushuang,

449
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,560
enough.

450
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,640
Brother Su, work hard,

451
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,720
we'll leave first.

452
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,440
Let's go, Rushuang.

453
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,520
Then Brother Su, I'll help you pack your stuff.

454
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,480
Let's go, Rushuang!

455
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,000
You!

456
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,920
Be careful!

457
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,360
Rushung!

458
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,280
Don't worry.

459
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,600
Today,

460
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,080
Marquis Yong'an visited me,

461
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,600
saying that his son
suddenly got banished,

462
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,680
and wanted me to find a way to bring him back.

463
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,600
What happened?

464
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,880
I heard that he molested an ordinary woman

465
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,400
and hurt an officer from Mingjing Office.

466
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,080
Coincidentally Prince Qi saw it.

467
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,680
Prince Qi took the advantage

468
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,560
and exposed everything

469
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,120
he had done.

470
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,160
It is said he caused an outrage among the people

471
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,040
and had the King send him out.

472
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,840
This Xiao Junhao indeed has no future.

473
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,120
But,

474
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,440
that he made Prince Qi
enter the palace and make a request

475
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,600
is interesting.

476
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,360
Send people to ask Xiao Junhao

477
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,560
what happened.

478
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,280
Yes.

479
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,960
Long live the Majesty.

480
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,400
Say it.

481
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,320
Say it!

482
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,960
Dumb bird.

483
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,680
Your Highness.

484
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,520
The person following Xiao Junhao has sent words.

485
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,600
He said he's well-behaved

486
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,760
and said nothing.

487
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,160
The guards are also arranged.

488
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,120
Make sure

489
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
he said nothing.

490
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,000
You broke all his teeth,

491
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,120
it's not going to be easy for him to talk.

492
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,240
Is it funny?

493
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,560
Your Highness, you did all these

494
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,320
for Detective Su?

495
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,000
Why are you so talkative?

496
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,960
You're dismissed.

497
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,240
Yes.

498
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,680
Your Highness.

499
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,680
Commander Fu is waiting for you at the pavilion.

500
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,160
Your Highness.

501
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,960
Ziyou,

502
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
what brings you here today?

503
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,440
Your Highness.

504
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,080
I'm getting married.

505
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,000
I came specially to give you an invitation.

506
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,640
I left for only half a month,

507
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,560
you're too fast!

508
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,280
Who is the bride?

509
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,760
A lady from Mansion of Du.

510
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,040
The one who is

511
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,760
a childhood friend of yours?

512
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,920
Ziyou,

513
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,320
you hid it too well.

514
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,200
Zizhuo didn't come?

515
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,760
Recently, Zizhuo,

516
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
he doesn't feel good,

517
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,000
and he doesn't go out.

518
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,080
Why?

519
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,760
Bring along Zizhuo another day

520
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,680
and we'll go relax together

521
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,160
and have a celebration for you.

522
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
By the way, Your Highness,

523
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,800
I need to visit Mr. Qu to collect a drawing.

524
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,040
Please excuse me.

525
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,840
What masterpiece did you

526
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,520
get from Mr. Qu again?

527
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,320
I want to join.

528
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,720
Childe.

529
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,200
Childe, guests came to meet you.

530
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,880
Let them in.

531
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,040
Yes.

532
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,120
I'll be entering the palace

533
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,240
in a few days

534
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,280
to draw portraits for candidates
of the princess consort.

535
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm afraid I couldn't attend
Brother Fu's wedding.

536
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,160
I almost forgot.

537
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,880
Congratulation, Your Highness,

538
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,360
for not having a concubine for so many years,

539
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,600
making every lady in the city

540
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,680
concern about you.

541
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,960
Not only me,

542
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,640
the commander of the imperial guards,

543
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,880
with extraordinary power,

544
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,160
is only waiting for a person all these years.

545
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,320
How many ladies' heart have you broken?

546
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,360
Two childe,

547
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,200
a beauty is to be loved.

548
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,160
She won't be a beauty if she's heartbroken.

549
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,520
Seems like Mr.'s drawing skills have improved.

550
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,720
You're too kind.

551
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,120
Thank you.

552
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,480
We are friends,

553
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
this is what I should do.

554
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,760
Oh right!

555
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,440
How's Mr.'s drawing

556
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
of the beauty?

557
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,120
I've been drawing,

558
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,800
but there are too many chores recently,

559
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,240
so it's not complete yet.

560
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,360
Let us see

561
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,640
what have you done.

562
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,800
Please wait.

563
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,160
Rushuang.

564
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,680
Rushuang, you have been hiding here
for half a day,

565
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,560
what are you doing?

566
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,040
Don't cause trouble here.

567
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,960
Leave, leave!

568
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,920
I'm not leaving,

569
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,880
I have to accompany you.

570
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,840
I don't need your accompaniment.

571
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,880
I have to.

572
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,440
Xie Beiming,

573
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,040
I want the bean curd
from the restaurant at the city's gate.

574
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,320
Can you go buy some for me?

575
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,240
You want to eat now?

576
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,680
No,

577
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,800
bring it back straight to the inn
after you bought it.

578
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,520
Then I'll eat it in my room.

579
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,840
Go.

580
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,480
Rushuang,

581
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,480
are you purposely sending me away?

582
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,480
Are you going or not?

583
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,560
I'll be mad if you don't go!

584
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,199
- When I'm mad I'll...
- I'll go.

585
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,920
But it's not because
I'm scared of you poisoning me.

586
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
I just

587
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,639
don't want you to be mad.

588
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,840
I'll go now.

589
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,159
Less than half a month,

590
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,639
only the eyes await to be finished.

591
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,600
Look at the lips.

592
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,840
The colour of the lips is like a lotus flower,

593
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,640
pure and gorgeous.

594
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,160
What do both of you think?

595
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,120
I like the pair of hands added,

596
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,000
soft,

597
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,520
and slender.

598
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,760
It's so rare.

599
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,960
Seems like

600
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,440
Mr.'s progress recently is smooth.

601
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,400
How stunning it'll be when it's completed.

602
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,840
The eyes are where a beauty's soul is.

603
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,720
How would Mr. draw them?

604
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,000
Do you have an idea?

605
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,720
Brother Fu, you're right.

606
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,760
The eyes are the soul of this beauty portrait.

607
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,560
It's just that I have searched for so many years

608
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,040
but I still dare not easily draw.

609
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,800
I hope that Mr. will find his inspiration soon

610
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,600
and complete this portrait.

611
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,480
Miss.

612
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,040
How do I go to Feiyun Inn?

613
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,120
Feiyun... Feiyun...

614
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,240
That way!

615
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,320
Thank you.

616
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,120
No problem.

617
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,320
Where did he go?

618
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,440
Rushuang,

619
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
why are you stalking me?

620
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,920
I...

621
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
I just want to know where you live.

622
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,480
Rushuang,

623
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,320
I can really take care of myself.

624
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,480
You don't have to move in with me.

625
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,960
Otherwise, let me go to your house

626
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,160
and make you a meal to thank you.

627
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,880
How about it?

628
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,640
After all, if it wasn't for you protecting me,

629
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,760
the son of Marquis Yong'an
wouldn't take revenge on you.

630
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,640
Can I?

631
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,920
I...

632
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,360
I'm moving soon.

633
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,460
Young master, what were you thinking?

634
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,500
Letting Detective Su and Rushuang live
in Mansion of Prince Qi.

635
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,580
Wouldn't you get exposed?

636
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,660
You normally play smart,

637
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,420
why are you unintelligent at critical times?

638
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,820
Find a big residence quick.
The faster the better.

639
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,060
Fei Yuan, what is this about?

640
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,500
Young master,
these are personally selected by Jiang.

641
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,900
There's no problem. They don't know who you are.

642
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,060
Alright, let me introduce

643
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,380
This is Xiao Xue, Xiao Yao, Xiao Jing.

644
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,460
This is Xiao Ting, the one at the back is...

645
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,100
Alright.

646
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,860
But... Young master, please be more serious.

647
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,300
If not, you'll forget their names again.

648
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,300
As long as you remember their names.

649
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,180
Okay. You all go ahead and do your work.

650
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,700
Go ahead.
