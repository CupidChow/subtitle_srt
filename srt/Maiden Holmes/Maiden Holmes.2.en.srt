(Episode 2)

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,840
What are you doing?

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,800
What else can I do?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm opening the lock.

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,840
Why don't you use your own hairpin?

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,960
It's just handy.

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,960
Here, light this up.

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,520
Hold this.

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
Turns out you know how to crack a crib.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,840
There's never too many skills.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,640
We're counting on it to save our lives.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Closer.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,760
Focus on opening the lock.

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,920
Take it back.

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,080
I'll do it myself.

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,600
Why isn't he awake yet?

31
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,320
Let me handle this.

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,720
Who's plotting against me? You are screwed.

33
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Over here.

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,880
Miss.

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,080
Why are you poisoning me?

36
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm not a bad person.

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
I saved you.

38
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,160
You looks like

39
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
a bad person now.

40
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,480
Kid, don't talk nonsense.

41
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm not talking nonsense. You...

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,600
Have a look.

43
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
What did I do?

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,040
It's not like what you think.

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,800
Here's the thing.

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,640
You said you were cold.

47
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,880
I took off my shirt for you.

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,120
Then you said, you were still cold.

49
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,240
So I took this off for you too.

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,480
Alright, alright.

51
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,360
You knocked me out, I poisoned you.

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,560
We're even now.

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
What are you doing?

54
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm helping you up. What else?

55
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,520
Why are you so nervous?

56
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,120
Nonsense!

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Higher.

58
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,680
Detective Su, pull me up.

59
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,720
Detective Su.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
Do you think I'm troublesome

61
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,520
so you ignore me?

62
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,200
We saved lives together,

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,440
fell into water together.

64
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,280
I even saved you
when we fell into the water.

65
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,240
How can you be so ungrateful?

66
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,200
Alright.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
Miss.

68
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,520
Tonight, you shall sleep at...

69
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,000
Why are you staring at me?

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,280
I...

71
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,400
I'll pour the water away.

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,760
I'll pour the water away.

73
00:05:58,761 --> 00:05:59,520
Ok.

74
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,320
Young Master.

75
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,240
Young Master, you're finally back.

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,400
Why is your body with all mud?

77
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
Where's that girl?

78
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
She's in there.

79
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
This is the masked man
who's saved that girl.

80
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,280
Xie Beiming.

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,240
Turns out, it's the young master
of Feiyun Manor.

82
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,560
It's an honour to meet you at last.

83
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,200
Do you know me?

84
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm Pei Zhao.

85
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,360
As an itinerant,

86
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,360
how could I have not heard of

87
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,760
your reputation?

88
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,120
I know, you're...

89
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,960
You're right.

90
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
I also wanna save that girl.

91
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,720
Yes.

92
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,040
We both wanna help that girl.

93
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm Su Ci from Mingjing Office.

94
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,520
Nice to meet you.

95
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
Su Ci?

96
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,720
You're the great young detective,

97
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,840
who can communicate with
supernatural beings with your eyes?

98
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,760
It seems all of you are big shots.

99
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,920
We wouldn't know each other without conflicts.

100
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,560
Yes, indeed.

101
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,760
Miss.

102
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,000
Where's the bride
who was supposed to be sacrificed?

103
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,200
I gave her some money for her to flee.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,960
Turns out you're not the real bride.

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,400
Of course not.

106
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't have scales.
How can I marry Dragon King?

107
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,400
So you were just

108
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
helping out that girl?

109
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,000
I wanted to pretend as the bride

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,360
to punish

111
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,120
those ignorant people
who don't treat life seriously.

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,720
I didn't expect you guys to ruin it.

113
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,720
Well, Miss,

114
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,440
you replaced the bride as sacrifice.

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,080
How did you plan to get out of this?

116
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Using poison.

117
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,280
So they'll have diarrhea for the next two weeks.

118
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,480
As for how to get out of it,

119
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
I didn't figure that out.

120
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,200
You're behaving as you are.

121
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,840
You're quite handsome and easygoing as well.

122
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,280
We're about the same.

123
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,280
Oh right.

124
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm called Dong Rushuang.

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,440
Nice to meet you, everyone.

126
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,960
It's getting late now.

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
Let's just stay here for a night

128
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,600
and make plans tomorrow.

129
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,800
Okay.

130
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,400
Brother Su, let's go.

131
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,880
Okay.

132
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,480
Your Highness.

133
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,680
Did you come here with Detective Su
to investigate an important case?

134
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,320
How did you know me?

135
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
Years ago, when you won a war

136
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,440
and came back with victory,

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,280
I saw you

138
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,400
from far away on the street.

139
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
Prince Qi is a young hero.

140
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
You have always been my idol.

141
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,600
Detective Su still doesn't know my identity.

142
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,640
Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.

143
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,840
But you have to let me assist you.

144
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,120
Assist me?

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,720
I would like to be a hero like you,

146
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,040
who's so chivalrous and righteous.

147
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,560
Okay.

148
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,600
That's great.

149
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,860
(The Legend of Prince Qi, Victory at Kunshan)

150
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Why do you still stay up?

151
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,320
Here.

152
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Here you go.

153
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,100
(Burnt. Harmful substance. Shouldn't be eaten.)

154
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
I'm not hungry.

155
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,920
Are you disgusted by my dirty pigeon?

156
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,760
Not disgusted.

157
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
It's just that my eyesight
is better than others.

158
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,560
Hence you have more trouble.

159
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,240
I would love to have your trouble.

160
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,960
What's going on?

161
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,720
Your eyes

162
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,520
are injured on the battlefield, right?

163
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
How do you know?

164
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,440
There's callus between
your index finger and middle finger.

165
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,360
It's a mark left by years of archery.

166
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,880
Brother Su is really observant.

167
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Impressive.

168
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,320
When we were discussing

169
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,560
about how to save Rushuang,

170
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,360
your plan was meticulous,

171
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,840
And you're able to command steadily.

172
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,680
It's obvious that you were an experienced soldier.

173
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,160
The army of Fan Yan Na is good
at using poisonous arrows.

174
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,000
They have injured and killed many soldiers.

175
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,680
I bet your eyes

176
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
were also injured then.

177
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,840
General, watch out! The arrow is poisonous.

178
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,600
Are you

179
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
the subordinate of Prince Qi?

180
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,840
That's right.

181
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,520
I was the captain of Prince Qi's western troop.

182
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,480
Really?

183
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,520
Then...

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Look at you.

185
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,000
You're supposed to be a potential general.

186
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,240
Why did you become

187
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,320
a misbehaving unruly vagabond?

188
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,360
Your Majesty.

189
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,000
Although Prince Qi has credit
in fighting the enemy,

190
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,960
the war with Fan Yan Na has been over.

191
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,560
Prince Qi should give up his military power.

192
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,880
Or else,

193
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,680
people may think he's keeping
the power for his own use

194
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,360
to control the imperial court

195
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,360
and affect the national foundation.

196
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,040
Your Majesty.

197
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
Prince Qi fought in wars

198
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,800
and gain many credits.

199
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,360
If he faces restrain as soon as he's back,

200
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm afraid that our soldiers

201
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,480
will be bitterly disappointed.

202
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,760
Aren't you afraid that the people may say that

203
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,080
His Majesty kicks out hero
after making use of him?

204
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,280
Besides,

205
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,240
the war was just over.

206
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,880
If Prince Qi returns the military power now,

207
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,000
the enemy may try to attack again.

208
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,320
Please think this through, Your Majesty.

209
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,240
Please think this through, Your Majesty.

210
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,360
Please think this through, Your Majesty.

211
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,160
Please think this through, Your Majesty.

212
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,600
Your Majesty.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,520
This issue affects the national foundation.

214
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,880
We can't take a step back.

215
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,520
Please take back the Tiger Tally, Your Majesty.

216
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,680
Brother.

217
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,120
You don't have to do this.

218
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
I have decided.

219
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,020
(The Legend of Prince Qi, Victory at Kunshan)

220
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,880
You like Prince Qi?

221
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,720
Yes.

222
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,400
Folklore

223
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,960
isn't necessarily true.

224
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,880
How would you know if it's not true?

225
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,000
Fellow mates.

226
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm going to investigate now.

227
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
Farewell.

228
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,400
Let's go together.

229
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,440
It's not necessary.

230
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,320
Brother Su.

231
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,160
It's necessary.

232
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,280
We don't need many people for investigation.

233
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,040
Anyway, the reason I became an itinerant

234
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,560
is to be chivalrous and righteous,

235
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,560
and punish the evil.

236
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,640
I have to

237
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,160
be involved in this.

238
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,400
That's right.

239
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,720
Investigation is so interesting.

240
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,120
I have to be part of it.

241
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
The Robbery by Dragon King isn't so simple.

242
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,640
Perhaps we can be of help.

243
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,200
Besides, we have been through troubles together.

244
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,800
You wouldn't be so ungrateful, right?

245
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,720
Young Master.

246
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,160
Why are we following Detective Su?

247
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
I came to investigate.

248
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,000
Not to follow Detective Su.

249
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,840
However,

250
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,560
we can also investigate on our own.

251
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
Why must we follow Detective Su?

252
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,600
First, he's the young officer
of Mingjing Office.

253
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,080
It's more convenient for him to investigate.

254
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,760
Well, second...

255
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,520
What's the second point?

256
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,360
Second, although he's just a young officer,

257
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
he's very righteous

258
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,960
and brilliant.

259
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,600
If anything happens to him,

260
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,320
it'll be a lost to Liang dynasty.

261
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,760
Therefore...

262
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,880
Therefore we have to protect him.

263
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Okay.

264
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,000
Why isn't he here yet?

265
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,240
Could anything have happened to Brother Xie?

266
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
Since Brother Xie volunteered
to get into the water,

267
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,920
he must be very confident.

268
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
Here he is.

269
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
It's Brother Xie.

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,760
Take this.

271
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,000
It seems this young master

272
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,280
is really good at holding his breath.

273
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
But he's lacking

274
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,400
the ability to judge.

275
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,600
You can't swim.

276
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,240
Beware that you might fall into water again.

277
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,880
Here, Brother Xie.

278
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,920
Okay.

279
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,040
Brother Xie.

280
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,000
You're great.

281
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,440
You could stay under water for so long.

282
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,440
This is the skill of holding breath.

283
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,680
My adoptive father taught me that.

284
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,400
Thank you, Brother Xie.

285
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Here.

286
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,400
Dry yourself.

287
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,320
I didn't expect you to be so great,

288
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,240
Warrior Xie.

289
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,120
Brother Su.

290
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm truly sorry.

291
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,440
It's really muddy underneath.

292
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,480
I couldn't see anything.

293
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,240
That's all I could get.

294
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,200
See if they're useful.

295
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,240
This isn't a normal board.

296
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,920
It's a board of a boat.

297
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,640
It smells like turpentine and wax.

298
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
It's for decay prevention.

299
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
They're only applied on boards for boats.

300
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
It's the waterproof partition.

301
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,880
Between the hull and the deck,

302
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,560
there's a waterproof partition.

303
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,280
If the hull bottom is broken,

304
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,280
waterproof partition can prevent water
from entering the hull.

305
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,119
You even know such thing.

306
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,400
I have seen it in war.

307
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,040
There was a heavy thunderstorm

308
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,119
on the night

309
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,480
the fund was transported here.

310
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,560
A flash of lightning

311
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,160
struck the ship.

312
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,600
According to what the witnesses said,

313
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,680
that ship transporting silvers

314
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,520
was stroke by lightning.

315
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,320
Lightning always hits the highest spot.

316
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,160
If it hits a ship,

317
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,680
it should hit the mast.

318
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,520
This waterproof board

319
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,280
is at the hull bottom.

320
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,720
Furthermore, there's trace of burning here.

321
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,640
This isn't caused by lightning.

322
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,240
It's obvious that the ship
was leaking from bottom.

323
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,160
There is...

324
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,360
What?

325
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,840
Scent of gunpowder.

326
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,440
It seems the Robbery by Dragon King is man-made.

327
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,220
(Fei Yun Inn)

328
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,720
Brother Su, you're really great.

329
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,200
You found so many clues

330
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,560
from just a piece of board.

331
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
I should thank Brother Pei's
sharp sense of smell,

332
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,840
which could detect
the leftover scent of gunpowder.

333
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,280
What about me?

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,240
Without me,

335
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,160
could you find this board?

336
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,560
Yes. Thank you for your help, Brother Xie.

337
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Meal's ready!

338
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
I'm so hungry.

339
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,800
Give it to me.

340
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,360
Enjoy, young master.

341
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,320
Enjoy, everyone.

342
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,800
Isn't this too bland?

343
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,840
Sir.

344
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
Brother Xie.

345
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,040
Qingshui County is starting to face a famine.

346
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,440
At least we have food to eat.

347
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,400
Brother Xie.

348
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,240
That's right.

349
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,800
The disaster relief fund was lost.

350
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,560
The folks sacrifice living person as offering.

351
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,280
Evil traders seize the chance
to increase food prices.

352
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,760
It seems it's time for us to meet

353
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,360
the magistrate of Qingshui County.

354
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,280
Brother Xie, Miss Rushuang,

355
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,560
please help collect some food

356
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,840
to save the folks.

357
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,840
Leave it to me.

358
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,840
Detective Su, it's been a hard journey

359
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,880
for you to come all the way here.

360
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm not in my best shape as a host.

361
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,440
Please forgive me.

362
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,560
Don't be extra polite, Officer Kong.

363
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,320
Detective Su.

364
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,920
I'll have someone prepare the best food.

365
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,920
Officer Kong.

366
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,440
Leave out the unnecessary formalities.

367
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
I was ordered to investigate
the case of missing disaster relief fund.

368
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,360
There's progress.

369
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,280
The shipwreck wasn't an accident.

370
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,440
The trace on this board

371
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,680
is the evidence.

372
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,720
Detective Su.

373
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,560
Are you kidding?

374
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,240
Using this board of boat as evidence

375
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,280
will be the joke of the state government.

376
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,800
Can you show me

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
the boxes found?

378
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,760
If you insist on seeing them,

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,320
I will of course not stop you.

380
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,320
Detective Su.

381
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,320
When these boxes were fished out,

382
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I opened them in front of the folks.

383
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,400
There are all rocks

384
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,600
in there.

385
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,600
Tell me.

386
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,680
Besides Dragon King,

387
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,680
who else can get the pieces of silver

388
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,480
without unlocking the boxes?

389
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,080
Only human would deceive others
in supernatural way

390
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,680
and have the gods and ghosts to take the blame.

391
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,240
Detective Su,

392
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,960
what do you mean?

393
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
The boxes were substituted.

394
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,160
These boxes were fished out

395
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,680
on site by the dredging team.

396
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,360
And this lock which has the word "Ji" on it,

397
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,840
was ordered by His Majesty

398
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,520
to be made specially as a blessing

399
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,680
to those counties that faced disasters.

400
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,080
The person who substituted the boxes

401
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,360
only know that there's "Ji" on the lock,

402
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,520
but he doesn't know that,

403
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,760
in order to please His Majesty,

404
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,520
(Ji)
the Ministry of Revenue didn't use

405
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
the traditional calligraphy to make it.

406
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,240
Instead, the handwritten "Ji" by His Majesty.

407
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,000
If I remember correctly,

408
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,800
the "Ji" that His Majesty writes

409
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
has a longer upper stroke

410
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,760
and shorter lower stroke.

411
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,920
That's right.

412
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,800
Hence someone used the name of supernatural

413
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,240
to substitute the disaster relief fund.

414
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Detective Su.

415
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,960
This can't possibly be done

416
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,280
in front of the public.

417
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,960
After eliminating all the impossibilities,

418
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,760
what's left is the truth.

419
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,040
Magistrate Kong claims
Robbery by Dragon King is true.

420
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,280
Could you be feeling guilty?

421
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,800
Don't you think you can be rude

422
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,840
just because you're Detective Su's friend.

423
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
As the local magistrate,

424
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,720
not only that you didn't help
settle the victims well,

425
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,120
you don't even care about the case.

426
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,760
Even when a living person
was sacrificed as offering,

427
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,920
you were nowhere to be seen.

428
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,120
If all officers are like you,

429
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,960
everyone can just be rude to the superiors.

430
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,240
Detective Su.

431
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,320
I respect you because
you're from Mingjing Office.

432
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,880
I have been cooperative.

433
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
As for if I've neglected my job,

434
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,520
that's the judgment of the Monitoring Office.

435
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,960
You have no right to judge me here.

436
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,280
As an officer,

437
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,200
if you only understand slander,

438
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,960
you should really have the monitoring officers

439
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,680
come by.

440
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,640
Officer Kong.

441
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,480
Detective Su.

442
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,320
The disaster relief fund is indeed missing.

443
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,560
If you have the capability,

444
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,560
then ask it back from Dragon King.

445
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,640
I still have duty.

446
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,920
See you.

447
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,680
Take my token

448
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,080
and contact all the shops
under the name of Feiyun Manor.

449
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,560
Have them collect food for me.

450
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,240
The shops under Feiyun Manor's name
are everywhere.

451
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,800
We need a few months to contact them.

452
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,440
Then have the food transported here.

453
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,040
That will require half a year.

454
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,560
I'm afraid...

455
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,440
That's the case.

456
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,320
The aid is too far away to be of use.

457
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,600
We don't need great tools
to get small jobs done.

458
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,600
It's just food collection.

459
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,760
Let me handle it.

460
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,840
There are so many victims in this county.

461
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,280
This should be
the richest family of Qingshui County.

462
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,080
(Hu Mansion)

463
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Open the door.

464
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,920
Here I come.

465
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,720
Open the door.

466
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,720
Open the door.

467
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,200
What's going on?

468
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,720
Is your master home?

469
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,760
Who are you?

470
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,040
I'm a female warrior.

471
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
I want to talk to your master about
robbing the rich and helping the poor.

472
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
My master isn't around.

473
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,920
You're insane.

474
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,920
No.

475
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,240
I...

476
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,360
Why did you stop me just now?

477
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,280
If you keep fighting with Magistrate Kong,

478
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,040
we won't be able to leave the county court.

479
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,200
But...

480
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Didn't you notice what he said?

481
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,720
He said,

482
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,160
the disaster relief fund is gone anyway.

483
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,040
What you mean is,

484
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,560
Magistrate Kong has long substituted

485
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,440
the disaster relief fund?

486
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,440
Therefore,

487
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,040
our urgent mission is to find out

488
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,760
how the disaster relief fund was substituted.

489
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
And where are the pieces of silver?

490
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
They were still on the boat when it sank.

491
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,200
They all turned into rocks
when they were pulled out.

492
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,640
When the villagers went
into the water afterwards,

493
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,840
there was no pieces of silver.

494
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,080
During the process of dredging,

495
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,520
the villagers were watching.

496
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,800
It couldn't be faked.

497
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,400
Dredging boat.

498
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
That's the only way to get close
to the pieces of silver.

499
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,600
This is the dredging boat.

500
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,200
Since it came back that day,

501
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,760
it hasn't been used.

502
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,600
What about those
who were in charge of fishing out?

503
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,840
They were from the county government.

504
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,720
They aren't here.

505
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,080
This boat

506
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,640
looks just like a normal dredging boat.

507
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,080
There's nothing special.

508
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,400
But when something is done,

509
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,400
there will surely be trace of it.

510
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,160
Stop.

511
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,200
What are you doing?

512
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,280
Listen up.

513
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,160
Robbery.

514
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
Hold on a second.

515
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,240
We're not here to rob.

516
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,400
We came to see your master

517
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,120
to borrow food for the victims.

518
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,640
Why would our master

519
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,560
give his food to the poor fellows?

520
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,160
Where did your master's food come from?

521
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,040
Didn't he get them from the folks?

522
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,400
Now that the folks are starving,

523
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,720
they have no strength to plant.

524
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,880
The one who is at lost eventually

525
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,280
is your master.

526
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,600
It's still a no.

527
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
I shall buy it then, okay?

528
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,000
No.

529
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,840
You!

530
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,880
Let me tell you.

531
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,440
If you don't leave,

532
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,000
I will not be polite to you.

533
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,360
Listen to me.

534
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,200
Come on.

535
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,040
Don't be polite at all.

536
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,040
Let me tell you.

537
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,600
We came to rob.

538
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
Give me all your food.

539
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,520
Beat them up.

540
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,880
How dare you!

541
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,400
You!

542
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:39,920
Hit them.

543
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,960
Come on.

544
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,120
Warrior Xie.

545
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,920
My medication is very expensive.

546
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,520
Can you not use all of them for yourself?

547
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,160
Sorry, Rushuang.

548
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,560
When will I faint this time?

549
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,000
You won't faint.

550
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,920
Really? Then I shall rest my mind.

551
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,080
What are you looking at?

552
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,960
If you don't give up your food,

553
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,640
you will be

554
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,520
in a worse shape than them.

555
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,240
Don't run.

556
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,440
Where's the food?

557
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,720
Have mercy, Miss.

558
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,760
I'll take you to get it.

559
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,480
Rushuang.

560
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,200
Why do I feel like my lips are numb?

561
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,240
Let's get the food first.

562
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,480
Food?

563
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,800
Yes, let's get the food.

564
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,400
What are you looking at?

565
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,400
Rushuang.

566
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,440
50,000 tael.

567
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,360
3,000 jin.

568
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,080
Sir.

569
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,320
If this boat is carrying 3,000 jin of load,

570
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
where would the waterline be?

571
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,320
It should be at

572
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,720
the strong imprinted waterline.

573
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,040
Brother Bei, look.

574
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,120
There are two stains of waterlines here.

575
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,480
Coincidentally, there are green algae
floating recently.

576
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,760
Therefore they left

577
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,560
a light stain on the hull.

578
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,280
On the way back to the shore,

579
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,440
the burden of the boat

580
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,160
is double the weight
of the disaster relief fund.

581
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,440
The rocks were first unloaded.

582
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,320
3,000 jin of disaster relief fund
was left on the boat

583
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,760
until two days ago.

584
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,560
Hence there's this second waterline.

585
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,400
However,

586
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
how were the pieces of silver loaded
onto the ship?

587
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,360
How was it undiscovered?

588
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,080
They weren't loaded onto the ship.

589
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,520
They weren't?

590
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,120
But...

591
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,040
The disaster relief fund

592
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
was dragged back using a fish net.

593
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,560
The food is enough to save many people.

594
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,960
Thank you.

595
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,040
I don't dare to take the honour.

596
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,960
Why not?

597
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,160
We're borrowing the food as we promised.

598
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,080
Give this letter of indebtedness to your master.

599
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,000
Tell him to ask for the food back
from Feiyun Manor.

600
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,520
Okay.

601
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,040
Oh right.

602
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,760
The interest of borrowing the food.

603
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,240
It's all yours.

604
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,880
Let's go.

605
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,240
Let's go, Warrior Xie.

606
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,720
Please, Warrior Rushuang.

607
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,760
Why did you give him so much money?

608
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,120
Isn't that too much?

609
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,760
Was it?

610
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,200
But I don't know the price of food.

611
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,080
Forget about it.

612
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,880
Take it as medical charge.

613
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,480
We hit so many of them.

614
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,240
Forthright, righteous.

615
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,480
Intelligent, brave.

616
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,560
Pleasant to work with you.

617
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,680
Pleasant to work with you.

618
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,000
From now on, we'll work together

619
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,920
to rob the rich and save the poor.

620
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,840
Deal.

621
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
Deal.

622
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,600
Let's go.

623
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,800
I'll confront Magistrate Kong now

624
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,000
and have him plead guilty, executed

625
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,200
and return the disaster relief fund.

626
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,240
What we said is just an assumption.

627
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,320
We have to find the evidence

628
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,320
to hit in one strike.

629
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,680
Lest Magistrate Kong will
take desperate measure.

630
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,720
Then we can only react.

631
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,920
Could we just let him embezzle?

632
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,680
Let's go.

633
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Pull me.

634
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,600
It seems the direction
of my investigation is right.

635
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,920
Are you alright?

636
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,480
I'm fine.

637
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,360
Are your eyes fine?

638
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,440
I'm fine.

639
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,080
I'll just apply some medication later.

640
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,960
Alright.

641
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,240
Let's go.

642
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
How are you?

643
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,640
I may have sprained myself just now.

644
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,000
You're injured. Don't force yourself.

645
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,440
I'm fine.

646
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,240
Let me carry you.

647
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,760
No need.

648
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,360
I can walk myself.

649
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,200
I can't see.

650
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,960
You have to tell me the directions.

651
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,560
Come on.

652
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,280
What are you waiting for?

653
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,840
Two of us, one is blind

654
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,920
and one is lame.

655
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,560
We can help each other out.

656
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:01,302

Stop.

662
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,320
There's a puddle.

663
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,600
Take a big step.

664
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
Keep going forward.

665
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,880
Keep going?

666
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,840
Yes.

667
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,880
The code of Liang dynasty

668
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,120
is separated into 6 chapters.

669
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,960
They are robbery, theft, imprisoning...

670
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,360
Are...

671
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Are you okay?

672
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,160
I'm fine.

673
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,000
What are you thinking about
instead of focusing on the road?

674
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,600
Sorry.

675
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,600
Take one step right.

676
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,280
Right?

677
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,154
Yes.

678
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,639
Okay.

679
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,320
Keep going forward.

680
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,480
Take one small step left.

681
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,800
Yes.

682
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,040
Keep going.

683
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,080
Why isn't Young Master back yet?

684
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,400
Beware of staircase.

685
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,239
A threshold.

686
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,199
Alright.

687
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,199
Young Master.

688
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,120
Put me down.

689
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,360
Young Master.

690
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,920
Fei Yan.

691
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Why are you back only now?

692
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,199
Have the servant prepare us water for bath.

693
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,120
Okay.

694
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,480
The two of you...

695
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,199
Of course not.

696
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,120
Of course we're bathing separately.

697
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,680
Okay.

698
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,080
Fei Yan, hold on.

699
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,000
Brother Pei's eye disease is recurring.

700
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,680
Just take care of him.

701
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,760
What?

702
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,640
Don't mind me.

703
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,200
Help Detective Su back to his room first.

704
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,160
No need, I'm fine.

705
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,240
Go back for medication.

706
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,840
I'm fine. He shall help you back first.

707
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,680
I'm really fine.

708
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,160
I can take care of myself.

709
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,520
Let me tell you, go back to your room first.

710
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,000
Your eye disease is more important.
You should go first.

711
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,760
Alright now.

712
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,600
I'm the suffering one after all.

713
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,960
Let's go together.

714
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,120
Young Master.

715
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,760
Young Master.

716
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,600
Your eyes are well again?

717
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,680
I found the medicine for Detective Su.

718
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,720
I shall send it to him now.

719
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,960
Fei Yan.

720
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,600
This...

721
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,280
He doesn't want me to bring anything.

722
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,640
But he asks it from me when he needs something.

723
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
Does he think I'm celestial with magic?

724
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,820
It's him!

725
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,700
He wanted to sacrifice me to the Dragon King.

726
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,460
You monster.

727
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,500
Calm down.

728
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,500
Investigation is more important.

729
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,100
I'll spare your unworthy life for now.

730
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,900
If you're still going to do human sacrifices,

731
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,980
I will not forgive you.

732
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,519
Thank you, sir!

733
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,280
I won't. I won't do it again.

734
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,780
When the ship carring the official silver
arrived at Qingshui County,

735
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,100
did you see it with your own eyes?

736
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,300
Yes, I saw it, I saw it.

737
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,020
What happened actually on the day the ship sank?

738
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,820
Tell the truth.

739
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,900
There are actually signs

740
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,180
of the robbery by the Dragon King.

741
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,340
The night before the ship sank,

742
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,340
I observed the sky,

743
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,300
It's terrible!

744
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,300
Terrible? What's terrible?

745
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,460
That night, a comet was seen
nearby the Big Dipper.

746
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,460
It was a bad sign.

747
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,060
Trying to avoid something bad to happen,

748
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,900
I was manifesting a divination all night,

749
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,540
and the divination showed that

750
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,620
there will be a disaster

751
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,980
in the next 30 years.

752
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,580
As expected,

753
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,300
Next morning,

754
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,780
the ship that carried the official silver
was just entering into the Qingshui County,

755
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,900
suddenly wind blew strong, sky turned cloudy,

756
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,100
and it seemed
as if it's night time during the day.

757
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,420
Although this person's statement
is over-exaggerating,

758
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:23,620
it was basically similar to
how the crowd described the scene.

759
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,220
This is a punishment from Dragon King
to the disaster caused.

760
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,220
Nonsense.

761
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,340
It was just all a groundless statement.

762
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,900
You don't believe what I said, right?

763
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,100
If you don't,

764
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,380
ask the boatman that was saved during that time,

765
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,820
He was on the boat.

766
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,700
Where is the boatman?

767
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,460
He's recovering at home.
