(Mansion of Prince Qi)

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Dancers and drummers
must be well-practiced.

17
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,920
No mistake is allowed

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,600
during the birthday banquet.

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,640
Yes.

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,720
I've asked them to practice more.

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,240
In two days,

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,920
I will check on them in person.

23
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,880
Yes.

24
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,080
Your Highness!

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,680
Fei Yuan, what's wrong?

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,680
Your Highness!

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,160
Brother Jiang, he's...

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,080
He's dead!

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,240
What?

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,360
Mingjing officers

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,760
have brought his body back.

32
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,680
Brother Jiang!

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,680
How could you leave us?

34
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,080
You caused his death!
You should pay with your life!

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,680
Fei Yuan! Show some manners!

36
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,960
Officer Liu.

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,880
Why

38
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,240
did he die at Mingjing Office?

39
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,520
Your Highness.

40
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,720
Here it's the thing.

41
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,960
We found an unknown corpse
in the suburb a few days ago.

42
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,680
He died from a sword piercing
through his chest.

43
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,400
On the body...

44
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm asking

45
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,160
why did he die at Mingjing Office.

46
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
Officer Jiang cut his wrist
with a broken porcelain piece.

47
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
It's too late when he was discovered.

48
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
I suspect that

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,600
he committed suicide
for fear of punishment.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
He's not the murder.

51
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,600
You're talking nonsense.

52
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,920
Your Highness.

53
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,520
There's enough evidence that
Officer Jiang killed Tian Yong.

54
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,240
Here's the case file.

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
Your Highness,
please check it yourself.

56
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,480
Your Highness.

57
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
We will investigate

58
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,920
Jiang Xiwen's suicide.

59
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,120
But it has nothing to
do with Mingjing Office.

60
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,440
He died there yet

61
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,200
it's unrelated to Mingjing Office?

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,480
Officer Liu.

63
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,400
You've indeed got some talents

64
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
in Mingjing Office
for the past two years.

65
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,840
Your Highness, we're sorry.

66
00:05:58,204 --> 00:05:59,404
(Case File)

67
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,800
The motive is Tian Yong
harassed Song Yao previously.

68
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,320
Jiang Xiwen killed him accidentally

69
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,520
on impulse?

70
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,800
Yes.

71
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,960
Where is the murder weapon?

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,280
We haven't found it yet.

73
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,960
What is the key evidence for

74
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,880
accusing Xiwen then?

75
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,640
The jade pendant on Jiang Xiwen.

76
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,040
Have you investigated why the jade pendant

77
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,240
was on Tian Yong's body?

78
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,400
Not yet.

79
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,520
The case has not been solved
and evidence is missing.

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
How is that enough evidence?

81
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,040
If you can't even convict him,

82
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,800
how could you say he committed suicide
for fear of punishment?

83
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
If my subordinate

84
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,400
was to die,

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,240
he'd only die on the battlefield
for the country.

86
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
Not in

87
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,920
the prison of Mingjing Office
without any reason!

88
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,920
I will get to the bottom of this case.

89
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,920
If I find any misfeasance,

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,240
he'd be doomed.

91
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,560
It's you who discovered Xiwen's suicide?

92
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Brother Jiang might not die

93
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,440
if I could discover it earlier.

94
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,080
It's not your fault.

95
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,040
Don't blame yourself.

96
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,520
Xiwen was my brother in arms.

97
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
After the Battle of Honggu,

98
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,800
I thought I could let him live peacefully.

99
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,720
I never thought

100
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
that's how he ended up.

101
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,680
He's your brother.

102
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,280
I swear

103
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,400
I will find out the truth.

104
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,800
Trust me.

105
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,560
Thank you.

106
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,960
Maybe Brother Jiang

107
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,480
confessed because he was trying

108
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,720
to protect someone.

109
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,640
Your Highness.

110
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,760
Come in.

111
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,400
Your Highness.

112
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,480
Mrs. Jiang is here.

113
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,680
Your Highness.

114
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,280
Please bring justice to Xiwen.

115
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,240
Please stand up.

116
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm so sorry.

117
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,640
Your Highness.

118
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,640
He didn't kill anyone.

119
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,920
He ended up like this because of me.

120
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,240
It's all my fault.

121
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,560
What happened?

122
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,680
Tell me.

123
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,920
I miss you, my beauty.

124
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,880
Let go of me!

125
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,840
Let go!

126
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,240
Xiwen!

127
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,280
Xiwen, stop beating him!

128
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,200
Xiwen, stop it!

129
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,080
Xiwen!

130
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
Xiwen, stop it!

131
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,520
You will beat him to death!

132
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm beating him to death

133
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,720
for good.

134
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,240
Stop!

135
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,960
Stop it!

136
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,120
Why are you stopping me?

137
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,880
Why are you sparing him?

138
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,360
I don't want you to

139
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,640
ruin your career for me.

140
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,200
He hurt you.

141
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,520
It's fine.

142
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,400
It's my fault.

143
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,360
You suffered because of me.

144
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,560
I will tell His Highness about us.

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,720
He'd justify us.

146
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,840
No.

147
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,240
He will not help us.

148
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,920
He doesn't care about other's opinions.

149
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,800
He will definitely understand.

150
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Xiao Yao.

151
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
I don't want to keep this a secret.

152
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,840
I want to marry you.

153
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,160
I want to be with you forever.

154
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,640
He must have confessed

155
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,920
to protect my reputation.

156
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,400
It's my fault.

157
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,960
It's my fault!

158
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,520
Xiwen!

159
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,280
Liu Yu.

160
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,240
Take Mrs. Jiang to rest.

161
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,520
Yes.

162
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,200
Mrs. Jiang.

163
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,880
Xiwen.

164
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
Why didn't you tell me?

165
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,440
What's this?

166
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,922
(Lieutenant Jiang Xiwen)

167
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,440
Your Highness, the spy we
caught had committed suicide.

168
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,160
He was loyal indeed.

169
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,240
It's no use just being loyal.

170
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,400
It's better to die for something worthwhile.

171
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,480
What is considered a worthy death then?

172
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,680
For me,

173
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,720
I'd send messages to you
at the end of my life.

174
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,240
What would you do?

175
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,200
I'd hold the medallion in my hand.

176
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,160
So,

177
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,160
you'd know that
someone was trying to harm you

178
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,480
and you could be alerted.

179
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,720
You're the only one

180
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,520
who could come up with this stupid method.

181
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,720
(Lieutenant Jiang Xiwen)

182
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,520
Xiwen.

183
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,200
I will not let you die in vain.

184
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,000
As for now,

185
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,120
we can bring him justice

186
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,040
only by finding out the truth.

187
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,880
There is a mixture of
pink and gold-colored powder

188
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:17,055
on the face and in the nails of the victim.

189
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,720
It should be rouge.

190
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,080
The rouge made by Sister Song
contains minimal gold powder.

191
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,120
This is unique in the capital.

192
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,840
I think Officer Luo found Brother Jiang

193
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,400
with this clue.

194
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,120
Tian Yong was killed with a single strike.

195
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,160
The wound shouldn't be as clean as this

196
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,480
if it was done by an ordinary person.

197
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,640
You are right.

198
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,320
The murderer should be good at martial arts.

199
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,640
Look here.

200
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,800
Rushuang.

201
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,599
What kind of powder is this?

202
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,720
Isn't he a craftsman?

203
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,760
Maybe he got something on him

204
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,880
like lime

205
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
when he was working?

206
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,520
No.

207
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,080
If it's lime,

208
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,240
it would corrode his clothes.

209
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,920
But his clothes was not damaged.

210
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,800
What is it then?

211
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,760
We cannot find it out
by just looking at it.

212
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:54,235
(Case File)

213
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,080
It's not mentioned in the file.

214
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
That's something

215
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,960
that wasn't discovered previously.

216
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,120
Let's go to

217
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,800
the crime scene tomorrow morning.

218
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,520
There might be clues that were missed.

219
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,520
Rushuang, I need you
and Brother Xie to help me.

220
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,600
Here is the place.

221
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,120
How is it?

222
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,880
It's as the case file mentioned.

223
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,480
It's not the primary crime scene indeed.

224
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,800
They said Tian Yong had a family.

225
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,280
Let's go and ask them.

226
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,200
Alright.

227
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,920
Officer.

228
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,120
Madam, no need to bow.

229
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
We come here today

230
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,040
to ask you something.

231
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,200
Alright.

232
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,000
Where did your husband plan to go

233
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,040
on the day he was murdered?

234
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
I...

235
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
I don't know.

236
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,640
He didn't tell me when he went out.

237
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,680
Did he have any enemies before he died?

238
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
He stole things

239
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,080
when he was working previously

240
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,200
so he got beaten up a few times.

241
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,480
I advised him not to
but he just ignored me.

242
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,120
Did he steal anything recently?

243
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,360
He repaired a warehouse previously.

244
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,200
He thought
there were valuable items inside.

245
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,640
He had been talking about that place

246
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,560
for a few times since we got poor recently.

247
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,080
Where is the warehouse?

248
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,920
It should be...

249
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
It should be below the mountains
in the eastern suburb.

250
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,760
Rushuang.

251
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,600
They're coming back.

252
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,200
Brother Xie.

253
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Sister Su. Brother Pei.

254
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,440
Have some water.

255
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,920
Here.

256
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,680
Sister Su.

257
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,720
We've asked

258
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,680
the prison guard at Mingjing Office.

259
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,400
Brother Jiang didn't meet anyone

260
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,040
outside of Mingjing Office
since he was arrested.

261
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,320
We also found that

262
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
Tian Yong wanted to

263
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,920
steal something from a
warehouse before his death.

264
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,600
Do you think he was killed
when he tried to steal

265
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,040
from the warehouse?

266
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,720
I'll check the warehouse tomorrow morning.

267
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,200
I'll go with you.

268
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,000
We'll go as well.

269
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,520
Look. That should be the warehouse.

270
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,880
It looks empty.

271
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,080
Let's take a look inside.

272
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,120
Alright. Let's go.

273
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
This is flour.

274
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
What kind of powder is this?

275
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,120
I got it.

276
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,320
The powder on Tian Yong is flour.

277
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,160
He did come here

278
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,800
on the night before he was killed.

279
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,840
The owner hired him to repair
this warehouse for a hefty sum

280
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,720
but there's only a jar of flour here.

281
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,680
Isn't that too much?

282
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,840
Yeah.

283
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,000
Something must be hidden there.

284
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Look.

285
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,880
Two storage jars might
have been placed here.

286
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,760
They might not be that big in size.

287
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,920
The mark left by the base is still visible.

288
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,800
It should be moved not long ago.

289
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,720
Look at this.

290
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
Why are there so many dead bugs?

291
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,560
Xie Beiming.

292
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,040
Get me two pieces of leaves.

293
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,960
I want to collect them.

294
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,920
Alright.

295
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,960
I think these bugs

296
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,640
came in contact with something

297
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,560
which caused all of them to die.

298
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,160
I'll know what the jar contains

299
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
after doing some researches on the bugs.

300
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,400
Great.

301
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:47,847
Rushuang. Here you go.

302
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,960
Rushuang.

303
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,480
It's dangerous. Let me do it.

304
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,720
Hold my blade for me.

305
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,240
Something uncommon

306
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,760
must have been stored here.

307
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,080
Why is that?

308
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,480
This warehouse was modified specially.

309
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,840
There are two layers of lime on the wall.

310
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,400
There's also a layer of dry sand in between.

311
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,200
Also,

312
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,960
there's a layer of lime under the floor too.

313
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,760
A normal warehouse

314
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,720
doesn't have to be this damp-proof.

315
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,000
The door...

316
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,440
seems sturdier than a normal door too.

317
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,160
It's no wonder that Tian Yong

318
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,640
felt there's something valuable here.

319
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,760
I'll check this warehouse's owner.

320
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,120
I believe we'll have a new clue soon.

321
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,560
Brother Pei.

322
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,000
Brother Pei.

323
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,600
It's just you alone?

324
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,400
Where's Rushuang?

325
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,440
She's researching the poison in her room.

326
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,680
Poison?

327
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,560
She wants me to tell you

328
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,160
there's a strong poison in the bugs.

329
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,120
She doesn't know
what kind of poison it is yet

330
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,080
but she is sure that

331
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,080
this poison is very strong.

332
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,440
With only a little, one can be dead.

333
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,720
So

334
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,120
after Tian Yong was chased out by Xiwen,

335
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,040
he went to the warehouse to steal something

336
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,520
and saw something he shouldn't have seen.

337
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,360
That is why he was killed.

338
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm sure that's what happened.

339
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
These are just our deductions.

340
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,320
We don't have any evidence.

341
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,440
We also don't know

342
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,160
what kind of poison is this

343
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,720
at the moment.

344
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,880
Sister Su!

345
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,840
A copy of the deed to the granary
was sent from Mingjing Office.

346
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,880
Here it is.

347
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,440
This warehouse

348
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
belongs to Sha Du.

349
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,120
Sha Du?

350
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,640
He had been

351
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,520
doing illegal businesses in our country,

352
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,960
He was slippery indeed.

353
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,040
A huge amount of strong poison

354
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,640
and a black market dealer.

355
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,440
I'm afraid there's a conspiracy

356
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,000
behind everything.

357
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,040
Brother Xie.

358
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm very worried

359
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,480
about the whereabouts of the poison.

360
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,200
Don't worry.

361
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,560
I've informed everyone in Feiyun Manor.

362
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,080
They will let me know immediately

363
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,800
once they find anything.

364
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,960
It's not that simple.

365
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,160
Sha Du was killed

366
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,240
because of the disaster relief fund.

367
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,240
Unfortunately,

368
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
we didn't find the culprit behind.

369
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,600
As this warehouse belongs to Sha Du,

370
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,720
this batch of poison

371
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,920
is most probably...

372
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,920
These purple particles

373
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,160
look like the juice of some plants.

374
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,360
Plants?

375
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,200
Do you know which plant is it?

376
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,560
This is a rare method to make poison.

377
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,200
It uses animal gallstones as well.

378
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,000
If I'm not mistaken,

379
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,840
it should be a method
used by the Western Regions.

380
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,480
Western Regions?

381
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,640
Yes. I'm sure.

382
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,160
We need to confirm the contents

383
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,520
of the poison as soon as possible,

384
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,320
so we can be well-prepared

385
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,720
in case we can't locate the poison.

386
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,120
Rushuang, what are you doing?

387
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,080
Hurry, gargle a bit.

388
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,000
How is it?

389
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,360
Do you feel ill?

390
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,200
I got it.

391
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,160
There's also Red Widow inside.

392
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,280
What is Red Widow?

393
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,320
When I smelled it,

394
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,320
I think it smells familiar.

395
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
We also talked about the Western Regions.

396
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,680
That reminds me

397
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,040
about the time when I was young.

398
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,680
I accidentally ate a rare item from the

399
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:58,040
Western Region in my dad's pharmacy.

400
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,200
That was the Red Widow.

401
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,760
It can be found in

402
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,360
the Western Regions
and places that are further.

403
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,760
It's a very rare poisonous scorpion.

404
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,840
Poisonous scorpion?

405
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,000
The powder made from Red Widow tails

406
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,800
plus the juice extracted from plants

407
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,080
and finally the gallstones of animals.

408
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,120
Udumbara?

409
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,400
Yes.

410
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,040
Udumbara is a flower.

411
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,560
It's already poisonous when it is extracted

412
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,680
using the poison making methods

413
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,880
of the Western Regions.

414
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,080
Adding in the tail of Red Widows

415
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,480
and gallstones inside the stomach
of a male goat

416
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,520
will create a rare but strong poison.

417
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,480
A little bit of it

418
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,880
can kill a man.

419
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,160
The initial symptoms of getting poisoned
is similar to coughing diseases.

420
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,680
After five days,
a red line will appear on the wrist.

421
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,440
Rushuang, is there an antidote
for this poison?

422
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
There's no record of it,

423
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,520
but I believe

424
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,240
every poison has its antidote.

425
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,760
I will also try my best to make it.

426
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,600
It's better to be prepared.

427
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,360
Thanks for your hard work.

428
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,640
It's fine.

429
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,120
I'll be leaving.

430
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,880
Alright.

431
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,280
Hopefully, Rushuang
can really develop an antidote

432
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,720
so Brother Jiang's sacrifice
to give us the message

433
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,240
will not be wasted.

434
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,200
How dare you lie to me?

435
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,760
Father.

436
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,040
I really don't know that

437
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,320
Su Ci is the remnant of Bai Liang Clan.

438
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,000
You're with them everyday.

439
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,320
How is that possible?

440
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,440
Su Ci never

441
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,480
said anything about this.

442
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
If anyone knows, it must be Xiao Yanzhi.

443
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,280
You're not ganging up

444
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,760
with Xiao Yanzhi

445
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,600
to lie to me, right?

446
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,880
I won't dare to do that!

447
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,080
It's you who raised me.

448
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,000
I will never forget or betray you.

449
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,400
Ming.

450
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,040
You are the one

451
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,360
I value the most.

452
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,320
You must never betray me.

453
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,720
Understand?

454
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Stand up.

455
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Yes.

456
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,560
Father.

457
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,200
Should we use

458
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,880
Su Ci's true identity

459
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,960
to hector Xiao Yanzhi?

460
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,320
I've prepared a huge surprise for them.

461
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,960
Ming.

462
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,080
Have a good rest when you're back.

463
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,600
Three days later,

464
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,280
I need you to do something

465
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,680
during the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

466
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,360
Yes.

467
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,880
(Invitation to the banquet for Su Ci)

468
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,480
I'm invited too?

469
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Yes.

470
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,920
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

471
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,880
Well then...

472
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,600
No way.

473
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,960
My parents

474
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,560
and my clans name
are going to be cleared soon.

475
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,920
I've been waiting
for this moment for a long time.

476
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,640
Actually, I don't want you to go.

477
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,480
I can't be sure what will happen

478
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,520
in the future after all.

479
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,520
I've dreamt about this day

480
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,360
for so long.

481
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,840
I want to unmask Prince Yun in front of

482
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,080
His Majesty and
the civil and military officials

483
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,800
and unveil the truth to everyone.

484
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,680
This day is finally here.

485
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,960
How can I not go?

486
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Alright.

487
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
I'll be with you

488
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,920
no matter what you do.

489
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,000
It's just that

490
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,000
we haven't found the murderer
of Tian Yong yet.

491
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,600
We can't clear Brother Jiang's name yet.

492
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,320
I still feel sad

493
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,120
when I think about that.

494
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,800
I believe

495
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,320
this case will come to an end soon.

496
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,800
Don't worry.

497
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,440
Tell me.

498
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,320
What do you want to do

499
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,600
when everything settles down?

500
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,880
What do you think?

501
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,200
I'll stick with you of course.

502
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,080
I'll go wherever you want to.

503
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,320
I'll do whatever you want

504
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,000
with you.

505
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,080
If that day comes,

506
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,080
I will do nothing.

507
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,760
But I do have something important to do.

508
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
What is it?

509
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,920
I want His Majesty

510
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,480
to grant us a marriage.

511
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,060
Brother Xie.

512
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,660
What's wrong?

513
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,980
Something is happening at the capital.

514
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,580
I have other things to do
at the birthday banquet.

515
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,620
I'm worried about the security.

516
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,620
So I want you
to protect Little Su and Rushuang.

517
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:45,860
Me?

518
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,060
Yes. You're the most suitable person.

519
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,900
I trust you.

520
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,420
Leave it to me.

521
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,420
Don't worry.

522
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,060
Brother Pei.

523
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,260
I promise you

524
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,020
I'll follow them
wherever they go from today.

525
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,420
Great.
