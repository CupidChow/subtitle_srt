(Episode 25)

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,760
We found those maids

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,880
upon arriving at the temple.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,480
After checking their pulse,

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,440
I realized that

19
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,760
they weren't expelled from the palace

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,040
because they were sick.

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,080
We got it right.

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,160
Brother Xie,

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,800
what's wrong with you?

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
You're so weird.

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,800
Are you all right, Brother Xie?

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,560
He's fine.

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
Rushuang, do you find out

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,160
what poisoned them?

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a chronic poison.

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,040
The palms of these maids

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,120
got swollen all of a sudden and

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,320
failed to be cured.

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,960
So they were expelled from the palace.

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,800
Seven years later,

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,000
most of their palms

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,720
have deformed.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,880
They only got palms deformed
after being poisoned.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
But the late emperor

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,040
died of a sudden death.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,320
It's different from the chronic
poisoning symptoms of

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,200
those maids.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,800
So I think

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,960
someone must have
used some catalytic agent.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,640
So it speeded up the poisoning.

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Can you be sure of that?

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,000
I need a little bit more time.

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,000
As long as I can find out the poison,

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,880
I'll find the catalytic agent.

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
That's great!

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,320
Brother Xie,

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,760
what's wrong with you today?

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,680
Two days ago, you looked sad and gloomy.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,720
And you're laughing happily today.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,040
Has something good happened?

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,080
Tell us.

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,240
Little Fei Yuan,

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,720
nothing good happened.

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,240
I don't know why

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,640
I just can't help laughing.

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,440
You looked so gloomy recently,

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,200
and I wanted to make you happy.

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,080
So I gave you a little bit
of laughing medicine.

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,160
Laughing medicine?

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,320
Sister Rushuang, you're awesome.

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,000
You can even make such rare drug.

66
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,280
Rushuang,

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,200
give me the antidote.

68
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
I laugh too much

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,200
that my belly hurts right now.

70
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,560
Okay.

71
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,280
I can give you the antidote.

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,520
But you must promise me that

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
you won't be sad and gloomy again.

74
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,120
You must be happy like you always do.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,360
Rushuang, I promise you.

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Please give me the antidote now.

77
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680
All right. I'll give it to you.

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,680
The antidote is on the desk in my room.

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,800
It's in a white bottle.

80
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,880
Drink it and you'll be fine.

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,720
Okay.

82
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,400
Keep chatting and I'll get the antidote.

83
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,280
It's been a long time since

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
we heard him laughing open-heartedly.

85
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,520
Brother Pei, Sister Su,

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,270
has he spoken to you

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,120
about anything recently?

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,880
What's wrong?

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,040
I'm not sure what's wrong with him.

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,000
I just feel that
he's been avoiding me recently.

91
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,760
It seems like something is bothering him.

92
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,520
Did you talk to him about it?

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,600
I did.

94
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,520
But he didn't answer my questions.

95
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
I don't know why he is avoiding me.

96
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
It seems like he doesn't want me
to know about it.

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,360
Rushuang,

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,560
everyone has their own secret.

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,480
Just like me. I had a secret too.

100
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,640
You should give him some time.

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,800
I know.

102
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,440
So I'm not forcing him to tell me.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
I just want to be by his side

104
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,920
and make him happy.

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,160
When he gets over,

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,600
he'll tell me.

107
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,920
The maids were poisoned by

108
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,120
something called

109
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,440
Fei Yue, a rare chronic poison.

110
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,320
It can be catalyzed by Bletilla.

111
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,920
We normally use Bletilla with the herbs
that help invigorate blood.

112
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
I've asked Imperial Physician Zhang to

113
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
list the prescriptions
that the late emperor

114
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,800
took when he's alive.

115
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
Bletilla wasn't in this list.

116
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,760
Are there any other catalytic agents?

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,200
Let me look into all these herbs.

118
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,200
You're not coming with me?

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,920
I've got other things to do.

120
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,400
Bletilla should be the catalyst.

121
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
But why it was not included

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,960
in the prescriptions?

123
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,560
Ms. Rushuang,

124
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Hi, Sir.

125
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,520
what kind of herbs
are you looking for today?

126
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,460
Are there any new herbs lately?

127
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,970
Yes. We've just got a new batch.
Please come and take a look.

128
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,740
See.

129
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,140
Let me have a look.

130
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,370
Help yourself.

131
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,750
Just let me know if you want anything,

132
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,890
I'll pack it for you.
-Thank you.

133
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,090
Sir,

134
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,690
I need two taels of Magnolia Ginseng.

135
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,130
All right. Please wait for a second.

136
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,720
-Sir.
-Yes.

137
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,680
That's not what this gentleman asked for.

138
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,610
Yes, it is.

139
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,370
He asked for some Bletilla.

140
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,250
Didn't he say Magnolia Ginseng?

141
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,850
Magnolia Ginseng is Bletilla.

142
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,330
How can they be the same?

143
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,010
Magnolia Ginseng looks like ginseng.

144
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,410
Besides that, it belongs to Magnoliaceae.

145
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,890
The elderly

146
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,490
used to call it Magnolia Ginseng.

147
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,090
But the name has changed.

148
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,330
Here you go.

149
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,570
Right. Magnolia Ginseng is Bletilla.

150
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,050
It's the catalyst.

151
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:31,770
Yes.

152
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,730
It's Bletilla.

153
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,330
Bletilla is harmless itself.

154
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,410
But the late emperor

155
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,970
had got chronic poison.

156
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,170
So...

157
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,890
Who gave this tonic to the late emperor?

158
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,170
The Empress Dowager.

159
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,770
Her Highness was very closed
to the late emperor.

160
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,890
I knew it.

161
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,210
So

162
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,490
it can't be her
who poisoned the late emperor.

163
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,290
Well then,

164
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,210
could it be that
someone took advantage of her

165
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,410
to present the tonic?

166
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,450
Don't worry.

167
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,490
I'll find what she might know.

168
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,970
Maybe I'll get the answer.

169
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,770
You want some tonics?

170
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,770
Yes.

171
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,050
I got many injuries

172
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,330
in the battles years ago.

173
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,520
So I thought

174
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,400
to take some tonics to be stronger.

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah.

176
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,650
You're not young anymore.

177
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,530
You should take care of your body,

178
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,050
and get your own children.

179
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,890
I remember
when the late emperor was still alive,

180
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,290
he often took tonics.

181
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,530
So I thought you might knew about it.

182
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,250
The tonic your father took

183
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,730
was indeed recommended by me.

184
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,170
But it was presented
by the imperial physicians.

185
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,490
But I can't recall

186
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,490
the details of the prescription now.

187
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,170
I remember father once told me that

188
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,570
the tonic he took

189
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,250
three times a day was really effective.

190
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,930
He felt so energetic after having it.

191
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,410
And he felt he was getting younger.

192
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,330
But who knew that

193
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,210
he was poisoned to death
not long after that.

194
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,850
Yeah.

195
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,970
Speaking of the tonic, Princess Consort Yun

196
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,840
did make a lot of efforts in finding it.

197
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,050
It's Princess Consort Yun
who presented the tonic.

198
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,610
What are you going to do?

199
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,050
I'm gonna to report the grievance

200
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,530
to His Majesty.

201
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,410
It was Prince Yun.

202
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,250
He was the one
who ordered to poison the clothing,

203
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,770
and took advantage of his wife
to present the tonic.

204
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,250
It's he who killed the late emperor,

205
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,290
and framed the entire Bai Liang Clan.

206
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,010
Calm down.

207
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,810
With his power and authority

208
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,410
in the court,

209
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,370
we can't bring him down

210
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,530
mere with the letters

211
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,490
and our inference on the case.

212
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,610
So we're just letting him break
the law with impunity.

213
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,210
The late emperor,

214
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,770
my parents,

215
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,690
the entire Bai Liang Clan,

216
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,530
as well as

217
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,770
the warriors sacrificed
in the Battle of Honggu

218
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,810
could not die for nothing.

219
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,930
Instead of acting recklessly

220
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,210
and making him alert,

221
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,130
we should try to get the solid evidence

222
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,210
and expose his conspiracy to the public.

223
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,210
Do you have any ideas?

224
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,890
I'll figure it out.

225
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,410
Rushuang,

226
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,770
what are you doing?

227
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,770
I'm doing an experiment.

228
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,890
What experiment?

229
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,170
What kind of experiment that needs
to use so many pieces of cloth?

230
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,290
That's all thanks to
the idot Xie Beiming.

231
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,290
I told him that

232
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,170
I just needed only one type.

233
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,930
Yet he got so many.

234
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,810
I was thinking that after the experiment,

235
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,210
the rest could be used to make
new clothes for Rushuang.

236
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,530
I bought them

237
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,850
from the best cloth store in the capital.

238
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,770
That's great.

239
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,170
We can make some new clothes.

240
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,210
Sister Su,

241
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,770
pick one for yourself.

242
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,330
I think this one suits you.

243
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,810
Right?

244
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,010
Brother Xie, do I look good in this?

245
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,930
Awesome.

246
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,290
You look good in everything.

247
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,770
By the way.

248
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,690
They told me that's the best.

249
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,410
It's the closest to Bai Liang brocade.

250
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:31,850
Brother Su,

251
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,370
I can get you some

252
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,250
if you like it.

253
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,570
It's Bai Liang brocade.

254
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,410
Are you sure?

255
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,690
Bai Liang Clan would never teach outsiders

256
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,610
about their brocade weaving technique.

257
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,250
Could it be...

258
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,690
Where did you get this?

259
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,770
(Jinxiu Silk Shop)
Sir, please take a look at this.

260
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,650
Is this brocade from your store?

261
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,610
I imported it from somewhere else.

262
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,610
You've got quite good taste.

263
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,730
The brocade in your hand

264
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,330
is the last piece in my store.

265
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,290
Where did you get it?

266
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:06,970
Miss,

267
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,050
are you trying to compete with me?

268
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,090
It's hard to get brocade
with such quality.

269
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,410
And they don't produce much

270
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,810
or at stable frequency.

271
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,130
I can't tell you for nothing.

272
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,330
Where exactly did you get the brocade?

273
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,730
Tell us.

274
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,850
I got it from the Xu family in Nanxun.

275
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
(Tea house)

276
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,530
Here's the tea.

277
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,890
The steamed bun will be served shortly.

278
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,930
(Nanxun Town)
You may leave us.

279
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,770
There's quite a number of

280
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,490
people left the town today.

281
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,530
Yeah.

282
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,810
I'd leave too

283
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,930
if we don't own

284
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,970
a huge mulberry orchard.

285
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:06,930
Hey, guys.

286
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,690
Why are there so many people
leaving the town?

287
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,010
There's an outbreak of plague in the town.

288
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,650
An outbreak of plague?

289
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,090
Will we get infected?

290
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,650
Little Fei Yuan, I'm here.
What are you afraid of?

291
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,330
It's the Xu family.

292
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,010
They got cursed by the silkworm empress.

293
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,410
And now everyone in town has to suffer.

294
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,690
I agree.

295
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,450
The Xu Family...

296
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,370
Hey, guys.

297
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,210
Are you talking about the Xu
Family, the silk merchant?

298
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,530
Yes.

299
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,290
Are you here to buy some silk?

300
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,450
You'd better not.

301
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,610
Have you guys heard about this?

302
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,570
The silkworm empress statue caught fire

303
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,530
in the celebration two days ago.

304
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,090
The next day,

305
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,810
one of the staff in the Xu family

306
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,330
was found dead in the silkworm house

307
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,610
with his head being wrapped in
white cloth just like a cocoon.

308
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,210
The murderer was so cold-blooded.

309
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,730
He wrapped the victim into a cocoon.

310
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,250
Bill, please.

311
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,690
No one murdered the staff.

312
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,010
That was the punishment
from silkworm empress.

313
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,250
Why was the Xu family

314
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,210
punished by the silkworm empress?

315
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,250
That's a long story.

316
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,050
In Nanxun Town,

317
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,570
almost every household is involved
in silk reeling business.

318
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,890
Some of us even produce brocade.

319
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,570
We all are blessed
by the silkworm empress.

320
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,210
The rich families will compete to
hold a celebration

321
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,170
for the silkworm empress
in the town every year.

322
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,810
Praying that they'll have a great
and prosperous year ahead.

323
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,810
The Xu family finally got the chance to
hold that celebration this year.

324
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,810
But the tragedy happened.

325
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,370
They're so unlucky.

326
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,450
The Xu family
has prospered for seven years.

327
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,290
It's about time.

328
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,970
Seven years?

329
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,450
You siad the Xu family has
prospered for seven years.

330
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,930
What happened seven years ago

331
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,210
leaving you such deep impression?

332
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,330
Seven years ago,

333
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,370
the Xu family mastered a very complicated

334
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,810
brocade weaving technique out of nowhere.

335
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,050
Ever since then,

336
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,090
they beat the Sun family

337
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,450
and became the biggest
silk merchant in town.

338
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,490
Sir,

339
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,690
do you know who in the Xu family

340
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,850
mastered this brocade weaving technique?

341
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,530
Lady Xu.

342
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,690
We all suspect that

343
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,010
Lady Xu

344
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,850
must have traded with the silkworm empress

345
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,970
to learn such great technique.

346
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:13,970
Otherwise,

347
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,490
why did she die

348
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,290
when the Xu family was in the prime?

349
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,290
She is dead?

350
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,770
A trade is a trade.

351
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,170
They'd have to

352
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,050
pay it one day.

353
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,050
You guys are talking nonsense.

354
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,170
It's true.

355
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,050
After Lady Xu passed away,

356
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,730
the Xu family could still hold up.

357
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,530
But none of their staff

358
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,610
could produce high-quality
brocade like Lady Xu.

359
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,330
And their business went downhill.

360
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,210
But some people said that

361
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,850
she was killed by the concubine.

362
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,730
Who knows.

363
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,330
Did she marry Master Xu seven years ago?

364
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,210
No.

365
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,370
She came from Nanxun Town.

366
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,410
Brother Pei, look at the woman over there.

367
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,890
Is she going to jump into the river?

368
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,170
Oh no!

369
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,810
Somebody was jumping into the river.

370
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,680
(Nanxun Hotel)

371
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,050
Miss, you're finally awake.

372
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,970
How do you feel?

373
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,690
Am I...

374
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,610
Am I dead?

375
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,530
If you're dead,

376
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,130
then we're all ghosts.

377
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,490
We wouldn't sit and see

378
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,090
you kill yourself, would we?

379
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,090
Why did you save me?

380
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,050
Miss,

381
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,290
is there something bad happened to you

382
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,570
that makes you want to commit suicide?

383
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,690
My father forced me to marry Sun Bo.

384
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,970
I didn't want it.

385
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,690
They wouldn't listen to me.

386
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,410
They forced me.

387
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,010
Although marriage is supposed to be

388
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,930
arranged by our parents,

389
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,930
our will is important too.

390
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,650
How could he force you to marry someone?

391
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,770
Sun Bo is after

392
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,090
my family's wealth.

393
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,810
He kept coming to my house to trouble us.

394
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,170
If he's after your family's wealth,

395
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,370
Why would your father

396
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,850
force you to marry him?

397
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,130
My family

398
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,370
held a celebration few days ago.

399
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,010
Something went wrong in that celebration.

400
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,170
Sun Bo took this chance

401
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,490
to stir up the hatred among
the people in the town

402
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,130
to fight against my father.

403
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,130
My dad had no choice.

404
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,090
You're the daughter of the Xu Family?

405
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,450
Yes.

406
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,810
I'm the eldest daughter.

407
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,530
Ms. Xu,

408
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,850
can you tell us what happened

409
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,370
during the celebration?

410
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,730
It's our turn this year to

411
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,250
hold the celebration
for the silkworm empress.

412
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,330
My father paid so much attention to this.

413
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,850
We prepared for
the celebration months ago.

414
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,370
My father told me that

415
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,890
it's one of the biggest celebrations
in town.

416
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,490
It has to be a success.

417
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,370
My father booked the entire tea house

418
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,890
this morning,

419
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,890
so that we can
watch the celebration from here.

420
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,090
We can see everything clearly,

421
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,610
in this quiet environment.

422
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,970
Your father is so good to you.

423
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,570
Look, it's the silkworm empress.

424
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,490
It's the silkworm empress.

425
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,530
Let's go and take a look.

426
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,210
It catches fire.

427
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,650
It catches fire. Why is this happening?

428
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,970
Help! Be careful!

429
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,770
Move!

430
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,610
You...

431
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,690
What do you want to do?

432
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,610
Everyone in town knows that

433
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,810
your family have screwed up the celebration.

434
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,610
That's right.

435
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,370
And now there's an outbreak
of plague in town.

436
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,050
Yeah.

437
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,850
What are you going to do to stop all these?

438
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,170
What are you going to do?
-Tell us!

439
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,570
How could you say that

440
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,650
we brought all these to the town?

441
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,730
Maybe one of you

442
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,490
insulted the silkworm empress.

443
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,130
Xu Mengchang,

444
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,530
if it's not you,

445
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,010
how come one of your staff, He Da

446
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,370
was killed in the silkworm house?

447
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,010
Yeah.

448
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,330
That's enough.

449
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,610
Or else,

450
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,850
I'll sue you.

451
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,850
How dare you?

452
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,170
We shouldn't let him off the hook.

453
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,890
Stop it.

454
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:31,850
Give us an explanation.

455
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,090
Calm down, everyone.

456
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,530
Master Sun is coming.

457
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,170
-Master Sun.
-Calm down.

458
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,770
Master Sun, please say something.

459
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,770
Master Xu,

460
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,290
come with me.

461
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,370
Come with me.

462
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,850
Please calm down, everyone.

463
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,330
Master Sun is here to help us.

464
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,170
Master Xu,

465
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,930
have you thought about the suggestion

466
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,970
that I gave you the other day?

467
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,890
If I can marry Qingmei,

468
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,690
you'll be my father-in-law and
I'll definitely help you.

469
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,210
Sun Bo,

470
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,930
I know that you're after

471
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,290
our silkworm rearing technique
for a long time.

472
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,410
Tell me.

473
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,770
Did you kill my staff?

474
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,770
Master Xu,

475
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,050
please don't make any accusations

476
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,810
when you have no proof.

477
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,370
I'm here to help you.

478
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,010
I can't stop them

479
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,570
from making a big fuss

480
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,410
if you don't give me your daughter.

481
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,690
Besides,

482
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,330
Xu Qingmei is the daughter
of your late wife.

483
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,770
And you don't like her.

484
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,810
Give her to me.

485
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,930
And you won't have to see her again.

486
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,130
And we'll be a family.

487
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,250
Master Xu,

488
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,210
it's win-win.

489
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,810
Your father is so cruel.

490
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,330
No parents will harm their child.

491
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,050
And he forced you to marry Sun
Bo just to settle the riot.

492
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,450
My mother...

493
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,210
My mother passed away a long time ago.

494
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,010
No wonder your father favors
your younger sister

495
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,530
and pushes you to hell.

496
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,730
They've been treating
me like this

497
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,690
for so many years.

498
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,290
I'm used to it.

499
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,890
Ms. Xu,

500
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,170
you said the statue caught
fire out of nowhere.

501
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,610
What happened?

502
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,690
I don't know.

503
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,970
It happened in a flash.

504
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,050
It caught fire when everyone was watching.

505
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,290
It's like magic.

506
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,290
That staff who was killed...

507
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,370
He Da.

508
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,450
Yes.

509
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,970
When did he die?

510
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,890
How did he die?

511
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,610
He died on the day

512
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,930
when the celebration was held.

513
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,530
His body looked very strange.

514
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,530
Everyone in the town said that

515
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,530
he was punished by the silkworm empress.

516
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,890
Did he

517
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,490
have any enemies?

518
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,810
I don't think so.

519
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,050
What were your family doing

520
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,650
when He Da was killed?

521
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,850
I was with madam during the celebration.

522
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,250
After the fire incident,

523
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,050
something happened on our way home.

524
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,770
So we got home late.

525
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,650
It was already afternoon when we're home.

526
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,170
My father and the others got home

527
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,690
earlier than me and madam.

528
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,210
Ms. Xu, take a good rest.

529
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,370
Don't think about this anymore.

530
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:32,930
Here you go, Sir.

531
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:33,890
(Morgue)
The piece of silver is for you.

532
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,890
All right. Please follow me.

533
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,730
Sir,

534
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,890
do you know about the details
on He Da's murder?

535
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,170
You'd better

536
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,490
not to look into the case.

537
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,730
He's not killed by human being.

538
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,370
On the 10th day of the 9th
month in lunar calendar,

539
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,970
we found his body

540
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,610
at the silkworm house in
the Xu family's residence.

541
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,890
His head was wrapped into a cocoon.

542
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,530
No wound was on his body.

543
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,930
It's strange, isn't it?

544
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,650
It must be the punishment

545
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,690
from the silkworm empress.

546
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,290
That day

547
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,010
was also celebration day, right?

548
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:11,850
You're right.

549
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,970
He had been staying in the
silkworm house for half a month

550
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,690
to look after the silkworm larvae.

551
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,250
This is one of the rules here.

552
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,650
And that date

553
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,010
was the third hibernation
period of the silkworms.

554
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:20,730
The date can't be wronged.

555
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,850
It's stated on He Da's record.

556
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,170
What do you mean
by third hibernation period?

557
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,170
All of silkworms in our town

558
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,250
produce cocoons only after
the 4th hibernation period.

559
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,610
The time is fixed.

560
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,130
Have any officers looked
into the suspects?

561
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,570
Yes.

562
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,730
But,

563
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,530
it's really not like done by human.

564
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,010
He Da had no family.

565
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,330
They simply processed his body

566
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,290
and sent it to the morgue.

567
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,410
His body is in this coffin.

568
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,450
You guys can come and take a look.

569
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,650
How's it?

570
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,290
Did you see anything strange?

571
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,650
His face had turned purple.

572
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,570
No physical wound was on his body.

573
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,890
He was suffocated to death.

574
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,930
Sir,

575
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,930
who sent his body here?

576
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,770
Mr. and Master Xu
reported to the government.

577
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,050
But I'm not sure who found the body.

578
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,290
By the way.

579
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,970
What's left
of the burnt silkworm empress statue?

580
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,490
It was burnt to ashes.

581
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,850
Nothing was left.

582
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,770
We couldn't find any clues on the body.

583
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,770
Let's pay a visit to the Xu family.

584
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,570
Sister Su,

585
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,210
I'm not going with you all.

586
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,010
I want to find the source of the plague

587
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,250
so that I could find a cure for it
as soon as possible.

588
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,490
All right.

589
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,050
See you.

590
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,810
I'll...

591
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,010
You must stay by my side.

592
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,250
Please be careful.

593
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,490
Let's go.

594
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:58,930
It's urgent.

595
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,650
Let's go to the Xu family.

596
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,170
Are you planning to go wearing this?

597
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,810
What's wrong with my outfit?

598
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:07,810
Goodbye.

599
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,650
Goodbye.

600
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,370
Please come again.

601
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,330
Sure.

602
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,530
How can I help you?

603
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,290
Dear,

604
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,290
just take a look around.

605
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,650
See if there's anything that you like.

606
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,250
We come from the capital.

607
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,650
We've heard that Nanxun Town
is known for its silk.

608
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,530
So we thought to buy some shops here

609
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,730
for our satin business.

610
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,530
Do you have any recommendation?

611
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,690
The Xu family is one of the
biggest satin stores here.

612
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,090
They own some shops and property too.

613
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,730
I think they're putting their business

614
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,970
on sale now.

615
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,570
Why's that?

616
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,290
Master Xu was interested in

617
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,170
a high-quality Hetian Jade in my store.

618
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,730
He even paid the down payment for it.

619
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,010
But he didn't come
to get it for so many days.

620
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,890
And they got into troubles recently.

621
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,810
I think they've got some
problems with their cash flow.

622
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,890
Can I have a look at the Hetian jade?

623
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,890
Sure.

624
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,210
Sir,

625
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,730
here is the jade.

626
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,290
It's as white as snow.

627
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,610
It's refined.

628
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,770
And the structure looks good.

629
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,010
It's pretty good.

630
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,490
Do you like it?

631
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,770
What do you think?

632
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,050
I've never given you any gifts before.

633
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,890
I'll buy this jade for you.

634
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,570
How much is this jade?

635
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,730
It's cheap.

636
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,450
Only 100 taels.

637
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,490
100 taels!

638
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,650
And you say it's cheap?!

639
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,650
Sir,

640
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,610
It's fine, dear.

641
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,170
What...

642
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,090
You can keep your savings

643
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,530
to buy some make-up.

644
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,850
It's too expensive.

645
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,690
It's good enough you're thinking
of buying me gifts.

646
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,490
Welcome.

647
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,450
Hi.

648
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,410
Why did you buy the jade?

649
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,290
Dear,

650
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,570
you can buy what you like in the future.

651
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,010
I can afford it.

652
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:01,890
No.

653
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,770
It's too expensive.

654
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,370
Sir.

655
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,770
All right. I'm just joking with you.

656
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,610
I need this to solve the case.

657
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,850
To solve the case?

658
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,480
Come on.

659
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,680
We need to get some new clothes.

660
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,810
Hold on.

661
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,090
Why do we have to get new clothes?

662
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,010
We're going to visit the
Xu family, right?

663
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,410
Those are our props.

664
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,450
Why we need props?

665
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,610
Please queue up and wait.
Everyone has a chance.

666
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,490
Rushuang, everything is ready.

667
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,450
I've spoken to the shopkeeper.

668
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,530
He agreed to let me

669
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,930
use all the herbs in the store for free.

670
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,010
All I have to do is

671
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,090
to examine their symptoms and
find the similarities among them.

672
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,290
Then I should be able
to find the solutions.

673
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,330
All right.

674
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,890
Let me do it, Rushuang.

675
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,330
Let me get you a bandage.

676
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,170
Rushuang,

677
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,450
I'm fine. It's just a minor cut.

678
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,610
I'm fine.

679
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,970
No.

680
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,050
We don't know how the disease spread?

681
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:52,930
We must be careful.

682
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,170
Rushuang,

683
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,610
I'm

684
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,050
not afraid to die.

685
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,650
Stop talking nonsense.

686
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,530
How do I survive if you die?

687
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,170
Rushuang,

688
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,970
You're so good.

689
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,210
I'm not worth it.

690
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,450
Later, let me talking with them.

691
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,810
You observe and see if there's
anything strange.

692
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:23,650
Okay.

693
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,530
(Xu Mansion)
Here we are.

694
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,770
Let's go.

695
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,850
Go.

696
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,610
Master,

697
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,650
What's it?

698
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,330
A gentleman is waiting to see you.

699
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,210
He told me that...

700
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,770
I'm not going to meet anyone.

701
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,130
This is a critical time.

702
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,810
How can you let strangers

703
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,890
come in to our mansion?

704
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,250
The man comes with his wife.

705
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,010
And it seems like they're rich.

706
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,650
He told me that he's here
to do business with us.

707
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,410
Really?

708
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,370
Hurry up.

709
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,730
Invite them to the living room.

710
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,730
Please drink some tea.

711
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,690
I come from the capital.

712
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,090
I heard that you're selling your property.

713
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,810
So I thought I should come
and talk to you about it.

714
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,930
I'm getting old.

715
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,810
And I don't have a son.

716
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,290
Our family owns a lot of property.

717
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,650
I can't pass all these
to my daughter, can I?

718
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,170
So I thought it's better to
sell it to someone else.

719
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,090
How much property do you own?

720
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,610
We have 2 shops,

721
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,970
57 acres of mulberry orchard

722
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,490
and 3 silkworm houses.

723
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,970
To be frank,

724
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,610
my family owns a few shops in the capital,

725
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,210
doing trades with the Purchasing
Bureau in the palace.

726
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,370
We've been supplying satin to
the palace all these years.

727
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,410
But we cannot always get high-quality satin.

728
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,690
So the elderly have decided

729
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,410
to acquire a satin company.

730
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,730
So we don't have to
travel around for good satin.

731
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,930
That's why

732
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,410
we're here.

733
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,370
You've come to the right place.

734
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,810
To be honest.

735
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,730
our technique in silkworm breeding,

736
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,810
silk reeling and brocade weaving is unique.

737
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,090
Unique?

738
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,130
Well.

739
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,130
How about the Sun family?

740
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,610
Their brocade

741
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,850
is nowhere near ours.

742
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,050
My late wife mastered

743
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,650
a unique brocade weaving technique
seven years ago.

744
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,290
No one in Nanxun knew the
technique except her.

745
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,650
Well, you've got me

746
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,250
curious about it.

747
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,770
Can we take a look at the brocade

748
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,610
that you produce?

749
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,770
Sure.

750
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,290
Sure.

751
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,250
Is anybody there?

752
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,130
Master.

753
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,610
Get our high-quality brocade.

754
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,090
You can leave us now.

755
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:21,890
All right.

756
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,210
It's the Bai Liang brocade.

757
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,610
The brocade is indeed of good quality.

758
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,370
But...

759
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,010
Master Xu,

760
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,210
the brocade weaving technique that you used

761
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,290
is similar to Bai Liang's brocade
weaving technique.

762
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:42,890
Well...

763
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:43,850
Sir,

764
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,810
that's nonsense.

765
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,530
Dear,

766
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,970
the Bai Liang Clan broke the law,

767
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,410
and the entire clan was given
the death-sentence.

768
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,250
Anyone related was questioned.

769
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,770
Your wild guess

770
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,410
will put Master Xu in danger.

771
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:05,610
That's right.

772
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,610
You're right.

773
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,210
I'm sorry for all that, Master Xu.

774
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,010
That's fine.

775
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,970
I was too excited just now.

776
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,730
I've been supplying brocade
to the palace these few years.

777
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,050
I can't help but

778
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,810
to compare your brocade
with Bai Ling brocade

779
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,250
because they're very similar.

780
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,050
I've heard the Bai Liang Clan
never gave out their technique.

781
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,530
And the entire clan
was sentenced to death.

782
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,050
It doesn't make sense

783
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,010
if they're the same.

784
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,610
You're right.

785
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,170
I'm curious that

786
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,090
how you've got such unique technique.

787
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,690
Where did your late wife learn
this technique from?

788
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,610
Well...

789
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,290
I really don't know about this.

790
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,010
My late wife locked herself up
for half a month.

791
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,290
And after that,

792
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,290
she mastered it all of a sudden.

793
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,050
Did your late wife have contact with

794
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,690
anyone before she locked herself up?

795
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,620
Master, the celebration has
turned into a disaster.

796
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,700
Is...

797
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,980
Is the silkworm empress punishing us?

798
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,740
What are you afraid of?

799
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,980
Look at how He Da died.

800
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,820
Shut up.

801
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,300
There's an outbreak of plague in the town.

802
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,320
Everyone is blaming us for it.

803
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,600
How are we going to live in this town.

804
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,660
It's all because of Sun Bo.

805
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,020
Sun Bo took this chance
to stir up the hatred

806
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,340
He did all that because

807
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,460
he's after my family's wealth.

808
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,660
And Qing Mei is so stubborn.

809
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,860
What she has to do is marry Sun Bo

810
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,500
and all would get over.

811
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,140
And now she has gone missing.

812
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,220
What should we do

813
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,420
if Sun Bo comes to cause trouble?

814
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,420
Yes.

815
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,220
We should find a solution.

816
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,940
No.

817
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,020
Master,

818
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,780
are you going to let Sun Bo marry Bingjie?

819
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,780
Father, Mother,

820
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,820
I'm still young.

821
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,340
I don't want to leave you.

822
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
No.

823
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,540
How could I let Sun Bo marry you.

824
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,140
Now,

825
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,140
if someone can acquire our property,

826
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,220
we'll leave this place.

827
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,660
That's a good option.

828
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,100
Look at our situation.

829
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,420
Who else will acquire our property

830
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,740
besides Sun Bo who is after our wealth?
