(Episode 26)

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,160
I heard that Bai Liang brocade
weaving skill

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,440
has never been passed to external party.

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,880
The entire clan has been destroyed now.

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,720
If it's true...

19
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,240
It...

20
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,480
It will be really bad.

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,440
Yes.

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,160
But I wonder

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,680
where did your late wife

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,120
learn this excellent
brocade skill of Xu family?

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,800
This...

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
I don't really know about this.

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,440
My late wife was in
seclusion for half a month.

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,680
She knew the technique

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
after she came out from seclusion.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,640
Was your late wife in touch
with anyone new

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,120
before or after her seclusion?

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,080
I wonder why you asked about all these.

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,600
My wife is a curious person.

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,840
Master Xu, please forgive her.

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,400
According to hearsay,

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
the brocade weaving skill
of Xu family is excellent,

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,000
and the business should be good.

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,160
But, how come I heard that,

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,720
the business of Xu family
is not as good anymore?

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,320
Don't listen to rumours out there.

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,360
It's because of the
celebration a few days back.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,960
Some...

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,320
Some problems occurred.

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,200
No big deal.

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,440
No big deal.

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,240
How come I'm so unlucky?

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,160
I just arrived in the town,

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680
and my jade was crushed by someone.

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
The fortune teller said
that I need jade in my life.

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,040
That's why

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
I simply bought a piece
of jade in this town.

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,880
The colour of this jade is
incomparable to those at home.

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,200
This...

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Mr. Xu,

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
let's be straightforward.

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,840
As long as your goods are good,

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,080
and your workmanship is good,

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,360
money is not a problem.

59
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,880
Good then.

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,400
Good.

61
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,480
Master Xu,

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,800
you mentioned just now that

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,200
you are good in
sericulture and silk reeling.

64
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,040
I wonder if it is convenient

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,560
for us to visit your silkworm house.

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,760
Sure.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sure.

68
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,920
This way please.

69
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
Master Xu, please guide us.

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
Come, over here.

71
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,400
Be careful.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,320
Have a look.

73
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,360
Look around.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
Come, hubby.

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,800
This is our unique sericulture technique.

76
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,400
Strict control on the
temperature and humidity.

77
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,920
Please have a look.

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,240
The silks that spit by our silkworms

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,520
are harder

80
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,840
and stronger.

81
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
So, if I purchase your property,

82
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,560
this skill will be mine too?

83
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,320
Of course.

84

(Sericulture Diary)

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,080
Master Xu.

86
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
This is...

87
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,080
This is the sericulture diary
recorded by the workers.

88
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,520
Can I read it?

89
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,440
Sure.

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,360
Sure.

91
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,240
(September of Lunar Calendar, the
growing process of silkworms by He Da)

92
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,920
Master Xu,

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,840
is He Da

94
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
your most skilful worker here?

95
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,440
Yes.

96
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,480
Will He Da follow the new owner?

97
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,160
He Da died.

98
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,370
(Sericulture Diary)

99
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,000
Hubby, I'm so scared.

100
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,440
What happened?

101
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,200
He was fine. How did he die?

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
I don't know.

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,040
So, it's a big lose

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,920
if I buy this silkworm house.

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,960
The skills of the old workers
are the most precious.

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,320
It's not like that.

107
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,360
The skills of other workers here

108
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
were taught by my late wife.

109
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
All of them can produce a silk
that can carry eight copper coins.

110
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
You don't have to worry.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Your late wife knew about
sericulture and brocade weaving skills,

112
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,680
but passed away at young age.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
It's really a pity.

114
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,800
Master Xu,

115
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,800
Xu family is so huge,

116
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
besides your late wife,

117
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,840
there's no other skillful worker?

118
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,200
There is someone better.

119
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,640
Then, I won't bother Master Xu anymore.

120
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,480
We'll walk around the town

121
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,040
and discuss with you later.

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,080
Let's go, hubby.

123
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,800
How about this?

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
When you return to my silkworm house,

125
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
we can negotiate about the price again.

126
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
-Is the medicine ready?
-Yes.

127
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,200
Although we haven't develop

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
the medicine to treat
the plague successfully,

129
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,520
this is good for prevention.

130
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Quickly drink it.

131
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,680
This medicine smells bitter.

132
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,040
Bitter medicine is good for health.

133
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,800
Moreover,

134
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,320
you're a swordsman with many experiences,

135
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,400
yet, you're afraid of bitterness?

136
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,360
Drink it quickly.

137
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,800
This is too bitter!

138
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,440
Take a candy.

139
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,640
Is it still bitter?

140
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,800
No.

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,440
Look at your mouth.

142
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,720
I'll take a bowl for Little Fei Yuan too.

143
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,600
How come he's so weird lately?

144
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,080
Could it be that

145
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,760
his feeling has changed?

146
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,800
Looks like Master Xu really doesn't know

147
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,000
the brocade that they produce

148
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,800
is the Bai Liang brocade.

149
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
His reactions

150
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,200
don't look fake.

151
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,160
Thank you sir.

152
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,680
Let's go.

153
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Sadly Mrs. Xu passed away.

154
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,880
We're clueless now.

155
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,880
Maybe not.

156
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,520
At least we can confirm that

157
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,200
the brocades from Xu family

158
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,800
is the Bai Liang Brocade
which made with a special skill.

159
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
Since Bai Liang Clan was destroyed,

160
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,360
the only person who
knows about this special skill,

161
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,280
and appeared in this town
seven years ago by coincidence,

162
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,120
is the palace maid from the Laundry
Bureau who played dead years ago.

163
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
We can investigate
by following this clue.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,840
Maybe we can find something.

165
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
This rich family of Nanxun

166
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,840
and Sun family...

167
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
These two families must be at odds.

168
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,560
The information that we
can't get from Xu family,

169
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,960
maybe we can find out

170
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
from their opponent, the Sun family.

171
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,560
Let's go.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,920
Let's have a look at Sun family.

173
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,080
Let's go.

174
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,760
This is not bad.

175
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,280
Mister,

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
what is the price

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,000
of your silk?

178
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,559
Sir and miss,

179
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
what do you need?

180
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,799
We have the best silk

181
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
in Nanxun.

182
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,600
Sir, have a look.

183
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,600
Look at the quality of this silk,

184
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
it must be made of good raw materials.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,440
The quality of this silk

186
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,640
is not as good as Xu family.

187
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,800
Miss,

188
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
looks like you don't
know well about this.

189
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,600
Xu family was still doing
well a few years ago.

190
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,840
But, they have become
really bad these few years.

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,240
What is the uniqueness

192
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,600
of you silk?

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Mister,

194
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,160
how many copper coins

195
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,160
can your silk carry?

196
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
Looks like you're an expert.

197
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,040
Our silk

198
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
can carry five copper coins
without breaking.

199
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,040
Our silks are of best quality.

200
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Five copper coins?

201
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,800
Yes.

202
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,520
Hubby,

203
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,240
I heard that the silk from Xu family

204
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
can carry eight copper coins.

205
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,360
Eight copper coins?

206
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,760
Yes.

207
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,840
Are you dreaming?

208
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
A silk can carry eight copper coins?

209
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,320
Since Lady Xu from
Xu family passed away,

210
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,480
who else can do that?

211
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,880
He Da?

212
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
He Da can only produce a silk
that can carry six copper coins.

213
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,000
Our master used a lot
of money to hire him.

214
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,680
Sadly, he passed away.

215
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,560
Sir and Miss,

216
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
don't listen to them.

217
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,760
Sun family is the best now.

218
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,440
Let's not talk about the
unlucky Xu family now.

219
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,600
Look at this.

220
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,480
This is the silk cloth with
turquoise gemstone dye.

221
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,080
Look at the bright colour.

222
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
The colour doesn't fade in water.

223
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
You can only find this

224
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
in Sun family.

225
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,320
Oh yes,

226
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,440
where is your master?

227
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,280
Our master has been
in the dyeing workshop lately.

228
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,120
Sun Bo, come out!

229
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,280
Where did you hide our lady?

230
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
How come this crazy woman come again?

231
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,280
Let's go.

232
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,360
(Feng Yu Weaving)
Crazy woman, why are you here again?

233
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,320
Sun Bo kidnapped our lady.

234
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,800
If something happened to her,

235
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
(Feng Yu Weaving)
I'll not let him go!

236
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,240
Sun Bo!

237
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,800
Enough.

238
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,680
Sun Bo, come out!

239
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,360
Don't disturb my business.

240
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Go away!

241
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,640
Sun Bo!

242
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,240
Don't disturb my business.

243
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,600
Sun Bo!

244
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,120
Hurry!

245
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,640
Okay, stop looking.

246
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
There's nothing to see here.

247
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,680
Do your work.

248
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,640
Sir and miss.

249
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,000
The woman is old,

250
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
why did you chase her away?

251
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,320
Sir, you don't know about this.

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
She was here yesterday too.

253
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,600
My business was affected.

254
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,480
Really unlucky.

255
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,120
Sir and miss,

256
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,120
let's continue to look inside.

257
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,200
Hey, Sir and Miss...

258
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,800
Madam.

259
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,320
Madam.

260
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,280
Are you calling me?

261
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,560
Yes.

262
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,320
Are you looking for someone?

263
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,640
Yes.

264
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,880
Our lady

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,400
was lost during the celebration
of the Silkworm Empress.

266
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,880
Come with us.

267
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,400
Ms. Xu is with us.

268
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,600
Who are both of you?

269
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,320
Is Qingmei all right?

270
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,360
Don't worry.

271
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,920
Ms. Xu is fine.

272
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,680
Xie Beiming.

273
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,280
Rushuang, are you all right?

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
You followed me for the whole
morning and now you finally came out.

275
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,720
Rushuang, I...

276
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,800
You're a man!

277
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,280
Yet, you always like to hide.

278
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,840
You must be brave in facing
something that you don't want to face.

279
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,640
Xie Beiming,

280
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,720
just tell me if you
don't like me anymore.

281
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,880
You don't have to hide.

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,040
You don't look like a man!

283
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,040
I didn't, Rushuang.

284
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,480
I...

285
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,360
Rushuang,

286
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
let me carry it for you.

287
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,920
We can be at ease now that

288
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,680
the madam is taking care of Ms. Xu.

289
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,160
Yes.

290
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,160
Let's go.

291
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,640
Let's go to the dyeing workshop
of Sun family again.

292
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,520
My master is at the backyard.

293
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,680
I'll inform him now.

294
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,720
Someone come quickly!
Something has happened!

295
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,120
Quick!

296
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,760
Let's have a look.

297
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,960
What happened?

298
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,760
Master is dead.

299
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,800
It's the Silkworm Empress.

300
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,800
It's the Silkworm Empress.

301
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,280
The curse of the Silkworm Empress.

302
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,200
Quickly report to the authority now.

303
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,560
Report to the authority.

304
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,320
Yes.

305
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:08,880
Report to the authority.

306
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,360
Don't destroy anything here.

307
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,400
There's water stain on the table.

308
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,240
Eight copper coins?

309
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,160
A silk that can carry eight copper coins?

310
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,680
The worker in the store
mentioned just now.

311
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,840
Only the late Lady Xu

312
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,960
can produce silk that can
carry eight copper coins.

313
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,440
Could it be someone

314
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,200
wants to deliver some messages?

315
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,320
Quickly look for someone

316
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,640
to carry your master out from there.

317
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,440
Yes.

318
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
There're traces of dragging.

319
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
What did you find?

320
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,200
He was suffocated to death.

321
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,880
He died an hour ago.

322
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,400
But...

323
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,280
But what?

324
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,600
Sun Bo died from drowning.

325
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,600
But, the location that he was
laying down in the beginning,

326
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,840
should be

327
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,160
on that table.

328
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,560
Is there anyone suspicious

329
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,800
appeared in the dye house lately?

330
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,200
No.

331
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,240
No.

332
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,200
Only some normal customers

333
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,240
came to see the clothes.

334
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400
If there's a suspicious person...

335
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,360
A crazy woman always scolding outside,

336
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,240
but she has never been inside.

337
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,720
Does your master have any enemy?

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,280
Master was rude and arrogant sometimes.

339
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,320
But, if we are talking about enemy here,

340
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,040
I can only think of the Xu family.

341
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,080
Xu family?

342
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,600
Sorry that I didn't know

343
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,760
both of you were here.

344
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
It's okay, Master Xu.

345
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,920
Have a seat.

346
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,880
Sit.

347
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,880
Have a seat too, my wife.

348
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,440
I wonder how is the
consideration of both of you.

349
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,920
Today, we had an
appointment with Master Sun

350
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,120
to discuss about
buying his silkworm house too.

351
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,640
We didn't expect that

352
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,400
he had passed away.

353
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,760
Sun Bo passed away?

354
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,440
When Sun Bo passed away,

355
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,520
his head were wrapped
like a silkworm cocoon.

356
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,840
It was quite terrible.

357
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,760
When did that happen?

358
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,760
In the afternoon.

359
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
It is even more strange that

360
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,120
when Sun Bo died,

361
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,640
there were eight
copper coins next to him.

362
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,400
Eight...

363
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,400
Eight copper coins?

364
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,160
Why did your face look pale?

365
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,720
This...

366
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,000
This...

367
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,000
Could it be

368
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,160
we wanted Qingmei to marry Sun Bo

369
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,040
and made sister angry?

370
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Shut up.

371
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,240
Master Xu,

372
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,599
it looks like the incidents

373
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,040
that happened in the town
lately are not so simple.

374
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,599
What do you mean?

375
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,000
Sun Bo wanted your daughter and workers.

376
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,359
He also wanted to buy
your property with a low price.

377
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,960
You're afraid that He Da
will choose to follow Sun Bo.

378
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,440
Therefore, you use the
name of the Silkworm Empress

379
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,480
to kill both of them.

380
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,400
Am I right?

381
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,000
You...

382
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,200
You're talking nonsense!

383
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,400
Nonsense!

384
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,400
Master didn't kill them.

385
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
It's the ghost.

386
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,840
The ghost killed them.

387
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
My wife, let me send you to your room.

388
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,560
It's the ghost.

389
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,640
-Guards!
-It's the ghost.

390
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,000
Someone come over and chase them out!

391
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,440
Guards!

392
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,840
Do you think my prediction is right?

393
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,160
It's Master Xu who killed Sun Bo.

394
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,160
I don't think so.

395
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,360
Then, why did Master Xu become so angry?

396
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,400
He even chased us out.

397
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,640
This means that he did something wrong.

398
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
I think that

399
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,640
compared to Master Xu,

400
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,440
the words from Mrs. Xu
are worth thinking over.

401
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,040
Everyone in this town

402
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,840
think that the Silkworm Empress
killed the two people.

403
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,640
But, only Mrs. Xu

404
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,600
thinks that they were
killed by the ghost.

405
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,760
Where are you going?

406
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,920
I want to go back and ask the madam.

407
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,480
Madam,

408
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,000
were you by the side of Lady Xu

409
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,520
since she was young?

410
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,920
No.

411
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,200
Lady Xu took me in

412
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,160
because she pitied

413
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,920
a lonely and helpless person like me.

414
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,200
That was more than 10 years ago.

415
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,440
Then,

416
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,480
do you know

417
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,720
how did Miss Xu's mother died?

418
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
She died because of the two people.

419
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,160
Do you mean Master Xu and Mrs. Xu now?

420
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
She's not Mrs. Xu!

421
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,040
She was just a maid

422
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,040
who was rescued by Lady Xu years ago.

423
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,960
Nobody expects that

424
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
she became the concubine of our master

425
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,000
in less than half a year time.

426
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,640
Not only was she riding
roughshod over other people,

427
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,280
in order to be the master's wife,

428
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,080
she killed Lady Xu with poison.

429
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,960
So many incidents had
happened in Xu family in the past.

430
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,240
I think Xu family was
hiding something from us.

431
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,880
These two cases,

432
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,200
the copper coins that
were left on the crime scene,

433
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,640
are definitely related to Ms. Xu's
mother from the Liu family.

434
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Master Xu and Mrs. Xu are feeling guilty

435
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,960
and think they the ghost
came to take people's lives.

436
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,480
Let's turn the trick into our own use.

437
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,360
I agree with you.

438
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,000
But...

439
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,560
It may be too risky.

440
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,000
What are both of you talking about?

441
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,720
Tell me now.

442
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,360
I saw the late Lady Xu's portrait before

443
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
at Ms. Xu's place.

444
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,640
Both of us...

445
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,120
Do we need to tell this to Ms. Xu?

446
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,080
Don't tell her first.

447
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,320
I'm afraid that she'll be confused.

448
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,160
I have another question.

449
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,840
Who is going to act?

450
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,920
I'll act.

451
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,440
No.

452
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,200
The murderer left nothing

453
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,000
after killing two people.

454
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,440
I think the murderer must be a dab hand.

455
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,640
I think

456
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,840
let the person who has
the best kungfu among us

457
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,440
to act.

458
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,760
It's safer like this.

459
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:19,840
Yes.

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
Me?

461
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,815
(Nanxun Inn)

462
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,520
Rushuang,

463
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,120
do you really think that
Brother Xie can act as Lady Xu?

464
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,280
Can we trust both of them?

465
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,040
Both of you didn't realise
that I was teasing him?

466
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,120
He has been so weird lately.

467
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Rushuang,

468
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
do you think my attire like this

469
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,000
works?

470
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,120
I think it works.

471
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,680
Young master, we can eat

472
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,120
fish today.

473
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,080
Ghost!

474
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,600
Ghost!

475
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,200
Fei Yuan,

476
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,000
-it's me.
-Ghost!

477
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,440
I...

478
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,160
I...

479
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,360
How do I look?

480
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,120
You look good.

481
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't mean this.

482
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,480
Do I look like her?

483
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,080
I think something it's lacking.

484
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,560
What it is?

485
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,920
It would be good if you can
add a little bit more lipstick.

486
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,600
Okay, let me do it.

487
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,760
Let me do it.

488
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,480
You?

489
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,480
How is it?

490
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,320
If there's such a beautiful
lady ghost in this world,

491
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,040
I'm willing

492
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,320
to be bothered by it my whole life.

493
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,680
You're good at talking.

494
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,320
Flirtatious.

495
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,880
Sister Xiaoying...

496
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,280
Sister Xiaoying...

497
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,880
Sister...

498
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,360
Sister Xiaoying...

499
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,040
Sister...

500
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
-Sister Xiaoying...
-Master.

501
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
Master, she's coming.

502
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,600
Sister,

503
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,680
don't kill me.

504
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,440
Master,

505
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,720
she's here.

506
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,600
Everyone comes in.

507
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,280
Quick.

508
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,280
Eight copper coins.

509
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,920
Don't kill me.

510
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,040
Ghost!

511
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,600
Ghost!

512
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,320
Quick!

513
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,200
Hurry and take me out of here.

514
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,040
She's here.

515
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,960
She's here.

516
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,000
Hurry and take me out of here.

517
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,600
Who is she?

518
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,600
Who wants to kill you?

519
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,880
Sister,

520
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,200
it's all my fault.

521
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,000
I bit the hand that feeds me.

522
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,680
I knew that I'm wrong, sister.

523
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,800
Mother.

524
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,400
-Madam!
-I knew that I'm wrong, sister.

525
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,280
All of you stay here!

526
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,400
How come you're here?

527
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,120
Mother, what's wrong with you?

528
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,760
Mother.

529
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,040
The person that you mentioned,

530
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,920
is she the mother of Xu Qingmei?

531
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,280
It's her.

532
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,040
Her spirit came back
to take revenge on me.

533
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,080
There's nothing like

534
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,520
the curse of Silkworm Empress.

535
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,840
You knew since the beginning that

536
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,320
it's the spirit of Lady Xu
came back to take revenge.

537
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,080
She killed He Da and Sun Bo.

538
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,680
Then...

539
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,360
Then, it'll be our turn.

540
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,680
Sister,

541
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,360
when I see the copper coins and white cloth,

542
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,760
I knew that you've come back.

543
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,680
-Mother...
-I knew that I'm wrong.

544
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,480
Mother...

545
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,680
Please forgive me.

546
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,080
I beg you.

547
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,200
What did you do back then?

548
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,560
Master,

549
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
everything in the house belongs
to Lady Xu.

550
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
Everyone listens to her commands only.

551
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,720
She always controls me

552
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,840
because of her strong family background.

553
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,880
Everyone in the town

554
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,680
thinks that I depend on her.

555
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,400
They said that I'm able to have achievement
today because of her Liu family.

556
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,960
I...

557
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,760
No way!

558
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,200
Master,

559
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,720
how about

560
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,720
we poison her to death

561
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,240
secretly?

562
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,320
You...

563
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,720
Master gave me the poison.

564
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,320
You're so ungrateful!

565
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,120
Mother,

566
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,480
how can you murder someone?

567
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,400
Are you crazy?

568
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,280
So, the copper coins in He Da's
hands were taken away by you.

569
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,400
I don't want others
to relate it to sister.

570
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,720
The 10th of September in lunar calendar.

571
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
The three moulters of silkworm.

572
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,280
You've been thinking

573
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,480
since we walked out
from the silkworm house.

574
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,240
What is it?

575
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,280
There's something that
I still don't understand

576
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,920
about sericulture.

577
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,400
Every family in Nanxun
has their own silkworms.

578
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,560
If you don't understand,

579
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
just ask someone.

580
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,480
Food has arrived.

581
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,160
Enjoy the food.

582
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,160
Excuse me, do you have silkworms?

583
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,000
Yes.

584
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,280
They're all in the backyard.

585
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,600
They're hibernating now.

586
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,840
Is there any silkworm that
are not hibernating now?

587
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,440
It's impossible.

588
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
Our silkworms are all
four moulters' silkworms.

589
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,520
They all have the
same hibernation period.

590
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,000
Then, how about five moulters' silkworm?

591
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,200
No one has five moulters' silkworm yet.

592
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,040
I want to know,

593
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,040
can the silk spit by the
five moulters' silkworm,

594
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
carry eight copper coins?

595
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,200
Of course.

596
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,240
Please enjoy.

597
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,720
Okay.

598
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,400
Thank you.

599
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,680
Thank you.

600
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,800
We've been busy for the whole day.
Eat some noodles first.

601
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,520
Ms. Xu,

602
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,840
what is your plan in the future?

603
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
I don't know.

604
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,040
But,

605
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,000
luckily madam is taking care of me.

606
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,120
Madam has been taking care of me very well

607
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,120
in these seven years.

608
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,080
I'll treat her very well

609
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,120
and take care of her until she dies.

610
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,200
Seven years?

611
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,320
Are you sure you remember correctly?

612
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Yes, I'm sure.

613
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,480
Madam came to our house seven years ago.

614
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,040
And in the same year,

615
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,880
my mother has got the blessing
from the Silkworm Empress.

616
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,440
Her brocade weaving skills
improved tremendously.

617
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,000
And the business of Xu family

618
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,600
became good since then.

619
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,360
Qingmei.

620
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,440
Qingmei,

621
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,080
I've tidy up the backyard.

622
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,400
Let's go home.

623
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,960
Sister Xu is so pitiful.

624
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
How will she live on

625
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,720
in the future?

626
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,920
She's so weak.

627
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,000
How if she is bullied by
someone in the future?

628
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,240
It would be good if
someone can take care of her.

629
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,120
Among so many people,

630
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,240
only madam has been opposing

631
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,960
Xu Mengchang and his wife.

632
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,320
She has been trying to protect Ms. Xu.

633
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,320
And...

634
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,320
She came to Xu family
suddenly seven years ago.

635
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,800
Your father said that

636
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
he'll pass all his properties

637
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,280
to your sister.

638
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,320
Look,

639
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,080
his fingerprint is here.

640
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,760
This...

641
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,160
Is this really the
fingerprint of my father?

642
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,320
Why?

643
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,920
The properties of Xu family

644
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,000
shouldn't be given to the
daughter of that despicable woman!

645
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,880
Qingmei,

646
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,960
give me the letter.

647
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,600
Madam.

648
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,600
Madam, it's useless
that you tear that letter.

649
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
Another copy

650
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,520
has been sent to the government office.

651
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,400
Since Master Xu's fingerprint
is on the document,

652
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,240
when the government office make decision,

653
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,760
the properties will still be
given to the second young lady.

654
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,200
These...

655
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,560
These properties should
be given to Qingmei!

656
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,440
I'm useless.

657
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,840
That's why they got all the properties.

658
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,640
Madam,

659
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,520
wealth is mere worldly possessions.

660
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,960
I don't care about those.

661
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,320
I'm good

662
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,480
as long as you're by my side.

663
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,760
Qingmei,

664
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,280
I don't care about wealth too.

665
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,080
I'm just angry.

666
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,640
If you're chased out by them...

667
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,480
I'll feel very shameful
to face Lady Xu

668
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,480
when I die later.

669
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,840
Madam,

670
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,320
if my mother is around,

671
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,080
she won't care about the wealth too.

672
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,920
It's more important that you
take good care of yourself,

673
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,640
than giving me any amount of money.

674
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,680
Stop it!

675
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,471
Madam.

676
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,640
Qingmei.

677
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,680
Madam.

678
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,760
Qingmei, good that you're all right.

679
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,000
Good that you're all right.

680
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,080
I can be at ease now.

681
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,240
Madam,

682
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,440
they are the one who saved me.

686
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,560
Stand up please.

687
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,680

00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,920
Madam, why did you look for
Ms. Xu at Sun family?

693
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,520
Sun Bo has been
wanting to marry our lady.

694
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,760
I thought Qingmei was kidnapped by him.

695
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,920
Therefore, I had a look at their place.

696

I bumped into you by coincidence.

697
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,120
Ms. Xu, don't do anything stupid anymore.

madam treats me the best in this world.

Madam is the only family
member that I have now.

705
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,920
Good then.

706
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,520
