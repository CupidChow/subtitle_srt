(Episode 7)

15
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,080
Young master, this way.

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,360
This is

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,040
your study and bedroom.

18
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,960
Let's go, I'll show you.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,280
Fei Yuan.

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Where is the guest room?

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,320
The guest room...

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,520
The guest rooms are in the side and back yards.

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,240
This way.

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,600
Lead the way.

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,440
Here, young master.

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Look.

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,280
At your command,

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,560
I have converted the largest master room

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
into a guest room.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
Not bad.

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,800
Right, over here.

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,440
Young master.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
This is what you asked me
to prepare for Detective Su.

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,600
The folklore about Prince Qi.

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Young master.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Why don't you just tell him that

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,080
you are Prince Qi.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,960
It's not a good timing.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,760
All right.

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,240
I'll show you the other rooms.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Okay.

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,160
Let's go.

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,240
Such a nice house.

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,040
I thought that Brother Pei was the kind of

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,480
childe's aesthetic.

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,560
It seems that I still don't know him well.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
What kind of childe's aesthetic would that be?

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,160
It's the type of aesthetics
like Xie Beiming has.

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,680
All the houses he showed me recently
were magnificent,

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
with carved beams and painted buildings,

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,360
as if he wishes to be inlaid with gold

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
at all the corners.

53
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm just an errand boy,

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,160
I can't afford that.

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,120
From what I see, Brother Pei
could definitely afford it.

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,320
Why would you say that?

57
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,880
Here is in a downtown
with convenient transportation.

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
The land value and rent

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,280
are among the top in the capital.

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Although there is no gold
or jade inlaid in this mansion,

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,200
the design is charming and unique,

62
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,440
and the furnishings
are exquisite and meticulous.

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,240
It is by no means
ordinary residential building.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
I had a rough look at it just now.

65
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
There are about 20 servants in the mansion.

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,680
If we calculate

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,800
on the basis of one tael of silver
per person per month,

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,240
Brother Pei would have to pay

69
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,760
more than 20 tael of silver

70
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,840
as for the monthly salary.

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
Not to mention some experienced servants,

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,880
the monthly salary will be higher.

73
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,880
Brother Pei.

74
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,560
I'm afraid your identity
is not as simple as you said.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,240
This is the villa of my ancestors,

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,240
no rent is required.

77
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,200
Also, my family has been running some business

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,400
which makes a lot of money every month,

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,520
and I just rely on them,

80
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,840
otherwise I can't afford it

81
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,240
with my own salary.

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
Let's go over there.

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,760
Okay.

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,160
Here, this way.

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,280
Brother Pei, it's just an average house.

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
Actually, I can pay for it.

87
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
And you can make it more gorgeous.

88
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,120
What do you think?

89
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,600
Gorgeous?

90
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
The houses he looked for me

91
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,320
were indeed much more gorgeous.

92
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,280
Rushuang...

93
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,400
You've just arrived in the capital,

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,080
I just hope that you can live more comfortably.

95
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,640
My eyes nearly got blind

96
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,280
seeing the houses inlaid with gold and jade.

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,440
And you said it was comfortable?

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,800
What's over there?

99
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
There's a garden there.

100
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,720
I'll show you.

101
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,360
Okay.

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,040
Let's go.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Let's go.

104
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,280
This way.

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Brother Pei.

106
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,280
Are the rooms of me and Rushuang

107
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,040
close to each other?

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,160
Sorry,

109
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,560
I didn't arrange a room for you.

110
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,480
Then...

111
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,000
Didn't Fei Yuan say that
there are three guest rooms?

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
I think my house is too dull and not a match

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,680
for the childe's aesthetic standard

114
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,480
in which inlaid with gold and jade.

115
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,680
Brother Pei.

116
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,600
I have thought about it.

117
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,560
I think

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,240
my style matches this simple and elegant style

119
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,520
very well.

120
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,680
But the room is too small,

121
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm afraid it would be uncomfortable for you.

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,920
It's not small at all.

123
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,040
It's better to have a bunch of people together.

124
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,400
Am I right?

125
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,320
Look! Maple leaves.

126
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,320
Yeah.

127
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,760
The maple leaves are so beautiful.

128
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,000
Try it.

129
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,280
This brush...

130
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,680
I've seen this before

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,720
when I was working in the palace.

132
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,040
But where did you get it?

133
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,560
I got this from the Prince Qi,

134
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,680
I don't need it myself.

135
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll give it to you.

136
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,000
It's too expensive.

137
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,600
Just take it.

138
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm just a rough man,

139
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
I could carry knives and guns,

140
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,640
but not this.

141
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,440
The folklore about Prince Qi!

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,280
Brother Pei.

143
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Why do you have so much
of the folklore about Prince Qi?

144
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,040
I got them for you.

145
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,760
For me?

146
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,320
I know you like them.

147
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,520
Does that make you so happy?

148
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
Brother Pei.

149
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Come in.

150
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
Little Su.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,960
Brother Pei.

152
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,560
Thank you for arranging a room for us.

153
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,000
I know I shouldn't

154
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,280
bother you again,

155
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,080
but I think it's better

156
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,200
to make something clear.

157
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,480
Have a seat.

158
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,200
You should first have a look at this.

159
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:41,160
(Lease Agreement)

160
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,461
(Lessee: Su Ci, Lessor: Pei Zhao)

161
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,080
Lease agreement?

162
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,640
Sit down.

163
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,560
I should pay the rent

164
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,960
as I live here.

165
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,920
You can set a price.

166
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,800
No, Little Su. I just want to...

167
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,840
I can understand.

168
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,360
Which is why

169
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,680
I can't take this kindness

170
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,160
for granted,

171
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,680
and that's not a gentleman should do.

172
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,160
If I don't collect the rent,

173
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
Little Su would definitely
refuse for a long stay.

174
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,120
Okay.

175
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,000
Then five tael of silver per month.

176
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,120
Five tael of silver...

177
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,240
Then I couldn't have enough to buy the folklore.

178
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,960
But it's reasonable,

179
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,840
it's worth the price.

180
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
We made a deal.

181
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,200
I'll add it in the agreement later.

182
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,600
Besides that...

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,760
Given to our circumstance,

184
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,520
I also drafted additional terms.

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,920
Here they are.

186
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,960
Keep it a secret for the lessee,

187
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,600
and shall not use it to blackmail...

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,760
Physical contact?

189
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,800
And other non-compliance actions.

190
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,200
During the contract period,

191
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,360
the same-sex intercourse
must be strictly observed.

192
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,320
If there is any violation,

193
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,400
the lessee has the right
to demand compensation,

194
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
the compensation details are as follows.

195
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,200
Here.

196
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,600
If there is a clear intention of verbal offense

197
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,920
or physical contact,

198
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
a fine of one tael,

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,760
if committed again, then...

200
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,240
Wait.

201
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,480
I feel that your contract is just for

202
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,280
binding me.

203
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
In return,

204
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,680
under the reasonable

205
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,760
and ethical circumstances,

206
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
I will also provide assistance

207
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,080
such as investigating cases.

208
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,240
It sounds like you're going to help me

209
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,960
deal with my affairs after an accident.

210
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,960
No.

211
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
That's not what I mean.

212
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,640
I have to think about it.

213
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Since the owner doesn't agree,

214
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,600
I'll move out tomorrow.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,960
The room rate tonight,

216
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,920
just calculate
based on the market price of the inn.

217
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,600
Thank you, Brother Pei.

218
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,120
Wait, Little Su.

219
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,120
Okay, I'll sign it.

220
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,400
It's effective now, here you go.

221
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going back now.

222
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,960
Okay.

223
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,840
Goodbye.

224
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm such a pity landlord.

225
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
Lease agreement?

226
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,360
Young master, so mean of you.

227
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,000
This...

228
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,040
Ain't both of you are friends?

229
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
How could you collect the rental fees?

230
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,960
Little Su insists.

231
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,120
He's such a principled person.

232
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Five tael?

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
Young master, you're
such a blackhearted landlord.

234
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,120
What...

235
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,240
Detective Su's monthly salary
was only seven tael,

236
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,280
and you collect five tael from her?

237
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,960
This...

238
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,040
How do you want Detective Su to live?

239
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,800
What?

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,480
Little Su's monthly salary was only seven tael?

241
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,800
I heard it from Detective Su
last time when we chatted.

242
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,400
It seems that I should find a way

243
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
to raise the salary of Mingjing Office.

244
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:36,336
(Lessee: Su Ci, Lessor: Pei Zhao)

245
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
The legal codes of Liang
are divided into six parts.

246
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,200
They are theft and robbery law,
treason law, prisoner law,

247
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,120
law of arrest, miscellaneous law,
and criminal law.

248
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,080
The basic content is roughly
divided into three parts.

249
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
The first part is...

250
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
The most beautiful moment...

251
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,000
Keep it.

252
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Keep it.

253
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,480
Don't you have breakfast
with the homeowner?

254
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,400
I still have unfinished tasks
in Mingjing office,

255
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm not going to eat.

256
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,720
Brother Pei, do as you wish.

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No physical contact.

258
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,120
We've already written it in the contract,

259
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,080
the one who breaks the rules
will be fined one tael of silver.

260
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,560
Does it count?

261
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,680
Young master.

262
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,920
What are you guys talking about?

263
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,240
The young officer is trying hard

264
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,320
to make me reduce my rent.

265
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,440
Yes, you should.

266
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,480
One more tael of silver
will be added for verbal teasing.

267
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,680
Ain't we are friends?

268
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,520
Since we are friends,

269
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
why can't we do it

270
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
like before?

271
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
Before?

272
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,560
Before?

273
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,560
Little Su.

274
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,480
Don't you want the pieces of silver?

275
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Weird, so weird.

276
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

277
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,600
-This way, please.
-Welcome.

278
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,800
-Congratulations.
-Welcome.

279
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,520
Childe, this way please.

280
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,640
-Welcome.
-This way, please.

281
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,240
Your Highness.

282
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,400
(Fu Mansion)

283
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,360
Officer Fu.

284
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,720
It's the greatest honor
for Your Highness's presence.

285
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,200
Officer Fu, you're welcome.

286
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,200
Ziyou and I are like brothers,

287
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,480
of course I have to be here

288
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,760
to celebrate his big day.

289
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,880
Where is the groom?

290
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,640
Ziyou?

291
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,480
He went out early in the morning
to pick up the bride.

292
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,960
I can tell that he was in a hurry.

293
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,880
Getting married is a significant event in life,

294
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,960
the etiquette can't be neglected.

295
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,520
Your Highness, please.

296
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Right, did Zizhuo go with him?

297
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm so busy

298
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,160
that I've forgotten about him.

299
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,440
Probably.

300
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,560
Officer Su.

301
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,600
Officer Shen.

302
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,200
I've heard Ministry of Personnel
just informed us

303
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,320
we're going to have a pay raise.

304
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,600
Really?

305
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,560
Why so sudden?

306
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,160
Are you serious?

307
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,160
Our daily work is so risky,

308
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,160
we deserved a raise long ago.

309
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,280
You are right.

310
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,920
Great, I can buy the folklore.

311
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,920
Your Highness, please.

312
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,560
Young master,

313
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,920
why hasn't the bride come yet?

314
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,320
Welcoming the bride would not be easy.

315
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,160
Everyone makes it difficult for the groom,

316
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,800
so that they can ask for more money.

317
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,320
Master!

318
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,800
Master, something bad happened.

319
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,840
Su Ci.

320
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,400
(Case File)
A body was found under the city walls this morning.

321
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,360
It has been proved to be
the daughter of the Du family.

322
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,920
The one going to marry

323
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,800
Commander Fu today?

324
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,640
This case involves the courtiers,

325
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,720
Mayor of Capital City
has transferred the case to us.

326
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,600
You are now in charge of this.

327
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,320
Yes, My Lord.

328
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,080
I've recorded all the evidence

329
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,160
and the process of handling the case

330
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,720
in this booklet.

331
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,640
Keep it.

332
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,680
Brother Su, are you heading to the crime scene?

333
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,040
Why are you here?

334
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,280
I can't go into the Mingjing Office.

335
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,560
So I can only wait here.

336
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,000
Rushuang, I'm in a hurry.

337
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,840
I should go now.

338
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,840
I know.

339
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
(Mingjing Office)
I'm here to help you.

340
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,120
I have all the autopsy tools ready.

341
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,320
Miss Du died miserably.

342
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,240
All right, stop looking.

343
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,320
Never thought she would leave

344
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,400
at such a young age.

345
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,280
Stop gather around. Step out of the way.

346
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,240
Detective Su.

347
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,360
Could it be that ghost bride?
She has come back to haunt.

348
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,960
Stop it. It's so creepy.

349
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Miss Du

350
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,360
looks so horrible.

351
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,560
Yeah, so bad.

352
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,920
Joint dislocation,

353
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,200
obvious fracture of the scapula,

354
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,320
fatal injury is the neck fracture,

355
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
showing death form of
falling from high altitude.

356
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Is this Su Ci, Detective Su?

357
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,800
Indeed, never heard of him?

358
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,840
He is the great detective Su Ci.

359
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,079
It's true that she jumped down.

360
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,359
Brother Su, where are we going now?

361
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,240
Rushuang, don't follow me.

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,640
Let me follow you.

363
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,839
I promise not to make trouble.

364
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,560
You're not a member of the government,

365
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,880
you will be criticized for this.

366
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
But...

367
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,200
I have followed you

368
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
since we were investigating
a case in Qingshui County.

369
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,320
But this case involves
the daughter of a courtier,

370
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
it's not appropriate.

371
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,920
You should go back.

372
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,000
Then...

373
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,120
Then...

374
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,480
Then...

375
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,280
Then I should just go back.

376
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,840
I'll go back.

377
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,560
Be careful on your way home.

378
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,160
The government is gathering
information from witnesses.

379
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
Whoever saw the girl

380
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,240
in the portrait last night,

381
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,600
with any clues

382
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,120
can report to the government,

383
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,760
and will be rewarded once verified.

384
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,720
Rumors say that it was Miss Du who found dead.

385
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,760
A wedding that became a funeral.

386
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,120
(Collecting Witness Clue)
She is the apple of Master Du's eye,

387
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,880
getting married to the
eldest son of the Fu family,

388
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,680
why did she die?

389
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,120
What do you mean by this?

390
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,680
The Mingjing Office
would like to ask you a few questions.

391
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,920
What questions?

392
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,800
Did you meet Miss Du yesterday?

393
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,800
Miss Du?

394
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,920
Do you mean my sister-in-law?

395
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,000
She was dead.

396
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,600
Someone had witnessed
two of you were together last night,

397
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,480
so we would like to know
what actually happened last night.

398
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,160
What? Who have died?

399
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,080
Ms. Du Lan.

400
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,840
She was found dead under the city walls.

401
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,320
Xiao Lan?

402
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,600
The young lady got along better

403
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,640
with the second son of the Fu family
since she was a child.

404
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,480
I think they've agreed on eloping

405
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,560
last night.

406
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Go ahead.

407
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,560
But the young lady came back

408
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,200
right after they met,

409
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
and said

410
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,640
she had made up her mind.

411
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,640
Made up her mind?

412
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,160
What was that about?

413
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,040
She'd decided to get married.

414
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,520
She said that
the elder son of the Fu family is nice.

415
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
She would live a life

416
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,800
for the reputation of the two families.

417
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,000
Did anything else happen last night?

418
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,960
No.

419
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,600
I didn't leave until I had served
the young lady to sleep.

420
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,560
No one else saw your young lady

421
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,920
when she went out in the middle of the night?

422
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,520
Does this baggage belong to your young lady?

423
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,760
Can I open it?

424
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Did she bring this yesterday when she went out?

425
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,240
No, she didn't.

426
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,320
Ms. Xiao Qing, think carefully.

427
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
What's unusual about your young lady

428
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
besides seeing the second son of the Fu family?

429
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,440
Unusual?

430
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,360
Yeah.

431
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,440
Like

432
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,280
some unusual acts.

433
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,560
You can tell me.

434
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,240
My young lady...

435
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,880
My young lady would hear
the raindrops for no reason.

436
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,120
Raindrops?

437
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,880
That day she looked out of the window in a daze,

438
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,720
and suddenly asked me
to listen to the rain with her,

439
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,120
saying that

440
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,560
the sound of rain was good.

441
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
But when I looked out the window,

442
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,720
it wasn't raining.

443
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,760
Did she act like this before?

444
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Never before.

445
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
Listen to the raindrops on a sunny day,

446
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,040
that was really weird.

447
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,560
Detective Su.

448
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,040
We've caught Fu Zizhuo.

449
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,040
Detective Su,

450
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,960
he hadn't sobered up

451
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
when he was caught,

452
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,400
and he refused to say a word.

453
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,320
Okay.

454
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,080
-Little Su.
-We'll go now.

455
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay.

456
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,360
Brother Pei.

457
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,760
I've heard about it.

458
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,920
So I came to you

459
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,520
and wanted to help you with the case.

460
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,520
We don't need your help.

461
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,560
Little Su.

462
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,920
The Fu brothers are my friends,

463
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,960
I should do something for them.

464
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,920
I hope you can understand.

465
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,480
All right, you may follow us.

466
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,360
We've caught

467
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,840
the second son of the Fu family.

468
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,240
What?

469
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,200
Fu Zizhuo is not a prisoner,

470
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,520
why did you lock him up?

471
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,400
I guess you don't know that

472
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,440
he has gone mad

473
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,520
when hearing about the death of Miss Du,

474
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,880
and none of us could catch him.

475
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,680
It was hard to get him here.

476
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
After bringing him back,

477
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,800
he didn't say a word

478
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,960
like he have lost his soul.

479
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,080
We had no choice

480
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,520
but to lock him up.

481
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,440
This way, please.

482
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,200
He must be emotionally unstable

483
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,880
after the tragedy,

484
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,400
so let me talk to him first.

485
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Okay.

486
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,160
Zizhuo.

487
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,000
Your Highness.

488
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,120
They said Xiao Lan was dead.

489
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,040
Is it true?

490
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,600
It's true.

491
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
How could it be?

492
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,760
How would she...

493
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,520
Zizhuo, listen to me.

494
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,520
Detective Su
from the Mingjing Office investigates it.

495
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,680
She is fair and intelligent,

496
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,200
she can definitely find out the truth

497
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,320
and won't let Miss Du died for nothing.

498
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,440
You must cooperate with her.

499
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,160
Make sure you tell her everything you know.

500
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,880
Okay.

501
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,040
Detective Su doesn't know my identity yet,

502
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,680
so...

503
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,680
Detective Su, you may come in now.

504
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,680
Master Fu, I'm Su Ci from Mingjing Office.

505
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,000
Detective Su, please find out the truth.

506
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,920
That's what I should do.

507
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,760
Master Fu, I hope you
don't hide anything from me.

508
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
For the sake of Xiao Lan,

509
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,400
I will tell everything I know.

510
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
You are accused of meeting with Miss Du

511
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,440
outside the capital gate last night.

512
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,840
Is that real?

513
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,680
Yes.

514
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,360
Why did you meet each other?

515
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,600
Xiao Lan and I promised each other

516
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,160
to elope to the borders,

517
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,880
and stay together anonymously.

518
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,600
Xiao Lan?

519
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,160
I've been worried that you won't come.

520
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,400
The carriage is just
outside the capital, let's go.

521
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
No, Zizhuo.

522
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,760
I can't go.

523
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,320
Neither can you.

524
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,280
Xiao Lan, what's wrong?

525
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,920
I'm here

526
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,320
to tell you that

527
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,560
we're done.

528
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,600
No.

529
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Why?

530
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,920
Didn't we agree to leave together?

531
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,400
If we leave,

532
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,240
we'll be unfaithful to our elder brother

533
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,960
and unfilial to our parents.

534
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,360
Even if we live on the borders,

535
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,040
we won't feel at ease.

536
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,240
I don't want to make
the elders of the two families

537
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,080
become the laughing stock of the capital

538
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,040
because of us.

539
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,480
Have you made up your mind?

540
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,200
It's our fate.

541
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,000
I sent Xiao Lan back to Du Mansion,

542
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,240
then I went to buy some drink.

543
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480
Then I left the capital.

544
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,960
You were out of the capital last night?

545
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,120
Yeah.

546
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
I was drunk.

547
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,160
I returned to the capital after dawn.

548
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,560
Then I found a tavern and continued to drink.

549
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,320
Why were you out of the capital?

550
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,640
Xiao Lan and elder brother were going to marry,

551
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,920
I didn't know how to face them.

552
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,200
I just wanted to find a place and hide up.

553
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,960
Does anyone can be your alibi?

554
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,400
Why would you ask me that?

555
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,680
Zizhuo.

556
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
At present,

557
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,680
your suspicion is indeed the biggest.

558
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,560
You suspect me?

559
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
It's impossible that I would kill Xiao Lan.

560
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,840
Young master, please calm down.

561
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,880
As far as the situation is concerned,

562
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,320
you seem to have the intention to do so.

563
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,600
So,

564
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,560
please think carefully.

565
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,520
Does anyone can be your alibi

566
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,600
when you left the capital?

567
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,680
I got drunk and went out of the capital,

568
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,680
continued to drink,

569
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,920
and then I fell asleep.

570
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,800
Have you returned on half way?

571
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,280
No.

572
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,280
Were you wearing the same clothes

573
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,720
since last night?

574
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,040
Can you take them off and let me have a look?

575
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,040
We may find traces on his clothes,

576
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,120
while he was outside the capital,

577
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,160
to prove his innocence.

578
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
I know him well.

579
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,200
Even if elopement fails,

580
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,400
he will not kill.

581
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,960
We have to find the evidence

582
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,320
to prove his innocence.

583
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,320
The death of Miss Du

584
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,920
can only reveal

585
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,160
until we find the truth.

586
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,360
Since he said that

587
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,720
he left the capital in the middle of the night,

588
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,080
then I'll go

589
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
to restore the scene tonight.

590
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I'll go with you.

591
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,920
I don't feel safe
if letting you handle the case alone

592
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,000
late at night.

593
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,240
Besides,

594
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,360
I have to do my part

595
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
as a friend.

596
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,920
All right.

597
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,080
For friends.

598
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,080
Let's go.

599
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,280
Right,

600
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
you should go back first and wait for me.

601
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,560
I have another place to go.

602
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Mansion of Fu?

603
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,920
I used to think that

604
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,920
you're the most dull to emotions,

605
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,880
but I didn't expect that

606
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,200
you're the most attentive in this case.

607
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,160
Put heart to heart,

608
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,200
the sudden loss of the beloved,

609
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,640
Ziyou is the most innocent

610
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,520
and painful person.

611
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,280
You should comfort him.

612
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,600
Ziyou.

613
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,680
Your Highness.

614
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,920
Why didn't I get apprised?

615
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,520
Have a seat.

616
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,120
I'm just here to pay you a visit.

617
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
I asked them to do so,

618
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,080
so as not to disturb others.

619
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,120
Thank you for your concern.

620
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,480
Have a seat.

621
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,920
I didn't get to show her

622
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,320
the painting.

623
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,200
Ziyou.

624
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,920
I've met Zizhuo.

625
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,840
Actually, Zizhuo...

626
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,000
I already know.

627
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,840
You knew it?

628
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,400
Xiao Lan and I are engaged.

629
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,640
But in fact, Zizhuo has been closer to her

630
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,720
than I since childhood.

631
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,000
Two days ago,

632
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,000
I accidentally saw a letter of Zizhuo,

633
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,560
in which he said that

634
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,960
he was willing to give up everything

635
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,920
and leave the capital with Xiao Lan.

636
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,680
You knew they were about to elope?

637
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,520
Yeah.

638
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
And you...

639
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,520
Didn't stop them?

640
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,800
One is my brother,

641
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,600
and the other is my lover.

642
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,240
If Xiao Lan chose to go with Zizhuo,

643
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,080
I would be willing to help her.

644
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
But if Xiao Lan chose to stay,

645
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,400
I'd be good to her for the rest of my life

646
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,160
and prove that she had made a right decision.

647
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
But who knows...

648
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,480
Ziyou.

649
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,040
Do you think Zizhuo would kill people?

650
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,520
I don't know.

651
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,520
The truth is all I want.

652
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,360
If she killed herself,

653
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,040
I want to know the reason.

654
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,720
But if it's a homicide,

655
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,160
I'll let the killer pay for it.

656
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,440
Goodbye, Prince Qi.

657
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,040
Now I realize that if you like someone,

658
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,280
you give

659
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,480
without expecting anything in return.

660
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,120
Love should be selfless,

661
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,560
not selfish.

662
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,960
Little Su.

663
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,240
No matter what you choose,

664
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,480
I'll be there to protect you.

665
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,800
Little Su.

666
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,240
Brother Pei.

667
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,880
I was going to read while waiting for you,

668
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
but I fell asleep.

669
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,200
That's okay.

670
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,440
You can rest for a while

671
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,360
if you're tired.

672
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,080
No, I've had enough sleep.

673
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,400
What time is it now?

674
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,200
Just after 7 p.m..

675
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,960
Let's move now before it's too late.

676
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,920
Okay.

677
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,760
Zizhuo leaves the city from here.

678
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,520
Where would he head for next?

679
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,880
Many dyeing workshops
are on the west of capital suburb,

680
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,960
people who passing by
will leave some traces of dye

681
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,360
on the clothes and shoes.

682
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,800
Look here.

683
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,080
I guess

684
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,000
he must've been heading to the west.

685
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,240
What now? Where are we going?

686
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Fu Zizhuo said he had walked for a while,

687
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,040
then stopped to drink

688
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,680
and fell asleep.

689
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,680
Look.

690
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,200
The green marks on this

691
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,320
should be the juice from the grass,

692
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,520
and the wrinkle on his back

693
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,760
should be left after
the clothes were wet with dew

694
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,440
and dried.

695
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
So now

696
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,680
we should look for a grassy area

697
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
and there should be a big tree next to it.

698
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Look here.

699
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,880
This is...

700
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,520
Bird's dropping?

701
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,920
He should have been lying down,

702
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,800
the bird droppings on his body,

703
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,320
then he wiped it with his hands.

704
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,680
Let's go over there.

705
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,960
Look at this.

706
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,159
This wine jar belonged to Zizhuo?

707
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,760
Probably.

708
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,159
It means that

709
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,800
Zizhuo was outside the capital last night.

710
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,560
But it's just the route we speculated.

711
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,000
Give me the clothes.

712
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,920
I mean the evidence.

713
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,239
I want to see

714
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,040
if there are any other clues.

715
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,040
Thank you.

716
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,440
Why you sigh?

717
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
I'm just lamenting that

718
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,960
love doesn't always end well.

719
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,639
Little Su.

720
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,840
Miss Du's death would be a painful

721
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,120
and a lifelong grief for Zizhuo.

722
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,160
Although

723
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,160
I can't help him out,

724
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,920
I hope I'm able to find out the truth.

725
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,120
I'll be with you.

726
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,360
Little Su, thank you.

727
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,940
From now on, we could enjoy the food

728
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,620
made by Little Fei Yuan as we live together.

729
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,700
Look, this is the kitchen.

730
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,020
Brother Pei, you have a bed in the kitchen?

731
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,440
Fei Yuan, why didn't anyone tell me that

732
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,460
the kitchen had moved to another place?

733
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,300
I haven't had the chance to tell you...

734
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,440
Young master.

735
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,600
Are you named...

736
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,960
Xiao Yao?

737
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,360
Young Master, my name is Xiao Xue.

738
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,120
From now on, you will be called Xiao Yao.

739
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,840
All right.

740
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,840
Let's go. Let's move to the backyard.

741
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,360
Brother Pei.

742
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,440
You recognize neither the people nor the house.

743
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,080
Is this your house for real?

744
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,160
I don't pay much attention to them.

745
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,320
There are too many maids here,

746
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,640
it's normal to remember wrongly.

747
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,440
No, there are just two or three women here.

748
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,960
Look, the rest are all men.

749
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,160
All right.

750
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,360
Go and see the rooms.

751
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,720
Let's go and see the rooms!

752
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,800
I've told you to remember the people well.

753
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,200
