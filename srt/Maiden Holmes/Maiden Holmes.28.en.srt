(Episode 28)

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,160
But my adoptive father treats me well.

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Everything I have is given by him.

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,360
I can't betray him too.

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,520
Why is it a betrayal?

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
If his actions are righteous,

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
then I have nothing to say.

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,920
But he persecuted

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,960
the loyals

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
all for himself.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,240
Aren't you distorting the truth

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,400
if you continue to be loyal to him?

26
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
But

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,200
he's my adoptive father after all.

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,440
I can't treat my adoptive father...

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,400
Why did you drink so much

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
if he really cares for you?

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Tell me.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,880
Are you going to watch him

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
falling down into the abyss?

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,160
Wouldn't it be better

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,800
if you could stop him

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,080
and get him back on the right track?

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,920
Can I really do that?

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,040
At that time,

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
you don't have to push
Rushuang away anymore

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
in order to protect her.

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,360
Brother Pei.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
What should I do?

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,600
Sir, sorry to keep you waiting.

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,720
It's you.

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
Do you see this bottle of powder?

46
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,960
With it,

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,240
your pretty little face

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,480
will be destroyed.

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,400
I can let you go

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,080
unless you answer my questions.

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,160
Does Xie Beiming really like you?

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,200
You'd better think it through.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,400
Miss.

54
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,240
Please spare me.

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
What is the relationship
between you and Xie Beiming?

56
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,480
It was Mr. Xie

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
who gave me a sum of money

58
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
to put on an act with him.

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,920
Mr. Xie.

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,560
Thank you for the rouge.

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,560
Don't come over.

62
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,400
Just stand right there.

63
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,560
I don't feel comfortable.

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,240
Here's the upfront payment.

65
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,120
I'll pay off the balance when it's done.

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,480
It's okay with me

67
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,760
to put on an act

68
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
making Ms. Rushuang leave you.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,400
But

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
why are you doing this?

71
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,800
It's none of your business.

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,720
Here are the conditions.

73
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
First,

74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,400
you can't tell Rushuang about our deal.

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
Second, you can't touch me.

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,000
Rushuang is the only one for me.

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
Don't try to seduce me.

78
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,360
Third,

79
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,320
don't be too domineering
in front of Rushuang.

80
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
If she gets too pissed off,

81
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
I won't pay you.

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Do you really mean to break up?

83
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,000
I...

84
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
It's none of your business.

85
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,720
Please leave the lip print

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
right over here.

87
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,800
Hold on.

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,040
Give me the rouge.

89
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll do it myself.

90
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,080
He really applied the rouge?

91
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,520
He said

92
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,040
that when it's done

93
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,800
he'd redeem me.

94
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,520
Listen up.

95
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,840
From today onwards,

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
you can't contact with him anymore.

97
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,880
If he comes to see you,
you can't meet him.

98
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,320
It

99
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
isn't a good idea.

100
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,920
I'll still ask him to pay you.

101
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,480
You can redeem yourself.

102
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,480
Really?

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,480
I'm a woman of my word.

104
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,400
All right.

105
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,960
If Mr. Xie comes here again,

106
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,680
I'll get people to kick him out.

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,080
Thank you.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
This is for you.

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,640
Why would I want the poison powder?

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,880
I was just pulling your leg.

111
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,800
This is my exclusive homemade powder.

112
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,680
With it,

113
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,400
your skin will be more
delicate than that of children.

114
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,680
Take it as a gift.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,320
Untie me before you leave.

116
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,360
You deserve it.

117
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,920
That's for your holding
Xie Beiming's hand.

118
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,240
Ming.

119
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
You're here.

120
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,920
Father.

121
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,120
Ming.

122
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,840
Are you here to tell me

123
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,560
about Xiao Yanzhi?

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,880
Yes.

125
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,880
Xiao Yanzhi and Su Ci

126
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,520
went to Nanxun Town.

127
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,640
Why did they go there?

128
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,080
They found the person

129
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,880
who applied poison
on the Bai Liang brocade

130
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,680
and found out that you

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,920
were the culprit.

132
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,880
Who stitched me up?

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
Where's it?

134
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,600
Gone missing.

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,160
Xiao Yanzhi must have tucked away.

136
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,960
Very well, Xiao Yanzhi.

137
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,000
If you don't want to
be a carefree prince,

138
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,280
and work to put me to death,

139
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,840
then don't blame me

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,920
for pulling the rug
from under your feet.

141
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
Father.

142
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,000
Well,

143
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,880
what are you going to do?

144
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Ming.

145
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
You should return first.

146
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,560
If he's up to anything,

147
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,280
report to me at once.

148
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Yes.

149
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
Go on.

150
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,360
My Lord.

151
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,030
Should we send someone
to kill the witness?

152
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,200
No.

153
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,910
Xiao Yanzhi found the witness

154
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,120
of poisoning the Bai Liang brocade.

155
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,600
He intends nothing but

156
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,480
to reverse the verdict of the
late emperor's poisoning case.

157
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
Since you're plotting against me,

158
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,280
don't blame me for making things ugly.

159
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,120
It's time

160
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,120
to get back the things
that should belong to me.

161
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,280
My Lord.

162
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you have any plans?

163
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,160
Xiao Yanzhi

164
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,960
is still too young.

165
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,880
He thought he could bring me down

166
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
with some witness or evidence.

167
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,360
He doesn't even know

168
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,440
that I already had something crucial

169
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,480
that could bring about his demise.

170
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
I've protected that person for so long.

171
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,960
It's about time for him
to return the favour now.

172
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,879
(Pei Mansion)

173
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
It's all done.

174
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
If there's nothing else,

175
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,720
I'll get going then.

176
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,960
Brother Xie.

177
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,160
Yesterday, Rushuang...

178
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,080
Brother Pei.

179
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,400
I have decided.

180
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,720
I can't let Rushuang

181
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,880
take the risk with me.

182
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,360
But have you thought about it?

183
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Actually,

184
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,080
women are stronger than us at times.

185
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,600
Look at Little Su.

186
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,480
Her clan was slaughtered
when she's little.

187
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
But she's so strong

188
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,480
and survived it.

189
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,080
She even disguised herself as a man

190
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,280
and entered Mingjing Office
to investigate the case.

191
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
She is more resilient

192
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,440
than many men.

193
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Brother Su is indeed very admirable.

194
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
But Rushuang is different.

195
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,720
She's the same.

196
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,880
She's a girl

197
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
who makes a living alone in jianghu.

198
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,280
She must have encountered many dangers.

199
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,880
But look at her.

200
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,040
She still goes her own way.

201
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,440
Still as candid and straightforward.

202
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
So

203
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
don't simply decide for her.

204
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,560
Xie Beiming.

205
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,880
Where are you going?

206
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,280
It's you.

207
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,800
Stop pretending not to see me.

208
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
I know you saw me.

209
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,760
I have things to do.

210
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,240
Ms. Rushuang.

211
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,920
Please behave with dignity.

212
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,880
Tell me why you broke up with me.

213
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,160
Then, I'll let you go.

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,360
Didn't you see it yourself?

215
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
I fell in love with someone else.

216
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,520
It's fine.

217
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
You like someone else, and I like you.

218
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
Wenwen and I are about to get married.

219
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,240
Stop pestering me.

220
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,720
Rushuang, you...

221
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
I've kissed you.

222
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,360
You're mine now.

223
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,040
Don't wipe it off.

224
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,640
You like this colour, don't you?

225
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,880
I forgot to tell you.

226
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,320
I've added poison to the rouge.

227
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,840
The colour will stick without antidote.

228
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
If you don't feel embarrassed,

229
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,840
you can go flirting with it.

230
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,720
Whatever girls you find,

231
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,440
I'll get rid of them all.

232
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,400
Your Majesty.

233
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,120
Rise.

234
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,960
Uncle.

235
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,360
Your Majesty.

236
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,960
May I know the reason
for asking me here?

237
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Mother's birthday is around the corner.

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,320
We were discussing

239
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,560
to let you plan the birthday
banquet for mother.

240
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm used to being idle.

241
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm afraid such significant task

242
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,360
is beyond my capability.

243
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
Her Highness regards

244
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,240
and treats you like her own son.

245
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,320
No mothers will pick
on their own children.

246
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
Yanzhi, don't decline it.

247
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,640
I believe

248
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,360
you can make it.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If so, I shall do it then.

250
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,960
Your Highness.

251
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,160
Prince Yun has started making a move.

252
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,040
If so, we'll beat him at his own game.

253
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Yes.

254
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,850
(Mingjing Office)

255
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,560
Luo Xin.

256
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,320
My Lord.

257
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,320
You've inspected the corpse
in the suburb.

258
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,400
How was it?

259
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,680
The victim was stabbed
to death with a sharp blade.

260
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
No blood splatter around the body.

261
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,080
There were only marks
of dragging the body.

262
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,000
It can be concluded

263
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,360
that the location of body

264
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,880
isn't the primary crime scene.

265
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,680
Traces of rouge were found

266
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,440
in the victim's fingernails
and on the face.

267
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,040
I suspect that the victim

268
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,800
had a struggle with a woman
before his death.

269
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,800
Also,

270
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,240
we've found a jade
pendant on the victim.

271
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,760
Judging by its fineness and value,

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,560
it's probably not his belonging.

273
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,800
The identity of the victim
has not yet been confirmed.

274
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,720
It's in the midst of investigation.

275
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,640
Do it quick.

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,520
Yes.

277
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,000
The Empress Dowager's
birthday banquet is coming.

278
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
Make sure it's absolutely
safe in the capital.

279
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,800
What matters now is solving the case.

280
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
If you don't have enough man,

281
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,320
you can get help from your colleagues.

282
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,200

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,680
We could finally buy it
after waiting so long.

344
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Yeah.

345
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Detective Su.

346
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,680
Here's your rouge.

347
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,760
Thank you.

348
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,440
Thank you.

349
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,320
Come here next time.

350
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,480
Detective Su.

351
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,320
Sister Song.

352
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,720
What's wrong with your neck?

353
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,560
Nothing.

354
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,920
I have some allergies lately.

355
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,760
I accidentally scratched it.

356
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
What brings you here today?

357
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,040
Would you like to take a look inside?

358
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
I have new varieties of rouge.

359
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Let me show you.

360
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,560
Today, Mingjing Office received a report

361
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
that a body was found
in the capital suburb.

362
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,320
The victim is Tian Yong.

363
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,160
(Mansion of Prince Qi)

364
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,920
This is a list of all the fireworks
at the banquet

365
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,000
waiting for your check.

366
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,920
How's the production going?

367
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,760
Most work is done.

368
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,600
The ones with greater difficulty,

369
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,840
which are Gorgeous Peony and Auspicious,
are still in progress.

370
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,960
Everyone has been working continuously
in the past few months.

371
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,040
It's been very tough.

372
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,520
After the birthday banquet,

373
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,160
I'll reward all of them.

374
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

375
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,720
Mr. Zhang.

376
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,840
I would like to custom fireworks.

377
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,640
I wonder if it's too late.

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,160
Just give the order, Your Highness.

379
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,960
(Longing for you)

380
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,760
What do you think?

381
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
Can you do it?

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,760
No problem. Your Highness.

383
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,120
I shall take my leave.

384
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,920
Xiwen.

385
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,920
You and Commander Fu
must keep an eye on the guards

386
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,960
for the Empress Dowager's
birthday banquet.

387
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,120
Don't worry, Your Highness.

388
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,080
There are too many things to do.

389
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,880
If I don't have spare time for you,

390
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,160
I'll get Liu Yu help you with it, okay?

391
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,200
Just do as you say.

392
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,360
Yes.

393
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,080
Your Highness, you...

394
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,960
Take care of yourself.

395
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,200
Xiwen.

396
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
What's wrong with you?

397
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,360
I just think

398
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,000
you always shoulder everything yourself.

399
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,960
It's just too hard.

400
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,360
Don't worry. I'm fine.

401
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,000
You, on the other hand

402
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,480
seem hesitant to speak lately.

403
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Is anything happened?

404
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,280
Officer Jiang.

405
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
I'm Luo Xin of Mingjing Office.

406
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,240
I would like to seek your assistance

407
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,040
with a murder case.

408
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
What case is that?

409
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,000
A craftsman named Tian Yong

410
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,680
died on the outskirts
a few days ago.

411
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,480
There is evidence that linked you
to his death.

412
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,560
I didn't kill anyone.

413
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,840
Officer Jiang.

414
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,640
(Wen)
You should recognise the word

415
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,920
on this jade pendant.

416
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,400
Murder? That's a serious crime.

417
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,240
Why would your jade pendant
be found on the victim?

418
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
Please come with us and explain it.

419
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,640
With just a jade pendant?

420
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,040
Just a routine questioning.

421
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,600
Please cooperate with us.

422
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They can't frame the innocent
or spare the bad guy.

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,600
That's right.

424
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,880
You're Prince Qi's man.

425
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,760
If you make a scene here,

426
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,240
you'll embarrass His Highness.

427
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,480
I'm sure you wouldn't want that.

428
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,720
Prince Qi's man?

429
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,720
Prince Qi's man?

430
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,360
That's right. Why would he be arrested?

431
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,480
What's going on?

432
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,440
I don't know.

433
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,800
Will Prince Qi be implicated?

434
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,920
All right.

435
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,240
I'll come with you.

436
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,040
I believe you will find out the truth.

437
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,480
This way.

438
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,320
Young Master.

439
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,240
Young Master.

440
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,120
Sister Su is here
and would like to see you.

441
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,120
Why would she come here?

442
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,760
Perhaps, she misses you

443
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,240
and can't wait to see you.

444
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,920
Don't spew nonsense.

445
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,880
Get some tea here.

446
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,920
All right.

447
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,160
What brings you here?

448
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,600
Are you missing me?

449
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm not here to see you.

450
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,800
Is Brother Jiang here?

451
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,720
Xiwen? He's just left.

452
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,840
What's the matter?

453
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,520
He's linked to a murder case.

454
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,920
Bad news.

455
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,120
Young Master.

456
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,800
Brother Jiang has been taken in
by Mingjing Office.

457
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,080
What?

458
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,120
Your Highness.

459
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,080
Rise.

460
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,560
Take me to see Xiwen.

461
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,760
Forgive me, Your Highness.

462
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,720
I can't take you to see the suspect.

463
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,640
Who are you calling a suspect?

464
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Brother Jiang will never kill anyone!

465
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,840
Don't you say that about him!

466
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,400
Fei Yuan, watch yourself.

467
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,360
Officer Liu.

468
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,200
Since Xiwen is only a suspect
and has not been convicted,

469
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,200
can I still meet him?

470
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,240
Your Highness.

471
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,680
We've got strict regulations here.

472
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,200
No one can see the suspect
before the case is solved.

473
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,120
Besides, given your relationship
with Officer Jiang,

474
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,680
you shouldn't see him now.

475
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,000
Why?

476
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,480
If Your Highness intervened now,

477
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
even if he's innocent,

478
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,480
everyone would think

479
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,320
that Your Highness
covered up for your man.

480
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,400
Then, he'd never
get rid of suspicion.

481
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,960
For his sake,

482
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,320
Your Highness shouldn't meet him now.

483
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,440
So

484
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,720
unless the case is solved,

485
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,400
I can't meet Xiwen?

486
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,920
I hope Your Highness can understand us.

487
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,520
If so, please look out for Xiwen.

488
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,200
I'll do my best.

489
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,680
Fei Yuan, let's go.

490
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,080
Jiang Xiwen.

491
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,760
Such a coincidence.

492
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,040
Things are working in my favour.

493
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,120
My Lord.

494
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,960
I have a plan.

495
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,240
You are...

496
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,800
Li Yu?

497
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,120
Officer Jiang,
you really have a good memory.

498
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
We merely had a brief encounter

499
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,600
at Princess Yunchuan's banquet.

500
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,360
Yet, you still could recognise me.

501
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,040
Why are you here?

502
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
It looks like

503
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,040
the only person you want to meet
is Prince Qi.

504
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,320
Or is it Song Yao?

505
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

506
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,600
I wonder

507
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,000
how your younger brother feels

508
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,280
after watching all this

509
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,840
for so many years.

510
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,280
What are you trying to do?

511
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,280
What a good pawn.

512
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,840
Of course one will want to keep it

513
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,960
for himself.

514
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,000
You want me to betray Prince Qi?

515
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,360
Are you not afraid
you'll burn your own fingers?

516
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,680
You can only blame yourself
for being out of luck.

517
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,560
We thought of just getting rid
of a small fry.

518
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,800
But we never thought

519
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,120
we would get a big fish like you instead.

520
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,560
You've done us a great favour.

521
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,200
What do you mean by that?

522
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,440
What do you have to do
with Tian Yong's death?

523
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,360
A wise man serves only a virtuous master.

524
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,400
Officer Jiang.

525
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,400
If you choose to pay
allegiance to my Lord,

526
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,640
I promise

527
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,160
you will never regret it.

528
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,240
Dream on!

529
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,560
I only give you

530
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,920
one night to consider it.

531
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,360
If I don't get the answer

532
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,320
that I want tomorrow morning,

533
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,560
I will send you

534
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,240
and Song Yao

535
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,560
to reunite with your dead brother.

536
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,960
Stop!

537
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,120
What are you trying to do?

538
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,080
Don't hurt Song Yao!

539
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,920
Li Yu can enter the prison so easily.

540
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,840
They must have someone inside
the Mingjing Office.

541
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,600
Now,

542
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,840
things are not in favour for His Highness.

543
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,320
I can't let myself be their pawn

544
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,160
to harm His Highness.

545
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,730
(Lieutenant Jiang Xiwen)

546
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,080
Watch out!

547
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,530
(Lieutenant Jiang Xiwen)

548
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,280
Are you still worrying
about Brother Jiang's case?

549
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,440
I'm pretty sure

550
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,040
that he'd not kill anyone.

551
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,520
But there's nothing I can do for him.

552
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
I feel so guilty.

553
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,920
I'll go to see him tomorrow.

554
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,040
All right.

555
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,240
Please look out for him then.

556
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,000
Every suspicion in this case

557
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,160
have been cleared.

558
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,040
Lead Officer.

559
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,920
I am here for Jiang Xiwen's case.

560
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,840
the suspect's testimony is quite ambiguous

561
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,160
and the motives are somewhat questionable.

562
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,640
You know that the suspect
is Prince Qi's confidant.

563
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,120
So you're trying to clear his name

564
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,000
to please Prince Qi.

565
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,120
Officer Luo.

566
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,720
We're just working on the case.

567
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,440
How could you say that?

568
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,360
Officer Su.

569
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,280
Here's the whole record of the case.

570
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,880
It contains the convict's confession.

571
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,680
Have a look.

572
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,000
Should any of it violates the rules,

573
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,920
I'll hand it over to you
to re-investigate it.

574
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,640
(Confession record)
But if you can't find anything wrong

575
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,240
I'll not hold back.

576
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,360
Don't you think about

577
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,840
intervening in this case.

578
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,800
How is it?

579
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,360
Nothing wrong in the process.

580
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:48,900
(Confession)

581
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,240
Su Ci.

582
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,760
You have been an official
for two years now.

583
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,640
Don't you know
how to say it tactfully?

584
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,680
I'm just...

585
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,240
Luo Xin is an ambitious man.

586
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,840
If you question him face to face,

587
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,760
he'll surely be upset.

588
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,080
Besides, you're close to Prince Qi.

589
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,600
You should sit out
to avoid suspicion.

590
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,600
Officer.

591
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,400
How about this?

592
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,640
I'll take a closer look at the file.

593
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,280
If there is any problem,

594
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,760
I will ask him to re-investigate it.

595
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,560
That's really thoughtful of you.

596
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,360
Well, may I go to the prison
to questions Xi Wen

597
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,440
in person?

598
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,040
Yes, of course.

599
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,600
Thank you.

600
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,360
Detective Su.

601
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,280
I'm here to see Jiang Xiwen.

602
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,400
OK.

603
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,480
Detective Su, please come with me.

604
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,400
Brother Jiang!

605
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,460
Officer Luo.

606
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,180
How is it going with Tian Yong's case?

607
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
We have caught the murderer.

608
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,180
The murderer?

609
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,260
Jiang Xiwen is just a suspect.

610
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,820
He has confessed to the crime.

611
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,660
I have complied the files.

612
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
I'm gonna report it to Officer Liu.

613
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,700
That's impossible.

614
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,300
What do you mean by that?

615
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
Are you the only one in Mingjing Office

616
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,420
who knows how to solve cases?

617
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,780
You mean my cases
are unjust, fake and false charges?

618
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,340
I don't mean that.
