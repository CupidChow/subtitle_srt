14
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,851
(Episode 18)

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,400
Is it the same poison as the Princess's?

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,240
It's similar

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,520
but not identical.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
It's strange.

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,640
She is the close maid of the Princess.

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,680
Do you think she came in contact
with the poison too?

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,960
I smell

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
something strange in this room.

23
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,800
Is there an incense lit?

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,200
This is Yunchuan's favourite Baili Incense.

25
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,760
Are you talking about this?

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,680
I smell something else as well.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,080
Rushuang.

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,920
Your Highness,

29
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,720
it's time to act now.

30
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,160
Prince.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,880
I have a suggestion.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,000
I've underestimated
the lady Detective Su's brought.

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
I didn't expect that

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,680
she could actually
cure Yunchuan from the poison.

35
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,520
Has Her Highness recovered?

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
In another two days,

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,840
we can formally discuss
the political betrothal with Prince Qi.

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,280
When it's done,

39
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
we shall depart back to Beirong.

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Che Yan,

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
prepare for the return journey.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
What about the culprit?

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,640
Won't Your Highness find it out?

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,240
A scapegoat will gloss over the matter.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,440
If we stay on,

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,920
I worry about unnecessary troubles.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,640
The purpose of our trip

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
is for the treaty of alliance
and the marriage of state.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Given the current situation,

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,920
we've gained upper-hand in the treaty.

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,080
We only have to wait for
Yunchuan and Prince Qi's marriage.

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,440
Anything else

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,640
will be discussed further after we return.

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,800
Yes, Your Highness.

55
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,800
You should stay at your mansion.

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,800
If someone with an ulterior motive finds out,

57
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,880
it won't be good.

58
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,880
I just want to check on you.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,760
Little Su...

60
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,960
Stop.

61
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,040
Walls have ears.

62
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,840
Since you're putting up a show,

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,120
you should take care of yourself first.

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,440
Rushuang's prepared this medicine.

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,600
Have it first.

66
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
Someone's outside by the window.

67
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
The person's left.

68
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,640
I saw you dancing previously...

69
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,320
It's not like you're tone-deaf.

70
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,760
But Her Highness is.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
I'd like to rest,

72
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
please take your leave.

73
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,440
Alright.

74
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,120
I'd like to see who's trying to hurt Yunchuan!

75
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,480
Che Yan?

76
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,440
Rushuang,

77
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,560
can you really cure Princess Yunchuan?

78
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,760
I don't know.

79
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,960
Bring me the satchel.

80
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,400
Okay.

81
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,800
What's this?

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,800
It's Princess Yunchuan's blood sample.

83
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,640
What's it for?

84
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,080
After two days of sediment,

85
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,240
the toxin in the blood has been separated.

86
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,760
This allows me to test for the poison.

87
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,400
Why is it like this?

88
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,600
Rushuang, is there any new discovery?

89
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,120
Oh no!

90
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,480
Rushuang!

91
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,760
Che Yan.

92
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,760
You've been working for me for years,

93
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,480
I regard you as my own brother.

94
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
Why did you do it?

95
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,600
Who are you being so loyal to?

96
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,200
That you'd rather die than to expose him!

97
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,240
Your Highness!

98
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,760
I also

99
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,280
wished to tread on the heels
of Your Highness,

100
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,200
do the best and
die fighting in the battlefield.

101
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,880
That's the glory of a Beirong man.

102
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,640
But I can't put my whole family in danger

103
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,320
for the sake of my honor, Your Highness!

104
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
Who made you do this?

105
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
What?

106
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,120
Do you think that I

107
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,600
can't even protect your entire family?

108
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,520
It's the pro-war leader in the court,

109
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,520
Nuo Hu.

110
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,520
That's right.

111
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,040
Who else could it be if it's not him

112
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,240
to do something like this?

113
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
I'll have my ways to deal with him.

114
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
What's urgent now is to cure the princess,

115
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,800
give me the antidote now.

116
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
I didn't poison the princess!

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,760
What?

118
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,880
It's not you?

119
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,120
Lord Nuo Hu said that

120
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,040
after arriving here,

121
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,680
I shall follow orders and do as told.

122
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,120
Follow orders?

123
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,240
Whose orders?

124
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,880
An anonymous man.

125
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,200
I've only heard his voice,

126
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,920
but I've never seen him.

127
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Is he from Liang Dynasty?

128
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,880
Yes.

129
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm afraid we've alarmed them now.

130
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,800
If we want to catch the culprit...

131
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,920
Little Su!

132
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,520
What's wrong?

133
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,240
Little Su!

134
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,440
Sister Su!

135
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Sister Su!

136
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm late!

137
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,560
What happened?

138
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,280
Everyone,

139
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
leave this room immediately.

140
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,640
Sister Su...

141
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,040
Little Su,

142
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,080
how do you feel?

143
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,680
Rushuang.

144
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,400
Am I poisoned as well?

145
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,720
Sister Su, hold on to it.

146
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,840
You're not poisoned that much.

147
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,480
But it's reached Fengchi acupuncture point.

148
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,160
How could this happen?

149
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,800
Is there any remedy?

150
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,440
Rushuang has said it's chronic

151
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,080
I think, for the time being,

152
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,480
it won't kill me.

153
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,120
The current priority is to cure the princess.

154
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,240
You aren't poisoned as badly as the princess,

155
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,280
but you can't keep taking it.

156
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,640
Rushuang, you came here in a rush.

157
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,640
Have you found out what the poison was?

158
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,840
I've only discovered two of the ingredients.

159
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,560
What are they?

160
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,400
I extracted the toxin
from Her Highness' blood

161
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,800
and mixed it to the potion made of monkshood,

162
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,040
realizing that two things
didn't go with the monkshood.

163
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,400
One is Huanghuo and the other is Mindu.

164
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,520
They're respectively found
in insect resistant coating

165
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,440
and Baili Incense,

166
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,640
is that right?

167
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,200
Are these the poisons
that Yunchuan has got?

168
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,080
If I'm right with the guess,

169
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,120
it is the long-lost

170
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,600
Four-Drug Soul Reaper.

171
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,280
Four-Drug Soul Reaper?

172
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,480
I've been in Jiang Hu for so long

173
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,440
but I've never heard of this drug.

174
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,680
The Four-Drug Soul Reaper

175
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,800
consists of four incompatible drugs

176
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,320
to induce a lethal poison
right within one's body.

177
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,920
But if anyone gets only one ingredient,

178
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,320
it's not poisonous.

179
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,320
What?

180
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,240
What a sophisticated method.

181
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,960
As it requires an incredible precision

182
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,320
in dosage,

183
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,960
few people could master it

184
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,640
and it couldn't be passed down eventually.

185
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,640
I've only seen it in medical books too.

186
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,760
Since we know the poison now,

187
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,800
do you know how to make the antidote?

188
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
There are over a hundred variations
of the poison.

189
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,520
I need to find out the four drugs

190
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,840
to make the right antidote.

191
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,840
This also means that

192
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,520
in daily life the culprit

193
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,880
only had to send these four items

194
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,880
to Yunchuan's room,

195
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,280
and she'd be slowly poisoned day after day?

196
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,520
That's right,

197
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,080
it's also why Little Yue
showed signs of being poisoned too.

198
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,520
Rushuang,

199
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,080
they've stayed in the room just now too.

200
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,080
Take a look at them.

201
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,240
Brother Pei.

202
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,720
The pulse of Brother Pei is steady,

203
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,840
and there's no sign of being poisoned.

204
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,440
Your Highness,

205
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,200
please.

206
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,440
Your Highness has
no signs of being poisoned as well.

207
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,760
This is bizarre.

208
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,120
Everyone's in the same room.

209
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,680
Why some are poisoned

210
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,000
and others are not?

211
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,160
Xiao Yanzhi has actually gone to the inn.

212
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,040
My Lord,

213
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,120
how about catching him on the spot

214
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,680
and accusing him of defying the Emperor?

215
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,520
Make the carriage ready,
I'm going to the palace right now.

216
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,440
Yes.

217
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,880
Everyone's in the room,

218
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,280
but why am I the only one who's poisoned?

219
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,760
Why did you remove your mask? Put it on quick.

220
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's the pillow.

221
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,839
Your Highness.

222
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,200
Why... Why is it?

223
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,720
Brother Jiang,

224
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,839
where's His Highness?

225
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,480
What is it? Speak quick!

226
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,640
His Majesty is coming to visit here.

227
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,400
What?

228
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,520
Go to the inn now
and bring His Highness back.

229
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,160
It's the Bixiang Herb.

230
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,960
Detective Su, you're looking for me?

231
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,560
Is this what the Princess previously used?

232
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,520
Were the items in the room
newly-bought in the capital?

233
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,560
No.

234
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,120
Since we'd stay here for a long time,

235
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,760
Her Highness asked us
to take a few

236
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,840
items that she often used.

237
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,560
All things that were previously
in this room were cleared out.

238
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,800
But this pillow...

239
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,120
Why is it new?

240
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,480
Her Highness wasn't sleeping well
on the first few days of arrival.

241
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
It's said that this pillow could help.

242
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,120
So it's replaced.

243
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,280
Who said it?

244
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,320
Her Highness mentioned it herself.

245
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
She said that the Bixiang Herb
had a calming effect,

246
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,760
and asked me to buy it from the drug store
to put it in the pillow.

247
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,040
Since then,

248
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,360
Her Highness did sleep well.

249
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,960
Did Her Highness know about herbs?

250
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
How did she know that
Bixiang Herb could help?

251
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,760
She heard the guqin master, Li Yu,
mentioning it,

252
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,360
and remembered it.

253
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
Guqin master...

254
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,440
Then this pine guqin

255
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,040
was made personally by Li Yu too?

256
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,400
Yes.

257
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,640
Her Highness has been using the one

258
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,720
of Li Yu to practise,

259
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,160
but she couldn't get used to it.

260
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,920
So Li Yu specifically made her

261
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,280
a pine guqin.

262
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,920
In the room,

263
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,640
what else were newly bought?

264
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,000
Nothing more.

265
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,080
The herb pillow was suggested by Li Yu,

266
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,760
and this guqin was made by Li Yu as well.

267
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,040
Could her be the culprit?

268
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,320
Hasn't she been serving the Princess
all the time?

269
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,120
Before Her Highness
decided to come here,

270
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,680
she volunteered to become
the guqin master.

271
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,800
Then where is she now?

272
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,160
I'll take you there.

273
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,440
Rushuang, take care of the Princess.

274
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,400
Let's go.

275
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,920
Your Highness!

276
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,600
Fei Yuan reported that

277
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,600
His Majesty is visiting you.

278
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,560
Looks like we're still late!

279
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,040
She really is the culprit.

280
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,680
The tea is still warm,

281
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,120
it means that she isn't far away.

282
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Come on, have a look!

283
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,240
Take a look!

284
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,320
Come, look around!

285
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,280
Quick. Do come in.

286
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm back.

287
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,200
Is everything done?

288
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,400
Yes.

289
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,640
Oh, no!

290
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,440
What?

291
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,940
(Reception Arrangement of Beirong Delegation)

292
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,000
(Mansion of Prince Qi)

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,640
Your Majesty.

294
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,360
You may rise.

295
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

296
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:06,066
(Breakthrough)

297
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,720
Your Majesty has arrived

298
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,680
yet Prince Qi hasn't been
here to see His Majesty.

299
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,920
What's the excuse?

300
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,520
His Highness is changing clothes.

301
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,920
and can't see His Majesty in time.

302
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,360
We seek Your Majesty's forgiveness.

303
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,040
This is an impromptu visit,

304
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,520
and brother is still ill,

305
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,960
it is acceptable if he couldn't make it in time.

306
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:31,409
(Breakthrough)

307
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,800
He has a kind of tea
with a light and elegant taste.

308
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,000
The color of this tea is relatively deep,

309
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,920
it seems it's not the one.

310
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
Is Your Majesty referring to the Congxiang Tea?

311
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
I think so.

312
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,120
Make me the tea.

313
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

314
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,400
The color of this tea is deep too,

315
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,720
it isn't what I want.

316
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,600
Your Majesty, shall we try another one?

317
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,360
Your Majesty,

318
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
we aren't here for tea.

319
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,440
Prince Qi isn't around, is he?

320
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,960
Your Majesty,

321
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,720
you ordered Prince Qi
to reflect on his wrongdoing at home,

322
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,360
yet he's gone out
without your permission.

323
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,440
Your Majesty,

324
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
Prince Qi is challenging the supremacy
by deceiving you.

325
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,840
He's committed the sin of defiance.

326
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,240
Uncle,

327
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,280
the crime of defying the monarch

328
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,440
isn't what I can bear.

329
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,640
Your Majesty.

330
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,560
Rise, brother.

331
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,200
I've heard that you are ill.

332
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,280
Uncle has especially invited me
to visit you together.

333
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,080
Ill?

334
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,360
I wonder who've told uncle my illness?

335
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,360
A servant.

336
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
It's just a mistake.

337
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,000
Your Majesty!

338
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,600
We've found evidence.

339
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,200
Prince Qi is innocent.

340
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,480
Your Majesty.

341
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,440
I'm the sinned official, Su Ci.

342
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,880
Rise and speak.

343
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

344
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,400
Just now, you said that

345
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,440
you have evidence
to prove Prince Qi's innocence.

346
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,600
Yes.

347
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,080
We've found that

348
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,320
the guqin master among the delegation, Li Yu,

349
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
was the culprit who poisoned the Princess.

350
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,760
Where is the evidence?

351
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,440
Li Yu was on the run.

352
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,240
But we're currently
pursuing her in the city.

353
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,760
Someone still on the run

354
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,760
can't possibly be evidence, can it?

355
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,880
Li Yu has escaped

356
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
but at her room

357
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,520
we found this

358
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,160
the delegation reception document
with the seal of the Ministry of Rites.

359
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,080
It' a seal from the Ministry of Rites
to consult superior opinions,

360
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,240
and not the one to disseminate documents.

361
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,560
Not many in the court
have this document.

362
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,560
Your Majesty, please have a look.

363
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,753
(Reception Arrangement of Beirong Delegation)

364
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,960
Whom have the Ministry of Rites
submitted the consultation to previously?

365
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,320
Bring me their documents!

366
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,536
(Reception Arrangement of Beirong Delegation)

367
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,247
(Prince Qi)

368
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,400
Your Majesty,

369
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,520
they're all here.

370
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,400
This...

371
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,120
Your Majesty,

372
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,680
to rid Prince Qi's crime, Su Ci could be

373
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,880
making up a huge lie intentionally.

374
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,240
Su Ci,

375
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,560
these documents are currently

376
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,200
placed here in completion.

377
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,680
I'd like to see

378
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,760
how you're explaining this.

379
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,520
Your Majesty,

380
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,280
please allow me

381
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,720
to take a closer look.

382
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,960
You're allowed.

383
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

384
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,640
Hold on.

385
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,080
Your Majesty,

386
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,520
I worry that Su Ci has planned

387
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,640
to memorize these arranged documents

388
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,080
to accuse others of forgery.

389
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,440
Your Majesty, I suggest to

390
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,680
mix up these documents.

391
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,440
I shall see

392
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,960
how she will identify them.

393
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,400
Uncle, your words do make sense.

394
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,520
Yes.

395
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
Your Majesty,

396
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,000
it's done.

397
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,280
Su Ci,

398
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,440
you can step forward to check now.

399
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

400
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,280
This document

401
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,160
belongs to Prince Qi.

402
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Prince Qi.

403
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,880
How could you identify it?

404
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Your Majesty,

405
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,480
it has the stain of sword polishing grease.

406
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,920
Prince Qi practises martial arts all year round,

407
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,920
he must have the habit
of caring for his weapons daily.

408
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,720
Hence, I guess that

409
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,560
this document belongs to Prince Qi.

410
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,320
I've long heard that
you have an amazing perception,

411
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
I see that it's truly the case.

412
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,560
Thank you for the compliment, Your Majesty.

413
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,320
This is ink paste.

414
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,560
This document

415
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,120
is Minister Shen's.

416
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,280
Minister Shen.

417
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,800
Bloodstain.

418
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,680
Gold paint.

419
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,440
This...

420
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,520
What are you smirking at?

421
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Minister Lei,

422
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,200
where's your document?

423
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,640
Isn't it right here?

424
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,080
Oh, Su Ci,

425
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,760
I've exposed your identity

426
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,240
but don't take the chance
to revenge out of resentment

427
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,640
The ink on this document hasn't dried.

428
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,360
It's obviously forged today.

429
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,880
What do you mean it's not dried yet?

430
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,480
Who can distinguish it?

431
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,400
Your Majesty, it's clearly dry.

432
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,280
Just because His Majesty
praised your shrewdness,

433
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,960
you're accusing me, aren't you?

434
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,760
If the ink cannot prove,

435
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,280
what about the paper?

436
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,120
What paper?

437
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,000
Your Majesty,

438
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,120
- Your Majesty...
- Minister Shen,

439
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
what paper do these documents use?

440
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,400
It's made from Kaihua Bill Paper.

441
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,480
Then, may I ask Minister Lei,

442
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
why is yours the only one

443
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,040
that uses Kaihua Paper?

444
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,680
What... What Kaihua Bill Paper and Kaihua Paper?

445
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
Who can recognize them?

446
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,240
Your Majesty!

447
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,120
Your Majesty, please judge wisely, Your Majesty.

448
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,480
Is there any way to test them?

449
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,560
Your Majesty,

450
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,680
both types of paper
are incredibly hard to differentiate

451
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
but Kaihua Paper
is water-tight.

452
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,560
A test is all it takes to know.

453
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,360
Yes.

454
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,240
Your Majesty,

455
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,080
The water droplets penetrate
all four other documents

456
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,120
but Minister Lei's document

457
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,080
is water-tight.

458
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,280
How dare you, Lei Zheng!

459
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,800
You poisoned Princess Yunchuan,

460
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,280
and instigated the discord of two nations.

461
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,960
What's your motive!

462
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,240
False charge...

463
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,920
It's a false charge!

464
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,600
All of you must have worked together

465
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,040
to frame me!

466
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,080
How dare you!

467
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,840
Protect His Majesty!

468
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,080
You...

469
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,880
Your Majesty...

470
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,920
Unsheathing a blade before His Majesty

471
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,840
is a capital offense of rebellion.

472
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,960
Even death wouldn't redeem him.

473
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,040
My Lord,

474
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,440
at least Li Yu is saved.

475
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,280
Otherwise,

476
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,840
we'd have suffered a great loss!

477
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,240
The person who I've asked you to investigate,

478
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,040
have you found him?

479
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,120
My Lord,

480
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,880
we have clues.

481
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,960
That person lurks among the court officials.

482
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,800
Now we can't wait any longer.

483
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,199
Find out that person immediately.

484
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,280
Yes.
