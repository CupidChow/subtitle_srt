(Episode 10)

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,280
Detective Su.

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,640
Here she is.

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,840
It was you

18
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,240
who found Ms. Xu was dead?

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,120
I went to serve her wash up
as usual this morning.

20
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,360
But no one responded

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,480
insides.

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,400
I knocked the door open

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,200
and I discovered that Ms. Xu...

24
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,640
She was already...

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,840
When was the last time you saw her?

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,120
That was

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,040
before she went to bed last night.

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,480
I served her wash up as usual.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,320
Was there anything ususual before that?

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,760
Sometimes

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,240
she would stare out the window in a daze.

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,160
She would occasionally smile to herself.

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,000
She thought she was going
to be the Princess Consort Qi.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,080
I supposed she was happy.

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Besides,

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,600
was there anything else?

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
Nothing else.

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
But

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,280
she often said the sound of rain here was nice.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
Perhaps because she used to stay
in Northern Xinjiang.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,360
So it must be something new to her.

42
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,320
The sound of rain?

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,360
Was it a sunny or rainy day at that time?

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,200
It was a rainy day.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,880
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,520
How will you deal with Xu Zhi's death?

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,960
I've asked the Mingjing Office
to investigate in full scale.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,120
Before that,

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,560
Your Majesty, if you intend
to comfort Marquis Zhenyuan,

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,160
I'm afraid this isn't enough.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
So uncle, what do you suggest?

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
Xu Zhi was killed in the palace.

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,520
The imperial guards
should be responsible.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I suggest

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,560
to dismiss Fu Ziyou

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,040
Commander of the Imperial Guards

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,280
to show your attitude.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,520
Well...

59
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,960
It allows no hesitation.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,520
Marquis Zhenyuan
commands a massive military force.

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,840
If he bears any animosity,

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,280
it might lead to endless disasters.

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,520
Your Majesty.

64
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,360
If so, demote him.

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,880
Let's revisit the issue again

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,360
when this is all over.

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,080
Sure, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,040
Your Majesty.

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
Prince Qi is waiting for your summon.

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,840
Send him in.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,040
Yes.

72
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,520
Prince Qi, this way, please.

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
Your Majesty.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,840
Uncle.

75
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,280
You're here, Yanzhi.

76
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,520
Your Majesty.

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,760
I shall take my leave.

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,240
Your Majesty.

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,560
I've just demoted Commander Fu.

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,360
Uncle said

81
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,400
that we needed to answer to it.

82
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,680
Ms. Xu's death
has caused an uproar in the palace.

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,080
It's rumoured that her life
was taken by the devil.

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,960
Don't believe in supernatural beings.

85
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,960
Of course, I won't.

86
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,960
But Marquis Zhenyuan
loved her daughter dearly.

87
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,600
He might blame it on you.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
Brother,
have you prepared for it?

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
I didn't want her to die,

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,320
but she died because of me.

91
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,800
If Marquis Zhenyuan blames me,

92
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
I should accept it.

93
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
Someone wouldn't let Ms. Xu
to be Princess Consort Qi.

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,720
So they would resort to different means.

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
But they chose the most vicious one!

96
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,120
Have you thought about the reason?

97
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,600
Both sides suffered great losses.

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,520
Even if it raises others' suspicion,

99
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,520
they want to ensure
no one with unsuitable status

100
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,360
dare to think about
marrying Prince Qi.

101
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,880
Little Su.

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,040
Brother Pei, you are here.

103
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,960
I'm here with Prince Qi
to deal with some things.

104
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,840
It's about Xu Zhi, right?

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you in charge of this case?

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm going to the office for
an autopsy with Rushuang.

107
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,080
Why don't you come with us?

108
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,320
You could inform Prince Qi
if we would have any news.

109
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,280
All right.

110
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,800
The scar extends from the neck
to the back of the ear.

111
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,320
Her nails are frayed and broken.

112
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,920
She must have struggled

113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,520
before she was hanged.

114
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,640
It matches the shoes print
on the stool.

115
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
Why is this tied from the outside?

116
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Someone is trying to mislead us.

117
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Brother Su.

118
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,240
What is this?

119
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,000
I could smell the scent
of rouge and powder.

120
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,800
Brother Pei, take a sniff

121
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,760
and see if you can figure out what it is.

122
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
The scent is very special.

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
It's my first time
coming across this scent.

124
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,320
Rushuang.

125
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,280
Collect some and examine it.

126
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,360
All right.

127
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
I need to go out.

128
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,520
Where are you going?

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
To question Qu Linjiang.

130
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,960
He drew a portrait of Xu Zhi before.

131
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,560
Qu Linjiang? He's a friend of mine.

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,080
I'll go with you.

133
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,680
This is...

134
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm Su Ci from Mingjing Office.

135
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,400
I would like to ask you a few questions

136
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,960
about the murder of Ms. Xu Zhi.

137
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,920
Ms. Xu was killed?

138
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Yes.

139
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,880
She was such a pure and smart woman.

140
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,440
What a shame.

141
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,200
How many times
did you contact with her?

142
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,440
Only once.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,840
I was ordered to draw her portrait.

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,480
Was she acting as usual?

145
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,670
Ms. Xu

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,640
was graceful and well-mannered.

147
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,760
Nothing unusual.

148
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
Where were you last night?

149
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,280
Last night, I was working
on my beauty portrait

150
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,480
at my place

151
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
and tried to find a way to perfect it.

152
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,120
My boy servant can testify for me.

153
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,920
This beauty portrait...

154
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,160
Brother Qu is determined
to draw a portrait

155
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
to capture the beauty of the world.

156
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,120
He has been painting it for many years.

157
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,920
Qu.

158
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,120
It's okay to let Detective Su
take a look at it, right?

159
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,720
It's so beautiful.

160
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,080
But why haven't the eyes been drawn yet?

161
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,720
The eyes of the beautiful lady
must be charming,

162
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
lifelike, dark and bright.

163
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,320
I have been searching for years

164
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,080
but found nothing.

165
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,400
Brother Qu is very particular about

166
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,560
every feature of his portrait.

167
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,280
I wonder

168
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,280
when will he be able to find it.

169
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
No.

170
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,800
I have found it.

171
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,560
Sirs, please come upstairs.

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,000
(Cosmetics Store)
Have you heard?

173
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,920
Someone killed herself
in the wedding gown again.

174
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,320
Which girl is it this time?

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,360
I heard it's Marquis Zhenyuan's daughter.

176
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,680
Her name is Xu Zhi.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
That's so spooky.

178
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,680
Miss.

179
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,800
Could you take a look
at this box of powder?

180
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,240
What about it?

181
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,800
I detected the ingredients
of animal fat and cinnabar

182
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,960
from it.

183
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,160
So I guess this is a box of lip rouge.

184
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,640
Indeed.

185
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,920
But it's slightly different
from those in my store.

186
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,000
How so?

187
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,560
Here.

188
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,600
I'll get my product for you
to make a comparison.

189
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
You'll see.

190
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you.

191
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,390
(Mansion of Marquis Zhenyuan)

193
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,400
Marquis.

194
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,000
My condolences.

195
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,600
Marquis.

196
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm here to extend my apologies.

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,640
You should apologise.

198
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,720
It's my fault for letting this happen.

199
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,560
It's all because of me.

200
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,000
However you're mad at me,

201
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,560
I deserve it.

202
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,040
Do you think

203
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,000
that I'm mad at you

204
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
for not keeping Zhi safe?

205
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,160
No.

206
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,680
When I met you a few years ago,

207
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,520
you weren't the one
sticking to social rules.

208
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,440
You were magnanimous and optimistic.

209
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,680
I thought

210
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,400
there would be
a well-ordered administration.

211
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,360
I never thought you would change

212
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
and degenerate.

213
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,000
Pretentious.

214
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,320
Manipulating power.

215
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm willing to take your advice.

216
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,920
With your intelligence,

217
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,720
how would you not know

218
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,880
that someone was using the Empress Dowager

219
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,920
to lay a trap for the selection
of your consort?

220
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,560
But you protected no one but yourself.

221
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,320
Have you ever wondered

222
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
the destiny of the pawns in this game?

223
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,360
You'd rather be an onlooker.

224
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
But you never thought

225
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,520
about being the one to end it.

226
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,720
Marquis.

227
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,960
You've misunderstood him.

228
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,640
Shut up.

229
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,040
I thought you had the passion
of a soldier.

230
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
You're such a big letdown.

231
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm deeply ashamed.

232
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,320
Go.

233
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,400
(Xu Zhi's memorial tablet)

234
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,680
My beloved daughter

235
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,560
was wrong about you.

236
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm sure your mom
will like the gift I picked for her.

237
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,600
Don't worry.

238
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,520
How thoughtful of you.

239
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,120
Your Highness.

240
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
Why didn't you say anything

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
or give him an explanation?

242
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,840
Marquis has lived with honor
all his life.

243
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
He's grieving the loss of a child.

244
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,120
It's fine to take

245
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,520
whatever scolding he has.

246
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,480
But

247
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,600
That's enough.

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,920
Let's go back.

249
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,520
I have found out that the powder

250
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,920
scraped from the wedding gown

251
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
was a unique lip rouge
in Northern Xinjiang.

252
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,880
This lip rouge is different from ours

253
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,200
because the extraction method is more complex

254
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
and the colour lasts longer.

255
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
So it is very popular among the nobles.

256
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,680
I cross-checked it
with Detective Chen today.

257
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,680
We found this box of lip rouge

258
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
from Ms. Xu's room.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,880
Lip rouge?

260
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,240
I just smell something fishy
about this.

261
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm sure Ms. Xu didn't commit suicide.

262
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
Why would you say that?

263
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,880
When I was on the street today,

264
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,120
I heard a lot of people talking about it

265
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,960
and they were spreading fear.

266
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,120
They said her life was taken by the devil.

267
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,160
Like being possessed by a ghost bride.

268
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,800
It was talked by different people.

269
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,760
But the story was the same.

270
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,080
I think someone must be

271
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,880
spreading the rumours

272
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,920
to confuse the people

273
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,760
so that he could just bluff his way

274
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,480
out of it amid the chaos.

275
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,400
Here, Detective Su.

276
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,120
Rushuang.

277
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,000
Thank you.

278
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,080
Rushuang.

279
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,120
Your reasoning ability
is getting better now.

280
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,280
That's showing off in front of an expert.

281
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,640
This is nothing as compared to you.

282
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,520
Thank you.

283
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Let's eat.

284
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,720
Brother Pei.

285
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,160
You can't eat this.

286
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,440
Is something bothering you?

287
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
No.

288
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,560
Perhaps, I've been too tired lately.

289
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,120
It's quite easy to tell apart

290
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
if one is tired or being preoccupied.

291
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,920
You...

292
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,160
Brother Su!

293
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,440
How is it?

294
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,040
I found something.

295
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,960
Take a look.

296
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,000
All right.

297
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,960
I've been investigating
on similar cases lately

298
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,480
before I heard

299
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,880
about Ms. Xu's case.

300
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,240
This murderer

301
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,560
has lost his sanity.

302
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,160
He has got his way
into the palace now.

303
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,880
Here.

304
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,800
Brother Xie.

305
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,920
Drink some soup.

306
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,120
Xu Zhi's death

307
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,960
seems different.

308
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
How so?

309
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,000
Xu Zhi's case

310
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,880
has many similarities.

311
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,280
But

312
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,200
this murderer left too many traces behind.

313
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,160
It's completely different
from the former cases.

314
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,360
Also, it's obvious

315
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,810
that someone put on
the wedding gown for her.

316
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,000
It's very different
from Lady Jing and Ms. Lin.

317
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,120
So Xu Zhi was probably not...

318
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,240
Here. Take a look.

319
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,840
Jumping over the walls.

320
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,240
Poisoning.

321
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,560
Hanging oneself.

322
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,880
Drowning.

323
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,960
Swallowing gold.

324
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,760
In all these suspected cases,

325
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,520
the murderer's methods
of committing the crime

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,920
were different.

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,960
But Ms. Xu's death was the same as Lady Jing's.

328
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,800
They both hanged themselves.

329
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
Judging from these cases,

330
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,440
the methods of death for each victim

331
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
were carefully planned.

332
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
This murderer

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,480
must be someone meticulous

334
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,040
who's after perfection.

335
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,760
Someone like this

336
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,840
would not allow his ritual

337
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,040
to be interrupted.

338
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
Ms. Xu was the most popular candidate

339
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,520
to be Prince Qi's consort.

340
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,240
Now that she's been murdered.

341
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,640
Everyone in the capital knew about it.

342
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,720
I'm afraid no family will dare

343
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
to allow their daughters

344
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,360
to marry Prince Qi now.

345
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,680
That's exactly what the murderer wanted

346
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,440
so that he could use this

347
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,960
to cover up his real motive
of killing Ms. Xu.

348
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,040
But

349
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
is it that easy

350
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,070
to commit murder in the palace?

351
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,520
It's the selection of princess consort

352
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,480
and the palace is heavily guarded.

353
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
The murderer

354
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,640
is unlikely to be an outsider.

355
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,000
Is it possible

356
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,800
that Ms. Xu was too popular

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
and the other candidates
were jealous of her?

358
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,310
That's possible.

359
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,310
All right now.

360
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,120
We won't be able to figure it out now.

361
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Let's get some rest first.

362
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,880
Help yourselves.

363
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,360
Young Master.

364
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,440
I'll get back to work too.

365
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,920
This is...

366
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,600
Brother Pei!

367
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,360
It has a great impact on you,
right?

368
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,400
It's fine.

369
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,600
Don't worry about me.

370
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,200
Go back and get some rest.

371
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,720
Acting tough.

372
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,040
It's obvious something is up.

373
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,960
Brother Pei.

374
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,080
Are you asleep?

375
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,760
Come on in.

376
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,280
Little Su.

377
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,560
Here. Take a seat.

378
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,400
Is something bothering you?

379
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
No.

380
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,560
You're not the kind of person
drowning the sorrows.

381
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,280
Little Su.

382
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
I can take care of it myself.

383
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,320
Don't worry about me.

384
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,880
You're helping around
with Xu Zhi's case too, right?

385
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,920
Brother Pei.

386
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,120
I remember you once told me

387
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,600
not to take it alone
if I encounter any problems.

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,120
You remembers

389
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,680
my words so well.

390
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,000
I have always had a good memory.

391
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,720
The government
has become panic-stricken now.

392
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
So Prince Qi is affected by it.

393
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,240
I've been running around for this matter.

394
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,880
The conflict in the government

395
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,520
brings disaster to the innocent.

396
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,880
Prince Qi is implicated in it.

397
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm sure he's been put in a bad spot.

398
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,680
Prince Qi

399
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,480
did have an inescapable responsibility.

400
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,880
I heard

401
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,480
that Marquis Zhenyuan argued with His Majesty.

402
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,600
Would it put Prince Qi in the spot?

403
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,720
Not really.

404
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,520
The Marquis was right.

405
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
My colleagues were discussing about this.

406
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,200
The Marquis commanded a massive military force.

407
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
-If he used this to...
-Little Su.

408
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,920
He wouldn't do that.

409
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,240
It's precisely
because he's an upright person.

410
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
That's why he put pressure on His Majesty

411
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
in a direct manner.

412
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,480
If he was up to no good,

413
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,480
he would have left the capital by now.

414
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,800
Brother Pei.

415
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,800
I'll surely find out the truth
as soon as possible

416
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
so that Prince Qi
will not be put on the spot.

417
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,280
Little Su.

418
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,800
Thank you.

419
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,120
Brother Pei.

420
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,480
Why don't you buy a love lock?

421
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,080
You'll be locked together
for a lifetime

422
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,360
and no one can tear you apart.

423
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,920
Brother Pei.

424
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,080
I just recalled

425
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,960
that I've got things to do.

426
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,120
I have to go.

427
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't drink anymore.

428
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,260
(The button on the robe,
the lip rouge stains on the wedding gown)

429
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,240
I get it now.

430
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,320
Detective Su,

431
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,960
why did you ask me here?

432
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,320
Just routine inquiries.

433
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,280
Don't worry.

434
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,960
Detective Su.

435
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,960
If there's anything else you want to ask,

436
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,960
I'll surely tell you everything I know.

437
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,760
Do you know all the things

438
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,360
that Ms. Xu used
to carry around with her?

439
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,360
Ever since Ms. Xu entered the palace,

440
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,520
I was the one who took care
of everything for her.

441
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,120
Of course, I know.

442
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,280
Here's the thing.

443
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,560
When we were checking Ms. Xu's belongings,

444
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,920
we discovered

445
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,240
that a few things have gone.

446
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,800
My Lord, you may not know that.

447
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,600
The candidates of concubine
would bring their belongings

448
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
to grease the palms of others.

449
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,600
So did Ms. Xu.

450
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
What did she bring?

451
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,520
To whom did she give them to?

452
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,160
My Lord.

453
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,520
She brought some jewellery

454
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,440
and gave them to other candidates of concubine.

455
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,760
Ms. Xu was a kind person.

456
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
She even gave me some.

457
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,280
No powder or rouge?

458
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,360
No.

459
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,200
Just some pearl hairpins.

460
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,200
What happened to your fingers?

461
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,960
I got in on my fingers

462
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
when I applied the lip rouge this morning.

463
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,120
Sorry about that.

464
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,600
It's fine.

465
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,000
Wipe it off.

466
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,240
Can't wipe it off?

467
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,200
It's fine.

468
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,520
It's just harder to remove.

469
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,280
I can wash it off later.

470
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,680
There's actually a lip rouge
so hard to remove.

471
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,040
Girls' things.

472
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,720
It's normal if you don't know.

473
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,160
But I'm just curious.

474
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,640
Why don't you wipe off

475
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,240
the lip rouge on your lips?

476
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,600
My Lord.

477
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,160
I might have mistaken it.

478
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,360
This should be Ms. Xu's lip rouge.

479
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
My Lord,

480
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,720
Ms. Xu's lip rouge
is not only nice in colour,

481
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,520
it's also very hard to remove.

482
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,720
I see.

483
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,280
Detective Chen.

484
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,480
Yes.

485
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,960
So why is there

486
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,720
the same lip rouge stains on your clothes?

487
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,920
It probably got on my clothes

488
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,280
when I put on makeup for Ms. Xu.

489
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,440
But as far as I know,

490
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,920
Ms. Xu had obsession with cleanliness.

491
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,800
She never let anyone
put on makeup for her.

492
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,480
Well.

493
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,440
I probably got it elsewhere!

494
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,280
You said

495
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,840
that Ms. Xu never gave anyone

496
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,160
her powder and lip rouge
in the palace.

497
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,960
No, I...

498
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,000
Also...

499
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,960
how do you explain

500
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,360
that the pattern on your dress

501
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,840
is exactly the same as the begonia pattern

502
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,000
on Ms. Xu's wedding gown?

503
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,920
The people from Palace Clothing Bureau

504
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,440
said that this pattern
was designed by them.

505
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,120
It's unique.

506
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,880
You plotted everything
down to the tiniest detail

507
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,320
that you've even had it thought out

508
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,720
to wear the wedding shoes
and stand on the stool.

509
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,320
But you never would have expected

510
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
that a small box of lip rouge

511
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,520
from Northern Xinjiang

512
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,760
would leave behind such hard evidence

513
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,960
on you.

514
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,080
Detective Su.

515
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,320
Detective Su, spare me.

516
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
I bet all my fortune

517
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,840
on the candidates of Prince Qi's consort.

518
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,880
I can't lose.

519
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,120
Detective Su, spare my life.

520
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,880
Detective Su, spare my life.

521
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,120
So it was her the murder?

522
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,240
My Lord.

523
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
I have compiled the details

524
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,240
into a file.

525
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Please go through it.

526
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,000
Do you think I would believe

527
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,920
that you would dare to kill my daughter

528
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,800
for just a small bet?

529
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,840
My Lord, spare my life.

530
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,120
That small money might mean nothing to you.

531
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,120
But it's my everything!

532
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,480
Stop pretending!

533
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,800
I have seen all the dark dirty secrets
in the palace!

534
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,280
Tell me the truth.

535
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Who ordered you to do it?

536
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
No one!

537
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,200
No one.

538
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,880
I can give you
whatever they offered you.

539
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,160
If they threaten you,

540
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,120
I can help you with it

541
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,840
as long as you tell us the truth.

542
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
I can even

543
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,720
spare your life.

544
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,560
No.

545
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,280
No.

546
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
No.

547
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,480
I never thought you would change

548
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
and degenerate.

549
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
Pretentious.

550
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,560
Manipulating power.

551
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,400
But you protected no one but yourself.

552
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,120
Have you ever wondered

553
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,080
the destiny of the pawns in this game?

554
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,240
You'd rather be an onlooker.

555
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,760
But you never thought
about being the one to end it.

556
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,920
What the marquis said
was right on point.

557
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,480
I, Xiao Yanzhi,
should go against the trend

558
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,680
instead of dealing with power

559
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,280
and treading with caution

560
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,080
every single day.

561
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,690
(Respect)

562
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,760
Marquis.

563
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,120
Zhi.

564
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,360
To enter the palace for the selection,

565
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,080
she said to me,

566
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,440
"I can't spend the Mid-Autumn Festival
with you this year."

567
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,280
But right now, she's...

568
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Marquis.

569
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,840
I know you don't want to see me.

570
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,520
Since you know that,

571
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,640
why are you here?

572
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,480
I'm here to thank you.

573
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,800
Thank me

574
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,880
or thank my daughter for sparing you?

575
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,160
I'm here to thank you

576
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,680
for your priceless advice.

577
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,240
My priceless advice?

578
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,680
You really think so?

579
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,720
Back then, when I returned
from the battle at Honggu,

580
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,080
everyone in the government
got all jittery.

581
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,120
I thought that was lame.

582
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,080
So I gave up my military power.

583
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,760
A person's talent
will arouse the envy of others.

584
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,720
Suspicion

585
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,280
did not stop because of this.

586
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,800
Indeed.

587
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,520
I can't cut off ties with the government.

588
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,160
Given the unstable political environment,

589
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,960
I still have unfinished business

590
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,480
and I have no choice
but to deal with it.

591
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
This is the real cause of suspicion.

592
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,920
That's your own problem.

593
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
How does it concern me?

594
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,080
Marquis.

595
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,120
You reminded me

596
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,480
to end the game.

597
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,080
A real man

598
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,120
should lead an
honourable life.

599
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,480
Although I disdain the power manipulators,

600
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,440
I have to live and play by their rules.

601
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,120
Not only it's lame,

602
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,880
I'm sick of it too.

603
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,480
Marquis.

604
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,720
This is another plot as well.

605
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,880
What do you mean by that?

606
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,640
The people behind this
know your temperament.

607
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,000
So they killed two birds with one stone.

608
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,880
Not only they ruined our marriage alliance,

609
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,800
they drove a wedge
between you and the royal family.

610
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,400
So when the government is in danger,

611
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,440
there'll be no assistance from the north.

612
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,680
Marquis, you've guarded
Northern Xinjiang so long.

613
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,120
You have high prestige,
you are loyal and patriotic.

614
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,800
You're crucial
in keeping the Liang Dynasty stable.

615
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
Onlookers are under the control.

616
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,360
But the ones who crack it
can take control of others.

617
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,400
Marquis.

618
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,640
Isn't that what you've taught me?

619
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,760
Zhi

620
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,200
was innocent.

621
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,480
Am I suppose

622
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,680
to just let things slide?

623
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,840
Marquis.

624
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,080
The people behind
are well hidden now.

625
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,240
But I, Xiao Yanzhi

626
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,600
hereby swear

627
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,160
that I will pursue this matter to the bitter end

628
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
and bring justice to Xu Zhi.

629
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,400
My Lord.

630
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,480
Marquis Zhenyuan
will leave the capital soon.

631
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,320
How come he can keep his composure?

632
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,400
Prince Qi visited him

633
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,960
and apologised to him.

634
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,840
I never thought

635
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,640
he would be able to see through my plan.

636
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,840
My Lord.

637
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,680
The one who solved Xu Zhi's case

638
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,840
was a young officer of Mingjing Office.

639
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,240
His name is Su Ci.

640
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,480
Su Ci?

641
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,200
Mingjing Office?

642
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,720
What's his story?

643
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,000
He has solved several major cases
in the past few years

644
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,320
known as the great young detective
in the capital.

645
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,600
When in Qingshui County,

646
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,760
he has been by Prince Qi's side.

647
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,520
It looks like
he is Prince Qi's secret agent.

648
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,480
Dig up everything on him.

649
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Get rid of him
once you find out anything.

650
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,460
I believe Your Majesty

651
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,660
have heard about my daughter's murder.

652
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,540
Yes.

653
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,340
I've asked the Mingjing Office
to investigate in full scale.

654
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,420
They'll surely bring you justice.

655
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,100
I suspect

656
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,940
that someone rigged
the selection of concubine,

657
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,900
manipulated power

658
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,180
and killed my daughter.

659
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,140
Marquis.

660
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,380
Your Majesty.

661
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,180
I'm a military man.

662
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,180
I won't beat around the bush.

663
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,860
I thought

664
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,300
my daughter acted against the rules

665
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,900
and broke taboo.

666
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,620
At most, she'd be disqualified and be sent home.

667
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,060
But I never thought

668
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,020
this would be an eternal goodbye.

669
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,420
Right now

670
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,100
I beg you, Your Majesty.

671
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,500
Even if things
couldn't be brought to light,

672
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,580
Please give me justice in the end.
