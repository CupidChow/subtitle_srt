00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,868
(Episode 22)

15
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,720
Something secret is brewing
in the capital.

16
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,455
This matter has serious implications.

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
If you' get involved rashly,

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
you might be in danger.

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm not afraid.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,600
I know

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,280
you're worried about me.

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,039
But all this time,

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,759
But you've been protecting me
all this while.

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
This time

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,320
I would like to do something for you.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
Let's discuss at length

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,400
when we get back to the capital.

28
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
As for that person,

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm not going to spare him.

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,400
Actually, I've long suspected

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,120
there's more than meets the eyes
in the Battle of Honggu.

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
What sister-in-law said

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,520
has confirmed my suspicion.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,440
But...

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,600
the eye witness, Liang Cheng

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,600
has been murdered.

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,760
Little Su.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,320
I didn't tell you this earlier.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,480
Everyone has a past

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,280
that they don't want to bring up.

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,960
I know.

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,560
The Battle of Honggu

44
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,200
has always been
the pain of the past to you.

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,320
Little Su.

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,000
Thank you

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,760
for being by my side all this time.

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,240
Perhaps, I shouldn't be hiding things
from you too.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,960
But will you be able to accept

50
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,600
that I'm a member of Bai Liang Clan?

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,520
Brother Pei.

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,000
Actually I...

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm investigating the Bai Liang case.

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
The letter to the enemy
from Bai Liang Clan's leader

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,040
was forged.

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Are you sure?

57
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,839
Lei Zheng was the one
who led the Bai Liang case.

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,040
When I read Liang Feng's letter,

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,400
I've been suspecting
that it was related to the Bai Liang case.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
Actually, that's my real purpose
for making this trip.

61
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,000
I didn't tell you earlier too.

63
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,360
So we're even now?

64
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,240
You said the letter to the enemy
was forged.

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you remember the fake painting

66
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,320
calligraphy, and list of names
we saw at Liang Feng's house?

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,960
Are you saying

68
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,440
that Liang Feng might be the one
who forged the letter?

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
Master Liang had people

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,400
collected these from all over the world
seven years ago.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,760
Seven years ago?

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,640
That's right.

73
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,295
That was when the Bai Liang Clan
was exterminated.

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,120
These are all the imitation paintings

75
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,320
done by some unknown scholars.

76
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,000
After collecting them,

77
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,920
Master Liang never touched them again.

78
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,386
(Li Mu, Shi Min, Lin Jia,
Wang Zhixin, Zhao Jin, Sun Qingfu, Fan Ming)

79
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
The names on this list

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,240
are all those unknown scholars.

81
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,320
This is great.

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,680
You're dismissed.

83
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,200
Let's hit the road now

84
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
and locate these scholars.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,520
There's no rush.

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,720
Let's take a break for now.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
We'll set out tomorrow.

88
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,080
But

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,280
you've just recovered from poisoning.

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,320
Besides

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,640
For investigating the case
you haven't had a good rest these days.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,800
You have waited for seven years.

93
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,120
It makes no difference
to wait for another day.

94
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,280
Brother Pei.

95
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,080
Do you really believe
that the Bai Liang Clan is innocent?

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Do you believe in me?

97
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
There might be more than meets the eyes

98
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,200
in the Bai Liang case.

99
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,640
Send our guards to find out

100
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
who executed the order back then.

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,440
Perhaps, they might find some clues.

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,960
Why did you bring up
the Bai Liang case again?

103
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,960
The clues found in the Liang Mansion

104
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,920
are most likely related
to the Bai Liang case.

105
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,280
The sudden death of the late emperor

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
might not be that simple.

107
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,880
You were there at that time.

108
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,480
Did you find anything unusual?

109
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,760
Fei Yuan.

110
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,760
Where are you going?

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,560
Sister Su.

112
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm asking the young master to eat.

113
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,960
I'll go.

114
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,480
Nothing that Your Highness didn't know.

115
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,200
There were no survivors found.

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
But when they did the body count,

117
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
the clan leader's only daughter
was missing.

118
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,120
Any survivors?

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,160
No.

120
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,640
Do another body count.

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Yes.

122
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,160
Search carefully!

123
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,320
Yes.

124
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,760
This must be the man
who killed my parents.

125
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,760
Remember his voice.

126
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
But war was approaching then.

127
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
So we didn't conduct
further investigation.

128
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
The clan leader's only daughter?

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,440
Convey my order.

130
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,800
As long as she's still alive,
you have to find her.

131
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,200
Yes.

132
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,760
So it was you who ordered
for the extermination of my clan.

133
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,080
That's why you're buying time.

134
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,960
Are you trying to destroy the evidence?

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
And you want to track me down?

136
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
Do you intend to hunt me down
and have me killed?

137
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,640
Father.

138
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,160
Mother.

139
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,440
I'll avenge you today!

140
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Little Su?

141
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,680
Xiwen, stop!

142
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,840
No, Your Highness!

143
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,800
Xiwen!

144
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,520
Your Highness!

145
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,520
Little Su, what are you doing?

146
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,560
What are you trying to do?

147
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,600
From now on

148
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,040
both of us

149
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,840

Did Detective Su misunderstand anything?

What is it that made her want to kill me?

168

Could she have overheard our conversation?

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm investigating the Bai Liang case.

171
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,840
The letter to the enemy
from Bai Liang Clan's leader

172
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,600
was forged.

173
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,480
Why was she so sure

174
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,960
that the letter to the enemy was forged?

175
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,520
Why did she look so sad

176
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,000
whenever we talked about

177
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,440
the extermination of the Bai Liang Clan?

178
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,360
Could it be that

179
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,520
Detective Su...

180
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,680
She was the only daughter
of the Bai Liang Clan who got away.

181
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:16,691
(Qifu Town, Maoyuan Inn)

182
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,600
Sister Su!

183
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,840
We finally found you!

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
Why would you be here?

185
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,560
Sister Su.

186
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,920
Don't fight with the young master.

187
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,240
We went searching for you

188
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,240
and haven't had a good night sleep
for days now.

189
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,720
Brother Su.

190
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,600
I can understand
that you're mad at Brother Pei.

191
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
But you left us behind.

192
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,840
That's not right of you to do that.

193
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,160
I have things to do.

194
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,840
Don't follow me.

195
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,880
(Maoyuan Inn)
Sister Su!

196
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,280
You...

197
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,520
What are you doing?

198
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,880
Put me down!

199
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,200
Put me down!

200
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,920
What are you doing?

201
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,840
Let go of me!

202
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,840
Let go of me!

203
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
Put me down!

204
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Little Su, we...

205
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,440
Let go of me!

206
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,560
Little Su!

207
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,400
Little Su, hear me out.

208
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,840
Don't touch me!

209
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Little Su, we have been through so much.

210
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,800
Don't I at least deserve

211
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,880
to know the truth?

212
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,720
Let go of me!

213
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
That's right.

214
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,360
All the things between us

215
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
have turned into a joke now.

216
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Why?

217
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
Because I'm a member of Bai Liang Clan.

218
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,040
And you

219
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,480
you're the murderer who exterminated my clan!

220
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
I just hate that I can't kill you myself.

221
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,920
The only thing I can do now

222
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,240
is to find out the truth

223
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,960
and prove our clan's innocence
to the world.

224
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,840
That's all I can do.

225
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
I killed your entire clan?

226
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,200
Little Su, is there a misunderstanding?

227
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,520
Misunderstanding?

228
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
That's impossible.

229
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,120
All these years

230
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,200
I spent every day

231
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,720
and every night

232
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,440
to recall that voice over and over again.

233
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,480
I can never forget

234
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,720
his tone and pronunciation.

235
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,760
It has been replaying in my mind
for thousands of times!

236
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,520
How could I possibly be wrong?

237
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,440
What voice?

238
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,320
The guard who stood
in front of me that day.

239
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,920
I was in the well

240
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,360
and I heard it so clear.

241
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,680
He's your man.

242
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
It's you.

243
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,720
It's you!

244
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,760
I sent Xiwen there to save the people!

245
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,200
But we were too late.

246
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,320
I don't believe you!

247
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,880
There were many doubts
in the Bai Liang case.

248
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,200
But it was a serious matter.

249
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,000
Things progressed rapidly
from top to bottom.

250
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
I was afraid there was more to it
than met the eyes.

251
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,880
So I sent Xiwen

252
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,800
to lead our men to stop it.

253
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,000
But we were too late.

254
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,200
Little Su.

255
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,360
If it was me who killed your clan,

256
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,280
why would I help you
with the investigation?

257
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,640
Unless it was me
who stitched your father up.

258
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,840
I help you with the investigation

259
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,080
just for a pretext to kill all of those
who are in the know.

260
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,320
Right?

261
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,880
-I won't listen to you!
-Little Su.

262
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,040
Little Su, hear me out.

263
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,600
Look at me.

264
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,840
If this is all true,

265
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,920
I can kill you right this moment.

266
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,120
So that no one will investigate
the Bai Liang case anymore.

267
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,520
Wouldn't it be more convenient for me?

268
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,080
I don't know.

269
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,120
I don't know.

270
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,800
The Battle of Honggu

271
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,120
is linked to the Bai Liang case.

272
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,160
Perhaps, you're keeping me alive

273
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,800
just in order to

274
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,520
make use of me

275
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,320
to find out the truth
behind the Battle of Honggu.

276
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,720
That's it.

277
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
That must be it.

278
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,160
That must be it.

279
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,280
So to you

280
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,480
I'm someone who schemes
in such a machiavellian way

281
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,720
and also a brutal man.

282
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,640
Right?

283
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,372

I don't know.

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,120

290

I hope you can agree

291
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,040
Let me investigate
the Bai Liang case with you.

292
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,560
This is also

293
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,640

299
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:48,222
(Maoyuan Inn)

300
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,680
All the dishes have been served.

301
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,200
Sirs, please go upstairs.

302
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,800
Take a look at the list of names.

303
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,000
The seven people on this list

304
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,560
were hired by Liang Feng

305
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,200
to make fake calligraphy for him.

306
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Liang Feng started collecting them
seven years ago.

307
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,760
That was right before the Bai Liang case
took place.

308
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,800
Wait a minute.

309
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,000
Brother Su.

310
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,319
Is the Bai Liang case you're talking about

311
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,400
the one where the clan leader
of Bai Liang Clan

312
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,520
colluded with the enemy
to murder the late emperor?

313
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,200
Isn't this case closed long ago?

314
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,960
After I was promoted,

315
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,200
I read some old case files.

316
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,520
I discovered

317
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,920
that the letter of treason,
the direct evidence of the Bai Liang case

318
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,000
was forged.

319
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
Forged?

320
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,840
What does it have to do
with the list of names?

321
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,080
The list...

322
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,080
Back then, Liang Feng

323
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,800
searched everywhere for the fake items.

324
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,720
There was a good chance

325
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
that he was searching
for the best imitator for Liang Zheng

326
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,840
to imitate the handwriting
of the clan leader of Bai Liang

327
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,160
and forged the letter.

328
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,800
Sister Su.

329
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,280
How did you know

330
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,120
that the letter was forged?

331
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,560
Have you forgotten
that in order to save me back then,

332
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,840
Little Su was able to tell
the ownership of the document

333
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,240
only by the small differences
in the paper?

334
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,160
It's the same for this.

335
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
Is that the case, Brother Su?

336
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,840
Yes.

337
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,480
This is a major royal case
and has serious implications.

338
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,040
I don't want to get all of you involved.

339
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
That's why I didn't tell you.

340
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,880
Brother Su!

341
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,520
There's no such thing.

342
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,560
To the outsiders,

343
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,920
we're a team.

344
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,800
-Right?
-Yes.

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,960
Unless you think we can't help you.

346
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,360
Of course not.

347
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,480
It's settled then.

348
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,520
Let's eat.

349
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,600
Let's eat.

350
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,960
Hurry.

351
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,240
I'll eat this.

352
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,520
-I'm starving.
-Here.

353
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,040
My Lord.

354
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,960
The things that Liang Feng hid
have been discovered.

355
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,920
And Su Ci

356
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,320
has already set out to find the scholars
on the list.

357
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,600
If they find out the secrets

358
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,280
behind the forged letters...

359
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,280
Su Ci

360
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,520
might reopen the case.

361
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,360
Go now.

362
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,600
Find Xiao Yanzhi and Su Ci at once.

363
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,960
Do everything you can to prevent them

364
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
from finding any clues
to the Bai Liang case.

365
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,520
If necessary,

366
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,840
kill them all.

367
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,280
Yes.

368
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,360
Go now.

369
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,160
Is this the place?

370
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,560
I've asked around.

371
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,800
This is the place.

372
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,480
What should we do?

373
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,040
This is the last person on the list.

374
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,760
Sir.

375
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,640
Miss.

376
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,600
May I ask you

377
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,640
if this was Li Mu's house?

378
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,080
Yes.

379
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
Where is he now?

380
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,760
Burned to death long ago.

381
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,560
Burned to death?

382
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,600
That's right.

383
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,240
A fine young man.

384
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,760
When they carried him out,

385
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
his body was charred.

386
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
How pitiful is that?

387
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,760
When did this happen?

388
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,880
About seven years ago.

389
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,640
Who are you?

390
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,680
Our friend sent us

391
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
to visit Li Mu.

392
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,760
We didn't expect
something like this to happen.

393
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,480
Did Li Mu have any relatives?

394
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,800
His parents died early.

395
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,480
I never heard of him
having any relatives or friends.

396
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,800
Well,

397
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,360
you won't be able to find him now.

398
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,680
(Maoyuan Inn)

399
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,800
Of all the scholars on this list,
Li Mu was the only one who died.

400
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,960
And it happened seven years ago.

401
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,400
I think he was the one
who forged the letter.

402
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,480
That's why he was killed.

403
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,320
But it was just a guess.

404
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,080
Perhaps, it was just a coincidence.

405
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,080
Whether he was killed or accident,

406
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,040
the local authority must have a record

407
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,320
on the fire incident.

408
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,720
How about this?

409
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,840
Let's split up into two teams.

410
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,480
Little Su and I will investigate the case
with the local authority.

411
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,160
Rushuang and Brother Xie

412
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,360
will go around the places
that Li Mu frequented.

413
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Find out who Li Mu

414
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,040
came in contact with

415
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,120
and what he did before he died.

416
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,400
All right.

417
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,560
I'll go on my own.

418
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,320
Sister Su.

419
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,280
Brother Pei.

420
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,600
It's fine.

421
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,600
Take a seat.

422
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
You need to learn from me

423
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,600
on how to coax girls.

424
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,320
First.

425
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,840
Be willing to spend money.

426
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480
You need to buy whatever necessary.

427
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,680
Second.

428
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,040
Let go of your pride.

429
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,160
Your pride doesn't matter.

430
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,920
Pester her if it so requires.

431
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,160
Then...

432
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,600
Judging from what you said,

433
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,360
you're feeling rather hard done by?

434
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,480
No.

435
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,040
No?

436
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,880
No, it's true.

437
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
I bet you must be suffering.

438
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,040
Not at all.

439

(Qifu County Office)

440
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,240
(Autopsy Reprt)
Found it.

441
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,800
Li Mu spent most of the time
on the streets of Qifu Town

442
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,280
and made a living as a ghostwriter.

443
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,160
When he died,

444
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,880
it was exactly one month
after the Bai Liang case.

445
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,280
What the heck

446
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,400
did you write?

447
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,000
What's the matter?

448
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,800
I wrote it as per your request.

449
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,440
Your sentences didn't make sense
and it has so many errors!

450
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,920
Have you ever ghostwritten before?

451
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,400
You must be a swindler!

452
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
What nonsense is this?

453
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,200
I wrote it as per your request!

454
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,360
You thought I've never asked someone
to ghostwrite for me?

455
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,000
Li Mu from Li Village helped me before!

456
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,920
He was better than you.

457
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,240
And the fee was a lot cheaper!

458

460
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,960
Go to him then!

461
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,040
Why did you ask for my help then?

462
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,280
I'll take the law into my own hands

463
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,600
and tear down your stall!

464

What's the matter?

There are signs of long-term use

Who is Li Wu?

00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,120
Why did he compare me to him?

486
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,760
Li Mu was like you.

487
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,040
He was a ghostwriter.

488
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,840
He was an educated person.

489
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,360
Back then,

490
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,680
he would stay in the city

491
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,400
and helped people to write letters.

492
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,920
I didn't see him hang out

493
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,040
with rogues.

494
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,360
That's right.

495
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,880
Where is he now?

496
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,080
He's dead.

497
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,680
Dead?

498
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,640
How did he die?

499
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,880
His house caught fire.

500
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,760
But he didn't manage to escape.

501
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,280
He was a good kid.

502
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,280
He was well-behaved.

503
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,360
He would step forward

504
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,200
to help the neighbours

505
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,720
with any laborious task.

506
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,360
But who would have expected...

507
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,440
How about his family?

508
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,560
He had no family.

509
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,760
He was all by himself.

510
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Even his funeral

511
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,080
was arranged by the villagers.

512
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,720
His body

513
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,720
was buried beside his parents' grave.

514
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,600
In my opinion,

515
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
his ancestral graveyard has bad fengshui.

516
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,520
The entire family is gone.

517
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
What's with the bad fengshui?

518
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,040
You aren't aware of that.

519
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,400
The graveyard

520
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,160
was built along the riverside.

521
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
So much negative energy.

522
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,280
That's true.

523
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,480
Fei Yuan.

524
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,840
Did that man really say

525
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,000
that Li Mu did a lot of laborious tasks?

526
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,000
Yes.

527
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,120
They said his ancestral graveyard
was built by the river.

528
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,000
It has bad fengshui.

529
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,120
That's why the family has no descendant.

530
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,960
That's right.

531
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,920
That's not possible.

532
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
The official case file

533
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,760
clearly stated that he had taken
long-term medication.

534
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,480
He failed to escape due to his weak body.

535
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
If he was weak,

536
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,720
how could he possibly help
with those tasks?

537
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,120
Was he lying to me?

538
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,160
That's impossible.

539
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,680
We put up quite a show

540
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,360
to prevent getting false information.

541
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,520
He must be telling the truth.

542
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,840
Right, Fei Yuan?

543
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,880
From the looks of it,

544
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
I need to go to the ruins
of the Li family again tomorrow.

545
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
Look. There's a jar here.

546
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,360
What a huge jar.

547
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
But he lived alone.

548
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,960
Why would he need such big rice jar?

549
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,000
If there was no external force,

550
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,760
such a big rice jar

551
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,400
wouldn't have easily toppled over.

552
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,040
There is no trace
of high temperature burning

553
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,280
in the soil under this rice jar.

554
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,760
It proves that the rice jar

555
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
was standing upright
when at the time of the fire.

556
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,800
Well, who would deliberately

557
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,600
pushed the jar over after the fire?

558
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,200
Watch out!

559
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,560
Brother Pei!

560
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,120
-Young Master!
-Fei Yuan!

561
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,720
The cellar is airtight.
One will easily suffocate to death!

562
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,680
Don't you get in there too.

563
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,680
But...

564
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,480
No buts!

565
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,600
Fei Yuan.

566
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,440
If it's too suffocated,

567
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,520
they'll come out themselves.

568
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,880
They finally get some time alone.

569
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,960
Let's not disturb them.

570
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,960
All right then.

571
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,400
Otherwise, who knows how long more

572
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,880
are they going to be at loggerheads.

573
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,080
Let's go.

574
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,520
Be careful.

575
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,120
It looks like someone used to live here.

576
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
Why would he live here?

577
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,680
Was he held in captivity

578
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
or was he in hiding?

579
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,720
Little Su.

580
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,120
Let's get out there.

581
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,240
Let go of me.

582
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,600
Look at you now.

583
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,000
Are you still trying to avoid me?

584
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
No way.

585
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,800
Sister Su!

586
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,440
Brother Pei!

587
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,240
Young Master.

588
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,440
Let me help you.

589
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,640
Young Master.

590
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,400
Come on. Be careful.

591
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,560
-Take a seat.
-Sit here.

592
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,880
Brother Pei, how are you?

593
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,280
How are you? Are you all right?

594
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,440
-Brother Pei!
-Young Master!

595
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,200
Check out on Brother Pei first.

596
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,800
Young Master!

597
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,080
Young Master!

598
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,800
We need to perform
mouth-to-mouth breathing.

599
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
Otherwise, the foul air in his lungs
can't be expelled.

600
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
His life will be in danger.

601
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,440
What?

602
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,680
Wake up.

603
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,800
Brother Pei!

604
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,640
You're going to be fine.

605
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,200
How are you?

606
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,160
Brother Pei.

607
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,680
How are you?

608
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,360
Little Su.

609
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,880
Young Master!

610
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,812
(Maoyuan Inn)

611
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
Young Master, how do you feel now?

612
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,800
Are you feeling better?

613
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,680
I'm fine now. Don't worry.

614
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,800
That's great then.

615
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,240
Little Fei Yuan.

616
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,720
Go and prepare some dishes!

617
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,520
Nurse him back to health.

618
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,520
You're right.

619
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,600
Wait for me.

620
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,680
What kind cellar did Li Mu build?

621
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
What was it even used for?

622
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,320
He almost got both of you killed.

623
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,600
I think someone was hiding in there.

624
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,880
That's why he managed to escape from fire.

625
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,200
But I heard from the villagers

626
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,880
that Li Mu's body was charred.

627
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,440
It's exactly because the body was charred.

628
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,280
That's why no one could tell

629
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,280
if that was Li Mu.

630
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,520
Are you saying

631
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,480
that Li Mu might still be alive?

632
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,880
That's possible.

633
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,920
Li Mu is alive?

634
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,920
Perhaps not.

635
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,680
Perhaps, when Li Mu died,

636
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,200
there was someone else in his house.

637
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,680
This person hid in the cellar
and survived.

638
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,840
Well, how are we going to find him?

639
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,040
If he's still alive,

640
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,400
he might be related to the Li family.

641
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,800
Brother Pei.

642
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,880
Stop playing riddles with me.

643
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,600
I wouldn't be able to guess it.

644
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,000
The graveyard.

645
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,720
Let's check it out tomorrow.

646
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,400
The graveyard?

647
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,240
Did that man really say

648
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,360
that Li Mu did a lot of laborious tasks?

649
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,400
Yes.

650
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,560
They said his ancestral graveyard
was built by the river.

651
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,520
It has bad fengshui.

652
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,680
That's why the family has no descendant.

653
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,640
That's right.

654
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,360
Hold on.

655
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,000
I have another plan.

656
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,400
I wonder

657
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,720
if you'll be interested.

658
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:02,310
(Announcement)

659
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,360
They want to dig up the wasteland
for water supply purposes.

660
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,320
That's a good thing.

661
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,960
But it's a misery

662
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,400
for those who have had graveyards

663
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,240
built on these two wasteland.

664
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,320
They need to move the graves
within seven days.

665
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,520
I think these two wasteland

666
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
have bad fengshui.

667
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,920
No one builds a grave on it.

668
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,760
Right?

669
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,760
Yes.

670
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,000
That's right.

671
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,200
Young Master.

672
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,600
Here.

673
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:44,067
(Li Mu's Grave)

674
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,800
Sir.

675
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,480
They have been investigating
Li Mu's identity and cause of death.

676
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,160
Li Mu is already dead.

677
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,720
What's there to investigate?

678
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,720
With Su Ci's ability

679
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,600
and Prince Qi's guidance,
