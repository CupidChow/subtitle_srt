(Episode 19)

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,080
Commander Fu.

16
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,440
Since the Princess was poisoned,

17
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,200
you've been waiting outside the door every day.

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,720
Li Yu has escaped now.

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,280
Why don't you take a break?

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,840
It is because the murderer has escaped

21
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,680
and to prevent her
from harming the Princess

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
that I need to keep guard closely.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,520
Thank you then.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
It's my duty.

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,960
Take a look.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,560
No, thank you.

27
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,640
Little Su.

28
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,360
You knew at first

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
that Li Yu's document
belonged to Lei Zheng, right?

30
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,160
Yes.

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,800
Take a look!

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Lei Zheng always smokes tobacco.

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,240
He's got light yellow tobacco tar
on the fingers.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,240
Traces of tobacco tar
were left on that paper.

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,000
If I were to say straightforward,

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,720
he would definitely
accuse me of making it up.

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,640
After all, I was the only one who saw it.

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
So

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,640
only by proving that he had
forged the document

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,320
could we reveal his crime.

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,520
His Majesty praised you

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,880
and even promised me

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,640
that as long as you could solve the crisis,

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
he would personally appoint
you as a female officer.

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,320
To solve the crisis,

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,760
we should first find the antidote.

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,800
The marriage alliance
is a half measure.

48
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,360
Now that the truth has come to light,

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,240
I can call off the engagement

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,440
as soon as the Princess recovers.

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,360
Time is running out for the Princess.

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,400
We don't even have a clue

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,120
about the last ingredient of the poison.

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Right now,

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,560
Rushuang can only work on it one by one.

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,720
The last one.

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,000
What's the last one?

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
A banquet will be held at Lord Liu's residence

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,200
and they've prepared
many special dishes.

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,560
Will you go there?

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
My mother said

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,480
they sent us the invitation.

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,560
It's not good if we don't go.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,000
But I know their intention.

65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,040
They just want me

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,040
to marry Lord Liu's dumb son.

67
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,120
How annoying.

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,640
Why would Li Yu have the reception document?

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
Why did she wait until the banquet

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
since she was close to the Princess for so long?

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,400
They knew from the document

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,400
that I would receive the delegation.

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,800
From the moment Shuomo

74
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,160
proposed the marriage alliance
at the court,

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,680
they set this trap for me.

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,000
If they used your banquet
to set this trap,

77
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,680
the former three ingredients
were just paving the way

78
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
for the place where

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,400
the last poison worked.

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,640
Only then

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
could they stitch you up

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,040
for the crime of poisoning the Princess.

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,600
So the last one

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,400
must appear on the banquet.

85
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,920
But there were so many foods at the banquet.

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,560
Which one was the last poison?

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
It's Beirong's food.

88
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you sure?

89
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,720
When hosting the delegation, it's customary

90
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,640
to prepare their special local dishes

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,920
at the banquet.

92
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
All they had to do is to conjecture

93
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
the food that I'd prepare at the banquet.

94
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,720
What were the dishes?

95
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,240
Cheese.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,960
Kumis.

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,360
Cold noodles.

98
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
Are you sure?

99
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,640
These three dishes.

100
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,160
I'll test them

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,560
and make the antidote.

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,720
That's great.

103
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
Rushuang, are you going
to stay up late again?

104
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,400
-I'll keep you company.
-All right.

105
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,680
No.

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,880
By the elimination method,

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,920
this isn't the poison as well.

108
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,400
Rushuang.

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,240
I...

110
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,120
My heart is beating so fast.

111
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,600
You...

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,880
Is yours the same?

113
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,160
Yes.

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,960
Rushuang.

115
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,880
We...

116
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,000
Are we poisoned?

117
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
There

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
are so many sorts of poisonous powder.

119
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,960
We'll easily get poisoned.

120
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,320
Exactly.

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,800
You are poisoned.

122
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,360
Am I poisoned?

123
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,800
What should I do?

124
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,000
I am poisoned!

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,200
I am poisoned!

126
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Have the antidote then.

127
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,200
Such a fool.

128
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,080
I've made it.

129
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,320
Wake up.

130
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,440
Xie Beiming, wake up!

131
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,559
Xie Beiming!

132
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Look! I've made it.

133
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
Get up!

134
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,559
Look!

135
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,320
I did it!

136
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,303
(Capital Suburb Inn)

137
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,520
It's too bitter. I don't want to drink it.

138
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,720
You still have to.

139
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,160
Ms. Rushuang said

140
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,800
with a few doses

141
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,200
your hair would back to normal.

142
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,880
Here.

143
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,520
Where's my brother?

144
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,720
As you got poisoned,

145
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,440
the peace talks were delayed.

146
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,040
His Highness has gone into the palace.

147
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,520
I should thank Detective Su

148
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,640
and Ms. Rushuang.

149
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,400
There is another one you should thank.

150
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,920
Who?

151
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,560
Your Highness,
ever since you lost consciousness,

152
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,520
Commander Fu has been guarding
by the door.

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,680
He has lost so much weight.

154
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,000
Even at night?

155
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
Send him in.

156
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,040
But you're not properly dressed.

157
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
May I help you get changed?

158
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,960
No, it's fine.

159
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,200
But...

160
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,680
Go on.

161
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,640
All right.

162
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,040
Commander Fu.

163
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,960
Her Highness is asking for you.

164
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,680
Your Highness.

165
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,200
Rise.

166
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,880
Your Highness, are you feeling better?

167
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,960
That's great then.

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,640
May I know

169
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,840
what I can do for you?

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,960
Little Yue said
that ever since I got poisoned,

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,160
you have been guarding me
all this time.

172
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,840
I don't like to be indebted to others.

173
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,640
Tell me.

174
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,240
How should I repay you?

175
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,080
It's my duty to protect Your Highness.

176
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,600
There's no need to repay me.

177
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,320
If there's nothing else,

178
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,960
I shall take my leave.

179
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,360
Your duty?

180
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
(Royal Announcement)
"In response to the public,

181
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,200
the Imperial College

182
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,040
shall set up a department
for female officials today.

183
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,880
Look!

184
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,240
His Majesty is to implement
a female official system.

185
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,960
So

186
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
now women really can be officials.

187
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,400
Exactly.

188
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,480
I've heard Su Ci is a female
detective in Mingjing Office.

189
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
She's as good as the men.

190
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,240
Thanks to her saving the Princess,

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,520
the female official system

192
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,920
can finally be implemented.

193
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,080
I should hurry up to send my
daughter to the school.

194
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,920
Let her work in Mingjing Office in the future

195
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,680
and learn from Detective Su.

196
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,600
Detective Su!

197
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,960
-Detective Su!
-Detective Su!

198
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,080
Detective Su!

199
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
You've lied to us for so long.

200
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,160
Yeah.

201
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,040
Yeah. It's too long.

202
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,120
From now on,

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,680
no one should boast his powers of observation.

204
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,240
Yes.

205
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,000
We've worked with Detective Su for years.

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,520
But no one has ever noticed it!

207
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,520
All I can say is that Detective Su is so heroic

208
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,640
that she's no worse than men!

209
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,520
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You get to the point.

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,440
I had no choice

211
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,640
but to hide my identity.

212
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,280
I hope you can pardon me.

213
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,320
That's too much.

214
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't be like that.

215
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,280
We shall ride on your coattails.

216
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,280
-Right?
-Yes!

217
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,120
Why are you so noisy?

218
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,200
Lead Officer.

219
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,080
Lead Officer.

220
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,480
You've just recovered
from the poisoning.

221
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
Why not take more rests?

222
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,800
Please don't worry about me.

223
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
I'm all right now.

224
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,200
That's great then.

225
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Listen up!

226
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,400
Mingjing Office is the place
to investigate cases.

227
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
There's no gender discrimination here.

228
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,080
Do your business as usual. Got it?

229
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,160
Yes!

230
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,800
You're particularly interested
in the confidential files

231
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,880
in the archive room, aren't you?

232
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,120
Now that you have been promoted,

233
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,280
you have the right to read them.

234
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,450
(Sun Lin Bribery Case)

235
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:42,063
(Bai Liang Clan's Case)

236
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,200
Letter of collaboration?

237
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,320
No.

238
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,120
Although the handwriting is similar,

239
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,280
it's definitely
not my father's.

240
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
(Bai Sheng, the head of Bai Liang Clan,
colluding with Fan Yan Na,)

241
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
(poisoned late emperor through tributes)

242
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:42,589
(Lei Zheng was in charge
of Bai Liang Clan's case)

243
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,160
Lei Zheng?

244
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,080
I've never thought Bai Liang Clan's case

245
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,880
was actually handled by Lei Zheng.

246
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,000
Detective Su.

247
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,680
While you were away,

248
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,640
the Lead Officer told me
to do the remaining work

249
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,680
of the case of Lei Zheng.

250
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,360
I have sorted the files.

251
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,280
I'll leave them to you now.

252
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,360
Lei Zheng's residence
is still under inspection.

253
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,600
Since you're back,
you can go there yourself.

254
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,480
I have other cases to handle.

255
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,760
Thank you.

256
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,960
Also, I found a marking

257
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,000
on Lei Zheng's body.

258
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,840
It's very similar to the one

259
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,680
you were looking for.

260
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,560
Have a look.

261
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,160
Come and look.

262
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,400
Come on and look.

263
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,320
The rouge from this store is good.

264
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,120
That's right.

265
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,520
I often buy it here.

266
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,120
Really?

267
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,040
Commander Fu.

268
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,240
I'v heard that there are
many sorts of rouge.

269
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,760
Come with me
and pick up a few.

270
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,040
Your Highness.

271
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,760
Let the guards go with you.

272
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll wait for you at the door.

273
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,120
Why?

274
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,760
You were the one who always
kept me company.

275
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,680
To be honest,

276
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,560
My late wife often asked me

277
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,640
to accompany her to buy rouge.

278
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Now she's gone,

279
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,400
I don't want to go
there anymore.

280
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,920
She's already gone.

281
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,640
You need to let go of the past

282
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
and start a new life.

283
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,480
Your Highness.

284
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,520
You haven't found the person you like.

285
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,080
You don't know how hard it is
to forget someone.

286
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,720
Who says I don't have anyone I like?

287
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,320
You're the one I like.

288
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,120
Your Highness,
please don't tease me.

289
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm not!

290
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,680
I like you.

291
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,360
Your Highness.

292
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,320
Prince Qi is the one you should like.

293
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,880
I don't like Prince Qi.

294
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,120
But you are getting married soon.

295
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,040
I'll ask my brother
to call off the engagement.

296
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,880
Even if you don't like Prince Qi,

297
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,319
you shouldn't like me either.

298
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,280
Why can't I like you?

299
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,760
I already have someone I love.

300
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,319
I won't fall in love with anyone else.

301
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,920
You...

302
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,880
Don't you like me?

303
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,520
No.

304
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,319
You've been guarding me

305
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,800
when I got poisoned.

306
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,599
It's my duty to protect you.

307
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
Am I only a Princess

308
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,200
to you?

309
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
Of course, you're also my friend.

310
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,160
Even friends can turn into lovers.

311
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,280
Right?

312
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,120
Your Highness.

313
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,840
Don't waste your time on me.

314
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,840
It's not worth it.

315
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,160
Come on.

316
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,080
Sir, please come upstairs.

317
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
How's Princess Yunchuan now?

318
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,120
Don't worry.

319
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,160
She's all good now.

320
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,280
It'll not affect your engagement.

321
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,760
Fortunately, she's blessed to escape this time.

322
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,000
Otherwise,

323
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,720
I cannot get away with it.

324
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,320
No need to blame yourself.

325
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,000
The murderer has been executed.

326
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,400
It has nothing to do with you.

327
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,920
But

328
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,000
I wonder why Lei Zheng

329
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,040
poisoned Yunchuan?

330
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,840
Shuomu.

331
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,760
To be frank,

332
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,360
Lei Zheng's target

333
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,280
was me.

334
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,840
What?

335
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,480
You don't get it.

336
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,360
All these years

337
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
I might be a Prince sitting idle.

338
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,560
But I've been targeted.

339
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,200
Someone's always trying to

340
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,640
kill me.

341
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,640
I'm treading on thin ice every day

342
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,120
wary of being killed.

343
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,920
Once I went travelling

344
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,720
and I almost got killed.

345
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,600
But it will be better now.

346
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,760
Princess Yunchuan and I
are getting married soon.

347
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,320
With the support from Beirong,

348
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,120
I can live safe and sound now.

349
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Come on. Drink up.

350
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,720
Drink up.

351
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,480
Come on.

352
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,560
Brother.

353
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,240
I have something to discuss with you.

354
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,160
Okay.

355
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,760
So do I.

356
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,320
You go first.

357
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,400
What is it?

358
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,040
Well...

359
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,800
The Prince Qi I chose for you...

360
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,520
He's not a good choice.

361
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,680
How so?

362
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,160
He's just a Prince sitting idle.

363
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,200
He has no other supports

364
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,920
and is often targeted.

365
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,160
I'm worried...

366
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,360
You're worried that I'd have a
hard time if I married him?

367
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,000
Not only the hard time.

368
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,200
Also...

369
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,960
you might get into danger.

370
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,680
Just call of the engagement then.

371
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,720
You...

372
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,240
Won't you feel upset?

373
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,160
What's there to be upset about?

374
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,880
You were the one who chose Prince Qi.

375
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,280
Besides, I'm here waiting for you

376
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
to tell you

377
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
that I don't want to marry Prince Qi.

378
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,480
Yunchuan.

379
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Don't worry.

380
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,440
I'll surely find a good husband for you.

381
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,240
Don't bother.

382
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,680
I can pick one myself.

383
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,000
I didn't know what it's
to like someone before.

384
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,440
I always thought the one you chose
must be the best.

385
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,320
But now I have someone I like,

386
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,160
I can't just get married
to someone I don't like.

387
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,920
You have someone you like?

388
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,840
Who is it?

389
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,280
I'm not telling you.

390
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,280
Shuomu.

391
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,400
When you call off the engagement tomorrow,

392
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,160
help me ask His Majesty for a favour.

393
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,920
Prince Shuomu, what brings you here?

394
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,840
Your Majesty.

395
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,520
The covenant has been signed.

396
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,560
Soon after the truce,

397
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,920
the trade at the border
will be resumed.

398
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
My mission has been achieved.

399
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,120
I will leave for Beirong tomorrow.

400
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
As for...

401
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Princess Yunchuan's marriage...

402
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I hope Your Majesty can call it off.

403
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,960
What...

404
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,480
Why is that?

405
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,120
Your Majesty.

406
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,480
Previously, I was so rash

407
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,760
that I suggested a marriage
alliance for my sister.

408
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
After much deliberation,

409
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,600
my sister was spoiled by my
father since youth.

410
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,800
She has a really bad temper.

411
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,720
I find it inappropriate.

412
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,800
Princess Yunchuan

413
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,960
must be a straightforward
and cheerful person.

414
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,240
Girls like her

415
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,880
are to my liking.

416
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,320
No.

417
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,600
You are not familiar with her.

418
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,480
If she were to marry you,

419
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
in less than three days

420
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,680
she would even tear down the walls.

421
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,640
Well...

422
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,680
The marriage alliance is to
consolidate our friendship.

423
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
If it gave rise to conflicts...

424
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,520
all our previous efforts
would be in vain.

425
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,440
It looks like I'm not that lucky to marry her.

426
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,840
It's my sister who is unlucky to lose it.

427
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,520
Prince Shuomu, don't be sorry.

428
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,560
We have so many young and
talented men in our country.

429
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm sure she can find the right one.

430
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,720
Since you two have no objection,

431
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,960
the engagement is canceled then.

432
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

433
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

434
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,440
My sister...

435
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,680
has another request.

436
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,440
"The Emperor

437
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,040
(Imperial Edict)
who follows the Mandate of Heaven declares

438
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,440
Fu Ziyou has rendered great merits for

439
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,400
protecting Princess Yunchuan
and he shall be reinstated.

440
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,242
As decreed by His Majesty."

441
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,840
Come on.

442
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,760
Put them in order.

443
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,400
Yes.

444
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,040
Commander Fu.

445
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,360
Your Highness.

446
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,200
Thank you for all this time.

447
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,680
It's my duty.

448
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
Your Highness, have a safe journey.

449
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,320
Commander Fu!

450
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:01,797
(Capital Suburb Inn)

451
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,760
Your Highness.

452
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,640
You've been reinstated.

453
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,920
So are you happy?

454
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,200
Your Highness.

455
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,240
How do you know that?

456
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,440
Of course I know.

457
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,760
Well.

458
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,320
Take this.

459
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,880
It's the sword tassel made on my own.

460
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,240
I don't owe you anything now.

461
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,200
Your Highness.

462
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,760
You don't have to do this.

463
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,800
It's up to me.

464
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,280
I know you still can't forget
your late wife.

465
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
But I'm giving you this sword tassel

466
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,520
merely to express my feelings.

467
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
Yes, I like you.

468
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,120
But I'll not force you
to like me in return.

469
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,440
Today, I will be going back to
Beirong with my brother.

470
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,800
Perhaps

471
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,080
I might continue to like you.

472
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,720
Or perhaps, I might forget you soon.

473
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,000
It doesn't matter if you like me.

474
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,600
It's my own business.

475
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,880
It's none of your business.

476
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,440
Commander Fu.

477
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
We shall meet again.

478
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,800
Xiwen.

479
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,960
Your Highness, how's it?

480
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,440
Shuomu called off the engagement.

481
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,120
Congrats, Your Highness!

482
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,560
Where's Little Su?

483
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
Detective Su is inspecting the Lei mansion.

484
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,080
Your Highness, where are you going?

485
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
To see Little Su.

486
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:53,342
(Lei Mansion)

487
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,960
Little Su.

488
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,040
Where did she go?

489
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,120
Sir.

490
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,760
We couldn't find Detective Su anywhere.

491
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,680
Detective Su probably has left.

492
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,600
Tell them to lock the door
and go back.

493
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,480
We shall continue tomorrow.

494
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,040
Yes.

495
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,200
Are you all right?

496
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,920
I'm fine.

497
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,400
That's great then.

498
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,560
We should find a way to get out.

499
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,520
People will gossip

500
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,040
if they see us like this.

501
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,560
Let them.

502
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,040
No matter what,

503
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,560
I'm going to marry you.

504
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,080
The one you're engaged with

505
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,000
is Princess Yunchuan.

506
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,960
It's inappropriate for you to say this.

507
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,280
What if I'm not engaged anymore?

508
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,120
What do you mean?

509
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,960
The engagement

510
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,080
was called off.

511
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,120
Really?

512
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,640
Really?

513
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,840
Little Su.

514
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,240
I've never thought

515
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,600
you like me so much.

516
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,800
I...

517
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,560
I'm not!

518
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,080
Are you all right?

519
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
Are you all right?

520
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
It looks like we need to get out soon.

521
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,720
Otherwise, I'll get bruised all over.

522
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,920
This must be a trap
that Lei Zheng set up

523
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,320
in fear of others
stealing his stolen goods.

524
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,560
Hold on.

525
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,440
Don't move.

526
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,040
Be careful.

527
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,640
Come on.

528
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,000
Thank god that you're fine.

546

It's moving!
His tongue moved!

547
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,600
His tongue moved.

548
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,120
-What about me?
-You...

549
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,080
I didn't!
Say something!

550
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,560
You make me feel ashamed.

551
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,520
Don't just eat,

552
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,800
say something.

553
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
Rushuang, why are you crying?

554
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,040
Did I say something wrong?

555
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,120
If it tastes bad,

556
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,040
I'll make you another one.

557
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,400
Rushuang, don't cry.

558
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,200
Maybe because you have your own target.

559
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,960
The reason I like to travel around

560
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
and bring justice to people

561
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,280
is that I don't want to sit idle.

562
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,640
to just do nothing every day.

563
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,160
I hope I can be the one

564
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,520
who is needed.

565
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,680
Rushuang.

566
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,440
You have to believe in yourself.

567
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
You can do it.

568
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,240
If you can't do it,

569
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,880
there is no one else who can

570
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,000
in this world.

571
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,280
My heart is beating so fast.

572
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,120
Rushuang.

573
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
We...

574
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:36,384
Are we poisoned?

575
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,880
Why this fool
still hasn't said that he likes me.

576
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,440
From the moment Shuomo proposed

577
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,640
the marriage alliance at the court,

578
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,340
they set this trap for me.

579
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,660
If they used your banquet
to set this trap,

580
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,500
the former three ingredients
were just paving the way

581
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,260
for the place where the last poison worked.

582
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,380
Only then

583
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,580
could they stitch you up

584
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,580
for the crime of poisoning the Princess.

585
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,980
So the last one

586
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,980
must appear on the banquet.

587
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,820
But there were so many foods at the banquet.

588
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,900
Which one was the last poison?

589
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,580
Your Majesty.

590
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,340
As per the agreed itinerary,

591
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,540
I have listed the arrangements
for the delegation

592
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,260
on the document.

593
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,260
Please check it, Your Majesty.

594
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,240
♪ The whimpering of the flute
and the faraway star ♪

595
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,100
Brother, I'll leave it to you.

596
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,260
Beirong people are friendly
and good at martial arts.

597
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,860
On the day of the banquet,

598
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,020
you'll hold it at your mansion.

599
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,060
Your Majesty, allow me to interrupt.

600
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,700
When hosting the delegation, it's customary

601
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,100
to prepare their special local dishes.

602
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,060
You're right, Uncle.

603
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,780
Beirong and Liang differ greatly in diet.

604
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,540
They might not get used
to our food.

605
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
I'll take note of that.

606
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,380
It's Beirong's food.

607
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,180
Are you sure?

608
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,180
When hosting the delegation, it's customary

609
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,420
to prepare their special local dishes

610
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,780
at the banquet.

611
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,740
All they had to do is to conjecture

612
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,860
the food that I'd prepare at the banquet.

613
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,340
What were the dishes?

614
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,740
Cheese, kumis, and cold noodles.
