(Episode 16)

Long Live the King.

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,920
Rise!

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you, Your Majesty!

18
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,080
Liu Yuanhong, the Director
of the Ministry of Works

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
is promoted to a fifth rank official.

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,960
Summon Liu Yuanhong!

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Your Majesty.

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,640
Xu Shaoqing from Ministry of Personnel.

23
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,120
Summon Xu Shaoqing.

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,480
(Mingjing Office, Su Ci)

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,640
Su Ci, Detective

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,240
of Mingjing Office

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
is promoted to a fifth rank official.

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,480
Summon Su Ci!

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,760
Rise.

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,240
Father.

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,640
Mother.

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm finally promoted
to a fifth rank official.

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,840
I'll have permission to view
the top-secret files.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,040
I'll surely clear
the name of Bai Liang Clan.

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,760
Detective Su, you may dismiss yourself.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,080
Hold on!

37
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,880
Your Majesty.

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,880
I have a report to make.

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
I received a secret report

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
that someone in Mingjing Office
is a woman disguised as a man

41
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
duping the sovereign.

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,880
That's outrageous.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,640
There's something so ridiculous?

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,240
I have an ironclad proof.

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,640
This painting is...

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
Is this...

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
It's him.

48
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,920
That's quite a resemblance.

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,360
Your Majesty.

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,880
I'm sure

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,000
all of you have heard
of the wedding dress serial killing

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,920
not too long ago.

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,840
The murderer Qu Linjiang,
had a booklet at home

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,680
recording all the information
of his victims.

55
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840
The last page of this booklet

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,920
was Detective Su Ci

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,000
of the Mingjing Office.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,640
So it's really him.

59
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,240
Officer Lei.

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,000
I heard that the victims of that case

61
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,399
were all women.

62
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,079
That's right.

63
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,440
But I have no idea how

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,240
Detective Su escaped
Qu Linjiang's murder

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,640
and tore off the last page of the booklet

66
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,920
to cover up her identity.

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,800
Unfortunately, Qu Linjiang

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,200
drew the portraits of all his victims

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,600
and the last page

70
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,160
was Detective Su.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
It was really Detective Su?

72
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,520
This is a crime of deceiving the monarch!

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,240
That's a capital crime.

74
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,960
She's out of her mind.

75
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,600
Why did she do that?

76
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,360
Why would she do such a thing?

77
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,480
Your Majesty.

78
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,520
The last page of Qu Linjiang's booklet

79
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
was indeed missing.

80
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,600
But how did Officer Lei verify

81
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
that the information on the last page

82
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,320
is mine?

83
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,200
Officer Lei said I was
the woman in the painting.

84
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,800
I can also say

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,800
that the one in the painting
is another woman.

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
After all, there are so many people
in the world

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,160
who look alike.

88
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,200
How can I be convicted

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840
with just a painting?

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,640
Your Majesty.

91
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,320
I heard that Qu Linjiang became delirious

92
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,880
after he was put behind bars.

93
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,800
I'm afraid

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,200
this painting cannot be used as evidence.

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,760
Your Majesty.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,120
I have a witness.

97
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,800
I would like
to seek Your Majesty's permission

98
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,640
to confront Su Ci.

99
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Who is it?

100
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,640
Xiao Junhao, son of Marquis Yongan.

101
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,920
What does he have to do with this?

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,280
He's the one who tipped me off

103
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,720
that Su Ci was a woman
disguising as a man

104
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,160
with an evil intention
against the government.

105
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,640
As for Prince Qi,

106
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,280
His Highness knew Su Ci's identity
but kept defending her

107
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,960
and tortured and coerced Xiao Junhao

108
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,280
to stop him from
exposing Su Ci's identity

109
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
to the government.

110
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,200
May I ask Your Highness

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
if what I'm saying is true?

112
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Xiao Junhao is notorious

113
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,360
in the capital for his misconduct.

114
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
That day, he kidnapped
the government official.

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,240
I happened to pass by
and rescued the official.

116
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,720
How did it turn into threats?

117
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,920
Prince Qi.

118
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,920
That's just your story.

119
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,320
I don't believe it.

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,800
Your Majesty.

121
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,280
It's better to bring the witness here

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,560
and question him instead.

123
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,080
Bring him in.

124
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,480
Bring Xiao Junhao in!

125
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,120
Your Majesty.

126
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm innocent!

127
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,600
Take us through what happened that day.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,680
Your Majesty.

129
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,360
That day, I invited Detective Su
to my place for a drink.

130
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,520
Detective Su got drunk

131
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,200
and revealed her identity
as a woman.

132
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,760
Just when I wanted to report it,

133
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,680
Prince Qi suddenly showed up

134
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,400
and knocked me out.

135
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,640
I was even exiled!

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,360
You twisted the facts.

137
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
A bunch of nonsense!

138
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,320
How presumptuous!

139
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,040
Su Ci!

140
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,480
This is the imperial court.

141
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,280
You're in no position to speak here.

142
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,000
Take him away.

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,080
-Yes!
-Yes!

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,880
Xiao Junhao kidnapped
the government official

145
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
and was up to no good.

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
There's solid evidence!

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,600
And now, he's here
making such irresponsible remarks!

148
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,200
That's right.

149
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,000
Where's the evidence?

150
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,160
How is he to argue that?

151
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,040
He's talking nonsense.

152
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,119
If Detective Su is innocent,

153
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,560
we can do an inspection right here!

154
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,440
Isn't it?

155
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,760
Check on the spot!

156
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,280
-Examine!
-Have a check!

157
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,440
A mere check and it'll be settled.

158
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,840
Do it, and it'll all come to light.

159
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
She has a guilty conscience.

160
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,200
Your Majesty.

161
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
Please don't do that.

162
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,880
If Su Ci is innocent

163
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,800
and he has to suffer such humiliation here,

164
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
how are the Mingjing officers

165
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,600
going to serve Your Majesty in the future?

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

167
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
If anyone could fabricate testimony

168
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,520
and insult the government officials

169
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,480
to force them to prove their innocence,

170
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,480
where's the integrity of law?

171
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,800
Your Majesty.

172
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,480
We can't set such precedents.

173
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,800
Prince Qi.

174
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,640
You stood up to defend him.

175
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,880
Could you be involved in this too?

176
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Su Ci

177
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,120
hid her identity
in the Mingjing Office.

178
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,680
She lied to His Majesty, besides,

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,120
if she had an ulterior motive,

180
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,760
how should you be punished for it?

181
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,720
Guards.

182
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,200
Verify her identity on the spot!

183
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,240
Who dares!

184
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,280
Prince Qi.

185
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,960
How dare you snarl

186
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,760
in front of His Majesty and the officials?

187
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,120
This is a crime of deceiving the monarch!

188
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,880
Your Majesty,
please punish her for the crime!

189
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,040
I see.

190
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,040
His real target is Prince Qi.

191
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,800
It's true. I disguised as a man
and got into Mingjing Office.

192
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,400
What...

193
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,960
She...

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
I confess.

195
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,520
I hereby return the document.

196
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,040
Little Su.

197
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,120
But Prince Qi didn't know about this.

198
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,760
Your Majesty, please don't blame him.

199
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:40,732
(Prisoner)

200
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,400
Get in there.

201
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,680
Something went wrong
with the man that I sent

202
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,600
to keep an eye on Xiao Junhao.

203
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Your Highness, please punish me for it.

204
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,440
Get up.

205
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,000
Your Highness.

206
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,720
Why don't you plead with His Majesty?

207
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,400
There's solid evidence.

208
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,320
No point pleading with His Majesty.

209
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,520
The only solution now

210
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,280
is to persuade His Majesty

211
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,640
to implement a female official system.

212
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,800
Arrange for the people

213
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,880
to bring petitions
to the Ministry of Justice

214
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
to request the release of Detective Su.

215
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,600
Also

216
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,440
ask the Imperial College

217
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,480
to build up public opinion

218
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,240
and ask His Majesty to allow women
to go to school.

219
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,280
Yes, I'll get to it now.

220
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,160
Remember.

221
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,680
Raise a stink.

222
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,760
What a shame.

223
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,560
Su Ci stole a march on us
and confessed to it first.

224
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,760
We didn't manage

225
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,080
to implicate Xiao Yanzhi in it.

226
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
But

227
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,640
Su Ci is in our grasp now.

228
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,600
We can take Xiao Yanzhi down
one way or another.

229
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,440
My Lord.

230
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,960
Now,

231
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,320
why don't we use Su Ci
to set a trap?

232
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,360
Whether Xiao Yanzhi

233
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,280
will walk into the trap or not,

234
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,000
it all depends on

235
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,720
how important

236
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Su Ci is to him.

237
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,800
The crime of deceiving the monarch
is

238
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,040
familial extermination.

239
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,040
Anyone who has anything to do with her

240
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,600
will be executed.

241
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,920
That's right.

242
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,360
If their real target was Brother Pei

243
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,640
I'm afraid...

244
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Sister Su must be suffering now.

245
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,560
Why isn't Brother Pei back yet?

246
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,040
We can't wait any longer!

247
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,160
Given my capability,

248
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
I don't believe
I won't be able to save Brother Su!

249
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
How are you going to save her?

250
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Xie Beiming!

251
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:16,323
(Name: Su Ci, Gender: Male)

252
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,040
A male?

253
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,240
Su Ci.

254
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,360
How did you trick
the census register officer?

255
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,840
I was raised as a boy since I was a kid.

256
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
There was nothing to lie about it.

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,440
You're known as the great detective.

258
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,240
Are you not able to tell
if you're a male or female now?

259
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,440
Even if you have no common sense,

260
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,280
that can't be the reason
for deceiving His Majesty

261
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,880
and becoming an official.

262
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,480
Isn't it the ambition of scholars

263
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,560
to be selected through
the imperial examinations

264
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,000
to be officials one day?

265
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,640
Why am I wrong?

266
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,720
Mingjing Office is directly
under His Majesty

267
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,600
and with great authority.

268
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,680
What's your motive of infiltrating it?

269
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm only good at solving cases.

270
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,120
Of course, it's to make a living.

271
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,360
If you're not going to tell the truth,

272
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
it's fine.

273
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,200
Anyone who enters the prison
of the Ministry of Justice

274
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,280
will always leave something behind.

275
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,040
Either it's the truth

276
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,520
or

277
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,640
their lives.

278
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm telling the whole truth.

279
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,040
Su Ci.

280
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,400
Lead Officer Liu can't help you forever.

281
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,040
You'd better think carefully

282
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,680
how to answer my questions.

283
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,960
No matter how many times you ask,

284
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,760
my answer is the same.

285
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,160
Fine.

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,400
Fine.

287
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,560
Let her try the torture instrument.

288
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,040
Yes.

289
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,880
Detective Su.

290
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,160
Still not willing to tell the truth?

291
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
I have nothing to say.

292
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,480
Beat her to death.

293
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,320
Hit hard.

294
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,800
Brother Wang.

295
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,200
Li Wan.

296
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,440
Excuse me.

297
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:24,680
(Petition)

298
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,560
(Imperial College)

299
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,294
(Feiyun Inn)

300
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:34,920
(Closed today)
This jailbreak is extremely dangerous.

301
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,840
Failure is not an option.

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,080
Are you going to talk or not?

303
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,760
You sure are stubborn.

304
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,360
Continue to beat her up!

305
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,960
Yes!

306
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
(Legal Code of Liang Dynasty:
Theft and Robbery Law）

307
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,440
I thought I was doing a good job
in disguising myself.

308
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,240
I was very careful all these years.

309
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,520
Well, it turned out that
I've been lying to myself.

310
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,160
Little Su.

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,560
I'll surely save you.

312
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,760
What a joke!

313
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,160
Shouldn't they just stay home
to raise their children?

314
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,520
-That's right.
-Women cannot be officials.

315
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,160
How is that appropriate?

316
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,840
What's wrong if women become officials?

317
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,400
That's right.

318
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,400
How inappropriate!

319
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,720
That's just outrageous.

320
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,240
Your Majesty.

321
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Prince Qi would like
to seek an audience.

322
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,280
Send him in.

323
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Summon Prince Qi!

324
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,480
Your Majesty.

325
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,960
Su Ci.

326
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,360
I'll give you one last chance.

327
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,280
Are you going to talk or not?

328
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,520
Officer Lei.

329
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,200
I can't take it anymore.

330
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,359
Officer Lei, what do you want me

331
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
to say?

332
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,920
Of course, it's your purpose
for disguising as a man

333
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,560
to infiltrate Mingjing Office

334
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,800
and the person behind you!

335
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,839
Please state it clearly.

336
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,800
So, I'll know what to say

337
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,760
on the court

338
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,760
is to your satisfaction.

339
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,600
Of course, it's Prince Qi.

340
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,720
He forged an identity for you

341
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,400
and arranged you
to get into Mingjing Office.

342
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,880
In just a few years, you were promoted
to a fifth rank official.

343
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
As a pawn,

344
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,000
you lie in wait for an opportunity

345
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,320
whereas Prince Qi  is waiting
for the right timing

346
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,560
to commit atrocity
and harm the government.

347
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,760
Officer Lei.

348
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,560
If you have anything on Prince Qi

349
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,880
to prove his misconducts,

350
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,680
why don't you tell me?

351
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,440
It can prove that I'm pretty important

352
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,720
as a pawn.

353
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,880
So, my testimony

354
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,680
will be more convincing.

355
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
Just do as I told you just now.

356
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,400
Why are you laughing?

357
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,280
Turns out

358
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,880
you have exhausted your limited abilities

359
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,960
and the only way left

360
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,120
to get somebody else
to do your dirty work.

361
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,920
Officer Lei, you look so anxious.

362
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,400
I wonder who's putting the pressure on you

363
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,040
to deal with it quickly.

364
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,800
You've been using tobacco leaf
and strong tea to stay awake.

365
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,120
Inadequate sleep causes irritability.

366
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,160
I believe your master

367
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,960
is very hard to please.

368
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,960
If there are officials
with outstanding political achievements,

369
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,840
upright and honest,

370
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,480
and win the hearts of the people,

371
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,320
should they be put
in an important position?

372
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
If there are soldiers

373
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,080
who have countless military merits

374
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
and guarded our territories

375
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
should they be promoted?

376
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,040
As per the situation
that you mentioned,

377
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,960
these people should be promoted
and be put in important positions.

378
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,080
What if they are women?

379
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,000
Just because of gender differences,

380
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
they cannot be put
in important positions

381
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,440
and have to be imprisoned.

382
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,840
How is this making any sense?

383
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,440
I think

384
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,160
women can't be officials.

385
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,720
You...

386
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,320
presided over the allocation
of disaster relief funds.

387
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,760
In the end, the ship sank

388
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,280
and the disaster relief funds
went missing.

389
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,480
The disaster victims were displaced.

390
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,920
It was Su Ci who helped you
to retrieve the disaster relief funds.

391
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,120
That helped you secure your position.

392
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,200
But you?

393
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
You're clamouring

394
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,160
that women can't be put to use!

395
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,320
You too!

396
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,240
There were riots
in Northern Xinjiang last year.

397
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,760
As a commander,
you fought the war half-heartedly.

398
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,720
If it weren't for the women in the city
who protected themselves

399
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,320
and guarded the city
for half a month

400
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,000
while waiting
for Marquis Zhenyuan's rescue

401
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,920
would you still be standing here?

402
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,440
If women serve as officers and soldiers,

403
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,800
they are doing their duties

404
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,120
to the country and the people too.

405
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,040
What's wrong with that?

406
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,760
This is...

407
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,360
This is...

408
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:26,422
(Confession of Crime)

409
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,160
Do you think

410
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,880
you can take down Prince Qi

411
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,560
with perjury?

412
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,760
Do you want to know

413
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,440
what Prince Qi would do for you?

414
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,680
Officer.

415
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,960
What if Prince Qi investigates it?

416
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,520
There's no denying in deceiving the monarch.

417
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm not afraid of him.

418
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,120
This is a petition signed by the people

419
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,280
and the scholars of the Imperial College

420
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,280
to ask of Your Majesty to grant
females chances to study

421
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,640
and allow women with outstanding skills

422
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,480
to become officials.

423
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,840
I second that.

424
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,800
I agree.

425
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,480
I support that.

426
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
If that's the case...

427
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,200
we will...

428
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,760
Hold on.

429
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,040
Do you want to know

430
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,720
what Prince Qi would do for you?

431
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,400
Come on.

432
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,920
I'll pour a cup for you.

433
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,960
These guards act loose

434
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,280
with cold eyes.

435
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
They obviously aren't prison guards.

436
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,760
I get it now.

437
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,240
They're producing false evidence.

438
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,040
It's best if they can convict Brother Pei.

439
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,080
But if not,

440
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,960
they can put the word out
of my situation

441
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,440
and use it as a trap
to lure Brother Pei into it.

442
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,120
Don't ever come here.

443
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
Prince Qi has never interfered
with government affairs.

444
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,640
Why are you suddenly
so concerned about the country

445
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,160
because of an issue
involving the female officials?

446
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,600
It is my job

447
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,120
to share Your Majesty's burden

448
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,240
and serve the people.

449
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,560
I think

450
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,840
you're doing it to save Su Ci, right?

451
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,080
Your Majesty.

452
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,200
Officer Lei would like to seek an audience.

453
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:32,960
Send him in.

454
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,600
Send Officer Lei in.

455
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,120
Your Majesty.

456
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,000
Rise.

457
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

458
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,640
Do you have anything to report?

459
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,680
Your Majesty.

460
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Detective Su Ci of Mingjing Office

461
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,920
acted under Prince Qi's order

462
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,040
to disguise as a man
and become an official

463
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,760
to deceive Your Majesty
with an ulterior motive.

464
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,040
There's conclusive evidence.

465
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,640
Your Majesty, please make the decision.

466
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,160
This is Su Ci's testimony.

467
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,720
Prince Qi arranged her
to join Mingjing Office

468
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,720
for her capability in detecting.

469
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,240
She was promoted to a Detective
at a young age.

470
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,880
It's all arranged by Prince Qi.

471
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,680
And all these plots

472
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,440
are one of Prince Qi's moves

473
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
to rebel against Your Majesty.

474
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,800
Brother.

475
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,880
Do you have anything to say?

476
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,440
Officer Lei.

477
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,880
Not to mention

478
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,960
if the testimony
was obtained under torture.

479
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,040
Even if I did arrange for Su Ci
to get into Mingjing Office,

480
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,320
how is a woman

481
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,360
going to rebel against His Majesty?

482
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,640
As we all know,

483
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
Mingjing Office serves directly
under His Majesty.

484
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,600
The higher Su Ci's rank is,
the nearer she gets to the palace.

485
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,160
If Prince Qi is up to something,

486
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,240
Your Highness will surely have a way.

487
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,920
Besides, Prince Qi did his best

488
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,760
to pave the way for Su Ci's promotion
a few days ago.

489
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,200
It has caused an uproar

490
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,200
and everyone knew it.

491
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,400
Su Ci joined Mingjing Office
for just a few years

492
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,000
solved countless major cases

493
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,000
and dedicated to His Majesty.

494
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,160
May I ask Officer Lei

495
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,320
what kind of misconduct
has she committed?

496
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,720
She has done everything

497
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,560
right by God

498
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,040
and His Majesty.

499
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,720
I'm trying to preserve
such talent for His Majesty.

500
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,520
How am I undermining
the laws of the imperial court?

501
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,240
Your Majesty.

502
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,160
As an official,

503
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,560
I'll not allow anyone to rebel

504
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,960
or harm Your Majesty.

505
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Your Majesty, please issue the decree

506
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,760
to strip Prince Qi of his title

507
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,960
and investigate thoroughly.

508
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,520
As for Su Ci,

509
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,600
she should be executed at once.

510
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,960
Your Majesty.

511
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,240
This matter involves Mingjing Office.

512
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,440
I'm well aware
that this was my negligence

513
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,680
and I shouldn't intervene more.

514
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,360
But it's hard to convince the public

515
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,200
to convict her of the crime
without hard evidence

516
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,040
based on a vague testimony.

517
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,200
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

518
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,560
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

519
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,360
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

520
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,320
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

521
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,960
Your Majesty, please make a decision.

522
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,240
Your Majesty.

523
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,200
A mere testimony

524
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,600
proves nothing.

525
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,880
But Su Ci has indeed committed
a deception.

526
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,880
After Beirong delegation leaves,

527
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,200
she shall be executed.

528
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,480
Your Majesty!

529
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,440
Your Majesty.

530
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,920
Although there is no evidence

531
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,320
to prove that Prince Qi is guilty

532
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,480
he harboured and condoned Su Ci's action
of lying to Your Majesty.

533
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,400
This is an indisputable fact.

534
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,440
If Prince Qi just gets away with this,

535
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,440
I'm afraid the people will gossip about this

536
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,280
saying Your Majesty harbours
family memebers.

537
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,840
If so, Prince Qi must ponder over his mistakes.

538
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,520
Your...

539
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,040
You two, go in through the back door.

540
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,360
Rushuang, you...

541
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,680
Why are you here?

542
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,520
To break into the prison with you.

543
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,762
(Prison)

544
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,240
Officer Lei has given the order

545
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,400
that no one is allowed to enter.

546
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,080
How dare you

547
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,240
stop Prince Qi"?

548
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,520
Prince Qi.

549
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,200
Shouldn't you be pondering
over your mistakes

550
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,280
at your home?

551
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,800
It's none of your business

552
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,520
as to where I should be.

553
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,240
Your Highness.

554
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
The prisoners here are felons.

555
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,600
No one is allowed to enter.

556
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,320
What if I insist?

557
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,720
I'm just doing my job.

558
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,400
We can't bend the rules.

559
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,240
If Your Highness insists,

560
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,600
I have no way but to offend you.

561
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,040
If Your Highness kicks up a stink here

562
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,600
for the sake of Su Ci...

563
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,960
I'm afraid

564
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,880
if the words get out there...

565
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,800
Your Highness.

566
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Let go of me!

567
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,760
Why do you come?

568
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,960
Why is it that you can go

569
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,280
and I can't?

570
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,440
It's too dangerous.
You shouldn't take part in it.

571
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,040
You're here.
What's there to be afraid of?

572
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,360
Besides, I have poison.

573
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,520
I can lend you a hand.

574
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,480
No way.

575
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,120
I can't let you take the risk.

576
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,720
We agreed to take up arms for justice

577
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,480
and wander from place to place together!

578
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
Yet, you're kicking me aside...

579
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,200
Rushuang!

580
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,920
Breaking into prison is no joke.

581
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,240
If you go alone,

582
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,600
what if you get hurt?

583
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
What if you get captured?

584
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,840
What if you die?

585
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,040
Am I supposed to do nothing

586
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,400
and just wait here?

587
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,120
Rushuang.

588
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,680
You...

589
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,880
Are you worrying about me?

590
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,680
Whatever, I'll go with you!

591
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,440
Sister Su!

592
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,080
Brother Su!

593
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,560
Sister Su, who beat you up so badly?

594
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm going to kill him!

595
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,080
Leave.

596
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
Rushuang, step aside.

597
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,400
Young Master, we're here!

598
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,640
Brother Pei?

599
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,360
Brother Pei?

600
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,360
Why do you come here?

601
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,960
This is a trap.

602
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,040
Leave now! Hurry!

603
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,840
The prisoners at the normal prison cell
rose up in revolt.

604
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,200
Lei Zheng

605
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,080
is in deep trouble himself.

606
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,440
You knew?

607
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The prison guards

608
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,360
are generally retired soldiers.

609
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,960
When did it become

610
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,560
a gathering place for martial artists?

611
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I can see through

612
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,200
such diversionary tactic.

613
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,480
Except using me

614
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,440
to stitch you up,

615
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,720
Lei Zheng have nothing on you.

616
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
All you have to do is to hold back

617
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,920
and say nothing.

618
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,160
There's nothing he can do to you.

619
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,280
But

620
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,240
you need to be careful

621
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,760
because the people behind him
are trying to harm you.

622
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,120
You're injured so badly.

623
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,520
You're still worrying about me?

624
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm fine.

625
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,880
It's too dangerous here.

626
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,720
You need to escape amid the chaos.

627
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,160
How could you be fine now?

628
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,760
Look how badly you were beaten up.

629
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,040
It's just some flesh wounds.

630
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,040
It's no big deal.

631
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,560
It's just that the food here

632
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,080
is too awful

633
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,760
and dirty too.

634
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,240
When you get out,

635
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,760
I'll get Fei Yuan to make you
some nice food.

636
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,840
There's no time.
Cut the crap!

637
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,600
Let's get out of here!

638
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,720
Stop!

639
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,560
She's not leaving. We should go.

640
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,560
Why?

641
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,080
If she leaves now,

642
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,200
how is she going to lead an upright life?

643
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,560
Brother Pei.

644
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,760
Have you figured out a way

645
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,160
to save Sister Su?

646
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,600
Don't worry.

647
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,360
I'll get here out of here.

648
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,240
Let's go.

649
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,440
Little Su.

650
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,520
Go on.

651
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,280
Go.

652
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,280
Hurry.

653
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,960
They beat Detective Su up so badly

654
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,680
and tried to lure Your Highness
into a trap.

655
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,360
The person behind
is becoming more outrageous.

656
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,000
Your Highness.

657
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,040
You must take precautions.

658
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,760
Right now,

659
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,280
if Your Highness
has the support of Beirong

660
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,640
perhaps, they might...

661
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,880
What?

662
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Didn't you say you weren't going
to marry Princess Yunchuan?

663
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,040
I'm willing to form a marriage alliance
with Beirong

664
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,440
and hold the wedding at once.

665
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,160
But there's one condition.

666
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,360
I hope that on the wedding day,

667
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,560
Your Majesty could grant amnesty to all.

668
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,480
You're doing it for Su Ci?

669
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,160
You...

670
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,800
You like Su Ci?

671
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,400
Brother.

672
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,880
Why are you telling me till now?

673
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,560
Now...

674
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,360
I understand.

675
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,680
Your Majesty intends to grant me my wish.

676
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,760
But all the officials
have eyes on this matter.

677
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,560
Your Majesty has to give them
an explanation.

678
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,600
So

679
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,880
after much deliberation,

680
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,760
this is the only way.

681
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,880
Not only will it not affect Your Majesty,

682
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,200
it can keep Little Su safe.

683
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,200
Brother.

684
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,640
You're not only my subject,

685
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,160
you're also my brother.

686
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,720
I hope you can live a happy life.

687
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,160
If you have no feelings

688
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,600
for Princess Yunchuan,

689
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,760
how am I to ask you to get married?

690
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,400
What matters is keeping Little Su alive.

691
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,520
Your Majesty.

692
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,040
Please issue the decree.

693
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,980
Your Highness.

694
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,180
How is it?

695
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,620
Go to the prison with me.

696
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,940
Detective Su can be released already?

697
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,660
I'm afraid she's been tortured.

698
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,300
I need to check up on her.

699
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,180
(Prison)

700
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,180
Officer Lei has given the order

701
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,380
that no one is allowed to enter.

702
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,580
How dare you stop Prince Qi?

703
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,060
Prince Qi.

704
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,780
Shouldn't you be pondering
over your mistakes

705
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,660
at your home?

706
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,220
It's none of your business

707
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,780
as to where I should be.
