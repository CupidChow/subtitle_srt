(Episode 12)

15
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,360
It starts to drizzle now.

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,480
There's a staircase in front of us.

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,520
Right.

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
Right.

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Careful. There's a staircase in front of us.

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
Why is the door of Detective Su's room open?

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,960
Detective Su.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,360
Be careful, Young Master.

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,440
Hold on.

24
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,440
Young Master,

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Detective Su is not here.

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,520
Where does he go?

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
Hold on.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,560
Let me pick up the case files
on the floor first.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,160
How can Detective Su

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,080
leave with all the windows in his room open?

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
All the case files are scattered
all over the floor.

32
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,440
What did you just say?

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,520
Hold on.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,480
You've stepped on a case file.

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,200
Hold on.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,320
Little Su never leaves his things
scattered around.

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,760
Are you out of your mind, Young Master?

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,360
The imperial physician said that
your treatment can't be interrupted.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,000
Shut up.

40
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,434
(Lips, hand, hair, hang herself, painting, neck)

41
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,640
What do all

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,240
the circled words mean?

43
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,240
Hair.

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,560
Hang herself.

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Painting.

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,800
February of the Fourth Year of Zhanghe,
Ms. An killed herself by swallowing gold.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,320
Brother Pei,

48
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,720
I finally found my inspiration this time.

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,880
With a slender neck,

50
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,000
the body shape of the beauty
is formed.

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,240
August of the Fourth Year of Zhanghe,

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,760
Ms. Lin jumped into the lake
and killed herself.

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,000
Lips.

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
Take a look at the lips.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,640
The colour of the lips is like
the colour of water lilies.

56
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,400
It's refreshing and gorgeous.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,360
I, on the other hand,
like this pair of plain hands.

58
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,880
They look soft and gentle.

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,560
The fingers are long and thin.

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,920
Hand.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,720
Ms. Du jumped from the rampart
and killed herself.

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,600
Is it...

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,320
December of the Third Year of Zhanghe...

64
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,960
May of the Fourth Year of Zhanghe...

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,320
May of the Second Year of Zhanghe...

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,400
She's so beautiful.

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,320
But why are

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,720
her eyes missing?

69
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,680
Brother Qu has very high requirements

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,720
on all the features of the lady in the painting.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
We're not sure

72
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,040
when he'll be able to find the perfect
pair of eyes.

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
No.

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,200
I've found it.

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,240
Oh no!

76
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,160
Where are you going, Young Master?

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,600
It is finally completed.

78
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,960
Finally, I have completed my masterpiece.

79
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
It is finally completed.

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,600
It is finally completed.

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,720
Masterpiece...

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,480
Masterpiece...

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,320
My masterpiece.

84
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,520
Why don't you have any reaction?

85
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,440
Don't you want to take a look at my masterpiece?

86
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,000
There's a piece of masterpiece
right in front of you.

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,960
Don't you want to see it?

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,600
Come here.

89
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,400
But you're such a mess now.

90
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,160
You're not qualified to look at my masterpiece.

91
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,240
Now,

92
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,240
it's time for you to die.

93
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,840
Let's finish this.

94
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,200
You won't suffer.

95
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,040
You've no regrets too.

96
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,440
I won't suffer.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,880
I've no regrets.

98
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,240
I won't suffer.

99
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,640
I've no regrets.

100
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,800
I won't suffer.

101
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
I've no regrets.

102
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,600
Mother...

103
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,160
Mother...

104
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,120
Live on no matter how difficult it is.

105
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,480
No.

106
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
I can't die.

107
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,480
I can't die.

108
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,920
Look at me.

109
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,640
Look at my eyes.

110
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,120
Here.

111
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
Don't hesitate.

112
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,800
That's it.

113
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,200
Great.

114
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,320
You can die now.

115
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
Little Su,

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,200
it's me.

117
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Wake up.

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Brother Pei.

119
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,680
How do you feel, Little Su?

120
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,640
I'll kill all of you.

121
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,880
Little Su.

122
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,960
Little Su.

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,880
My beautiful lady.

124
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,080
My masterpiece.

125
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
Little Su,

126
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,360
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry that I'm late.

128
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,200
My masterpiece.

129
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,760
Brother Pei,

130
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
the antidote.

131
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,840
The antidote is in my clothes.

132
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,440
Here you are.

133
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,840
What happened, Young Master?

134
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,280
Go and get Rushuang. Quick!

135
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,840
Young Master.

136
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,840
Young Master.

137
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Young Master.

138
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,000
Fei Yuan.

139
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,880
What is going on, Young Master?

140
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,640
Go and guard the door.

141
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,880
Close the door and
don't let anyone enter the room.

142
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,080
Go.

143
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,920
All right.

144
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,960
Rushuang,

145
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,600
Little Su has been hypnotised. Please help her.

146
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,840
I'll explain the rest to you later.

147
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,160
Rushuang,

148
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,080
I get that it's hard for you to accept this.

149
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
But Little Su has been hypnotised.
Her life is in danger now.

150
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,000
I know what to do.

151
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
She's taken the antidote that you gave her.

152
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,600
How's she now?

153
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,920
Although she's taken the antidote,

154
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,920
well...

155
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,800
she has been under the influence of
the drug for a long time.

156
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,440
Besides, she has been hypnotised.

157
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,880
So her vital signs are not stable.

158
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
It's all my fault.

159
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,680
I should have saved her earlier.

160
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,040
Is she going to kill herself a few days later

161
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,280
just like the others?

162
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,720
I'm not sure.

163
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,480
I've to perform some checks on her to be sure.

164
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,400
You've to leave the room now.

165
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,840
All right.

166
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,320
All right.

167
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,040
All right.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,640
Young Master.

169
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
What's going on, Young Master?

170
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,440
How's your eyes?

171
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm fine.

172
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,160
Take my badge and go to Mingjing Office.

173
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,440
What for?

174
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,600
The serial killer is Qu Linjiang.

175
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,840
He fled the scene.

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,320
Go and inform Mingjing Office about it.

177
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,160
Ask them to hunt him down.

178
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes.

179
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
One more thing.

180
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,880
Go and inform Jiang Xiwen.

181
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,480
Go now.

182
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,560
Yes.

183
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,640
Mother.

184
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,160
My daughter, you've to stay alive.

185
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,400
Mother.

186
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,880
Mother.

187
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,160
Don't leave me alone.

188
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,920
You've to stay alive.

189
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,160
Don't leave me alone.

190
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,560
Don't leave me alone.

191
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Mother.

192
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,560
Mother.

193
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
Don't leave me alone.

194
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,560
Don't leave me alone, Mother.

195
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,440
Don't leave me alone.

196
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,320
Mother.

197
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,440
You knew that she's a woman, didn't you?

198
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,440
But I believe that

199
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,520
there must be a reason why she did that.

200
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,440
Well, she has to explain everything
to me when she wakes up.

201
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,720
I'm wondering what could be her excuse.

202
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
These pills can calm her down.

203
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,200
Just put one in her mouth,

204
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,360
if she is having nightmares again.

205
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,120
What happened to your hand, Brother Pei?

206
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,720
Let me treat your wound.

207
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,119
Who is there?

208
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,280
How dare you to break the curfew?

209
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,200
I've something urgent from Prince Qi. Move.

210
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:13,885
(Qi)

211
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,920
Move.

212
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,600
Little Su,

213
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,200
thank god you're all right.

214
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,720
Little Su,

215
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,600
everything is going to be all right.

216
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,040
I'll always be here for you.

217
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:25,138
(Pei Mansion)

218
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,520
Why can't I see anything?

219
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,400
I still can't see anything.

220
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,000
Can't you see it?

221
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,680
Yes.

222
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,160
I still can't see anything.

223
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
Young Master.

224
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,600
Little Su is still asleep. Keep your voice down.

225
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
What are you doing early in the morning?

226
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,320
Young Master,

227
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,240
I need to talk to you.

228
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,600
What is it?

229
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,920
What do you want to tell me?

230
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,120
Young Master,

231
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,200
I want to remonstrate.

232
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,760
Remonstrate?

233
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,080
Do you know what remonstrate means?

234
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,160
Yes, I do.

235
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,440
Young Master,

236
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,240
I really didn't expect that

237
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,400
you'll do something like this.

238
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840
This is wrong. Do you know that?

239
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,000
What are you talking about?

240
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,480
Young Master,

241
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,480
I'll never let you

242
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,080
be obsessed with doing it anymore.

243
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,040
This is...

244
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,760
If the late emperor knew that you're gay,

245
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,640
he wouldn't be able to rest in peace.

246
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,720
I'm gay?

247
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,920
Who's my gay partner then?

248
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,880
Well...

249
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,200
Young Master,

250
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
I know that Detective Su is kind and good-looking.

251
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
But he's a man after all.

252
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,680
This is...

253
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,600
This is contrary to the ethics, right?

254
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,040
As long as you can realize this

255
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,160
I would feel worthy of

256
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,360
sacrificing my life for it.

257
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,920
You silly boy.

258
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,240
You really want to kill yourself.

259
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,760
It's blood.

260
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
Look at this, Young Master.

261
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,880
I'm dying.

262
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,920
You must promise me that

263
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,880
you can't live like this anymore.

264
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,920
Look carefully. Whose blood is this?

265
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,880
This...

266
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Young Master,

267
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,360
what happened to your hand?

268
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,600
Young Master, your hand...

269
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,200
Is your brain functioning properly now?

270
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,000
Who told you that Little Su is my gay partner?

271
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,240
Young Master,

272
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,520
stop denying about it.

273
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
I know everything.

274
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,800
You didn't even care about your eyes
when you rescued Detective Su.

275
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Little Su was in danger.

276
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,360
I'd to act fast.

277
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,440
Well...

278
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,040
You spent the whole night taking care of him

279
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,960
after you rescued him.

280
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,240
Well,

281
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,800
did I spend the whole night taking care of you

282
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,400
when you were sick?

283
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,600
Well...

284
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,240
That's enough.

285
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,680
I'm going to take a look at Little Su.

286
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,720
Hold on, Young Master.

287
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,040
Hold on, Young Master.

288
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,800
What do you have to say about this?

289
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,840
You painted Detective Su in woman's clothes.

290
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,800
This is...

291
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
This is crazy.

292
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,520
Since you've found out about it,

293
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
I'll have to admit it.

294
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,640
You

295
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,560
really are in love with Detective Su?

296
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,120
Yes.

297
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm in love with Little Su.

298
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,280
This is...

299
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,840
This is wrong.

300
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,480
I can't let you recklessly do that.

301
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
What are you going to do?

302
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,440
I...

303
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,560
I'll ask Detective Su to stay away from you.

304
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,880
Great.

305
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,760
Let's go and see Little Su now.

306
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,880
Young Master,

307
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,440
Detective Su has not recovered yet.

308
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,880
We don't have to rush this, do we?

309
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
A wedding dress.

310
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,520
Look at the painting that you're holding.

311
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,160
What does

312
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,280
this mean?

313
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,240
You silly boy.

314
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,440
You still can't tell
what is going on here?

315
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,480
Is she

316
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,000
a woman who disguises herself as a man?

317
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,280
Right. Keep it a secret.

318
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,280
Don't tell anyone about it.

319
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,920
Well...

320
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,200
I'll go get some hot water.

321
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,920
Prince,

322
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,120
we've found what you want.

323
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,080
We found this.

324
00:24:34,021 --> 00:24:35,402
(Su Ci: Eyes. Identity: Detective Su
of Mingjing Office. Without family.)

325
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,000
Where is Qu Linjiang?

326
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,440
He is arrested by Mingjing Office.

327
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,840
Rushuang,

328
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,760
you found out that I'm a woman.

329
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
I'm going to prepare your medicine.

330
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,800
Thank you, Rushuang.

331
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,920
Thank you for taking care of me
for the whole night.

332
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,840
You're a patient and I'm a doctor.

333
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,400
That's it. You don't have to thank me.

334
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,960
Besides, the person who took care of you
for the whole night is not me.

335
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,160
Rushuang,

336
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,400
how's Little Su?

337
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,960
She's awake.

338
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
She should be all right.

339
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
I've to go prepare her medicine.

340
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,080
You're holding...

341
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
It's the wedding dress.

342
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,160
I'll destroy it.

343
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,120

347
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,840
He has been arrested.

348
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,680
All of them

349
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,040
have known about my true identity?

350
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,800
Only Fei Yuan and Rushuang knew about it.

351
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,840
They won't tell anyone.

352
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,400
I was so careful.

353
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,520
I was worried that others
might find out about it.

354

I thought I was doing a good job

360
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,320
I was very careful all these years.

Prince,

414
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,200
you've wasted all of our effort.

415
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,480
You...

416
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,480
Why did you do that?

417
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,240
Do you want to lose your eyesight forever?

418
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,440
There's an emergency.

419
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,680
I'd to act fast.

420
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,320
So

421
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,960
how's his eyes now?

422
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,240
I told you before.

423
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,880
Once the treatment is interrupted,

424
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,760
we won't be able to get all the toxin out.

425
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,440
And he'd lose his eyesight.

426
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,240
So

427
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,880
what should we do now?

428
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,240
Young Master.

429
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,840
you'll still be able to see me right,
Young Master?

430
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,600
That's enough, you silly boy.

431
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,560
Let Imperial Physician Zhang
finish his sentence.

432
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,280
What we can do now is to try out
another prescription.

433
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,560
But we need a very rare ingredient

434
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
in this prescription.

435
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,640
It'll take a few days to prepare it.

436
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,760
Does that mean that

437
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,840
our Young Master's eyes will be healed

438
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
after he takes the prescription?

439
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,000
Well...

440
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,320
I can't be sure.

441
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,440
Hold on.

442
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,960
You're an Imperial Physician, aren't you?

443
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,280
Are you saying that

444
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,240
our Young Master's eyes can't be cured?

445
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
Please figure out a way to heal him.

446
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,960
Fei Yuan,

447
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,240
behave yourself.

448
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,680
The Prince's condition is very serious now.

449
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,720
It very much depends on his luck

450
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,360
whether he could gain his eyesight back.

451

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,280
What happened to him?

455
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,760
Qu Linjiang.

456
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,720
The Lead Officer is here to interrogate you.

457
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,160
Are you here to see my masterpiece?

458
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,120

462

Where's my masterpiece?

463
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,960
Lead Officer,

464
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,320
Qu Linjiang has lost his mind.

465
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,400
I'm not crazy.

466
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,199
I can still paint.

467
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
I can still paint.

468
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,040
This is the evidence that we have found
in Qu Mansion.

469
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,239
This book is written by Qu Linjiang.

470

It back-dated to four years ago.

471
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,840
All the information of his victims
is recorded in this book.

472
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,080

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,920

476
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,400
This...

477
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,400
What's wrong, Lead Officer?

478
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,200
The last page of this book is missing.

479
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,440

480

is Ms. Lin.

481
