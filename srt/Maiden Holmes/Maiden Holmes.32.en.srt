(Episode 32)

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,560
This...

16
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Ming, you're coming.

17
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,680
Xie Beiming, how come you...

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,000
Ming,

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,760
get all of them...

20
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,320
Prince Yun,

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,320
I've been waiting for this moment.

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,040
I've been waiting for you to turn yourself in,

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,360
to send the evidence to
the main hall on your own.

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,640
What?

25
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,080
Your rebel army has reached
the West Gate indeed.

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,080
But all these

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,160
is a trap for you.

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,360
You've been the Minister of Auxiliary
for so many years now,

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,680
you should know that

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,120
the border troops of the capital
are very well-trained,

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,040
let alone the security in the palace.

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,360
Have you ever thought about

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,520
how your army could easily get inside?

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,880
Retreat to the main gate.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,560
Close the gate.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
(West Gate)

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,160
(West Gate)
Fire.

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,920
How did you find out my plan?

39
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,160
I knew about it

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
the moment you assigned me to

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
lead the birthday banquet for Her Highness.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
And so we went with your flow,

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,160
and waited for the opportunity.

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,240
When you thought
that you've won the battle,

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,240
that's the moment we'd fight back.

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,440
Father,

47
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,560
it's time to stop now.

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,000
He promised me to spare your life.

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
Shut up.

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,480
You are my son.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,600
I trust you most.

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,200
Yet you've betrayed me.

53
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,800
No!

54
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,800
Brother Xie!

55
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,320
Father,

56
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,360
thank you for

57
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,240
raising me.

58
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
This is the only way

59
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,320
I can repay you.

60
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,440
Xie Beiming!

61
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,160
Father,

62
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,440
stop it, please.

63
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,480
Ming.

64
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,840
Brother Xie,

65
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,000
Xie Beiming,

66
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,720
hold on.

67
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,360
Xie Beiming.

68
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
Rushuang,

69
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm afraid I can't keep my promise anymore.

70
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,920
I can't stay by your side

71
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
for the rest of your life.

72
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
I'll

73
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,720
miss you.

74
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,600
Please

75
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,720
forgive me.

76
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,600
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,320
No.

78
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,640
You won't die.

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
You won't die.

80
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,280
You promised me to be by my side
for the rest of my life.

81
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,080
You can't go back on your word.

82
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,360
Long live the king!

83
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,040
Long live the king!

84
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,240
You may rise.

85
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

86
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,720
Brother,

87
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,680
I've been thinking about

88
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,520
something recently.

89
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,720
What is it?

90
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,240
I think we didn't handle

91
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,880
the Bai Liang case properly.

92
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,520
It's to give father the truth

93
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,800
if I can justify the
innocence of Bai Liang Clan.

94
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,440
Your Majesty, why not
make a public announcement

95
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,280
to clear the name of Bai Liang clan.

96
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Brother,

97
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,840
I don't think you're doing this for
Bai Liang clan.

98
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,520
You're doing this for Detective Su, right?

99
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,640
That's one of my concerns, of course.

100
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,200
The position of

101
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,160
the Lead Officer of Mingjing Office
is vacant.

102
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
How about promoting Detective Su
to be the Lead Officer.

103
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,720
What do you think?

104
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,240
No.

105
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,040
Detective Su
is too young and inexperienced.

106
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,960
It's not fair.

107
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,480
I think Detective Luo Xin

108
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,960
is good at case-solving.

109
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Besides, he's honest and righteous.

110
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,720
He'd be the perfect candidate to be
the Lead Officer of Mingjing Office.

111
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,720
Brother,

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,560
are you being fair

113
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
or are you doing all this for your own good?

114
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,360
I've been all by myself all this while.

115
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,640
Now, it's time for me to
think about my marriage, right?

116
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
Right.

117
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,760
I'm a fair king.

118
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,000
Su Ci and you saved our lives
and our country.

119
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,000
So I decided to

120
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,640
grant you your wish to marry Su Ci.

121
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

122
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,640
(Pei Mansion)

123
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,960
Rushuang.

124
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Sister Rushuang,

125
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,840
I've made some porridge.

126
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,320
Come and have some.

127
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,200
Do you think

128
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
he will recover again?

129
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sure he will.

130
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
Brother Pei,

131
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,840
what happened?

132
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
How come Xie Beiming

133
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
was related to the rebel Prince Yun?

134
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,800
Actually,

135
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,440
Prince Yun

136
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,040
was his adoptive father.

137
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,480
But Brother Xie didn't know
the true identity of Prince Yun.

138
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,400
He told Prince Yun our whereabouts

139
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,000
through letters.

140
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,440
No wonder...

141
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,560
No wonder he told me that
he had done something wrong.

142
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,800
He has got a pure heart.

143
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,040
He didn't know that

144
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,360
until we were being hunted
by some assassins

145
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,440
during the investigation of Li Mu's case

146
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,920
in Qifu Town.

147
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,280
So that's why he was avoiding me

148
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,480
and talking strangely.

149
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm leaving.

150
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,440
Rushuang,

151
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,680
If...

152
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,080
If...

153
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,760
If I accidentally made a blunder,

154
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
would you forgive me?

155
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,320
As long as you're faithful,

156
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
I can forgive you.

157
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,440
Well...

158
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,240
What if I'm not?

159
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
I'll forsake you then.

160
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
You, silly man.

161
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,120
How could you take all the burden alone?

162
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Why did you not tell me the truth?

163
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,120
Brother Xie did confront Prince Yun
after he found out

164
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,040
that he was being used by Prince Yun.

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,840
Prince Yun threatened to harm you.

166
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,680
In order to keep you safe,

167
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
he had no choice but to endure
all the pain alone.

168
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
You knew about it?

169
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
I had a long talk with Brother Xie

170
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,320
after we got back from Nanxun Town.

171
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,080
After that,
we secretly planned everything.

172
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
We went with Prince Yun's flow on purpose.

173
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
And then we set a trap for Prince Yun.

174
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,040
We led Prince Yun to believe that

175
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,680
the fireworks display was
the best chance for rebellion.

176
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,840
No wonder...

177
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,400
You knew about all these all along.

178
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,520
I can't imagine

179
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,760
what would happen

180
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,680
without his help.

181
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
But

182
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,840
I never thought that

183
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,480
between the righteous and his father,
he'd made such a choice.

184
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,160
He did it

185
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,080
because he felt guilty
for what he had done.

186
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,240
He hoped that we'd forgive him.

187
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,240
I never regret

188
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,840
meeting Brother Xie.

189
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,080
And I never blame him for anything.

190
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,680
Xie Beiming,

191
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,760
do you hear that?

192
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,880
We don't blame you.

193
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
We've forgiven you.

194
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,880
Wake up.

195
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,360
If you continue to sleep,

196
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll sprinkle some poison powder on you.

197
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,260
(Case file)

198
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,000
Your Highness,

199
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,240
I'll report my findings on Bai Liang case

200
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,680
to His Majesty

201
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,640
on court tomorrow.

202
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,280
All right.

203
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,200
Your Highness,
don't you have anything to ask me?

204
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,080
The truth that you discovered

205
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,440
should be the same as I thought.

206
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,880
So

207
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,680
you just need to report
everything to His Majesty.

208
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,520
Thank you.

209
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,440
Today,

210
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,400
His Majesty issued a decree
in the main hall

211
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,680
stating that we, the Bai Liang clan
was framed by Prince Yun

212
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,120
in the murder of the late emperor.

213
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,240
(Bai Liang Clan Leader, Bai Sheng and His Wife)
His Majesty

214
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,440
has cleared our name.

215
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,760
Father,

216
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,960
mother,

217
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,160
I've made it.

218
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,080

Finally, I've cleared the name of Bai Liang clan.

219
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,840
(Bai Sheng and His Wife)
I've cleared your name.

220
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,840
From now on,

221
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm no longer a descendent of murderers.

222
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,640
I can stand up straight
and tell everyone that

223
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,800
I'm from Bai Liang clan.

Luckily we're all unharmed.

285
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,480

Did I say something wrong?

You managed to escape death.

290
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,320
It's not a revival.

291
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,600

294
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,840
we're celebrating Brother Xie
regaining his health.

295
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,960
Secondly,

296
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,960
we're celebrating Sister Su...

297
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,560
Me?

298
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,920
Yes.

299
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,280
We're celebrating you becoming
one of the famous people in the capital.

300
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
That's right, Brother Su.

301
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,600
Everyone in the capital

302
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,200
is talking about how you solved the case.

303
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Even the storytellers

304
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,040
are telling your story.

305
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,320
Haven't you heard it?

306
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,240
I knew about it.

307
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Let me tell you a story.

308
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,680
Come on.

309
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,240
Prince Qi couldn't provide any evidence
to prove his innocence

310
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,800
when His Highness was being slandered.

311
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,840
A loud voice came from the outside.

312
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,800
'Prince Qi isn't the murderer,' she said.

313
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,840
That's enough.

314
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,560
Stop teasing me.

315
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,360
Brother Pei,

316
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Brother Su is so famous now.

317
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,240
How do you feel about that?

318
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,680
Well, she's a young hero...

319
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,720
heroine.

320
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,200
I think this is great.

321
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,160
Besides, she deserves the praise.

322
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,120
That's right.

323
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
That's enough.

324
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,280
All right.

325
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,400
There are too many things
we're celebrating today.

326
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560

327
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,840
Cheers!

328
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,480
Come on!

329
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,200
All right.

330
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,440
Let's drink.

331
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,120
Cheers!

332
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,560
Rushuang, let me refill your glass.

333
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,760
Let's eat.

334
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,080
-Young Master, listen to me.
-Try this.

335
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,000
This is very delicious.

336
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,720
Fei Yuan's cooking

337
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,120
is delicious as always.

338
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,480
The night view here is so beautiful.
I thought we're in heaven now.

339
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,760
It's so beautiful.

340
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,280
Little Su.

341
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,560
What's this?

342
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,640
This is a gift for you.

343
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,800
It's...

344
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Don't you feel that

345
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,760
these handcuffs have

346
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,720
brought us together?

347
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,320
Little Su,

348
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,080
I want to show you something.

349
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,440
What is it?

350
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,680
Come here.

351
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,680
Come.

352
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,040
Close your eyes.

353
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Open your eyes on the count of three.

354
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,440
Young Master is giving me a signal.

355
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,840
Here.

356
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,320
One,

357
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,960
two,

358
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,600
three.

359
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,280
Open your eyes.

360
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:23,675
♪ Who am I in the past ♪

361
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,360
It's breathtaking.

362
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,600
These fireworks are custom-made for you.

363
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,480
You didn't get to see
the fireworks show the other day.

364
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,800
It's compensation for you.

365
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:42,502
♪ Is it even me and who am I living for ♪

366
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,120
Look.

367
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,080
The fireworks look like red beans.

368
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,440
It's so beautiful.

369
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,600
What's its name?

370
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,080
It's called Longing for You.

371
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,560
This is my way to repay you
for the handkerchief.

372
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,720
Do you like it?

373
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,960
Yes, I do.

374
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,040
Little Su,

375
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,800
you made me a promise.

376
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,520
You promised to fulfill
three of my requirements.

377
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,720
There's one left.

378
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,000
Brother Pei,

379
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,200
I will not let you
keep my secret for nothing.

380
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,360
I'll give you 3 promises.
You can ask me to do anything.

381
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,880
I won't reject.

382
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,320
I swear.

383
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,280
I remember.

384
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,200
What do you want me to do?

385
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,240
I want

386
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,600
you to be Princess Consort Qi
of the Liang dynasty.

387
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,400
I want you to be my wife.

388
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,320
Brother Pei.

389
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,440
Stop calling me Brother Pei.

390
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,720
I want you

391
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,920
to call me

392
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,600
my dear husband from now on.

393
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,680
I haven't said yes.

394
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
You can't refuse.

395
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,000
Does Detective Su
want to go back on her word?

396
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,440
Seven years ago,

397
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,840
you saved my life.

398
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,560
You gave me faith

399
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,240
in my darkest moment.

400
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,680
You gave me strength.

401
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,920
You gave me the courage

402
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,960
to endure all the hardship.

403
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,240
I've never thought
that I'd meet you again.

404
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,840
Never in my life have I ever thought that

405
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,080
I could be by your side

406
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,240
and went through everything with you.

407
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
You know.

408
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
It's the first time I feel that

409
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,040
there's someone I can rely on

410
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,440
in the entire world.

411
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,040
And this person

412
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,080
is you.

Don't you think that
you should do something too?

429
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,880
Well...

430
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,400
What should I do?

431
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,160
It seems I should be the first to act.

432
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,640
What are you doing?

433
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,120
In some aspects,

434
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,840
it's man who should act first.

435
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,960
These grown-ups really don't care
what others might think of them.

436
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,160
(One year later)

437
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,960
Right.

438
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,400
I'd like to introduce a special tool

439
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,000
that we use during our investigation.

440
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,520
It's a magnifier.

441
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,880
You guys can pass around and
take a look at it.

442
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,120
Here. Have a look.

443
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,080
In the investigation,

444
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,920
we might miss

445
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,720
some details.

446
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
And so we can use it

447
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,360
to help us better observe the evidence.

448
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,320
With its help, we can find the details

449
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,800
that we can't see only with our eye.

450
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,560
I stabbed the pork

451
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,920
with different types of daggers just now.

452
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,320
As you can see,

453
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,360
the wounds aren't the same.

454
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,800
The wounds will look different

455
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,160
It's lunchtime.

456
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,680
if it's stabbed by a right hand
or a left hand.

457
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,680
Well, of course,

458
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,280
these are just for your reference.

459
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,360
Let's take a look at this wound.

460
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,640
It's stabbed from the top.

461
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,040
This kind of wounds are usually found on
the victims

462
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,240
who are unconscious

463
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,480
or not alerted

464
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,000
when they get murdered.

465
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,640
Let's take a look at this wound.

466
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,360
It's stabbed from below.

467
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,280
This kind of wounds are normally
found on the victim's abdomen.

468
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,960
And the murderer will normally stab
the victims with one hand.

469
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,520
What are you doing? Put me down!

470
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,640
It's time to go home.

471
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,240
I haven't finished yet.
They are watching us.

472
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,480
They really admire you.

473
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,840
I really hate how they look at you.

474
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,600
I want to tell them that

475
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,640
you're

476
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,160
mine.

477
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,200
So they just left?

478
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,360
Is the class dismissed?

479
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,480
Young Master, Sister Su, you're back.

480
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,080
Wrong.

481
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,360
Say it right.

482
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Your Highness.

483
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,920
Let's have lunch.

484
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,280
Let's go.

485
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,880
Let's go.

486
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,600
There are lots of dishes today.

487
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,960
So many.

488
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,840
-Here you go.
-Young Master.

489
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,880
Here you go. This is your favourite.

490
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,760
Here you go.

491
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,360
Little Fei Yuan,
-Here you go.

492
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,360
Come on.

493
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,480
Here you go. You need more to grow up.

494
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,680
It must be the letter from Brother Xie.

495
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,920
Look, Young Master.

496
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,360
Brother Pei and Brother Su,

497
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,200
Rushuang and I have traveled
over a hundred miles today.

498
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,080
We managed
to see the beautiful peach blossom.

499
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,640
There were white, pink,

500
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,640
as well as red peach blossom.

501
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,440
Rushuang managed to treat

502
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,000
an old lady's ears in Beishui Town.

503
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,920
I set off some firecrackers
to celebrate it.

504
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,480
I also treated the old lady to a meal.

505
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,360
Xie Beiming,

506
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,400
can you get to the key point, please?

507
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,760
Right. Key point.

508
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,240
Rushuang, what's it again?

509
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,320
After we treated the old lady's ears,

510
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,560
she could hear all kinds of

511
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,880
strange sounds in this house.

512
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,520
She thought that the house was haunted.

513
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,480
I remembered.

514
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,080
We thought that

515
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,520
the old lady was having some
auditory hallucinations

516
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,320
after Rushuang treated her ears.

517
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
So we thought of visiting her again
and take a look at the house.

518
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,000
To our surprise, we both heard
the strange sounds too.

519
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,280
It sounds like someone
was hitting the wall.

520
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,480
But there's no one living in the house
next to the old lady's house.

521
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,520
It's creepy.

522
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,920
Someone is trying to create chaos.

523
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,680
Young Master, let's go and find them.

524
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,440
Let's investigate the case

525
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,480
like when we first met.

526
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,240
All right.

527
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,720
Fei Yuan, go pack up our luggage.

528
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,720
That's great!

529
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,560
Let's go!

530
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,000
Let's go!

531
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,600
