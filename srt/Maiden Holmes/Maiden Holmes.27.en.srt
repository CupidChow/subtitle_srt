(Episode 27)

15
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,440
Madam.

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,880
You really are the murder.

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,720
Why

18
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,080
are you here too?

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,920
It's you

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
who killed my father

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,840
and drove my mother crazy.

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
Shut up

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
or I'll kill you too.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
Fei Yuan,

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
please take Miss Xu out.

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,640
Miss Xu.

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,440
I never thought

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,040
it's a forged document.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,920
You tricked me.

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,560
Concern can lead to mistakes.

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Otherwise,

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,680
how would you reveal yourself?

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,400
I did intend to kill Xu Bingjie.

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
Only then

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,840
could Qingmei
gain back her family property.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,360
Madam, it's no worth it.

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,400
That's not all you've done.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,320
You also murdered Sun Bo.

39
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,080
That's impossible.

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,840
When Sun Bo died,

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,880
you were taking her back to the inn.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,840
How could it be her then?

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,640
If I conjectured it right,

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,520
madam had drugged Sun Bo

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
before she went to Sun family's shop.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,480
But she didn't kill him right away.

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,960
Sun Bo failed to struggle due to the drug.

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,240
The white cloth that wrapped his head

49
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,840
didn't suffocate him immediately.

50
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,400
But at that time,

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,400
he was lying under the drying wet cloth.

52
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,640
As the water kept dripping,

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
the white cloth got tightened

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,040
and suffocated him.

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,560
Then,

56
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,760
he fell into the pool and drowned.

57
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,680
That's why traces of dragging the body

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,480
were left on the table.

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Madam,

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,800
I knew you did all these for me.

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,000
How dare Sun Bo covet you?

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,840
How could I protect you

63
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,880
if I didn't kill him?

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
You killed Xu Mengchang too.

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Madam,

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,600
it's true that they treated me badly.

67
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
But it's wrong to kill them.

68
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,680
How should I live on

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,360
after this?

70
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,080
You put 8 copper coins

71
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
besides Sun Bo's body

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
to intimidate

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,680
Mr. and Mrs. Xu.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,960
So you could

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,960
avenge for the late Lady Xu.

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,000
You're right!

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,640
Xu Mengchang

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,880
was ungrateful and unscrupulous.

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,560
Lady Xu worked so hard
for the family business.

80
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,120
He not only did nothing to help

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,520
but treated Lady coldly.

82
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
He deserved it.

83
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,440
You killed He Da too.

84
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
That's impossible.

85
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,640
That's not true.

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,920
Madam was with me

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
on the day He Da died.

88
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
He Da actually didn't die

89
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,760
on the tenth day
of the ninth lunar month.

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,880
It was a day before.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,880
The ninth day of the ninth lunar month.

92
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
That's even more impossible.

93
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,720
He Da secluded himself
in the silkworm house that day

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
and wrote notes on the 3rd sleep cycle.

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,480
You saw it too.

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,640
It wasn't madam.

97
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,280
You must have mistaken it.

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,960
The notes written by He Da

99
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,560
was her alibi,

100
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,200
but it's also the only flaw.

101
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,840
Brother Su,

102
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,840
what do you mean?

103
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,640
The silkworms in Nanxun

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,280
are from the same batch

105
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,440
with the same sleep pattern.

106
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
But the silkworms

107
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,000
at Xu's silkworm house weren't dormant.

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,040
And others in the town had entered
the fourth sleep cycle.

109
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,320
He Da would seclude himself
in the silkworm house every year.

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,520
He'd break his seclusion
on the fourth sleep cycle.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,880
The notes he wrote on the 3rd sleep cycle,

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,560
made everyone believe that

113
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,280
he died on the tenth day
of the ninth lunar month.

114
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,000
But the murderer

115
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,880
had exchanged them
with 5-sleep-cycle silkworms.

116
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
The 3rd sleep cycle occurred a day earlier.

117
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,360
So He Da had created an alibi

118
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,240
for the murderer.

119
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,160
Before the murderer left the crime scene,

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,960
she burnt charcoal to increase
the temperature inside

121
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,480
and closed the door and all windows.

122
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,640
So the officers couldn't
determine the time of death.

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,320
That's why

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,560
you had an alibi

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,120
on the tenth day of the ninth lunar month.

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,880
Does it mean that

127
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,680
you'd burnt the silkworm empress statue too?

128
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
I found the remaining wax

129
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
on the silkworm empress's wooden rack.

130
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,400
You wrapped white phosphorus
with wax pellets

131
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,840
and put it under the paper statue.

132
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,200
It was hot that day.

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
The wax melted quickly.

134
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,320
The white phosphorus

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,320
lit up the paper statue.

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,440
I get it.

137
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
After madam killed He Da,

138
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,960
she burned the silkworm empress statue,

139
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,480
leading everyone to believe that

140
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,960
it was a curse.

141
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,200
Madam,

142
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,240
why did you kill He Da?

143
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Because He Da deserved to die.

144
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,120
He Da,

145
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,080
did you promise Sun Bo

146
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,400
that you'd work for him?

147
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,760
It's none of your business.

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,120
You could get silk hanging 6 coins

149
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,640
all thanks to Lady's guidance.

150
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
How could you offer your skill
to the Sun family

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
after Lady passed away?

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
You're ungrateful.

153
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,040
I make a living through my skill.

154
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,520
I'll work for the one that pays more.

155
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,800
It's not that simple,

156
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,760
right?

157
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,160
What do you mean?

158
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,560
It's seven years ago
that you came here.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,840
But you lied to me
it's ten years ago.

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,880
Because it's so long ago

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
that I forgot it.

162
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,440
But seven years ago,

163
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,440
Lady Xu managed to produce

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
a very rare brocade.

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,800
Why all people remembered it

166
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,160
except you?

167
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,440
You wanted no one to find that

168
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,030
Lady Xu had by chance learned

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,400
the brocade technique from you.

170
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,880
As it was the Bai Liang brocade

171
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
that everyone knows about.

172
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,920
Who are you?

173
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,280
What are you talking about?

174
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,400
The person you always trust

175
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,640
might be the murderer of the late emperor

176
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
seven years ago.

177
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,920
What?

178
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,000
Madam,

179
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,200
you may deny it.

180
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,920
What do you think

181
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
the government would
do if they discovered

182
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,520
the Bai Liang brocade here?

183
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,840
You're right.

184
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,400
I'm the palace maid

185
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,800
who poisoned the Bai Liang brocade.

186
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,560
At that time,

187
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,280
I faked my death

188
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
and escaped from the palace.

189
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,520
But I never thought

190
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,840
they'd locate my whereabouts.

191
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,440
I was hunted down

192
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,640
and almost got killed.

193
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
It was Lady Xu who saved me.

194
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,320
In order to survive,

195
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
I hid in the Xu family.

196
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,080
When Lady Xu passed on,

197
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,840
I took care of Qingmei.

198
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
I wanted

199
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,360
to spend my rest life in peace.

200
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,000
But who knew that...

201
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,320
Do you think I'm ignorant?

202
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,240
You were so loyal to Lady Xu

203
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
because you were being hunted down.

204
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,960
She had saved you.

205
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,640
How did you know about this?

206
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,880
I overheard

207
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,080
your conversation with her.

208
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,600
What else did you know?

209
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,160
Everything.

210
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,800
He Da found out my secret.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,240
So he must die.

212
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,480
I only intended to kill him.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
But

214
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,040
I came across you

215
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,480
when I looked for Qingmei.

216
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,480
Since Bai Liang Clan was destroyed,

217
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,720
the only person who
knows about this special skill,

218
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,960
and appeared in this town
seven years ago by coincidence,

219
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,840
is the palace maid from the Laundry
Bureau who played dead years ago.

220
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,400
I overheard that

221
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,120
you're looking for the palace maid
from the Laundry Bureau.

222
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,320
If you continue the investigation,

223
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,200
you'll eventually discover my true identity.

224
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
Instead of sitting through,

225
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,040
I'd rather pave a better
way for Qingmei,

226
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,080
just to repay Lady for saving me then.

227
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,480
So

228
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,480
who instructed you to kill

229
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,880
the late emperor?

230
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,720
It was Prince Yun.

231
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,680
He instructed me

232
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,880
to poison the laundry water.

233
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,920
No wonder

234
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,280
other maids of the Bureau
had red and swollen hands.

235
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,320
How could you come out

236
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
such a vicious plot?

237
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,240
Madam,

238
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,880
did you know that

239
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,240
my parents died because of you?

240
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,720
You killed my entire Clan.

241
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,480
Did they deserve to die too?

242
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
You're

243
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,800
from the Bai Liang Clan?

244
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,680
You...

245
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,720
At that time, I know nothing

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
about his entire plan.

247
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,640
Madam!

248
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,400
She had poison!

249
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,240
Madam!

250
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,160
Madam!

251
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,160
Madam.

252
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,080
Madam.

253
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I

254
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,760
committed too many evil doings.

255
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,760
I can't

256
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,880
live on.

257
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,600
Please

258
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,120
take good care

259
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,880
of Qingmei

260
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,640
for me.

261
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,000
Madam.

262
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,640
After all these while,

263
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
we've finally found

264
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,000
the real culprit of
Bai Liang brocade poisoning.

265
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,960
It's a pity that...

266
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,040
No.

267
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,320
There's nothing to pity about.

268
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,200
Your clan is innocent.

269
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,960
The truth will eventually come to light.

270
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,040
Although madam had left a confession,

271
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
she passed on.

272
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,040
There's no witness left.

273
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,720
How can we testify against Prince Yun

274
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,160
and make him confess his crime?

275
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,800
An eye for an eye.

276
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,840
I promise you

277
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,120
I'll seek justice

278
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,800
for the innocence.

279
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,720
Don't be rash.

280
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,800
Don't worry.

281
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,360
I won't put myself in danger.

282
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,480
After all, I have you now.

283
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,040
I don't want you to worry about me.

284
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,800
I'm not worried about you.

285
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,600
Anyway,

286
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,600
now that Bai Liang Clan's innocence

287
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,840
has been proven,

288
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,120
I'm up to request something from you.

289
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,120
What do you want?

290
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,200
I want to fight with you

291
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,480
to make the culprit plead guilty

292
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,520
and seek justice for the dead

293
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,000
who were wronged.

294
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,640
Brother Xie,

295
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,480
why hasn't you packed up?

296
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,640
I'll do it in awhile.

297
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,680
Brother Xie,

298
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,960
why have you been

299
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
ignoring Sister Rushuang lately?

300
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,840
Have

301
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,400
I?

302
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,720
Stop feigning.

303
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,960
I know all

304
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,840
your little tricks.

305
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,880
What a little kid like you know?

306
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,280
Why don't I know?

307
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,640
At least I know that

308
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,960
to make a woman to dislike you,

309
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,360
the best way

310
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,680
isn't to avoid her.

311
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
Wait!

312
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,720
What's it then?

313
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,000
See.

314
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,360
You don't know about it, right?

315
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,360
I've learned it from the folk book that

316
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,440
if you want

317
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,960
to make a woman to dislike you,

318
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
the best way

319
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
is to like another woman.

320
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,040
In this way,

321
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
she'll get angry

322
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,600
and leave you.

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,280
What you said

324
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,880
does make sense.

325
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,280
I've made it!

326
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,160
I've found the cure for the epidemic!

327
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,040
Hurry up.

328
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,240
She has made the antidote.

329
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's go.

330
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
Go yourself. I have to pack up.

331
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,040
Be careful.

332
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,000
Thank you.

333
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,040
Here, don't spill out.

334
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,080
Thank you.

335
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,240
Here. Be careful.

336
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
Here. Thank you.

337
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,800
Take it easy

338
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,800
and queue up.

339
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,040
- Everyone will get one.
- Thank you.

340
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Don't spill.

341
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,440
Be careful.

342
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,680
Thank you.

343
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Take your time.

344
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,010
(Capital)

345
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,650
(Vermilion Bird Street)

346
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,240
Mister, you're so handsome.

347
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,960
Welcome in.

348
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,200
You're so sweet.

349
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,880
Welcome in.

350
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,120
(Pei Mansion)

351
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,920
Xie Beiming.

352
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,880
Rushuang.

353
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,560
Why did you drink so much?

354
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Wine.

355
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,240
Give it to me.

356
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,110
You're smelly.
How much have you drunk?

357
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Not much.

358
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,760
Only a little.

359
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,280
Come on.

360
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,840
What happened to him lately?

361
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Is it rouge?

362
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,080
Xie Beiming,

363
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,680
you're doomed!

364
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,200
Rushuang,

365
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,920
where are you going in such a hurry?

366
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,760
It's here.

367
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,880
We're here.

368
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,640
(Yaohua Store)
A rouge shop.

369
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,600
Do you want to buy rouge?

370
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,160
Just follow me.

371
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,840
Young Master,

372
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,280
why Sister Rushuang didn't

373
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,240
take Brother Xie to shop?

374
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,080
You'd better speak less and observe more.

375
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,840
Don't come over.

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
- Come on.
- Don't come over.

377
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,280
You...

378
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,300
(Yaohua Store)

379
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,120
Young Master,

380
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,000
it's Brother Jiang.

381
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,240
Hold on.

382
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,160
Brother.

383
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,440
Brother.

384
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,600
Stop fighting.

385
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,560
Fine! No wonder you refused me.

386
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,320
You've got a crush
on your brother-in-law.

387
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,240
You...

388
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,000
She fell for her brother-in-law.

389
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280
What a relationship!

390
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,960
I'll beat you to death
if you keep talking nonsense.

391
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,160
Come on.

392
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,920
Everyone, look.

393
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,400
The adulterous are gonna kill me.

394
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,600
The adulterous are gonna kill me.

395
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,440
It's not true.

396
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,040
I saw it.

397
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,720
You molested this lady.

398
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,240
He's just extending his help.

399
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,960
Yes, I saw it too.

400
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
You ganged up on me.

401
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,120
Think carefully before you speak.

402
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,120
Otherwise,

403
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,840
follow me back to Mingjing Office.

404
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
Sorry, I was wrong.

405
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,320
I won't show you any mercy
if you dare to cause trouble again.

406
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,960
Alright.

407
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,720
Alright, don't look on.

408
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,880
Go.

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,720
Are you all right?

410
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,600
Thank you.

411
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,760
Thank you.

412
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,360
Your Highness.

413
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,600
Your Highness.

414
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,760
Don't stand on ceremony.

415
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,520
She's Detective Su.

416
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
This is my sister-in-law, Song Yao.

417
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,480
Sister Song,

418
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,880
do you remember me?

419
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,480
Of course.

420
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,400
You came to my shop
2 months ago to look for rouge.

421
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,160
Am I right?

422
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,160
Yes, that's me.

423
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,560
I want another help.

424
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,640
Come on in.

425
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,600
Please have a seat inside.

426
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,800
Your Highness,
Detective Su, this way please.

427
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,280
Please help me to check.

428
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,840
Is this rouge?

429
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,080
It is.

430
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,160
Come with me.

431
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,200
It's the same color.

432
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,760
This cherry red color
was released 2 days ago.

433
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,360
It'll brighten your face if you use it.

434
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,840
Who bought this sort in the past 2 days?

435
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,400
Two ladies and a man.

436
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,960
What man?

437
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,760
Does he look few years older than me?

438
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,400
He's quite tall and strong.

439
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
Is it that he looks decent

440
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,520
but tricky

441
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
and foolish?

442
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,680
Are you referring to

443
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,000
Xie Beiming?

444
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Do you know him?

445
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,040
He bought a rouge from me 2 days ago.

446
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,920
It's the same sort.

447
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
He said he bought it for his sweetheart.

448
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,280
He specifically told me his name.

449
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,200
Fine, Xie Beiming.

450
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,640
You're doomed!

451
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,320
Rushuang.

452
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,200
Back then,

453
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,440
Xiwu was married for
less than half a month

454
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,960
before he went to war with us.

455
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,720
Your Highness,

456
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,280
I knew about my younger brother.

457
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,880
He never regretted

458
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,760
in fighting for the country with you.

459
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,160
After he passed on,

460
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,720
we received pension from Your Highness
and the imperial court.

461
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,080
It's sufficient to live by.

462
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,360
But

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,720
my sister-in-law liked rouges

464
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,440
so she opened this shop.

465
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,480
I often came over to help.

466
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,440
Your Highness, please have a rest here.

467
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,120
I have something to attend upstairs.

468
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,560
If she gets busy in daily life,

469
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,640
she can be solaced.

470
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,600
I didn't bring it up previously.

471
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,240
I thought you'd think a widow

472
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,240
like her should not show
herself in the public all the day.

473
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
It would be inappropriate.

474
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,760
Who says women should
lock themselves at home

475
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,360
and shouldn't step out of the house?

476
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,120
It's a good that a woman like her

477
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,400
can support herself.

478
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,920
But

479
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,920
you've been too impulsive today.

480
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,520
Tian Yong

481
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,120
always came over to cause trouble.

482
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,480
I couldn't bear it any longer

483
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,720
so I beat him.

484
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,440
If it occurs again,

485
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,360
just put him into the jail.

486
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,760
You don't need to do it yourself.

487
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,280
Yes.

488
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,640
Xie Beiming, you're a jerk!

489
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,560
Come on.

490
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,360
Rushuang,

491
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,040
talk to him nicely later.

492
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I'll dig him out today.

493
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,680
Wenwen.

494
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,120
Detective Su.

495
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,320
Ms. Rushuang.

496
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,720
Xie Beiming, what are you doing?

497
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,800
You're just in time.

498
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,680
I've got something to tell you.

499
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,160
Rushuang,

500
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,240
let's break up.

501
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,480
What are you saying?

502
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,080
Ms. Wenwen and I

503
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,040
love each other.

504
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,960
I'll redeem her later

505
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,360
and marry her.

506
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,560
Xie Beiming, you're a jerk.

507
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,480
Rushuang.

508
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,480
Rushuang.

509
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,920
She is prettier,

510
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,960
gentler

511
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,080
and sings and dances better than you.

512
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,640
What else do you know

513
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,440
besides medicinal herbs?

514
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,520
Are you despising me?

515
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,200
We Feiyun Manor

516
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,240
can't have a village tomboy

517
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,840
as its Young Lady.

518
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,600
My adoptive father won't agree to it.

519
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,040
How about her then?

520
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,080
Is a prostitute like her

521
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,320
a good match of Feiyun Manor?

522
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,040
Although she works at a brothel,

523
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
she's still a virgin.

524
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,040
She lives only by artistic skills.

525
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,560
I just love her!

526
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,560
Fine!

527
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,800
Young Master Xie,

528
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,000
Ms. Wenwen,

529
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,840
I wish you a happy marriage!

530
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,800
Rushuang.

531
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,560
Sister Su,

532
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,840
Xie Beiming dumped me.

533
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,640
He said that he only liked me.

534
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,920
I know.

535
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,760
He promised to fight for justice

536
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,920
with me.

537
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,480
He also promised
to stay by my side forever.

538
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,200
But why does he despise me now?

539
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Sister Su,

540
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,160
do all men

541
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,360
like beautiful girls?

542
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,920
No one likes

543
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,200
a tomboy like me, right?

544
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,040
How could it be?

545
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,840
You're not a tomboy.

546
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,960
Besides,

547
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,200
Brother Xie isn't like the others.

548
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,960
But he just said...

549
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,200
Rushuang,

550
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
calm down.

551
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,200
He fell in love with you at first sight,

552
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,640
thought of you every day,

553
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,120
and was willing to die

554
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,680
for you.

555
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,920
Why did he suddenly fall in love
with someone else?

556
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,000
But Wenwen's rouge was found

557
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,160
on his clothes.

558
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,280
They must have had
close body contact.

559
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,920
Rushuang,

560
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,800
tell me.

561
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,520
Would you specifically
tell the shopkeeper

562
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,440
your name when you

563
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,920
were to buy something?

564
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,040
No.

565
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Then.

566
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,280
If you fell for someone else,

567
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,800
would you bring him home

568
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,280
just to quarrel with Brother Xie?

569
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,720
No.

570
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,160
Xie Beiming would definitely kill him.

571
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,680
Do you mean that

572
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,440
he's lying to me?

573
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,560
Why did he do this then?

574
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,240
I'm just guessing.

575
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,320
You need

576
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,360
to ask him yourself.

577
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,040
Stop crying.

578
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,880
I never thought

579
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
Rushuang

580
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,800
would shed tears for Brother Xie.

581
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,360
Why do you think

582
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,240
Brother Xie treated Rushuang like that?

583
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,160
He might have some difficulties.

584
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,040
Did you know something about him?

585
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,280
It's hard to rationalize love.

586
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Didn't you alienate me on purpose too?

587
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,960
I...

588
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,240
Wasn't that a misunderstanding?

589
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,320
(Pei Mansion)

590
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,320
Brother Pei.

591
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,680
You've been drinking since last night.

592
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,040
What's the matter?

593
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,320
Nothing.

594
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,440
You've been helping me

595
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,480
ever since we met.

596
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,640
Do tell me

597
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,160
if you have any difficulties.

598
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,920
I'll do my best to help you.

599
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,360
I'm fine, Brother Pei.

600
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,880
Then,

601
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,360
I'd like to seek for your help.

602
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,640
Just fire away, Brother Pei.

603
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,240
If it's within my abilities,

604
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,640
I'll surely help you out.

605
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
You knew that

606
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,240
Little Su wanted to seek justice

607
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,840
for Bai Liang Clan.

608
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,200
And I couldn't take my mind off
the Battle of Honggu.

609
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,480
Whether it's Bai Liang case,

610
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,840
Battle of Honggu

611
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,320
or the sudden death of the late emperor,

612
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,920
all evidence show Prince
Yun is the culprit.

613
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,960
He has been governing
the country for years

614
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,400
with great authority and influence.

615
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,000
I can't

616
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,320
defeat him alone.

617
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,800
I hope

618
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,000
you can help me.

619
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,880
Brother Pei,

620
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,520
I am

621
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,680
just an idler.

622
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
I know nothing
about imperial court affairs.

623
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,280
I'm afraid

624
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,480
I'm unable to help you.

625
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,120
Are you rejecting me

626
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,240
because you want to help

627
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,160
Prince Yun?

628
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
You

629
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,760
knew it?

630
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,680
What do I know?

631
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,440
That you're his adopted son?

632
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,080
When did you find out?

633
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,120
A little later than you.

634
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,240
Why

635
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,240
did you let me

636
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,280
follow you to Nanxun then?

637
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,200
Aren't you afraid that I'd inform

638
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
him about madam?

639
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,640
You didn't do that, did you?

640
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
No.

641
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,680
Although he's my adoptive father,

642
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,560
I know what's right

643
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,000
and what's wrong.

644
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,600
Besides,

645
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,960
we've braced many obstacles together.

646
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,480
You're my best friends.

647
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,680
I, Xie Beiming,

648
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,480
will never betray my friends.

649
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,960
But

650
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,840
my negligence

651
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,000
has revealed your whereabouts.

652
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,720
I'm sorry.

653
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,560
Brother Xie,

654
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,720
you were taken advantage of.

655
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,160
It's not your fault.

656
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Brother Pei,

657
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,240
do you really think so?

658
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,440
But

659
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,520
my adoptive father treats me well.

660
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,040
Everything I have is given by him.

661
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,520
I can't betray him too.

662
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,670
Why is it a betrayal?

663
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,480
If his actions are righteous,

664
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,560
then I have nothing to say.

665
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,230
But he persecuted the loyals

666
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,880
all for himself.

667
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,360
Aren't you distorting the truth

668
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,560
if you continue to be loyal to him?

669
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,000
But

670
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,360
he's my adoptive father after all.

671
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,480
I can't treat my adoptive father...

672
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,600
Why did you drink so much

673
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,150
if he really cares for you?

674
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,260
Miss Xu.

675
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,940
Young Master Pei.

676
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,300

Miss Xu, what are you looking at?

681
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,100
This is a portrait of my mother.

682
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,860
Madam brought it to me.

683
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,700

Whenever I look at my mother's portrait,

689
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,380
I'll tell myself that
