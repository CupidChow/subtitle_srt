(Episode 23)

15
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,160
(Maoyuan Inn)

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,400
Look at you now.
Are you still trying to avoid me?

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,000
So to you

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,280
I'm someone who schemes
in such a Machiavellian way

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,320
and also a brutal man.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
right?

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,160
If he really was the murderer of my clan,

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,600
why would he risk his life to save me?

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,320
He is also investigating the Bai Liang Case

24
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,600
with all his heart.

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
Father.

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,680
Mother.

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,520
Should I trust him?

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,400
Hold on.

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,920
Are you taking the shift at the graveyard?

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm going with you.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,160
You're safer here.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,040
Little Su.

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Did you follow me because

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,760
you're worried about me?

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,920
Why haven't we arrived?

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
Are we there?

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,080
Let's talk when we arrive.

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,320
We'll be there soon.

40
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,080
What are you doing?

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,960
Someone's there.

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Why should we hide?

43
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,600
We cannot make them alert.

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,400
This is it, right?

45
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,280
Yeah.

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,280
Only one? Let's do it.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sir.

48
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,320
You've been following me
since that day at the Capital Suburb.

49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,520
You finally show yourself today.

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,920
You're good indeed.

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,560
It's a fake cemetery of Li.

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,640
Yet you've been waiting here for days

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,840
just to set a trap

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,360
and catch me, right?

55
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
You are my what I want

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,960
all this while.

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
We can ask the government to help us.

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,800
Get two abandoned land to make ditches.

59
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,120
One of the land

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
is the Cemetery of Li.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,200
The cemetery has to be relocated to dig ditches.

62
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,680
Li Mu will appear if he's still alive.

63
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,200
What about the other abandoned land?

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
We can make a fake cemetery.

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Why?

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,760
We've been followed

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
all the way here.

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,080
I'm afraid

69
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,440
the mastermind behind
has been alerted of our operation.

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,600
Rushuang and Little Su

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,800
shall wait at the Cemetery of Li.

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,560
I will be at the fake cemetery with Brother Xie

73
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,560
to draw them out.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,160
I want him alive.

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,920
Yes.

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,600
Go.

77
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,320
Yes.

78
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,600
Your Highness.

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,920
Mr. Xie has captured the workers
relocating the cemetery.

80
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,280
Let's go.

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,240
Young Master.

82
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,080
Brother Pei.

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,400
-Sister Su.
-Young Master.

84
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,320
You are finally here.

85
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,880
Here they are.

86
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,680
We've been waiting for you so long.

87
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,480
They're here.

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,720
Young Master.

89
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
(Li Mu's Grave)

90
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,400
What is your relationship

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,360
with the dead?

92
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,960
No.

93
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
We are just workers.

94
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,720
We get paid

95
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,080
to relocate the cemetery.

96
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,600
Why do you

97
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,840
do the relocation

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,840
sneakily at this weird time?

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,640
Here's all the money we have.

100
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,720
Here you are.

101
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,080
Do we look like bandits to you?

102
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,240
Give us the answer.

103
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
Why are you here sneakily at night?

104
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,080
You are...

105
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
really not robbers?

106
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,400
Do we look like robbers to you?

107
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,640
Just answer our questions.

108
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,560
Corpses cannot be exposed to sunlight.

109
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,240
Yes.

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,120
That's why we move them after sunset.

111
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,480
It's a local custom.

112
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,880
Sir., Misses.

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
We are just workers.

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,920
(Li Mu's Grave)
He paid us.

115
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Ask him.

116
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,840
I...

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,240
I...

118
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
(Li Mu's Grave)
I don't know anything.

119
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,480
I...

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,880
Someone gave me a tael of silver yesterday.

121
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,360
He asked me to pay them

122
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,640
so I came here.

123
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,760
What did he look like?

124
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,800
Where did he live?

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
He covered his face.

126
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,560
I don't know as well.

127
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,600
I came here

128
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,280
because of this tael of silver.

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,880
I thought it's easy.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,040
It seems

131
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
they're telling the truth.

132
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,840
What about the employer?

133
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
He covered his face too.

134
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,160
After he paid us the deposit,

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,560
he set a time

136
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,400
for us to relocate these 3 graves.

137
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,560
We haven't got the rest yet.

138
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,760
My lords.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,280
We still have work to do.

140
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,480
Can we start now?

141
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
The government

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,160
will deal with it.

143
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,160
You may leave.

144
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,400
Alright, let's go.

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,640
You stay.

146
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,000
We still have questions for you.

147
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
Where did you meet him?

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,840
If I knew I would be in trouble,

149
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,960
I wouldn't have taken the money.

150
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
It's at the front of my shop.

151
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,080
He came up to me.

152
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,440
You mean that

153
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,560
he lives around?

154
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
I...

155
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,080
Is it a custom to spread

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,040
rosin powder when relocating the graves?

157
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,720
It's for the family members

158
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,440
to spread when relocating.

159
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
So the spirit of the dead can

160
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
find the way to the new grave

161
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,240
by following the smell of rosin powder

162
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,520
in case they get lost

163
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,560
and wander alone.

164
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,800
We don't spread it here

165
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,200
as we're strangers.

166
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,720
Then why is there the rosin powder?

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,560
What...

168
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,120
If a stranger uses rosin powder,

169
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,120
he'll be haunted.

170
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,160
Is it possible if anyone
doesn't know that?

171
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,360
Every one here

172
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,960
surely knows that.

173
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,760
I got it.

174
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,800
It's the worker.

175
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,080
The one we're looking for

176
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,840
was hiding amongst the workers just now.

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,960
Stop!

178
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,670
Stop!

179
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,240
Stop!

180
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,320
Stop!

181
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,280
How is it?

182
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,440
We lost him.

183
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,960
What...

184
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,960
What are you trying to do?

185
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
Don't panic.

186
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,960
We just want to ask about Li Mu.

187
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,040
I...

188
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm not Li Mu.

189
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,760
I'm just a worker.

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,880
Why did you spread the rosin powder

191
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,680
if you're not related to Li Mu?

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

193
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,800
Watch out.

194
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,160
Catch him!

195
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you alright?

196
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,800
Are you alright?

197
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,680
Take care of yourself.

198
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Are you Li Mu?

199
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
Who are you?

200
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,920
Su Ci from Mingjing Office.

201
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm investigating the Bai Liang Case.

202
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,800
Are you Li Mu?

203
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,840
I knew

204
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,720
I'd get doomed someday.

205
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,440
We Bai Liang clan

206
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,040
couldn't be wrongly killed for nothing.

207
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,880
Tell me everything you know.

208
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,240
You are...

209
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,960
from the Bai Liang Clan?

210
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes.

211
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,440
What do you know?

212
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Tell me everything.

213
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,840
What you want

214
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,800
is buried...

215
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,640
between the two graves.

216
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,880
Bai Liang Clan was..

217
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,680
Li Mu!

218
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,800
Li Mu!

219
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,600
You can't die!

220
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,160
Wake up.

221
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,280
Li Mu!

222
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
Why are you here?

223
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,400
Let's go.

224
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,200
Hold on.

225
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,800
Take it slow.

226
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,840
Be careful.

227
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,240
Brother Jiang.

228
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,880
Where is Young Master?

229
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,400
His Highness was injured.

230
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,240
Injured?

231
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,560
Detective Su took him away.

232
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,040
Look over there! Go!

233
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,480
Take it slow.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,720
Brother Pei!

235
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,960
-Your Highness.
-Young Master!

236
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,360
Your Highness.

237
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,320
Sister Su!

238
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,720
-Young Master!
-Your Highness!

239
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,040
-Your Highness!
-Brother Su!

240
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,880
Your Highness!

241
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,480
-Sister Su!
-Young Master!

242
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,280
-Brother Pei!
-Young Master!

243
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Your Highness! Sister Su!

244
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,440
Young Master!

245
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,120
We should search separately.

246
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
Rushuang, come with me.

247
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,320
You two follow Brother Xie.

248
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

249
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,760
Others come with me.

250
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,360
Brother Pei!

251
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,160
Young Master!

252
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,280
Your Highness!

253
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,120
Watch out.

254
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,760
We'll be there soon.

255
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Hold it.

256
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,480
Here.

257
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,040
How do you feel right now?

258
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,200
I'm fine.

259
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,240
Let me check.

260
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,680
You're wounded so much.

261
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,880
How could you be fine?

262
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,080
It's not a big deal.

263
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,120
What's...

264
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,400
How did you get this?

265
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,600
I saved a girl

266
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,920
on the march.

267
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
She bit me.

268
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,830
(Yan)

269
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,160
Do you...

270
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,560
still remember it?

271
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,120
Take this.

272
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,080
Remember.

273
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,840
Live on no matter how difficult it is.

274
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,920
Are you...

275
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,760
It's you.

276
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,520
Little Su.

277
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,440
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

279
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,440
You saved me

280
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,640
but I still misunderstood you.

281
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,120
It's not your fault.

282
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,200
Your injury...

283
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
You're so injured.

284
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,880
I will get you some herbs.

285
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,400
I'll be back soon.

286
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,920
I'll be back soon.

287
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,120
Wait for me.

288
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,640
Wait for me.

289
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,200
-Your Highness!
-Where are you?

290
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,280
-Your Highness!
-Where are you?

291
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,400
-Your Highness!
-Where are you?

292
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,160
Brother Pei!

293
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,360
Young Master!

294
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,000
Sister Su!

295
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,560
-Young Master!
-Brother Su!

296
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,800
It's alright.

297
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm okay with that.

298
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,000
You got so many injuries for saving me,

299
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,720
yet I didn't believe you.

300
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,200
It's not your fault.

301
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,040
Really.

302
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,840
We've been through so many dangers.

303
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,680
But I forgot everything

304
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,720
we've experienced

305
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,600
for a mere sound.

306
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,400
I even...

307
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,080
I even thought of killing you.

308
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Little Su.

309
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,960
I just need you

310
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,800
to trust me with all your heart right now.

311
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,680
Trust me.

312
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,680
I will investigate with you to the end.

313
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,720
But, what if...

314
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,800
I don't care.

315
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,880
No matter how it ends,

316
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,800
I will always be by your side.

317
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,000
Little Su.

318
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm really fine.

319
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,840
Such a small injury is nothing for me.

320
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,640
You're always saying that.

321
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,800
It is

322
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,440
really nothing compared to those

323
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,200
I got in wars.

324
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,840
Look.

325
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,960
This one.

326
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,640
I was shot by a poisonous arrow

327
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,080
at the Battle of Honggu.

328
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,280
This one.

329
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,920
I got hurt when the enermy rushed

330
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,480
towards me with his long saber.

331
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,320
I recovered so well, didn't I?

332
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,800
What are you thinking?

350
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,520
I'm thinking my father

351
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,240
and my mother.

352
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,880
How did they look like?

353
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,640
My father

354
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,360
was tall and strong.

355
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,040
He was strict with me.

356
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,760
My mother was gentle.

357
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,760
She's so beautiful when smiling.

358
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
What a pity.

359
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,560
I have no chance to meet them.

360
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
They're definitely watching us.

361
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,600
Little Su.

362
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,160
How did you pull through for all these years?

363
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,040
I...

364
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
wandered for a while.

365
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,840
I had no food nor warm clothes.

366
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,120
I even got bullied by other kids.

367
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,400
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,400
I should've let you stay

369
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,880
by my side at that time.

370
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm alright now.

371
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,560
A senior nun adopted me after that.

372
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,760
She told me that

373
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
if I wanted to survive,

374
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,360
I had to forget my gender completely.

375
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,280
Therefore,

376
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,240
I was raised as a boy.

377
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,680
She taught me how to investigate cases.

378
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,840
She also sent me to Mingjing Office.

379
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,280
Where is she now?

380
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,240
She passed away due to illness.

381
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,480
So I got no relatives

382
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
in the world since then.

383
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,640
It's better now.

384
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,920
You've got me.

385
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
-Young Master! Sister Su!

386
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,160
Where are you?

387
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,040
Sister Su!

388
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,320
Young Master!

389
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,400
It's Fei Yuan.

390
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,320
-Your Highness!
-Young Master!

391
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,240
Sister Su!

392
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,560
Your Highness!

393
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
-Young Master!
-Your Highness!

394
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,320
Sister Su!

395
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,680
Young Master!

396
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,680
Fei Yuan!

397
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,280
We are here!

398
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,080
-Young Master.
-It's His Highness.

399
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
-Young Master!
-Sister Su!

400
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,480
Fei Yuan!

401
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,640
Sister Su!

402
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,680
Fei Yuan!

403
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,200
Young Master, I've finally found you.

404
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Fei Yuan, if you hug me with more strength,

405
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,600
I will be dead.

406
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,960
Young Master, you're injured.

407
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,320
I'm fine.

408
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,960
I'll carry you on my back.

409
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,600
Fei Yuan!

410
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,240
It's alright.

411
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,440
Fei Yuan, let me carry him.

412
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,040
Sister Su. Are you alright?

413
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,320
I'm fine.

414
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,280
Take it slow.

415
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,360
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

416
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,520
Young Master.

417
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,720
Be careful.

418
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,760
Slowly.

419
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,040
The injury is not serious.

420
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,360
He will be fully healed in 2 days.

421
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
That's great.

422
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,920
Young Master.

423
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,120
I'll make something delicious

424
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,440
and nutrient for you.

425
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,600
Where is the killer?

426
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,840
He's dead.

427
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,120
The body is in the morgue.

428
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,200
Jiang Xiwen is dealing with it.

429
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,160
Don't worry.

430
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,520
Brother Xie.

431
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,960
I have another mission for you.

432
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,720
No problem.

433
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,040
Here it is.

434
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,120
Mr. Li.

435
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,050
Mrs. Li.

436
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,160
Li Mu.

437
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,000
We have no choice but to dig

438
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,260
your tombs.

439
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,600
Please forgive us.

440
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,720
Rushuang.

441
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,720
Do you believe there's ghost now?

442
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,960
I don't.

443
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,560
But we still have to

444
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,200
respect the dead.

445
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,120
You are right. I have to mourn them.

446
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm sorry to disturb all of you.

447
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,240
The killer showed up

448
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,040
when we reached Li Mu's house.

449
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,080
It means our guess is right.

450
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,640
I hope what Li Mu left for us

451
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,960
is really useful.

452
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,560
This also means that there is

453
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
someone keeping exposing us as well.

454
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,160
We will know it

455
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,720
when Brother Xie returns.

456
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,280
How do you think

457
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,160
those killers found us?

458
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,200
It's strange.

459
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,880
Is there a spy among us?

460
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,800
No way.

461
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,560
You, me,

462
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,640
Brother Pei, Brother Su

463
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,400
and Fei Yuan.

464
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,440
Which of us

465
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,680
looks like a spy?

466
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,120
You're right.

467
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,240
That's impossible.

468
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,280
That is weird.

469
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,040
We found it!

470
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,400
Young Master.

471
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,000
It's Li Mu's letter.

472
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,720
My brother, Li Lin, and I

473
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,960
lived together since youth.

474
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,280
He had a younger brother?

475
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,320
My brother was weak and sick all the time.

476
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,480
To find a good doctor,

477
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
I answered a request

478
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,270
to forge a letter of collaboration

479
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,480
between Bai Liang Clan and Fan Yan Na

480
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,000
after deliberation.

481
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,240
If Li Mu had a younger brother,

482
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,560
why didn't his neighbours knew about him?

483
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,040
He wrote that

484
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,960
the birth of Li Lin

485
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,680
was ominous.

486
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,840
He wasn't allowed see others nor go out

487
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,200
before he became an adult.

488
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,280
He couldn't go out.

489
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,480
The secret room

490
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
was used to hide him

491
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,120
when someone visited.

492
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,880
So, was it Li Mu or Li Lin
who hid in the secret room

493
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,800
to escape from the fire?

494
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,520
It should be Li Mu.

495
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,280
Li Lin.

496
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,760
Why are you closing the door?

497
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Someone sneaked in during the day.

498
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
They searched for half a day...

499
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,800
and left with nothing.

500
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,880
I was down there

501
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,000
so they didn't find me.

502
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,200
They will never let you go.

503
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,400
It's the only way

504
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,200
I thought of.

505
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,000
No.

506
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,960
Li Lin!

507
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,960
Li Lin!

508
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,800
Li Lin!

509
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,840
What are you doing?

510
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,040
Li Lin!

511
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,600
Open up!

512
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,360
Brother.

513
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,240
There's food and water inside.

514
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,400
Remember.

515
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,160
Come out after two to three days.

516
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,000
No, Li Lin!

517
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,240
Stop it!

518
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,400
You... Li Lin!

519
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,760
Besiege this place.

520
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,800
Open up!

521
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,760
Brother, they're coming.

522
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,120
Don't come out.

523
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,960
You...

524
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,600
The one who was dead

525
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,240
who got killed.

526
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,760
The elder tried to cure the younger

527
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,600
while the younger protected the elder.

528
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,040
It's karma and

529
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,680
a causal loop indeed.

530
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,320
Look at this.

531
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,160
The handwriting was

532
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,760
so familiar.

533
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,840
It's written by Lei Zheng.

534
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,760
What's on the letter?

535
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,280
Lei Zheng?

536
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,040
This is the treason letter

537
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,280
of Bai Liang Clan with Fan Yan Na.

538
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,240
He asked Li Mu

539
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,320
to forge this in Bai Sheng's handwriting.

540
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,720
Who's

541
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,040
Bai Sheng?

542
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,600
He was the Bai Liang Clan's Leader
at that time.

543
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Bai Sheng?

544
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,320
Bai Sheng was
the Bai Liang Clan's Leader at that time?

545
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,200
So it was written by Bai Sheng?

546
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,280
No.

547
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,920
The evidence left my Li Mu has been found.

548
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,600
I guess things have a way

549
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,120
of working themselves out.

550
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,040
Hold it.

551
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,000
I need to rearrange my thoughts.

552
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,160
Lei Zheng asked Liang Feng

553
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,560
to find a student who was good
at mimicking handwritings

554
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,000
and Li Mu was chosen.

555
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,240
After that,

556
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
he handed Bai Sheng's letter to Li Mu

557
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,160
so Li Mu could forge the letter
of Bai Liang Clan's treason.

558
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,520
Later,

559
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,320
Liang Feng used the letter
to blackmail Lei Zheng

560
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,720
and ask Lei Zheng to promote Liang Cheng.

561
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,320
Brother Su.

562
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,960
You solved the case

563
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,560
just from a letter to Lei Zheng by Liang Feng.

564
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,120
That's unbelievable.

565
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,040
Sister Su.

566
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,080
Why do you look so pale?

567
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,120
Brother Su.

568
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,040
This is a key evidence.

569
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,560
You should be happy.

570
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,560
What's wrong?

571
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
To me,

572
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
this case

573
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,480
is not just an official matter.

574
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,840
It's about my past.

575
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,960
I wanted to

576
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,120
keep this a secret

577
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,160
until the case was solved.

578
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,680
But you got involoved unaware

579
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,720
as my friends.

580
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,040
The case

581
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,720
is getting out of control now.

582
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I don't want to see

583
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,240
any of you get in danger because of me.

584
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
So,

585
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,400
I have to tell you.

586
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,680
What do you mean?

587
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,400
Actually...

588
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,280
Actually, Bai Sheng...

589
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,920
was my father.

590
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,200
Bai Liang Clan was slaughtered.

591
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,800
I'm the only one

592
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,560
survived.

593
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,200
So you're also a Bai Liang crinimal?

594
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,280
No!

595
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,040
I don't mean that.

596
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,880
It's just...

597
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
It's too dangerous.

598
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,680
We need to hide you.

599
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,720
Yes.

600
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,480
You'll be dead if anyone from

601
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,320
the palace

602
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,680
finds out you're still alive.

603
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,800
I have an idea.

604
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,840
Feiyun Manor

605
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,360
has an inn at the desert.

606
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,640
Brother Su, you can go there.

607
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,120
It's a vast with less people,
far from the capital.

608
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,360
No one knows you.

609
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,640
Brother Pei,

610
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,640
you might have to suffer a bit.

611
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,960
It's alright.

612
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,400
He's used to not having a proper job.

613
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,880
