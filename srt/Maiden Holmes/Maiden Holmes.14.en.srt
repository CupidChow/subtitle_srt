Kill the enemy!

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,360
Kill the enemy!

17
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,400
Kill the enemy!

18
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,840
I will protect you.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,680
Brother Pei!

20
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,880
I will protect you!

21
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,360
Brother Pei!

22
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,600
-Brother Pei!
-Let go of me! Let go of me!

23
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
I have to save them! I have to save them!

24
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,760
-Brother Pei!
-Brother Pei!

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,040
-Young Master!
-Come and help!

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,560
-Let go of me! Let go of me!
-Young Master!

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,360
Brother Pei! Calm down!

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,240
Let go of me!

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Calm down! Young Master!

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,720
Young Master, what's wrong with you?

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,040
Rushuang!

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,160
I don't know...

33
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,440
How could you say that?

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,920
Young Master!

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,520
Young Master! Wake up!

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,800
Rushuang! Check on him.

37
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,280
Yong Master!

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,080
How's he?

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Is it poisonous?

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,880
The poison has been completely
removed from the body.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,160
He is still weak,

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
but he's safe now.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,640
Really?

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,160
That's a relief.

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,040
Brother Pei.

46
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,080
Rushuang.

47
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,120
Brother Pei.

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,320
Can you tell me the number?

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,840
What about this?

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,839
And this?

51
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,839
Rushuang. What's wrong with him?

52
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,959
Brother Xie.

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
It's time for you to shave.

54
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,520
Brother Pei. You scared the shit out of me!

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,880
Good for you! Young Master.
You're able see things now!

56
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,960
Rushuang, you're amazing!

57
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,240
-That's for sure.
-Rushuang.

58
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
Good for you.

59
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,880
Little Fei Yuan.

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,400
Shouldn't you reward me

61
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
with something delicious?

62
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,440
Yes, of course.

63
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,760
Move to the left, down, and down.

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,920
-Move straight up.
-All right.

65
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,400
Right. Move over there.

66
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:18,920
Is that okay?

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,800
Move down a little.

68
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,680
Yeah, that's right.

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,440
That's it.

70
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,240
Is there anything special about today?

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,320
It's a big day.

72
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,320
(Pei Mansion)
Come! Whoever sees it has a share!

73
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
Come on, over here.

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,080
Get it here.

75
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,000
-Please give me one.
-Thank you.

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
-Come on.
-Thanks.

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,920
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,200
-This one for you.
-One for me, please. Thanks.

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
-Here you go.
-Please give me one.

80
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,200
And one for me please.

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,600
-Thank you.
-Here, this is for you.

82
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
You look beautiful.

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,800
What takes
Rushuang and Detective Su

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,600
so long to be here?

85
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,120
I also want to know why.

86
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,800
Here I come.

87
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
-Rushuang!
-Hurry up, Rushuang.

88
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
So many foods!

89
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,640
Where is Brother Su?

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
Brother Su...

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
Who's this lady?

92
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm Su Ci.

93
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,720
You must be kidding!

94
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,720
So all of you have known about it?

95
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,960
I'm the only one knowing nothing?

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm sorry, Brother Xie.

97
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,000
I...

98
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,400
apologize with a toast.

99
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,320
You can't drink, don't force yourself.

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
I usually don't drink,

101
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,120
but since we have such a rare chance

102
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,640
to be so frank,

103
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,800
I have to drink it up.

104
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,760
Brother Xie.

105
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,560
Brother Su, to you.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,240
Friends should
be straightforward and aboveboard.

107
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,800
I shouldn't have lied

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
to you guys.

109
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,720
I'll drink it up as an apology.

110
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,560
Especially you, Rushuang.

111
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
Thank you for forgiving me.

112
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
I swear that

113
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,120
whenever you need me,

114
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,640
I'll try and make it for you,

115
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,320
and will never reject you.

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm broad-minded.

117
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,880
I'll let bygones be bygones.

118
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,320
From now on, we are sisters.

119
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,080
Sisters.

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,760
Great.

121
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
It's great.

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,840
I'm glad for that.

123
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
Brother Su, I

124
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,480
I thought that Brother Pei and you

125
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,080
might be gays.

126
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,159
It almost drove me crazy.

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,720
I think I need a drink to calm down.

128
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,799
The misunderstanding shows that

129
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,000
Brother Xie is the most tolerant.

130
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,799
I'm different from that
stubborn Little Fei Yuan.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,520
You can't even tell that Detective Su is a girl,

132
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
you dumb.

133
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,200
Don't speak like you are the first
knowing the truth.

134
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,320
I knew it earlier than you.

135
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,640
How dare you fight back?

136
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,560
You get the water, and I get the drink,
dare to fight?

137
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,080
Come on!

138
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,520
Let's have a toast.

139
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,520
-Here.
-Cheers!

140
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm full.

141
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,040
Does anyone want to have a walk?

142
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,880
I'll go with you.

143
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,280
Let's go.

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Let's go, Little Fei Yuan.

145
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,000
I haven't finished it.

146
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,360
You've eaten a lot.

147
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,760
You'll gain weight if you continue to eat.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,400
That's right.

149
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,360
Let's go.

150
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,360
Rushuang.

151
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,720
Little Su.

152
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,720
This is for you.

153
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Isn't this

154
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,080
the luminous pearl you've kept with you?

155
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,200
I've ground the pearl into a smaller size

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,080
so that

157
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
it fits on the hairpin.

158
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,280
Little Su.

159
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,400
You said that

160
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
Prince Qi was like a flash of light.

161
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,440
And now

162
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
if you will,

163
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,040
the light

164
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,040
will always be with you.

165
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Will

166
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,000
you?

167
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,320
I have become accustomed to eating alone,

168
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,720
going to the street alone,

169
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,360
living in the distorted world all by myself.

170
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,720
I...

171
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,440
I don't know.

172
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,920
Little Su.

173
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,760
You're no longer by yourself.

174
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,960
You have Rushuang.

175
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,320
You have Brother Xie.

176
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,840
You have Fei Yuan.

177
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,920
And...

178
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,240
me.

179
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,520
But I have weird temper.

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,080
And I don't have so tactful. I...

181
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,240
That's all right.

182
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,240
I'm brazen and I have good temper.

183
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,520
I don't care about those.

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,680
I'm poor in needlework.

185
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,440
I can't cook well.

186
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
Don't forget I'm Prince Qi,

187
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,360
so you don't need to do
the embroidery or cooking.

188
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
And I...

189
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,960
That's enough.

190
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,640
I'll put it on for you.

can make that work.

230
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,000
Rushuang.

231
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,840
Are you available now?

232
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,520
Yes.

233
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,520
Let's continue to drink.

234
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,240
Okay.

235
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,480
Great.

236
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,600
Xie Beiming.

237
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Wake up.

238
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,840
Go and get me more bottles of wine.

239
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,680
We have no wine left.

240
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
I've had enough.

241
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,920
It's different from what I thought.

242
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,600
Your Highness.

243
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,440
Are you looking for me?

244
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,800
Go and check whether there are women

245
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,160
enrolling in private schools
in the states and counties,

246
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,280
or joining the annual army recruitment.

247
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,120
If so,

248
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,920
find out what actions were taken
by the government

249
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,040
and how people thought of it.

250
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,160
Collect all the information and report to me.

251
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:28,297
Yes.

252
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,160
Go.

253
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
(Mingjing Office)
The content of the promotion exam

254
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,400
for government officials

255
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,400
has been confirmed,

256
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,800
which is divided into civil examination
and military examination.

257
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,080
The civil examination includes the code basis
and the simulation investigation.

258
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,960
The military examination includes archery
and martial arts competition.

259
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,120
The final results are based on the addition

260
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,680
of the four subjects.

261
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,040
The specific arrangements

262
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,680
are already in your hands.

263
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,480
Remember,

264
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
there is only one

265
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
promotion quota.

266
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,520
Now go and get yourself ready.

267
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,720
Yes!

268
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:15,680
(Confidential)

269
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,560
Go.

270
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Yes.

271
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,280
These are all confidential files existed

272
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,520
before the death of the late emperor.

273
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Lead officer,

274
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,280
can I have a look?

275
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,240
Why do you want to see these dossiers?

276
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,840
Nothing.

277
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,560
I'm just curious.

278
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,920
Not now.

279
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,080
Why?

280
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,160
These files involve royal secrets.

281
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,840
You can't access them

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,720
until you get to a higher position.

283
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,160
This time, I have to succeed
in the promotion examination,

284
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,000
to review the files,

285
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,839
and prove the innocence of the Bai Liang clan.

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,040
Detective Liu.

287
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,839
How are you going to prepare
for the promotion exam?

288
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,000
What do you think I have to prepare?

289
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,319
We will only be trailed at the bottom.

290
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,640
The promotion chance
belongs to either Detective Su

291
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,440
or Detective Luo.

292
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,119
No doubt to say that Detective Su's capability

293
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,640
in the code basis
and the simulation investigation

294
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,480
ranks the top in our Mingjing Office.

295
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,160
The reputation as the great young detective

296
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,480
is not come from nowhere.

297
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,640
Are there only the code basis
and simulation investigation in the exam?

298
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,880
Regarding the archery and martial arts,

299
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,720
Detective Su's capability is the worst.

300
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,760
We should just

301
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
be on-lookers.

302
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,320
No, he...

303
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,200
Let's go.

304
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,360
Detective Su, you should practice
to improve your martial arts.

305
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,800
I won't be merciful

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
on the battlefield.

307
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
I'll do my best.

308
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,080
And I hope you would do your best.

309
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,880
Sure.

310
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,480
Don't eat first!

311
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
Wait until Sister Su comes back.

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
Fei Yuan has gone to call her.

313
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
What takes him so long?

314
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm starving.

315
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:25,960
Young Master.

316
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,280
Sister Su just came back from
the training ground.

317
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,800
She's not feeling well so she will not eat.

318
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
I'll go find her.

319
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,360
Little Su!

320
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,000
Just a minute!

321
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,680
Why don't you go and eat?

322
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm not hungry.

323
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,960
Let go of me.

324
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,120
Let go of me!

325
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,400
Where are you taking me?

326
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Let go of me.

327
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,080
You...

328
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,400
Lie down.

329
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,360
What are you doing?

330
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,120
What else can I do?

331
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,440
I do what I should.

332
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,240
You can't do that/

333
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,120
It's not the time yet.

334
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,240
You...

335
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,800
What are you

336
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,680
thinking?

337
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,080
Don't move. Lie down and don't move.

338
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,000
Actually I can do it myself.

339
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,440
If you don't want to tell me,

340
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,920
then I'll do it my way.

341
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,800
It hurts! Gently.

342
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,360
What

343
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,200
are they doing?

344
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
What else could it be?

345
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,960
Sister Su not only has to memorize the code

346
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,240
but also has to practice the martial arts

347
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
to prepare for the promotion exam.

348
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,040
That's it? I'll teach her the martial arts

349
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,280
and she will be invincible.

350
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,880
Give it back!

351
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,440
Xie Beiming.

352
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,280
Why are you still calling her as Brother Su?

353
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,760
I got used to it.

354
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
It's more natural
to call her Brother Su.

355
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,520
Don't worry.

356
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,640
It's just a small wound.

357
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,200
You should take care of yourself

358
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,160
even if it's for the promotion exam.

359
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,920
I'm fine.

360
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,600
It's not that hurt. Really.

361
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,240
Endure it, or else it will get swollen.

362
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,320
It's not a big deal.

363
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,320
Gently, gently.

364
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,120
Next time if you get hurt again,

365
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,920
I won't let you off so easily.

366
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,680
We'll start from now.

367
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,720
Defend!

368
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,200
Not bad.

369
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,800
Defend! Dodge! Block!

370
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,160
Defend! Dodge! Block!

371

Defend! Dodge! Block!

373
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Defend! Dodge! Block!

374
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,040
Defend! Dodge! Block! Dodge!

375
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
Xie Beiming! Didn't you say that
you're going to take it slowly?

376
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
Why were you showing off you skills?

377
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,280
I... I was too excited.

378
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,320
I just...

379
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,960
Brother Su, I'm so sorry.

380
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,400
That's okay. It was my problem.

381
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,840
It's really so-so

382
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
of her martial arts.

383
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,800
Come here.

The key to archery

466
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,840
is to use even force,

467

Come on.

480
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,200
Relax the fingers when loosening the string,

481
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,440
and remember not to exert force
too much to prevent string slap.

482
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,280
When pulling the string,

483
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,120
relax your body,

484
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,320
expand your hands

485
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,960
and relax your shoulder muscles.

486
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,600
Look.

487
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,120
Did you guys see that?

488
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,160
Prince Qi is teaching him hand-in-hand.

489
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,200

495
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,120

496
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,960

-Nice one!

497
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,280
-That was amazing.
-Exactly.

498
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,280
That's how it feels. Keep on practicing.

499
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,120
All right.

500
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,800
Detective Su.

501
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,960
How's your preparation for promotion going?

502
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
I'm looking at some dossiers.

503
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,320
Actually I think,

504
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,840
you don't have to be so hardworking, right?

505
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,240
After all,

506
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
you have someone who can support you.

507
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,800
Detective Feng, what do you mean by that?

508
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,400
Nothing. It's just nothing.

509
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,160
I'll be off now.

510
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:33,219
(Pei Mansion)

511
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,560
Are you saying that Prince Qi likes men?

512
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,760
I haven't finished.

513
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,720
And it was said to be a pure and innocent guy

514
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,840
from the Mingjing Office.

515
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,080
Detective Su who lives here

516
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,040
is from Mingjing Office, isn't it?

517
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,520
Perhaps.

518
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,280
Anyway, I think our young master

519
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,760
has an unusual relationship with him.

520
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,320
It's going to be a long journey
for our young master,

521
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,080
Prince Qi is his competitor after all.

522
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,720
You can go back first.

523
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,880
I can do it myself.

524
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,800
What's wrong?

525
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,960
Now all these rumors
are spreading around about us,

526
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,520
saying that we're homosexual.

527
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,840
Let them be

528
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,840
if they want.

529
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,920
I think it's better if we keep our distance.

530
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,200
That's all right. I'm Pei Zhao, as I am here.

531
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,520
Little Su.

532
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
I was born in the royal family,

533
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,840
destined to be entangled in rumors all my life.

534
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,320
What we should do

535
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,960
is to confirm our minds

536
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,560
and cherish the time

537
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,880
we spend together.

538
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,880
All right.

539
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,720
I got it.

540
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,640
Tomorrow will be the exam.

541
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,080
Get a good night's sleep.

542
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,400
Xiwen.

543
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,520
Your Highness.

544
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,680
You may rise.

545
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,560
Your Highness.

546
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,680
Here's the information
you asked me to check before.

547
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,160
In the past four years,

548
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,280
a total of 23 women in the army
disguised themselves as men,

549
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,720
and were sent out of the army.

550
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,960
Among them,

551
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,560
the highest level they reaches
was the captain of the lower army.

552
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,440
However,

553
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,240
some women were still signing up

554
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
in the army recruiting station
in the past two years.

555
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,480
Go and find someone to write a folklore

556
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,600
based on these women's military stories.

557
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,040
Find the best storytellers in the capital

558
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,640
and ask them to go to the restaurants and inns

559
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,400
telling the stories in the folklore.

560
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,000
The more incredible the storytelling,

561
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,680
the more people listen to it,
the better.

562
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,800
Your Highness.

563
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,200
All you've done

564
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,960
is for the sake of Detective Su?

565
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,152
(Pei Mansion)

566
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Little Fei Yuan. It looks amazing.

567
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,080
Sister Su, this is named
"Carp Leaping Over Dragon's Gate".

568
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,120
You will achieve great success
after having it.

569
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,400
Thanks, Fei Yuan.

570
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,480
I really appreciate it.

571
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,920
No, it's nothing.

572
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,040
Come on, try it.

573
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,760
Sister Su.

574
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,840
Here's a special sachet

575
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,240
for you.

576
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,040
It helps to calm nerves.

577
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,120
Thanks, Rushuang.

578
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,440
I'm back!

579
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,960
Brother Xie, where did you get that?

580
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,920
I guess you know nothing about it.

581
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,360
This...

582
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,040
The parrot entering the house
is a sign of good luck.

583
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,600
Come one, say something
that brings good fortune.

584
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,360
Can it talk?

585
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,920
Don't just eat, say something.

586
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,400
Brother Xie, I appreciate your kindness.

587
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,520
Wait! Brother Su, I've trained it.

588
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,760
Say something!

589
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,440
You make me feel ashamed.

590
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,520
Young Master, wishing you good fortune

591
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
and may you enjoy boundless longevity.

592
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Not this one, you idiot.

593
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,000
You idiot! You idiot!

594
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,520
Even the bird knows.

595
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,520
Eat up.

596
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,320
So cute.

597
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:53,463
(Mingjing Office)

598
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,402
(Fairness and Integrity)

599
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,120
15 minutes have passed.

600
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,240
Everyone speeds up and answer.

601
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,640
Be aware of the time left.

602
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,040
-Good.
-Nice one.

603
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,040
That's was great.

604
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,040
-Nice one!
-Good one!

605
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,000
I've said, and Detective Luo did it.

606
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,560
Next. Su Ci, Detective Su.

607
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Finally, it's his turn.

608
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,040
Look what he got.

609
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,080
-Good shot!
-Nice one!

610
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,520
Your Highness.

611
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,640
How is it?

612
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,883
(Su Ci, 25)

613
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,200
Next will be the military examination.

614
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,000
Are you going?

615
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,640
Of course I do. I'll go get changed.

616
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,160
Your Highness. I'm afraid the people

617
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,880
will live up to the rumors with your presence.

618
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,360
