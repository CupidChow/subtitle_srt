(Episode 13)

15
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,240
Fei Yuan.

16
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,240
Is Brother Pei's eye illness acting up again?

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,040
What's wrong?

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,200
Young master's eyes

19
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,800
are going blind.

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,440
What?

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,480
The imperial physician said

22
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,960
his eyes' recovery

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,840
depended on his own efforts.

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,720
What happened?

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,200
Wasn't he fine previously?

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,560
It's all because of saving you.

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,160
Tell me clearly.

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,360
What is going on?

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,080
Fei Yuan!

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
The imperial physician said

31
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,160
he might be blind

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,520
if he stopped the medication.

33
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,520
He couldn't find you at night

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,760
so he took off his blindfold

35
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,040
and rushed to save you.

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,880
It's all because of you!

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,040
I'll never let you in.

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,320
What if he gets distracted again because of you?

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,080
Fei Yuan.

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,720
I will not let
him take any risks again!

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,760
Fei Yuan. Let her in.

42
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,440
It's my fault.

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,360
It's all right.

45
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,200
Here you are.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,680
Fei Yuan is childish.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,560
Don't blame him.

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,720
My eyes illness is not your fault.

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,200
My colleagues

50
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,480
found a booklet at
Qu Linjiang's house.

51
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,280
The last page has been torn.

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,959
You arranged it.

53
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,079
Right?

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
Why not?

55
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,400
Don't...

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,440
After saving me,

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
you did not receive treatment

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
and went to get rid of the evidence.

59
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Right?

60
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,720
You know it.

61
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,040
I can't repay you with anything

62
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
no matter how much you do for me.

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,880
I can't repay you

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
and I keep causing you troubles as well.

65
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
Little Su.

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,920
Don't feel guilty.

67
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,240
I did those willingly.

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
If I didn't save you,

69
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,520
I'm afraid

70
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,000
I would regret for my whole life.

71
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,560
I didn't think

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,040
it would end up like this too.

73
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,200
Little Su.

74
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,720
What's wrong?

75
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
At first,

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,760
I didn't care

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,320
when you treated me well.

78
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,160
After that, I didn't dare to care

79
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,480
when you kept saving me from dangers.

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
But now, because of me

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,200
I've decided.

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll take care of you

83
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
in this period when you can't see anything.

84
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,000
I will carry the burden with you

85
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,160
no matter what.

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,920
You mean

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
you won't take care of me anymore

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,400
after I recover?

89
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,840
I don't feel like

90
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:16,271
getting my eyes cured now.

91
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,000
I...

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
That's not what I mean.

93
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,760
Brother Pei, how are your eyes?

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
Brother Pei.

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,640
Do you think the imperial...

96
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
The physician is useless?

97
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,880
It's a stubborn disease.

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
It's never easy to cure.

99
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,200
I also didn't follow
the physician's instructions.

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,640
I can't blame anyone.

101
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Brother Pei.

102
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,640
How did you get this illness?

103
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,160
Hu Man Grass.

104
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,480
Hu Man Grass?

105
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,640
The thing that poisoned Magistrate Kong?

106
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,240
At the Battle of Honggu,

107
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,200
the enemies applied
Hu Man Grass's poison on the arrowhead.

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,200
My eyes got hurt at that time.

109
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,360
So...

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,160
Isn't it hard to recover from that?

111
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,160
There is no rush with my illness.

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,960
Rushuang.

113
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,200
Take a look at Little Su

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
and see if the drug has been cleared.

115
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,040
Sit down.

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,680
Ru...

117
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,520
It should be fine.

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,600
Don't overwork for the next few days.

119
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,160
Rushuang.

120
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,280
Brother Pei's illness is caused by poison.

121
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,560
You are a poison expert.

122
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
Do you have any ideas?

123
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
I don't need you to remind me of that.

124
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,080
I will try my best to treat Brother Pei's eyes.

125
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,920
I'm going to make medicine now.

126
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
Brother Pei.

127
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,920
There are many physicians at Feiyun Manor.

128
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,800
I don't believe

129
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,040
that none of them can treat you.

130
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,760
Wait for me. I'm going now.

131
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,320
Brother Su. I'm leaving.

132
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,200
Little Su.

133
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,800
Why don't you go back and take a rest?

134
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,960
I still want to...

135
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,640
How can you take care of me
if you don't take care of yourself?

136
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,600
Alright.

137
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,000
Young Master.

138
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,000
Young Master.

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,880
You really want
Detective Su to take care of you?

140
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,280
Can she take care of you well?

141
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,440
I have a more important mission for you.

142
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,680
What is it?

143
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
Hide the things

144
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
in my room.

145
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Don't let Little Su

146
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,560
find out about my identity.

147
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,280
Young Master.

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,680
Go.

149
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,804
(Recipe of Correct Diet)

150
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Rushuang.

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,160
Rushuang. Look.

152
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,280
I found this thousand-year-old ginseng.

153
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,520
What do you think?

154
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,800
Rushuang.

155
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,920
What's wrong with you today?

156
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm fine.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,680
You look unhappy.

158
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,240
How can you be fine?

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm really fine.

160
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,640
No.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
You feel like something wrong

162
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,800
in Brother Pei's room.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,720
Did someone bully you?

164
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,240
I've said I'm fine.

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,880
White fungus.

166
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,840
Brother Su, you're in the kitchen?

167
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,520
Are you cooking soup for Brother Pei?

168
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,120
Yes.

169
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
I have a thousand-year-old ginseng here.

170
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,600
It's very nutritious.

171
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,720
Cook it together.

172
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,040
Sure.

173
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,840
That's good.

174
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Put pig's liver into the pot.

175
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
Detective Su.

176
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,920
This is...

177
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,160
See.

178
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,824
This is Pig's Liver and White Fungus Soup.

179
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,440
It's good for the liver and eyes.

180
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,120
Wait!

181
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,800
You didn't remove the smell of pig liver,

182
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
nor soak the white fungus.

183
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,560
It's not written in the book. See?

184
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,400
Why did you use so big a wok to cook soup?

185
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,000
Put some water.

186
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,840
Put the white fungus in the pot together.

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,840
Cook them for 30 minutes.

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,280
What are you doing?

189
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,640
I'm kneading a dough to make snacks.

190
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,240
This is a batter.

191
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,640
It's not even a dough!

192
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,000
You two, stop now!

193
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,360
Fei Yuan.

194
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,360
Why is this soup so salty?

195
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,560
It smells strange too.

196
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,520
You cooked bad this time.

197
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,520
I didn't.

198
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,280
It's me.

199
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,760
Brother Xie gave me the ginseng.

200
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,760
I didn't think that...

201
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,880
Maybe my taste buds go wrong

202
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,080
due to the medication.

203
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,280
Let me taste it again.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
Don't drink it if it's bad.

205
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,640
Young Master, here is the soup I've made.

206
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,760
Try this...

207
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,880
Young Master.

208
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,320
Let me get you some water.

209
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,240
Pig's liver soup is good for my eyes.

210
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,000
Little Su is treating my illness well.

211
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
How can I say it's not nice?

212
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,960
How much sugar did you put?

213
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,160
It's too sweet.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,440
I'm sorry, Rushuang.

215
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,960
I heard that when girls eat sweet food,

216
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,040
they will feel happy

217
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,200
so I used more sugar.

218
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,040
Who says I am not happy?

219
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,440
It's so obvious.

220
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,920
You didn't smile for the whole day.

221
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,080
You didn't eat as well.

222
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,240
You didn't even use any strength

223
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,680
to make medicines.

224
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,600
I was just lied to by a good friend.

225
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,200
I feel like a fool.

226
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,920
Rushuang.

227
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,360
No matter who he is,

228
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
I will punish him

229
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,120
if he has any ill will towards you.

230
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,320
But if he means no harm,

231
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,600
the one who should feel unhappy

232
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,447
is him.

233
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,280
Why?

234
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,600
If a person is honest,

235
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
that means the person has no worries.

236
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,520
If this person

237
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
has to lie to their good friend,

238
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,920
it means that

239
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,400
he has a lot of worries.

240
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
He will be very unhappy.

241
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,640
Furthermore,

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,800
you are so nice,

243
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,480
Rushuang.

244
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,000
It feels terrible

245
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,800
to lie to you.

246
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,320
Rushuang.

247
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,120
Why are you crying?

248
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,920
Did I say something wrong?

249
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,040
I'll make you another one

250
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,200
if it tastes bad.

251
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,560
Rushuang, don't cry.

252
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,040
I'm fine.

253
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,640
You're really fine?

254
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,280
My issues cannot be compared to

255
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,040
Brother Pei's illness.

256
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,240
But I don't have any ideas up till now.

257
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,880
Hu Man Grass's poison can hardly be cured.

258
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,880
Brother Pei has also been
poisoned for so many years.

259
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,200
I don't know what I should do.

260
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,160
Rushuang.

261
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,360
You have to believe in yourself.

262
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
You can do it.

263
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,080
If you can't do it,

264
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
there is no one else who can

265
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,840
in this world.

266
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,840
You really think so?

267
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,160
Why do I feel so hot?

268
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,880
Fei Yuan.

269
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,960
Fei Yuan.

270
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,760
Young Master.

271
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,120
What do you want?

272
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,800
Prepare the bath for me.

273
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
I want to take a bath.

274
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,800
Yes.

275
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,120
Here. Young Master.

276
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,320
Let me bring you inside.

277
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,000
Slowly.

278
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,840
Don't make soup for me so late at night.

279
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,400
I haven't even digested the soup

280
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,960
made by Little Su in the day.

281
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,560
Come, take off my clothes for me.

282
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,680
Come on.

283
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,520
I...

284
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,640
Are you still feeling unhappy about Little Su

285
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
taking care of me?

286
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,960
You reek of oil from cooking.

287
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,160
You should take a bath

288
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,320
when I'm done.

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,960
I know.

290
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,000
You think that it's Little Su's fault

291
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,760
that my eyes got hurt.

292
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,440
But have you thought about it?

293
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,960
It's because I like her.

294
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,560
You will understand

295
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,000
when you grow up.

296
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,440
When you like someone,

297
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,760
you will risk everything

298
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,200
to protect her.

299
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,440
It's hard

300
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,240
for me
to finally find someone I like.

301
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,440
Don't scare her away.

302
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,640
Alright?

303
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,520
Young Master.

304
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,520
I brought the water.

305
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,840
Rushuang!

306
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,160
Rushuang!

307
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,600
What's wrong?

308
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,640
Rushuang, it's bad.

309
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,080
Young Master is bleeding. Go and have a look.

310
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,520
Young Master, it's fine.

311
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,720
It's stopped.

312
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,880
It's fine.

313
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:15,680
Brother Pei.

314
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,320
Let me check your pulse.

315
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,800
Alright.

316
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,080
It's just a nosebleed.

317
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,080
I'm fine.

318
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,640
Fei Yuan is just making a fuss.

319
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,120
Did you eat anything nutritious?

320
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,440
I'm afraid it's Brother Xie's ginseng.

321
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,840
Its effects were too strong.

322
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,280
How can Xie Beiming simply let you eat

323
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,840
anything nutritious?

324
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,920
You can't blame Brother Xie for this.

325
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
The soup is made by Detective Su.

326
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,560
It's her again?

327
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,680
Right?

328
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,440
She even...

329
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,160
Fei Yuan.

330
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,280
Make some desserts for cooling.

331
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,360
Brother Pei.

332
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
I'll go back to make medicines

333
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,320
since you are fine.

334
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,640
Wait.

335
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,960
I want to talk to you about Little Su.

336
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,160
If you're trying to
say something nice about her,

337
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,080
you can just forget about it.

338
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,800
I'm not trying to do that.

339
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
I wouldn't forgive her

340
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,760
if I were you.

341
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,120
You treated her sincerely

342
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
but she kept lying to you.

343
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,760
That's bad.

344
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,000
She had so many chances to tell you the truth

345
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,280
but she ignored them.

346
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,680
You should hate her for that.

347
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,560
She hid her identity with ulterior motives.

348
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,280
She's really hateful.

349
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,280
You don't...

350
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,400
That's too much.

351
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,840
See?

352
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,520
You do understand

353
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,360
that she isn't someone like that.

354
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,240
She is just the same as you.

355
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,600
Stubborn

356
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,280
and not tactful.

357
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,360
If she had a choice,

358
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,040
why would she take the risk of getting exposed

359
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,640
and hang with men?

360
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,960
You saw that she lied to you,

361
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,880
but you never thought that

362
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,400
she had already forgotten her identity.

363
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,200
Although her identity is fake,

364
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,120
her care and her love for you is real.

365
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,840
Isn't it?

366
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,680
I learned some basics of poison

367
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,000
and dared to say I'm an expert.

368
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,120
Great.

369
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,840
I can't treat Brother Pei's eyes

370
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,720
nor can I understand these poisons.

371
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,080
How can I show my face in the future?

372
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,520
I might as well be an acrobat on the streets

373
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,800
and not embarrass myself here.

374
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,760
Rushuang.

375
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,400
Don't give up.

376
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,200
If you're going to be an acrobat,

377
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,560
bring me as well.

378
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm good at that.

379
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,720
Xie Beiming.

380
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,680
Now is not the time

381
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
to be joking with me.

382
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,560
Rushuang.

383
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,480
I'm not joking.

384
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm serious.

385
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,440
I also believe that

386
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
you can make the antidote.

387
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,760
Take it away!

388
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,840
It's not this.

389
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,880
Take it away! Rabbits won't do.

390
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,520
That's it.

391
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,120
Rushuang.

392
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,320
Can I take a nap?

393
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,880
Yes.

394
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,400
Wake up.

395
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
Wake up.

396
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,400
Look.

397
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
What is this?

398
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,800
I made the medicine to treat Brother Pei's eyes.

399
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,240
Rushuang, really?

400
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,320
Yes.

401
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,680
Rushuang, you're so great!

402
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
Rushuang, you're awesome!

403
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,440
Rushuang.

404
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,440
Can you really treat Young Master?

405
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
If I use the right dosage,

406
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,120
it's possible.

407
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,320
That's great!

408
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Mr. Zhang!

409
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,960
Mr. Zhang!

410
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,680
Young Master's eyes can be treated!

411
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
Who told you that?

412
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,520
Last time,

413
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,960
the poison has already spread.
It's impossible to cure it.

414
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,720
Don't believe in any cure

415
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,200
and get scammed by the scammers.

416
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,920
It's fine if you couldn't treat it

417
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
but people who can treat it are scammers?

418
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,480
I didn't think that
the imperial physician would be so petty.

419
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,160
You...

420
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,080
Rushuang!

421
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,480
I found the medicine

422
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,640
you were looking for.

423
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,720
You are so capable.

424
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,840
That's great.

425
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,680
This...

426
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,960
Isn't this bufotoxin?

427
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,120
What are you trying to do?

428
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,360
Make an antidote of course.

429
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,320
Nonsense!

430
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,480
You're not following the medical theory

431
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,360
fighting poison

432
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,360
with poison.

433
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
Have you thought about

434
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,560
the consequences if you failed?

435
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,240
Hu Man Grass is a strong poison.

436
00:24:22,568 --> 00:24:24,048
You couldn't get rid of the poison

437
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,120
with conservative treatment for so many years.

438
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,560
If you have no other way,

439
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,200
you might as well let us take the risk.

440
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,840
Exactly.

441
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,520
Ignorance!

442
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,720
Old man.

443
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,200
Can't you speak nicely?

444
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,760
It's all for the sake of Brother Pei.

445
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,560
Rushuang didn't sleep for nights

446
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,920
to think of this cure.

447
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,120
It's fine.

448
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,360
Stubborn old man.

449
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,320
I'm stubborn?

450
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,480
What a joke.

451
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Do you think Prince Qi

452
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,887
can be treated by some ignorant girl

453
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,480
like you?

454
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,200
What

455
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,760
are you talking about?

456
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,440
Prince Qi was poisoned for more than 4 years.

457
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,040
Empress Dowager looked
for the cure all over the world

458
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,280
but it only managed

459
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,720
to suppress the illness.

460
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,640
A girl like you

461
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,640
is spouting nonsense here.

462
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,040
It's fine if you insult me.

463
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,400
But, if Prince Qi's eyes
can no longer be treated,

464
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,200
His Majesty will slaughter
your whole families as punishment.

465
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,400
You like Prince Qi?

466
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,360
Why do you like Prince Qi so much?

467
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,920
Because I think

468
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,200
he's a pure person.

469
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,560
I've been at Mansion of Prince Qi all day long.

470
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
I'm indeed exhausted.

471
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,080
I told him that

472
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:05,351
I had a girl whom I liked very much.

473
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,080
Who is it?

474
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
It's me.

475
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,320
Rushuang?

476
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,880
Now you know
how the feeling is to be lied to, right?

477
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,040
Although you lied to me,

478
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,640
you've got entangled with a woman for so long.

479
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,240
Compared to me,

480
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,120
you should be the one who suffered more.

481
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,720
No.

482
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,160
This is my fault.

483
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,760
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,840
Although Brother Pei lied to you,

485
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,880
he was almost blind because of you.

486
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,400
Compared to you,

487
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,240
he should be the one who suffered more.

488
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,400
His identity is fake

489
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,400
but the things he did for you

490
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,360
were all real.

491
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,240
It's like your identity is fake

492
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
but your care and help to me are real.

493
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,840
You are even better than me.

494
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Why?

495
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,600
The one I like became a woman

496
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,640
but the one you like became your idol.

497
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,640
Aren't you satisfied?

498
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,640
Young Master!

499
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,280
You need to control your emotions.

500
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,320
Don't go.

501
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,320
Brother Pei!

502
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,760
Wait here.

503
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,640
It's crucial

504
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,720
to treat your eyes now.

505
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,720
Let me get them.

506
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Yes.

507
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now is not the time

508
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,160
to throw a tantrum.

509
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,080
When did Brother Xie

510
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,200
become so dependable?

511
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,080
Young Master, let's take a rest.

512
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,720
Both of you are...

513
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,840
Brother Pei.

514
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,040
They are here.

515
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,040
Brother Pei.

516
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,440
We have to talk about

517
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,120
your eyes' treatment.

518
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,680
What? There's a risk to his life?

519
00:28:21,148 --> 00:28:23,360
It's dangerous to fight poison with poison.

520
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,240
The dosage must be accurate.

521
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,440
Any miscalculations

522
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,440
where one of the poison exceeds the other,

523
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,680
the consequences will be disastrous.

524
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,080
No way.

525
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,000
Young Master.

526
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,760
Let's not treat it, alright?

527
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Young Master.

528
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,040
Say something.

529
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,760
I think it's worth a shot.

530
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,920
Rushuang studied poison since she was young.

531
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,360
She will be fine.

532
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,520
What if it fails?

533
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,720
It's impossible.

534
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,400
Brother Pei is blessed with luck.

535
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,160
He's got over so many difficulties.

536
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,920
It will be fine as well this time.

537
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,920
Fei Yuan.

538
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,880
Do you want your young master

539
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,160
to be blind for life?

540
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,280
No.

541
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,640
But...

542
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,360
It's better to be blind than death.

543
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,280
You...

544
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,200
Brother Su.

545
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,440
Say something.

546
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
No one can decide for Brother Pei.

547
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,560
He will be the one

548
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,880
to bear the consequences

549
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,760
after all.

550
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,880
No matter what choice you make,

551
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,400
I...

552
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,240
We will be with you.

553
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,320
Rushuang.

554
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,680
Let's begin.

555
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,040
I've channelled all the poison in his body

556
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
to his eyes.

557
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,120
It takes 4 hours

558
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,160
for the poison to react with each other.

559
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,240
Rushuang.

560
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,720
Thank you.

561
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,840
You've tried your best

562
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
no matter what the result is.

563
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,680
Rushuang.

564
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,880
It's working.

565
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,800
Let's go.

566
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,160
Fei Yuan.

567
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,400
No.

568
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,840
Let's go.

569
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
-Come.
-This...

570
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,880
I'm here.

571
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Brother Xie.

572
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,920
Do you think I will succeed?

573
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,040
Is it too risky?

574
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:25,392
I'm just an

575
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,240
amateur poison user.

576
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,600
It's something that cannot be done
even by the imperial physician.

577
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,200
Do you think I can make it?

578
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,320
Rushuang.

579
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,320
Don't worry.

580
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,000
It will be fine.

581
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,320
You've applied the medicine.

582
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,120
Isn't it too late to worry about it now?

583
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,960
Young Master is blessed.

584
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,320
The army of Fan Yan Na
couldn't even defeat him.

585
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,880
This mere poison

586
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
is nothing.

587
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,160
Don't try to endure it.

588
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,120
Are you thinking that

589
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,120
Prince Qi is not so great as you imagine?

590
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,720
He is still the hero in my heart.

591
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,400
All these years,

592
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,560
he is like a flash of light

593
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,640
that lights up my heart.

594
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,160
He has always been my support

595
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,360
to go on.

596
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,560
Little Su.

597
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,080
I planned...

598
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,120
I planned...

599
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,160
to tell you

600
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,000
when you can face everyone

601
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,280
with your real identity.

602
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,520
Don't be angry with me.

603
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,640
I'm not angry.

604
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm just...

605
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,040
What?

606
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,840
Just...

607
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,639
Prince Qi.

608
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,120
He was too far from me.

609
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
He was so far

610
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,120
that I thought

611
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,320
I would never meet him in my life.

612
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,719
But Brother Pei, you are so close to me.

613
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,800
I...

614
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,920
don't know

615
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,400
how to face you right now.

616
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,320
Please

617
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,920
get to know Prince Qi

618
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,840
from now on.

619
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,400
I've heard he is easy to get along with.

620
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,080
Didn't you read his folklores?

621
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,000
You should understand him more than I.

622
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,040
Prince Qi

623
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,480
or Pei Zhao

624
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,160
are just names.

625
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
I am myself.

626
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,000
We overcame life and death

627
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,440
and shared our troubles.

628
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,040
It will be the same in the future.

629
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,400
There won't be any difference.

630
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,120
In the future...

631
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,480
It's a pleasure to meet you.

632
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,600
Hero.

633
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,700
You two.

634
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,540
Get me all the physicians

635
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,500
from the manor.

636
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,540
Yes.

637
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,300
You two.

638
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,780
Search for all the doctors

639
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,660
who are hiding in the mountains.

640
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,300
Yes.

641
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,820
Both of you, go back to the manor

642
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,820
and bring me all the medicines stored there.

643
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,780
Yes.

644
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,580
Young Master.

645
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,300
This is a ginseng
that I've been keeping for many years.

646
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,220
Do you think it will be of help?
