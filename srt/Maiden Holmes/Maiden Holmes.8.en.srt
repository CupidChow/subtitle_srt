(Episode 8)

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,480
What is this black stain on the cloth?

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,480
Look.

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479
It is coal.

18
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
Coal?

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,200
It is impossible to have it
in the middle of nowhere.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,040
Perhaps

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,000
it got stained when we were in town.

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,600
You.

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,720
I like you better

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,560
when you are free from disturbance.

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,320
Stop it.

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,040
One tael of silver.

27
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,360
I'll pay you ten.

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
Take your time to count. How do you think?

29
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,840
What happened to your hand?

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,200
Nothing.

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,160
Maybe it got injured
when I was looking for the wine jar.

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,080
Stop scratching.

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,960
You're going to make it worse.

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,680
Feeling better now?

35
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,560
I said I was fine.

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,680
Just a little bit itchy.

37
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,240
What if

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,200
I teach you how to navigate by the stars

39
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,520
to divert your attention?

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,480
Then you won't think about
your itchy hand anymore.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,640
Sounds great.

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,720
Teach me.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,400
There are seven stars at the eastern sky

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,280
that forms the shape of a dipper.

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,640
Can you see it?

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,760
Three.

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,080
Four.

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,440
Five.

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Six.

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,800
Seven.

51
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,000
It really looks like a dipper.

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,840
That is the Big Dipper.

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,280
Can you spot the position of the handle?

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,120
Yes. I saw it.

55
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,600
Now it is autumn.

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,720
The handle of dipper is pointing to the West.

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,400
It is what's stated in the ancient books that

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,240
"When the handle pointed to the west,
autumn begins."

59
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,600
How about summer?

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,160
You just need to remember all the directions

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,280
and the seasons.

62
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,080
So

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,320
the handle will point
to the south during summer?

64
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,720
Smart girl.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,560
I'm impressed.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,120
I can't believe you can identify directions
by constellation.

67
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,600
I learned it during my time in the war.

68
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,680
At that time, we had to ambush enemies at night.

69
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,040
So we can only rely on it
to find the directions.

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
But now

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
I can no longer see them.

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,360
Look.

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,120
There are two brightest stars in the galaxy.

74
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you know what they are called?

75
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,880
Where is their exact position?

76
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,320
Reach out your hand. I'll draw for you.

77
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,320
This is the galaxy.

78
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,920
One of them is here.

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
One is here

80
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,480
and the other one is here.

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,760
Do you know

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,080
they are Altair and Vega?

83
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,880
They are placed on opposite sides of the galaxy.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
They love each other

85
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,840
but not able to live together.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,920
I see.

87
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
How much longer do we have to wait?

88
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,840
Once we are in town

89
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,320
let's go to the most famous tailor shop

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,200
to get you a new dress, okay?

91
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,200
Sure.

92
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
Excuse me, pal.

93
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,080
When will the gate open?

94
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,160
It should be open soon.
Let's just wait for a while.

95
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,360
Alright.

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,520
Brother Pei, look.

97
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,960
Uncle Li.

98
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
You are so early everyday.

99
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
Finishing work early makes me feel relaxed.

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,640
I'll leave you to it.

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,920
Excuse me.

102
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,400
Yesterday,
when you were sending coal to the town,

103
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,560
have you seen

104
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,440
a young man right here?

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,640
He was plastered.

106
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,120
Waiting here to get into the town.

107
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,520
I did.

108
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,800
You may go in.

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,840
Sir.

110
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,520
Please have a look.

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,440
Is he the one who hit your cart?

112
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
That's him.

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,160
I felt like I was hit
by something outside the town.

114
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,400
I'm still experiencing pain in my waist now.

115
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,280
Guard.

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,040
Yes.

117
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,440
Check his body.

118
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,800
Detective Su.

119
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,120
He indeed has a bruise on his waist.

120
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,480
It looks like

121
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,840
after the town gate was closed,

122
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,720
he was outside the town for the whole night.

123
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,120
It's impossible for him to get in.

124
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,360
And this proved that

125
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
he was away at the time of the crime.

126
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,520
Sir,

127
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,640
come in please.

128
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,320
Are you finished eating?

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
Rushuang, don't be sad.

130
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
Have some osmanthus cake.

131
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
It tastes so sweet.

132
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,320
How can I get to investigate the crime

133
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,680
with Brother Su?

134
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,680
Why do you have to be with Brother Su?

135
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,720
Because it makes me feel happy.

136
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
What makes you happy?

137
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,720
It is hard for me to explain.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
Anyway.

139
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm happy as long as I'm with Brother Su.

140
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
Investigate crime makes me happy too.

141
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,080
I will get double happiness

142
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,000
if I'm able to investigate the crime
with Brother Su.

143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,159
You're not happy

144
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,440
hanging out with me?

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,400
Of course I'm happy.

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
But the feelings are different.

147
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,080
What makes them different?

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
I feel relaxed

149
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,960
when I'm hanging out with you.

150
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,240
But as time goes by, I feel a little bit empty.

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,920
But the feeling changes
when I'm with Brother Su.

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,080
Whenever there is new progress in crime cases,

153
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,440
I will gain a sense of accomplishment.

154
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,720
Maybe because you have your own target.

155
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,800
The reason I likes to travel around

156
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,160
and bring justice to people

157
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,240
is that I don't want to sit idle.

158
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,080
I hope I can be the one who is needed.

159
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,720
Yes, that's the feeling!

160
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,120
Rushuang.

161
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,680
If investigating crime with Brother Su
is what you wish,

162
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,880
then just go ahead.

163
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,720
I will fully support you.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,040
Come, have some osmanthus cake.

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,040
The bigger one is for you.

166
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,088
The most beautiful moment,

167
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,360
cherish it.

168
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,800
The most beautiful moment,

169
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,320
cherish it.

170
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,240
Young master.

171
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,760
Young master.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,600
Young master.

173
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,400
Here are new portraits of concubine candidates.

174
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,160
Quick, have a look.

175
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,960
Fei Yuan.

176
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,360
What are you doing?

177
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,280
I have scrutinized these portraits.

178
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,360
Look at this.

179
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,480
She is Miss Yang.

180
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,360
She wrote all these poems on her own.

181
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,280
Take away. I don't want to see it.

182
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,200
I'll get you another one then.

183
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,640
How about...

184
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,720
Look at this.

185
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,240
How about this?

186
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,920
Look.

187
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,360
She drew it herself.

188
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,840
Isn't she talented?

189
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,720
I understand.

190
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,280
I will take them away.

191
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,040
Boss.

192
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,360
Has my order arrived?

193
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

194
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,960
Brother Su.

195
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,840
Rushuang?

196
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,320
What are you doing here?

197
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,320
I want to investigate the crime with you.

198
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
Rushuang, actually I...

199
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,120
Quick, take a look.

200
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,440
It's so unpeaceful.

201
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,760
Brother Su.

202
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
It looks like something is happening there.

203
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,120
May I know which officer
you are from Mingjing Office?

204
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,520
Su Ci.

205
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,880
My Lord.

206
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,920
This lady has just been salvaged from the river.

207
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,960
Why

208
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,040
did she kill herself suddenly?

209
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,720
And she is wearing the wedding dress.

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,880
I heard that few days ago

211
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,160
there was also a lady in wedding dress

212
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,760
jumped off the gate tower.

213
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,720
Such a coincidence!

214
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,040
Exactly.

215
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
How could this happened.

216
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,840
No signs of being poisoned.

217
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,320
Her lips turned green and purple.

218
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,360
There are round spots in her eyelid
as a result of bleeding,

219
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,640
and pale red foams in her mouth and nose too.

220
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
She should be died from drowning.

221
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,400
Poor thing.

222
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,480
Couldn't agree more.

223
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,120
Her nails are

224
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,000
clean and white.

225
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,680
This implies no signs of struggle.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,720
Her clothes were soaked

227
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,160
but tidy

228
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
and clean.

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
No signs of struggle too.

230
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
My Lord, did you find anything else?

231
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,160
It seems that

232
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,960
it is indeed a suicide case.

233
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,040
If so, we could end the investigation.

234
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,880
Rushuang.

235
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,640
Brother Su.

236
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,080
There is one thing I need to clarify with you.

237
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,400
The reason
I want to investigate the crime with you

238
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,240
is not because I like to stick around with you.

239
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm not...

240
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,200
I started to study about poisons
since I was a kid.

241
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,160
I'm not good at other stuff.

242
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,400
But other than poisoning people,

243
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,760
I really don't know what else I can do

244
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,520
by studying this.

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,040
Since I investigated crimes with you,

246
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I found that

247
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,040
I could be the key to solve mysteries too.

248
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
It made me feel happy

249
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,120
and that I was a worthy person.

250
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,880
Brother Su.

251
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,280
If you don't like

252
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,480
what I'm doing right now,

253
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,640
it's fine.

254
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,360
I will figure out another way.

255
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,400
Because it's what I really want to do.

256
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
Follow me.

257
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,360
There are many cases in Mingjing Office.

258
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,520
Usually we will hire some incredible people

259
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,920
from outside to help us.

260
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,960
We will record their information in a book

261
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,360
for later use.

262
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
So...

263
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,080
So.

264
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,280
Follow me to register at the Mingjing Office.

265
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,880
Your Highness.

266
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,760
Marquis Zhengyuan comes to visit.

267
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,640
Your Highness.

268
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,360
Marquis.

269
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,280
Why are you here?

270
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
I just reported military information
to Your Majesty

271
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,120
and dropped by to visit you.

272
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,120
Marquis. Please have a seat.

273
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,960
Your Highness has been so concerned
with the borders,

274
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,240
I really

275
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,360
feel relieved.

276
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,640
Since Marquis led soldiers
to safeguard the borders,

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
it's been a while since we last met.

278
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,120
Every time I'm simulating military strategies,

279
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,120
it reminds me of the lessons taught by Marquis.

280
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,400
Your Highness has flattered me.

281
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,680
I really feel abashed.

282
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,000
The reason why Marquis
come to the capital this time

283
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,200
is the war in Beirong, right?

284
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,840
And also your personal matter.

285
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,600
Any further news on that?

286
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Please.

287
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,800
I had ordered someone to check it.

288
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,440
The arrow you sent to me

289
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,320
was indeed made in Beirong.

290
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,520
As I expected.

291
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,520
And...

292
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,640
Recently,

293
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,480
in several massive deals in Beirong,

294
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
we have found something as mentioned
by Your Highness.

295
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,120
Pieces of silver.

296
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,240
How can the disaster relief fund
flow into Beirong?

297
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,720
Someone used the money for personal gain,

298
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,800
selling arms in secret,

299
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,720
even found hand in glove with the enemy

300
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,040
to train their troops.

301
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,120
Their motives

302
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,640
are obvious.

303
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Your Highness.

304
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,720
You must be careful.

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,040
Yes, I will.

306
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Your Highness could forgive the past offences.

307
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,400
It's certainly not easy.

308
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,840
And you still care for the country.

309
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,280
That is really impressive.

310
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,960
You overpraise me.

311
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
Oh, yes.

312
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,320
I heard that Your Highness
is getting married soon.

313
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,240
I was wondering
whether I'm able to attend your wedding?

314
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
It is up to the Empress Dowager

315
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,000
to decide.

316
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,520
If I'm really getting married,

317
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,640
I will surely visit you personally

318
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,920
to give you my wedding invitation card.

319
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,520
Zhi

320
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,800
must be very happy then.

321
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,240
Xu Zhi also comes along with you?

322
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes.

323
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,440
It is hard for me to come back here.

324
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,080
So I bring her together.

325
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,960
I still remember I met her

326
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,520
when I was a kid.

327
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,800
She was a pure person

328
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,320
and straightforward like a man.

329
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,000
The border is wide and broad.

330
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,800
I want to let her grow up
without any constraints.

331
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,520
I can see that Marquis loves Xu Zhi very much.

332
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,920
Of course.

333
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,960
I'm blessed only with one precious daughter.

334
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,440
Detective Su.

335
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,920
She is Miss Lin's mother.

336
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,280
She insists to meet you.

337
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,560
My Lord!

338
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,880
My daughter wouldn't have killed herself!

339
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,600
There is no reason for her to commit suicide!

340
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
My Lord, please help us to investigate it! Lady.

341
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,400
Please calm down.

342
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,240
Don't worry, Detective Su will help you.

343
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,800
She is the only child in our family.

344
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,680
She has never been hurt since she was born.

345
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,480
Even her future husband
were carefully selected by us.

346
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,560
If she was not willing,

347
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,520
we wouldn't force her to do so.

348
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,760
She asked her dad

349
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,560
to find the most famous painter in town to draw.

350
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,440
She said that she wanted us
to keep it before marriage.

351
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,600
So that we could miss her.

352
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,000
Your daughter had a beautiful face.

353
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,240
Were there any guies
trying to approach her before?

354
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,320
We rarely let her go out since she was a kid.

355
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
If we did,

356
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,240
we would cover her face with a long veil.

357
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,200
She was quite obedient.

358
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,320
She never approached
any unruly vagabonds outside.

359
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Did you notice something unusual
before she died?

360
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,360
When she got engaged,

361
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,760
the whole family was so happy.

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,240
We still went to Puhua Temple
to make wishes together.

363
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,200
I remembered now.

364
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,440
Sometimes she looked stunned.

365
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,760
One time

366
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
she stared at the windows
and said it was raining outside.

367
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,400
But that day was a bright sunny day.

368
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,520
My daughter tried to fool us sometimes.

369
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,920
So I thought she was just kidding me.

370
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,520
Heard the rain in a sunny day.

371
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,920
I can't believe it was made in Beirong.

372
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,200
The disaster relief fund we had plotted

373
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,600
flowed into Beirong.

374
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,680
What?

375
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,760
Beirong has always been famous
for casting weapons.

376
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,760
You mean...

377
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
Your Majesty, do you still remember

378
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,920
Shadu who was killed in Worry-free Bar?

379
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,440
That guy was a notorious arm dealer.

380
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,560
There are people
who used the disaster relief fund

381
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,680
to buy piles of weapons from him.

382
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,280
He was killed

383
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,560
due to the arms sale.

384
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,320
That guy had created cases
of disappearance of funds

385
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,200
in many places.

386
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,640
He had gained a lot of money from that

387
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,560
and buying piles of weapons from Beirong.

388
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,080
Those people who besieged me in Qingshui County

389
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,040
had these weapons in their hand.

390
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,720
They were well-trained.

391
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,120
Their moves were structured.

392
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,280
I guess they were the private army
trained by those behind.

393
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Training soldiers secretly.

394
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,040
Trying to evoke commotion.

395
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,120
I'm afraid that it is linked to

396
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,040
what happened seven years ago.

397
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,920
Although they had planned for a long time

398
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,400
because of some flaws,

399
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,480
their plan was exposed after all.

400
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,920
Finally I'm able
to investigate crimes legitimately!

401
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,280
Congratulations Rushuang!

402
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,720
But you might be very busy after this.

403
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,160
There are still a lot of places
I haven't show you around.

404
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,480
I have moved here.

405
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,320
We still have plenty of chances ahead.

406
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,280
You are right.

407
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,680
Don't forget to bring me along.

408
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,600
No problem.

409
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,320
Little Su.

410
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,400
Brother Pei.

411
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,120
You look distracted.

412
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,160
There are many problems recently.

413
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,720
The death of Miss Du

414
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,440
is not an isolated case.

415
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,560
This is so good.

416
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
When will you make it again?

417
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,760
It tastes good, right?

418
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,440
I will make it for you again next time.

419
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,600
You can never keep your mouth shut.

420
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,400
I'm sorry

421
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,000
for the interruption.

422
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,120
There was another suicide case

423
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,680
happened this morning.

424
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,040
The victim was Miss Lin.

425
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
A young and beautiful lady in a wedding dress.

426
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,280
No motive of suicide.

427
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,040
Such a coincidence.

428
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,720
In wedding dress again?

429
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,200
Let's leave other questions aside.

430
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,480
Miss Lin

431
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,320
had also heard the rain in a sunny day.

432
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,920
So did Miss Du?

433
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
All these details are the same.

434
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,000
It is definitely not a coincidence.

435
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,160
Before Miss Du killed herself,

436
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,240
someone said that ghost bride
came back to kill again.

437
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,520
Again?

438
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,360
It means that the same things happened before?

439
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,360
Yes.

440
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,320
So I planned to go there

441
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,040
to investigate the similar cases

442
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,480
in recent years after lunch.

443
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Let's eat.

444
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,240
Rushuang, try this.

445
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,600
Something just crossed my mind.

446
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,760
If all of them are suicide case,

447
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,280
some families

448
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,920
might not want to report it to the government.

449
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,240
You mean

450
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,440
the record of these cases are incomplete?

451
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
That is just a piece of cake.

452
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,360
Just leave it to me.

453
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,680
Oh, yeah!

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,680
Brother Xie is an expert in

455
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,960
finding people and asking stuff.

456
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,160
Rushuang.

457
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,000
You should call me Warrior Xie now.

458
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,560
Alright.

459
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,000
Thanks in advance.

460
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,760
Don't mention it.

461
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,040
Warrior Xie.

462
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
Can you do me another favour?

463
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,400
Nobody here are able to do it.

464
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,720
After thinking twice,
I feel that only you can help me.

465
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,680
Rushuang.

466
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,080
As long as it is related to you,

467
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,760
I will definitely do it.

468
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,200
Sister Rushuang,

469
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,560
what is the matter
that needs Brother Xie to go alone?

470
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,720
How do you feel?

471
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,640
Sweet.

472
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,880
How come?

473
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,880
How about now?

474
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
It's getting sweeter.

475
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,720
That's not possible.

476
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,240
Could it be I got the formula wrong?

477
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,760
Rushuang.

478
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,640
Did you just

479
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,440
apply poison on me.

480
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,680
Yes.

481
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,960
I'm using your hand to test for poison.

482
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,280
Did you add itching powder

483
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,120
inside there?

484
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,320
Why do I feel itching

485
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,280
in my heart?

486
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,880
Can you be more serious?

487
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,720
If you keep acting in this way,

488
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,640
I won't bother you anymore.

489
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,320
No, Rushuang.

490
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,440
Please don't do that.

491
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm joking with you just now.

492
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,760
Please don't be angry. I...

493
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,200
What's wrong with you?

494
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,320
I felt like burning.

495
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,040
Yes. It should be felt like this.

496
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,920
Let me see.

497
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,120
It seems like

498
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,000
I have to figured out a perfect way

499
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,600
to leave the selection of concubine unsettled.

500
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,760
Why is it still burning

501
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,720
after so long?

502
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,400
Brother Pei.

503
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
Why are you drinking here alone?

504
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,520
This wine

505
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,120
should be drunk in this way.

506
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,200
Nice.

507
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,560
Come.

508
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
Here's a toast to you.

509
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,000
Nice wine.

510
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,920
Brother Pei.

511
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,680
Tell me honestly.

512
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,400
You don't want to choose a concubine, right?

513
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,240
Are you falling in love with someone?

514
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,000
Fine.

515
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,520
I won't force you if you don't want to tell.

516
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,640
We are true men.

517
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
There is nothing to hide.

518
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,520
Come.

519
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,360
I know you do.

520
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,880
Tell me, who is she?

521
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,440
Sometimes

522
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,920
I'm quite jealous of you.

523
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,440
Free from rules and constraints.

524
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,080
Able to do whatever you like.

525
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,160
So

526
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,520
you don't want to let others know that

527
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,080
you are Prince Qi?

528
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Actually...

529
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,560
when I become Pei Zhao,

530
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,320
I feel more like myself.

531
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,720
Come. Let's drink.

532
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,920
But

533
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,480
with your ability,

534
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,360
why don't you just suggest

535
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,600
the one you love?

536
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,960
Her current identity is not qualified.

537
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,080
Not qualified?

538
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,000
Then just make it qualify.

539
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,080
That's all.

540
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,080
Easy said than done.

541
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,000
Why is it so difficult to get a wife?

542
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,760
Drink some water.

543
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,360
Brother Pei.

544
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,640
I know it now.

545
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,880
I understand now!

546
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,320
It must be like this!

547
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,640
Brother Pei.

548
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,600
Brother Su.

549
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,920
Both of you...

550
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,440
Brother Pei.

551
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,560
Are you in a relationship with Brother Su?

552
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,720
I knew it! I...

553
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,080
Why didn't I think about it before?

554
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,480
If it is true...

555
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,880
Brother Pei,

556
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,080
it must have been so hard for you.

557
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,680
But don't worry.

558
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
I'm an open-minded person.

559
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,960
No matter what is your choice,

560
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,360
I will support you.

561
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,480
Good.

562
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,760
Come.

563
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,080
Thanks brother.

564
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,320
Brother?

565
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,640
Being able to become the brother of Prince Qi

566
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,720
who is respected by the people.

567
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,280
That feeling is really good.

568
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,480
But

569
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,360
you're not bad too

570
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,000
for having a heroic brother like me.

571
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,520
This is your fortune.

572
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,880
Come, let's have one more drink.

573
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,840
Alright.

574
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,400
Come.

575
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,400
Come.

576
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,440
Brother Pei

577
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
I can't drink with you anymore.

578
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,920
I still have to do my work.

579
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,040
Otherwise, Rushuang

580
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
will give me a hard time.

581
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
Take your time to enjoy the wine.

582
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,320
No. Don't drink too much. I've got to leave now.

583
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,080
What a heartless fellow.

584
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,400
Your Highness.

585
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,840
I have asked the Imperial Astronomer
to calculate

586
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,120
the birth date and Ba Zi of

587
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,800
the candidates of Princess Consort Qi

588
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,760
How's it now?

589
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,200
Your Highness.

590
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,040
The imperial Astronomer
has tried hard to calculate it.

591
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,120
But there are too many of them.

592
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,920
It is not yet completed.

593
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,360
The reason I look for you

594
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,280
is because I would like you

595
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,640
to do me a favour.

596
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,920
Your Highness is too kind.

597
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,280
Just tell me if you need anything else.

598
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,880
This...

599
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,440
All the names of ladies

600
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,600
on this name-list...

601
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,520
Your Highness doesn't want to see again

602
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,960
during the second round selection.

603
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,960
I...

604
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,120
Junior Mentor, you don't understand?

605
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,280
Junior Mentor.

606
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,320
The Ba Zi of these ladies

607
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,880
are not compatible with Prince Qi.

608
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,000
Alright.

609
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,520
I understand.

610
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,280
Please.

611
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,680
Alright.

612
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,480
Let's go to the data room.

613
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,440
Okay.

614
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,160
Brother Su.

615
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,360
There is a case

616
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,360
matches the conditions you said.

617
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,200
Really?

618
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,560
Let's go and check it out.

619
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,320
Let's go.

620
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,600
Rushuang.

621
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,280
You better not follow us.

622
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,200
Why?

623
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,200
I...

624
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:30,880
I got to go now.

625
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
Alright.

626
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,840
Please visit again.

627
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,400
You have come.

628
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,120
Go back in.

629
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,120
Sir, please come in.

630
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,280
You look so beautiful today.

631
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,760
Stop teasing me.

632
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,640
Drink again.

633
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,400
One more.

634
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,800
It turns out to be like this
in Lixiang Restaurant.

635
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,360
How do you find it this time?

636
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,240
Childe Wang, are you satisfied?

637
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,760
Rushuang, I came here for serious business.

638
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,400
Sure. Sure.

639
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,160
Listen to me.

640
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,080
You'd better not visit too frequently

641
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,320
to this place.

642
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,320
This place is not suitable for ladies.

643
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,600
The main reason I came here

644
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,680
is because of this case.

645
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,560
It must be done right here.

646
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,320
You annoying fella.

647
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,720
Why are you coming again?

648
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,440
Again?

649
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,800
How many times you have visited here?

650
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,360
Explain it properly.

651
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,720
What do you mean by again?

652
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,360
Did I come here to listen to music?

653
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
You came here every time to ask me questions.

654
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,200
Never listen to music.

655
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,440
I never request a song.

656
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,280
Tell me.

657
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,640
Are you the spy

658
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,720
from Chulan Restaurant?

659
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,560
I...

660
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,480
Detective Su.

661
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,000
You come to arrest people again?

662
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,840
I recognized all the faces here.

663
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,920
There is no miscreant for you to arrest.

664
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,000
I came here today

665
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,760
to investigate a case
that happened few years ago.

666
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,840
You want to ask about

667
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,440
the case of Jing Niang right?

668
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,720
Yes.

669
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,640
I have explained everything I know to him.

670
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,880
I don't know anything other than that.

671
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,040
You also believed that Jing Niang

672
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,560
had become a ghost

673
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,640
to kill these brides?

674
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,960
I really don't know about it.

675
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,120
I just know that

676
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,800
the bridegroom Wang who wished to married her

677
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,440
had been falsely accused.

678
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,960
He had prepared the ransom money

679
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
to marry her.

680
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,000
But she killed herself suddenly.

681
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,680
It meant that the rumours were untrue.

682
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,440
Of course.

683
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,760
Before Jing Niang hanged herself,

684
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,600
did you notice any of her unusual act?

685
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,920
I really don't know about that.

686
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,400
You can ask We Wen about it.

687
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,720
Jing Niang was closest to her
when she's still alive.

688
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,760
Rushuang.

689
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,560
I knew it from...

690
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,960
Sister Jing was a cheerful person.

691
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,080
But a few days before she died

692
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,840
she kept staring into space

693
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,480
and rarely talked.

694
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,200
When I talked to her,

695
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,200
she acted as if I didn't even exist.

696
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,200
Logically,

697
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
that should be the happiest moment in her life.

698
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,840
Because she was going to leave here
and getting married soon.

699
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,040
That's true.

700
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,360
Jing Niang was the

701
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,760
most popular lady in Lixiang Restaurant.

702
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,800
Her hair was as black as the black cloud.

703
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,560
I dare to say that

704
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
there are not many ladies in town
as beautiful as her.

705
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,120
Is it possible that

706
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,320
she was not truly falling in love
with Mr. Wang?

707
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,320
Impossible.

708
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,840
Sister Jing had always been loyal to him.

709
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,080
I accompanied her went to Puhua Temple before.

710
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,360
She made a wish that she could have a long
and loving life with him.

711
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
It sounds like

712
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,880
there is no reason for her to kill herself.

713
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,400
Then someone must have trickled her mind.

714
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,600
Please think again carefully.

715
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
Is there anything unusual happened before?

716
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,760
Anything unusual?

717
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,160
I remember

718
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,880
I was talking to her

719
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,400
in the morning before she committed suicide.

720
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,440
But she asked me to speak softly
out of a sudden.

721
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,720
She said that

722
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,280
she was listening to the sound of rain.

723
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,240
Sound of rain?

724
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,760
And the strangest thing was

725
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,960
that day was a bright and sunny day.

726
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,160
Young master.

727
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,080
Victims in these three cases

728
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,600
were died of suicide.

729
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,760
jumped into the river,

730
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,160
and jumped off from tower.

731
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,360
Investigation has been done at the crime scene.

732
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,840
There were no signs of homicide.

733
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,080
They were in wedding dress.

734
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,800
and in a confused state of mind.

735
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
All of them said that they heard
the sound of rain.

736
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,320
And they

737
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,840
were all pretty good-looking.

738
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,320
Yes.

739
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,160
When so many coincidences happened,

740
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,240
it's not considered as coincidence anymore.

741
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,600
It might be a certain tactic of the murderer.

742
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,720
But

743
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,080
it has been over two years
since the previous case.

744
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,800
This killer had so much patience.

745
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,320
It could be more than two years.

746
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,400
There might be more victims.

747
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,960
I planned to go to Puhua Temple tomorrow.

748
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
PuHua Temple?

749
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,280
Brother Su.

750
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,440
Are you going to pray to the god to help you?

751
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,120
What are you talking about?

752
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,760
Did she look like she needs help from god?

753
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,680
That's right.

754
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,800
Brother Su is a great detective.

755
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,720
Exactly.

756
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,080
Alright. Alright.

757
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,000
Did you just discover anything?

758
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,199
Wen Wen told me that

759
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,800
Jing Niang had been to Puhua Temple before.

760
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,239
So I want to go there and have a look.

761
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,560
Jing Niang...

762
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,679
Miss Lin and her family
also had been there before.

763
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,840
How about Miss Du?

764
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,560
Fu Zizhuo mentioned about it before.

765
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,600
It seems like

766
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
