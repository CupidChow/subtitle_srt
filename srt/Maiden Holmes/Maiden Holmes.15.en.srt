(Episode 15)

15
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:55,349
(Martial Arts Stage)

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,520
Officer Feng,

17
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,320
why are there so many imperial guards today?

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm sure someone will be here today.

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,000
Someone?

20
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,120
Who?

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,880
I think it must be Prince Qi.

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Prince Qi?

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,680
I thought he wasn't involved
in court affairs anymore?

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
Of course it's about something else.

25
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,480
The last test is the martial arts.

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,000
It accounts for one-fifth of
the promotion examination.

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,160
You need to compete one-on-one.

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,560
The winner of every round will receive 4 points.

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,720
Now,

30
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,040
please draw your lots

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,280
to determine the order of starting.

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,440
The martial arts test starts now!

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,040

(Su Ci)

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
Thank you, Detective Su.

36
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,355
(Finalists: Su Ci, Luo Xin)

37
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,880
Officer Liu,

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,160
Prince Qi has arrived.

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,280
Your Highness.

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,160
How's it?

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,520
It's the final round.

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,080
The finalists are Su Ci and Luo Xin.

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,840
Alright.

44
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
You may be excused.

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,480
Your Highness, you...

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,720
Don't bother.

47
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:04,779
(Champion: Su Ci)

48
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,440
Officer Luo, I win.

49
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
Since when

50
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
did the honest Detective Su

51
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
become so tricky?

52
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,040
I lost to my ability.

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,200
Why are you apologizing?

55
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,695
(Sanyuan Restaurant)

56
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,400
Cheers!

57
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,160
Cheers!

58
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,400
Sister Su, congratulations
for realizing your wish.

59
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,360
Sister Su, you're amazing!

60
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,280
Congratulations!

61
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,440
The final result

62
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,280
will be announced after being reviewed

63
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,440
by the Ministry of Personnel.

64
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
The review is a mere formality.

65
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,400
There won't be any problem.

66
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,480
Last time we mentioned that

67
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,640
Lu Zhaonan, who imitated Mulan
in serving in the army for her father,

68
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
disguised as a man

69
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,040
and concealed it

70
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,640
from many soldiers in the barrack.

71
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,240
Not only was she wise and brave

72
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,240
but also won many victories.

73
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,360
Rushuang.

74
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,840
After that,

75
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,680
Looks like it's a new story.

76
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,640
the Emperor conferred her the title
"General of the Flying Cavalry".

77
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,960
But on their triumphant return to the capital...

78
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
Guess what happened?

79
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
One day when Zhaonan was taking her bath,

80
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,760
she encountered assassination
by the remnants of the enemy.

81
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,400
Her true gender was revealed.

82
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,920
Sister Su,

83
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,880
try this.

84
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you.

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,320
She was so beautiful...

86
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,800
Young Master.

87
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,640
It not only surprised her subordinates

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but also the assassinators.

89
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,880
But her beauty didn't help her much.

90
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,880
As Zhaonan had deceived the Emperor,

91
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,880
the stubborn lieutenant captured her

92
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,520
and brought her before the Emperor.

93
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,680
Zhaonan received the title
"General of the Flying Cavalry"

94
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,120
for her military victories.

95
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,840
The lieutenant must be jealous of her.

96
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,360
Jealous.

97
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,080
That's right.

98
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,400
He's weak and narrow-minded.

99
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,320
Shame on him.

100
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,600
You should be killed for deceiving the Emperor.

101
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,200
How about the open-minded party?

102
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,480
They fought for Zhaonan
to make up for her deceit.

103
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,039
His Majesty should practice meritocracy.

104
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,880
She should be rewarded.

105
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,880
Everyone,

106
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,520
what do you think?

107
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,600
Of course she should be rewarded.

108
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,520
Yes, she should be rewarded.

109
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,400
I agree.

110
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,280
Need I say more?

111
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,440
Of course she should be rewarded.

112
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,200
Yes.

113
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,520
The citizens

114
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,880
thought so too.

115
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,920
So they voluntarily gathered a petition.

116
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,040
There were tens of thousands of names

117
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,320
on the 100-meter-long petition.

118
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,520
In the end, the Emperor appeased the people

119
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,720
pardoned Zhaonan

120
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,080
and conferred her the title

121
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,400
"The First Female General

122
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,600
of the Country".

123
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,240
Great!

124
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,160
What a splendid story!

125
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,160
Amazing!

126
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,520
Bravo!

127
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,720
What a nice story! Great!

128
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,720
That's brilliant.

129
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
It's quite good.

130
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,080
But the Classics of Prince Qi

131
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,160
was replaced by the Classics of Zhaonan.

132
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,920
Little Fei Yuan,

133
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
are you unhappy?

134
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,760
Is she right, Little Fei Yuan?

135
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,720
Actually,

136
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
all these were planned by Young Master.

137
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,440
He said

138
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,480
it's to appease the people.

139
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,200
Fei Yuan,

140
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,480
bring another bottle of wine.

141
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,160
Alright.

142
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,560
Brother Pei, I got it now.

143
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,840
Are you tired of

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,240
compliments?

145
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,160
Those were exaggerated.

146
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,720
In fact, I was sick of it.

147
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,000
You did this for me?

148
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,600
Here, have a drink.

149
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,240
Come on.

150
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,560
What a lunatic Qu is.

151
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,920
The price of his paintings is increasing.

152
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,080
You're right.

153
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,960
The one he finished yesterday

154
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,200
was sold for a good price.

155
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,880
I've never thought that

156
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,120
we could earn extra money from this.

157
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,840
You're right.

158
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,400
I've been travelling these few years.

159
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,600
I came across that many local schools

160
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,200
have started to recruit female students.

161
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
Mr. Xu, I wonder what you think about this.

162
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,880
Is it true?

163
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,120
That's absurd.

164
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,840
Why would you say that?

165
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,960
Women should learn how to become a good wife.

166
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,160
It's enough for them
to learn some women precepts.

167
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,920
If they attend school with men

168
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
and become intimate with males,

169
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,320
women's morals and propriety will lose.

170
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,920
Mr. Xu is Right.

171
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,000
Men study and pass examination

172
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,240
with the purpose of serving the country.

173
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,440
But it's not the same for women.

174
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,280
They'll eventually marry and have kids.

175
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,880
Why bother messing in public?

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,800
They'll bring shame to the family.

177
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,880
It's fine

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
if women learn about principles

179
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,840
and general knowledge.

180
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,000
But if they go too far,

181
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
evil intention may generate.

182
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,000
It's better to be ignorant and behave themselves.

183
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,760
That's right.

184
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,560
(Imperial College）

185
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,160
Your Highness,

186
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,440
these scholars are really pedantic

187
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,440
and stubborn.

188
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,040
That's right.

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,840
Why did you

190
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,920
pay them a visit then?

191
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,960
We still need them for the breakthrough.

192
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,680
If I can't convince them,

193
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,520
how can we break the tradition?

194
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,080
Looks like you has found a solution.

195
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,560
Here's another thing.

196
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,880
His Majesty ordered me

197
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,680
to host a banquet for the Beirong delegation.

198
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,640
Inform the others to prepare for it.

199
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,360
Yes.

200
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,760
Be careful.

201
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,200
Keep up!

202
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,240
Quick!

203
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:25,234
(Capital Suburb Inn)

204
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,800
Wait a moment.

205
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,800
I'm Che Yan,

206
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,000
subordinate of Prince Shuomu and Princess Yunchuan.

207
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,320
I'm Fu Ziyou.

208
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,640
I'm responsible for protecting

209
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,320
Princess Yunchuan while she's in Liang.

210
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,760
Thank you, Commander Fu.

211
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,280
What are those?

212
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,600
These are the daily necessities
of Princess Yunchuan.

213
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,520
Have you checked boxes?

214
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,800
Sir,

215
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,600
the delegation brought the boxes with them.

216
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,120
I have no right to check.

217
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,080
They've traveled a long distance.

218
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,160
Problems may occur

219
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,400
along the journey.

220
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,960
For the Princess's safety,

221
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,240
we'll need to check the boxes.

222
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,480
It's my responsibility. Please cooperate.

223
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,560
You can't do that!

224
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,160
How dare you

225
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,680
touch my stuff?

226
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
His Highness. Her Highness.

227
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,120
Commander Fu, don't stand on ceremony.

228
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,280
It's my responsibility to protect the Princess.

229
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,720
Your Highness, please pardon me.

230
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
I don't need your protection.

231
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,120
Carry my boxes inside.

232
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,720
Commander Fu,

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,760
my younger sister

234
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
is like a kid.

235
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,760
Don't bother yourself arguing with her.

236
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,000
Yunchuan,

237
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
we're now on their land.

238
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,560
We must follow their rules.

239
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,200
I...

240
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,360
Open them.

241
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

242
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,720
Understood.

243
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Good girl.

244
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,680
Carry the boxes to the Princess's bedroom.

245
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,640
Understood.

246
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,000
Is it done?

247
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,720
Carry them over.

248
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Brother,

249
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,960
I want to go out and play.

250
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,720
Look at you.

251
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,680
You'd better get a good rest.

252
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,840
We'll enter the palace to meet
the Emperor of Liang tomorrow.

253
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,880
Commander Fu,

254
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,280
I'll leave it to you.

255
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,640
Please excuse me.

256
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,720
What a great poem Mr. Li has written.

257
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Look at this painting.

258
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Yes, it's so vivid.

259
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,360
Is it true that Su Ci

260
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,240
is indeed a woman?

261
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,680
Su Ci had conflicted with

262
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,000
with the son of Marquis Yong'an

263
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,400
due to a girl's robbery case.

264
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Few days later,

265
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,920
the son of Marquis Yong'an
was exiled to the border.

266
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,720
Prince Qi has been strange lately.

267
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,560
He not only went to the Imperial College

268
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,080
and discussed female students

269
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,880
but also arranged storytellers to spread

270
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
the story of female general
at big inns in the capital,

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,160
to preach that

272
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,200
women can serve the country just like men.

273
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,440
Looks like

274
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,520
he's paving the way for Su Ci.

275
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,280
Find Xiao Junhao

276
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,760
in person.

277
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,360
Yes.

278
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,800
Find out if

279
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,480
Su Ci

280
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,280
is indeed a woman.

281
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,280
If yes,

282
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,720
we can take this opportunity
to get rid of her

283
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,600
and suppress Xiao Yanzhi.

284
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:36,606
(Mansion of Prince Qi)

285
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,600
Congratulations, Your Highness.

286
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,640
I've no idea what I should be happy with.

287
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,600
I've figured out the truth

288
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,680
as your request.

289
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,920
Mr. Xu's daughter is indeed
studying at the Imperial College.

290
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,880
Do you have any concrete evidence?

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Here you are.

292
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,599
Start with serving the parents,

293
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,079
followed by serving the King,

294
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,079
and end with the self.

295
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,359
Sir,

296
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,920
Officer Jiang, why are you here today?

297
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
Prince Qi asked me to give it to you.

298
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,760
This...

299
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,520
Sir.

300
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,840
This...

301
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,560
Don't be nervous.

302
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,960
His Highness is an upright person.

303
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,840
He just wanted to remind you that

304
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,920
as Confucius said, "Education
knows no class distinction".

305
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,680
There's no distinction in classes or wealth,

306
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,480
why care about men and women?

307
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
His Highness was right about that indeed.

308
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
Looks like I'm being pedantic.

309
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,720
The Imperial College will immediately announce

310
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,760
that women are allowed to enroll.

311
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,480
We'll call on local schools to follow

312
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,120
that everyone should have
equal access to education.

313
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,560
Thank you.

314
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,120
Brother Pei, have you slept?

315
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,400
Come in.

316
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,960
Come, have a seat.

317
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,160
It's fine.

318
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,160
This is for you.

319
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,680
This is...

320
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,520
I embroidered this on my own.

321
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,800
Are these

322
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,920
eggplants?

323
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,200
I know.

324
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,920
These are red dates.

325
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,880
Aren't they?

326
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,080
Are these peanuts then?

327
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,080
Is my needlework that bad?

328
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,240
Whether it's peanut or red date,

329
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,240
I know what you mean.

330

00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,120
Prince and Princess, you may rise.

347
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

348
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,280
We, Shuomu and Yuchuan of Beirong,

349
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,560
by the order of our King,

350
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,520
hereby present the Letter of Credence.

351
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,240
(King of Beirong extends greetings
to Emperor of Liang)

352
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
Beirong shows sincerity in peace negotiation.

353
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,480
If we could successfully sign
an armistice this time

354
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,200
and reopen the tea-horse road,

355
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,760
it would be a win-win situation.

356
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,400
But the alliance between two countries

357
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
involves military and government affairs
and business exchanges.

358
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,360
The specific conditions
need to be discussed in detail.

359
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Please extend your stay for another few days.

360
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,640
Take some time to appreciate
the sight of the capital.

361
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,320
You won't come all the way in vain.

362
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

363
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,760
Your Majesty,

364
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,800
Yunchuan is here

365
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,400
with the hope to form alliance by marriage

366
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,080
and foster friendship between our two countries.

367
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,640
That sounds good.

368
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,240
Princess Yunchuan is the beloved
daughter of your esteemed King.

369
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,080
I'll definitely help her find
the most suitable husband.

370
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,080
Father treats Yunchuan as a treasure.

371
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
He's very concerned about her marriage.

372
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,440
I'd like to request to Your Majesty

373
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,920
to allow me to choose

374
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,200
the best warrior of Liang.

375
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,440
Yes, of course.

376
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,440
Do you have

377
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,240
any idea about that?

378
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,920
To be honest,

379
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,360
I've long heard that Prince Qi
is brave, good at war

380
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,200
and out-going.

381
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,680
I guess he's the most suitable with Yunchuan.

382
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Indeed Prince Qi is the best.

383
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,120
Yes, he's right.

384
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,640
It's true.

385
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,240
It's reasonable.

386
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,240
Prince Qi.

387
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,360
They've said Prince Qi has extraordinary skill,

388
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,440
and is the best warrior of Liang.

389
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,240
But why you look like

390
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,000
a fair, delicate scholar?

391
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
I've also heard that

392
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,560
Prince Qi's eyes were injured years ago

393
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,920
and have not healed.

394
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
Can you still

395
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,600
fight in the war?

396
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,360
Yunchuan!

397
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,000
How could she say that about Prince Qi?

398
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,600
What kind of propriety is this?

399
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Prince Qi, please forgive us.

400
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
My sister has been mischievous and blunt

401
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,880
since youth.

402
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,080
Please pardon us.

403
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,680
Princess Yunchuan is adorable

404
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,880
and straightforward.

405
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,520
There's nothing wrong with it.

406
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,680
Besides,

407
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,360
I've not been involved
in court affairs for years.

408
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,640
I'm living an idle life.

409
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,760
Bravery and fighting

410
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,360
are a thing of the past.

411
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,760
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

412
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,240
I've already heard of this.

413
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,560
As a real man,

414
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,040
being a dissolute person is nothing

415
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,480
as long as you can lead an army.

416
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,240
Besides, my sister might not care for

417
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,040
dull and honest persons.

418
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,640
I...

419
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,560
Alright then.

420
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,640
I'll follow my brother's words.

421
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,200
Prince Shuomu,

422
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,800
Princess Yunchuan,

423
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,400
there's no need to rush.

424
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,480
There are many great talents in Liang.

425
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,800
Princess Yunchuan may take the time
to choose carefully.

426
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,800
How about we reach an alliance first

427
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,920
and discuss about the marriage later?

428
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,720
Wouldn't it be an icing on the cake?

429
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,160
Am I right?

430
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
There's no need to re-discuss
about the marriage candidate.

431
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,600
We may discuss about the alliance first,

432
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,120
followed by the details of the marriage.

433
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,480
Your Majesty,

434
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,160
what do you think?

435
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,240
That sounds good.

436
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,440
Damn!

437
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,560
Calm down.

438
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,800
Please calm down.

439
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,440
I guess Princess Yunchuan

440
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,240
is just momentarily cheated by Prince Qi.

441
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,200
She won't marry Prince Qi.

442
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,640
Even if Prince Qi agrees to it,

443
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,840
His Majesty won't allow him to go to Beirong.

444
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
You know nothing.

445
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,680
Can I still control Xiao Yanzhi

446
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,960
once he unites with Beirong?

447
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,080
At that time,

448
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,040
the entire country will fall into his hands.

449
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,440
We must not let him

450
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,760
unite with Beirong by marriage.

451
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,760
Your Highness, are you looking for me?

452
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Think of a way

453
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,120
to reject the marriage.

454
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,160
No matter what,

455
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,000
you must make Shuomu to perish the thought.

456
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,200
I got it.

457
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,360
Also,

458
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,080
send someone to protect Princess Yunchuan.

459
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,560
Someone in the court

460
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,920
definitely wants to stop this marriage.

461
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
This might bring danger to Princess Yunchuan.

462
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,480
Understood.

463
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,880
(Capital Suburb Inn)

464
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,480
Commander Fu,

465
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,560
Yunchuan is missing.

466
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,480
What?

467
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,760
Her Highness knocked out a maid

468
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,120
and put on the maid's clothes.

469
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,880
My sister

470
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,440
often dresses up as a maid

471
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,280
and sneaks out.

472
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,320
But she's not familiar with the capital.

473
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:26,800
I...

474
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,520
Your Highness, don't worry.

475
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,400
I'll bring the Princess home safely.

476
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,280
Both of you

477
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,200
search that area.

478
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,920
Yes.

479
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
You look over there.

480
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,200
Got it.

481
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,400
Watch your step.

482
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Please come again.

483
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,680
Don't worry.

484
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,200
I'll be back again.

485
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,480
Get back in.

486
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,120
Alright.

487
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,480
You're here.

488
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,040
Yes, I'm here.

489
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,040
Please get in.

490
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,760
Let's go.

491
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,840
Long time no see.

492
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,840
Mr. Li, are you satisfied this time?

493
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm satisfied.

494
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,640
Let me tell you.

495
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,280
We'll have more beautiful ladies next time.

496
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,240
Save one for me.

497
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,880
I'll remember it.

498
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,360
See you next time.

499
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,800
See you.

500
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,120
Please come again.

501
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,120
Hey, lady.

502
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,000
What do you

503
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,560
come here for?

504
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm here for the same reason

505
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,160
as they do.

506
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,760
You're joking, aren't you?

507
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,160
You might not be able to do

508
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,280
what they can do.

509
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,040
Why can't I?

510
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,440
Are you here to cause a scene?

511
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
I'm telling you this.

512
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,200
I won't be polite with you

513
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,560
if you continue to be like this.

514
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,920
Guards!

515
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,840
This...

516
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,440
Who are you?

517
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,600
Let go!

518
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,200
It's you.

519
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,880
You...

520
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,800
How dare you?

521
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,240
I don't mean to offend Your Highness.

522
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,200
Has Your Highness ever thought that

523
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,880
your action would implicate

524
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,000
other innocent people in the resident?

525
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,480
Our countries are entering into an alliance.

526
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,200
As a princess,

527
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,320
you shouldn't come to a brothel.

528
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,600
Who do you think you are?

529
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,640
How dare you scold me?

530
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,320
Aren't you Commander Fu?

531
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,320
Both you and Mr. Pei
have not been here for awhile.

532
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,680
Mister!

533
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,760
Mister!

534
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,520
Mr. Fu!

535
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,960
Let's have a drink together.

536
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,200
Yes, please stay for the wine.

537
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,040
Get off!

538
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,640
What's going on?

539
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,360
Why is he so fierce?

540
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,760
It's my responsibility.

541
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,760
I beg for your pardon.

542
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,360
Pardon?

543
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,120
I'll let my brother know about this.

544
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,800
You're doomed!

545
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:21,960
Stop!

546
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,520
What are you doing?

547
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,240
Are you afraid?

548
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
Trying to escape?

549
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,680
I lost my sword tassel at Lixiang Restaurant.

550
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,280
It means a lot to me.

551
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,080
Can you please let me go?

552
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,560
Don't let her step out.

553
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,280
Understood.

554
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,640
You...

555
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,840
You're the one eager to find an excuse

556
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,800
to visit such a place.

557
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,800
Your Highness,

558
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,840
can you not

559
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,200
sneak out alone again?

560
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,000
Thanks to Commander Fu this time.

561
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,120
What's so great about him?

562
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,840
It's just a useless sword tassel.

563
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,640
Why did he look so angry?

564
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Your Highness,

565
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
Commander Fu is so miserable.

566
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,400
So stop speaking bad about him.

567
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,600
Miserable?

568
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,600
Yes.

569
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,280
He had a fiancée.

570
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,080
I've heard that
she was his childhood sweetheart.

571
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,160
But on the night before their marriage,

572
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,680
his fiancee committed suicide.

573
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,160
Commander Fu felt depressed due to this.

574
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,000
He has been in a particularly bad mood.

575
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,720
Then, due to the candidate of concubine case,

576
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,720
he was demoted.

577
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,840
How did you know about these?

578
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,760
I heard the guards talking about it.

579
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,640
Everyone in the capital

580
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,440
knows about his fiancée's death.

581
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,640
Might the sword tassel be

582
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,520
a gift from his fiancée?

583
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,000
Your Highness.

584
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:12,680
( After investigation,
it was found that Su Ci was indeed a woman.  )

585
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,880
Su Ci is indeed a woman.

586
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,000
Xiao Yanzhi,

587
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,720
this time,

588
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,280
let's see to how you'll defend yourself.

589
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,120
Your Majesty.

590
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,920
(Report of Promotion Examination)

591
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,840
Your Majesty,

592
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,520
42 persons from different department

593
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,600
participated in this promotion examination.

594
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,360
Through the imperial exam
and actual combat tests,

595
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,120
only 9 persons are qualified for promotion.

596
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,480
Alright.

597
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,040
Announce the results based on
Ministry of Personnel's report

598
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,520
and promote the officials.

599
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,560
Sure, Your Majesty.

600
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,080
Your Majesty,

601
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,480
I suddenly remember the widely discussed

602
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,440
Roll Call Ceremony
during his late emperor's reign.

603
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,360
How was the Roll Call Ceremony?

604
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,120
At that time,

605
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,960
the roll call ceremony
was held in the main hall.

606
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,120
After the great music of Danbi was played,

607
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,480
the Roll Call Ceremony
officially began as the sun rose.

608
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,600
Under the lead of Ministry of Personnel,

609
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,720
the civil and military officials, in their court dress,

610
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,400
led the newly promoted officials

611
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,520
to enter the court.

612
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,560
They gathered beneath the steps
leading to the palace hall.

613
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,440
The scene was truly grand and solemn.

614
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,200
I guess it was an unprecedented grand occasion.

615
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,080
That's right.

616
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,960
Since Your Majesty ascended the throne,

617
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,400
you has been working hard, showing love

618
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,240
and setting a good example for the citizens.

619
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,640
If Your Majesty

620
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,720
holds a Roll Call Ceremony in the hall,

621
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,520
isn't it an opportunity for the officials

622
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,720
to kowtow and thank Your Majesty?

623
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,840
It'll reflect your kindness.

624
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,760
Will this

625
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,159
make a big scene?

626
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,880
Your Majesty,

627
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,920
if you think that
the Roll Call Ceremony is untimely,

628
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,679
how about sing praises

629
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,600
in the main hall?

630
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,600
This way,

631
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,560
the newly promoted officials

632
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,440
will feel honored.

633
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
I believe that

634
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,199
they'd give their best

635
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,639
and loyal to Liang.

636
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,679
Uncle, you are right about that.

637
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,880
Issue a decree.

638
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,760
Request the 9 newly promoted officials

639
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,120
to attend the morning audience tomorrow.

640
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,280
I'll sing praises of them

641
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,320
before the court audience.
