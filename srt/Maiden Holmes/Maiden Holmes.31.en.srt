(Episode 31)

15
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,720
Sister Su,

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,880
How do you feel?

17
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,320
Don't get up in a hurry.

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,720
How do you feel?

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,000
The fireworks.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,080
How did it go?

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,120
Don't worry.
The fireworks weren't set off.

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
No one's hurt.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
That's great.

24
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,880
But...

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,280
No.

26
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,280
No. Young Master is in trouble!

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,960
What happened to him?

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,800
Prince Yun accused him of conspiracy.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
He is being investigated
in the main hall now.

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,920
Where are you going?

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,400
Sister Su.

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
I want to help him.

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,920
You are too weak to go.

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,320
I have to.

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,880
I can't just stand by and watch him

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,160
being framed by Prince Yun.

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,840
Take it easy.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Be careful.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Officer Liu.

40
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Don't be afraid.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,880
You just have to tell the truth.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,200
Yes.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,840
According to the record
of the Ministry of Rites,

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,080
the preparation of the banquet
was led by Prince Qi.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
The transportation and the
production of the fireworks,

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,840
as well as the schedule of the fireworks

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,720
were all approved by Prince Qi.

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,040
Liu Xuan, get straight to the point.

49
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,040
Everyone knows that

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,200
the banquet was led by him.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,280
We don't need you to emphasize it again.

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,080
Okay.

53
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,600
Just tell us the investigation result.

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
Let's start with the
poisonous powder then.

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,760
The poisonous powder
in the Auspicious

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
is a strong poison called Udumbara.

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,160
A tiny amount is enough to cause death.

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
It can harm the lung once it's inhaled.

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
If the fireworks were to be set off,

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
the Zhaoyang Stage as well as

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,640
the whole palace would be affected.

63
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,880
All the guests

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,880
would be dead.

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,600
The consequences could be disastrous.

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,560
That's rebellion! It's conspiracy!

67
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,560
Her Highness is right.

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,840
Previously,

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
a confidant of Prince Qi, Jiang Xiwen

70
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,800
was suspected of killing
a craftsman named Tian Yong.

71
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,360
This case

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,240
was also handled by the Mingjing Office.

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,200
Tian Yong was repairing a warehouse then.

74
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,440
And the goods in the warehouse

75
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,240
were these poisonous
powder called Udumbara.

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,160
Officer Liu,

77
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,400
I knew about this case.

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,280
But no solid evidence could prove

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
that Jiang Xiwen killed Tian Yong.

80
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,160
Are you provoking us?

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,280
Jiang Xiwen committed
suicide to escape punishment.

82
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,000
And the cause of his death
has been unknown.

83
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,880
What was his actual motive then?

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
His actual motive

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm afraid, was to silence somebody.

86
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,880
This...

87
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
How vicious.

88
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,720
Detective Su, you...

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,560
Commander Fu,

90
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
we need to see His Majesty now.

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,840
Irrelevant people are
not allowed to enter.

92
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,200
Detective Su, please leave now.

93
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,760
It's regarding the fireworks case.

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
I really have something important
to tell His Majesty.

95
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,320
Please let us go inside.

96
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,840
Breaking into the hall without permission

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
is offending His Majesty

98
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,760
and will be sentenced as assassin.

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,440
Detective Su, you'd better leave now.

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,560
But...

101
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
Commander Su, something bad has happened.

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
A group of people
suddenly attack the city

103
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,160
from the West gate.

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Detective Su, please leave now.

105
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,800
Sister Su, quickly go in now.

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,520
I'm going to the West
gate with Commander Fu.

107
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,360
OK.

108
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,600
Let's go.

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,000
There's another thing quite suspicious.

110
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,160
The warehouse that
stored the poisonous powder

111
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,840
belonged to Sha Du, a businessman
from the Western region.

112
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,520
He was killed suddenly
a few months ago.

113
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,840
After investigation,

114
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
we found that His Highness
was at the crime scene.

115
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,160
Your Highness, was it true?

116
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,880
Yes, I was there.

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
Everyone has heard it, right?

118
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,520
How can there be such a
coincidence in the world?

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
Everything involving the poisonous powder

120
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,640
was related to the men of Prince Qi.

121
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,160
We have all the evidences now.

122
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,080
Prince Qi,

123
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
you're the mastermind behind it.

124
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Really?

125
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,840
How could he do that?

126
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
How could he do such things?

127
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,520
The mastermind of the
Fireworks case is not Prince Qi.

128
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,760
I'm Su Ci from the Mingjing Office.

129
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,360
Your Majesty,
Your Highness.

130
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,920
Su Ci,

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,160
how come it's you again?

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,960
Who allowed you to break into
the main hall? Get out now!

133
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Liu Xuan, let her speak.

134
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,680
Su Ci, stand up and speak.

135
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

136
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,520
Tell us what you've found..

137
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,400
In my investigation,

138
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,680
I found that a few craftsmen
working on the fireworks

139
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,720
were poisoned by Udumbara too.

140
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,000
And they all got poisoned

141
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,200
when they were
making the last firework.

142
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,600
Then, do you know who planned this?

143
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,360
It's him.

144
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,800
Liu Xuan.

145
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,920
What?

146
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,200
What happened exactly?

147
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,360
When I was investigating
the Jiang Xiwen's case,

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,880
some people in the capital were
transferring a batch of poison secretly.

149
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,160
And the poison was Udumbara.

150
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,200
All the people involved
in this case were killed.

151
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,480
I suspected that someone wanted to
use the poison to do something illegal.

152
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,360
Hence, I was investigating
the case in a rush.

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,600
But, at that time,

154
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Officer Liu used the incident of
water pollution outside the city

155
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
to lure me away.

156
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,400
The villagers in Zhushui Village
got poisoned from the drinking water.

157
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,240
Poisoned?

158
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,280
Do you think it has anything to do

159
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,120
with that poison?

160
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,360
Water in the village was
indeed poisoned by someone.

161
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,200
But, it's not Udumbara.

162
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,080
It's the thunder duke vine that could
cause severe symptoms seemingly

163
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,480
but it's not fatal.

164
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,720
Su Ci,

165
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
how can you prove that

166
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,520
Officer Liu has lured you away deliberately?

167
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,080
At eight o'clock on that day,

168
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,200
Officer Liu informed me that

169
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,920
someone poisoned the
water outside the city.

170
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,280
But, the village chief reported
to the government at ten o'clock.

171
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,080
So, Officer Liu,

172
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,960
how come you knew about the incident

173
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,440
an hour before?

174
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,640
Could it be the village chief
remember the time wrongly?

175
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,280
Su Ci,

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You cannot jump to the conclusion

177
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,560
based only on the words
of the village chief.

178
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,920
Even if the village chief
was right about the time,

179
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,960
it only proves that Office Liu

180
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,760
knew about the poison
incident in Zhushui Village earlier.

181
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,960
What is the relation to
the fireworks case?

182
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,200
Officer Liu,

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,320
can you show your right wrist?

184
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,120
What do you mean?

185
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,320
Your Highness,

186
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,600
those poisoned by Udumbara,

187
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,880
the lung nerve will
be burnt in five days.

188
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,880
There'll be a red
line at the right wrist.

189
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,560
I smelled sulphur

190
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,160
from Officer Liu a few days ago.

191
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,360
My Lord.
Have you been feeling unwell lately?

192
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,040
When I just came in,

193
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,480
I smelled sulphur from you.

194
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,040
Are you on medication?

195
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,720
It's no big deal.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,160
Perhaps, I've been too tired lately.

197
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,360
I've gotten some scabies.
So I applied some medicine.

198
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,840
Perhaps, it's the smell of the medicine.

199
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,080
Take good care of yourself.

200
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,840
Don't worry.

201
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,560
I guess that smell of sulphur

202
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,040
could be from the fireworks powder

203
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
when he sneaked into
the Production Bureau.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,760
Eunuch Li.

205
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
Yes.

206
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,040
It's really him!

207
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
It's really him!

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,400
So it's really you.

209
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,760
Yes.

210
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
I was the culprit.

211
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Why?

212
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,360
You have never thought

213
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,760
of surviving since the beginning, right?

214
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

215
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,920
Then, why did you frame His Highness?

216
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,080
Don't you feel happy watching

217
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,120
these immoral and despicable people
hurting each other?

218
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,560
Liu Xuan,

219
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,040
His Majesty stood your ground
against the opinion of the masses

220
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,680
and promoted you to be the
Lead Officer of Mingjing Office.

221
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,240
His Majesty has been
treating you very well.

222
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,760
Why did you do this?

223
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,200
What a great grace.

224
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,680
How can

225
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,720
such a small kindness repay

226
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
hundreds of lives
of my Bai Liang Clan?

227
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,880
What is your relationship
with the Bai Liang Clan?

228
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm Bai Jing.

229
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,960
A member of the Bai Liang Clan.

230
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,920
I was fostered by the Liu family
in Cangzhou since I was a kid.

231
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
My name was changed to Liu Xuan.

232
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,120
You are a Bai Liang criminal?

233
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,680
I was sent to my adopted
parents' home since I was a kid.

234
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,320
Therefore, I was able to escape
when my clan was being destroyed.

235
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,160
My father, mother,

236
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
grandfather, grandmother,
brothers and sisters

237
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,240
died in your hands.

238
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,960
The Bai Liang Clan
was plotting a rebellion

239
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,920
and killed the late emperor.

240
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,760
That was what the clan deserved.

241
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,680
Rebellion?

242
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,320
Everyone in the clan
was sentenced to death

243
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,160
just because of the
clothes that they contributed

244
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,280
and a letter from an unknown source.

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,720
The clan was destroyed.

246
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,640
That's hundreds of lives.

247
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,160
Did you give them a chance to explain?

248
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,840
There were firm evidences proving the
Bai Liang Clan killed the late emperor.

249
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
How could you deny that?

250
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,280
At the very least,

251
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,680
if you think you are innocent,

252
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
you can resort to a legitimate way
to review the old cases.

253
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,480
Yet, you chose to be unscrupulous.

254
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,680
Have you lost your mind?

255
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,040
You are the rulers.

256
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
And you can ignore

257
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,600
all the laws.

258
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,360
The existence of laws

259
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,280
are just designed for people like you,

260
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,880
to justify yourself

261
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,600
in such circumstance.

262
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,920
So you can prettify your
seemingly noble status.

263
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,640
You're rebellious
offending the authority.

264
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
How dare you quibble here?

265
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,880
All of you

266
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,000
with a high position

267
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,480
only know how to manipulate your power,

268
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,200
and disregard human lives.

269
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,760
And all of you,

270
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,080
useless officials,

271
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,400
are just holding sinecures.

272
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
In that case,

273
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
it would be better

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
for everyone to die!

275
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,400
Liu Xuan,

276
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,160
stay away.

277
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,880
-Let her go!
-Go away!

278
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,760
Lead Officer,

279
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,880
I've got the evidence
to reverse the verdict.

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,160
Why did you...

281
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,040
Yian,

282
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,320
beware of Prince Yun.

283
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,960
You knew...

284
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,480
Sister Su.

285
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,280
Lead Officer!

286
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,800
What are you talking about?

287
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,640
I'm the head of the family.

288
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,640
I don't need a secret stash.

289
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,720
You've just

290
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,960
recovered from the poisoning.

291
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,840
Why not take more rests?

292
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
Please don't do that.

293
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,800
If Su Ci is innocent

294
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,240
and he has to suffer such humiliation here,

295
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,120
how are

296
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,920
the Mingjing officers

297
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,160
going to serve Your Majesty in the future?

298
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Mingjing Office is the
place to investigate cases.

299
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,720
There's no gender discrimination here.

300
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,680
You're working too hard on investigation.

301
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
Just like me

302
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,800
when I first came to the capital.

303
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,360
Go and investigate your case.

304
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,320
Lead Officer...

305
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,800
I didn't expect that

306
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,720
we could see such plot.

307
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,040
The only two remnants
from the Bai Liang Clan

308
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,880
were killing each other here.

309
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,240
Su Ci,

310
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,920
you're the only one left
in the Bai Liang Clan now.

311
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,119
What is your feeling?

312
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,720
You mean

313
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,560
Su Ci is the remnant of
the Bai Liang Clan too?

314
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,760
Yes.

315
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,520
Detective Su is from the
Bai Liang Clan too. What...

316
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,720
Your Highness,

317
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,160
Su Ci disguised as a man
in the Mingjing Office.

318
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,960
I've suspected that she had other motive.

319
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,360
Therefore, I checked the
lineage of Bai Liang Clan.

320
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,480
I found that everyone
from the Bai Liang Clan died,

321
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,880
except the daughter of the
clan leader who was missing.

322
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
She's called Bai Yian,

323
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
who is Su Ci.

324
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,920
Yet Prince Qi hid her in his mansion

325
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,880
and helped her to be an
official in the imperial court.

326
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,200
They made a detailed plan,
acting step by step,

327
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,240
designed the fireworks rebellion case today.

328
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,600
They are the culprits
of this heinous crime!

329
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,400
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

330
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,200
Please behead the two as soon as possible.

331
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,320
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

332
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,200
I beg you to let me defend for myself.

333
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,960
Approved.

334
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,000
Bring the witnesses.

335
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,080
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

336
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,520
Who are these three people?

337
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,520
Your Highness,

338
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
they three

339
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,560
are the craftsmen,
the most important witnesses in this case.

340
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,040
Those who had died in the prison

341
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,240
were only fake craftsmen.

342
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,320
I've handed the real ones

343
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,440
to Your Majesty earlier.

344
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,840
Commander Fu did the arrangement.

345
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,280
Yes, mother.

346
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
Your Majesty,

347
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,920
an important case
like this is not a play.

348
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

349
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,840
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

350
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,600
If I don't do this,

351
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
how can I seduce the real mastermind?

352
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,160
Before the banquet,

353
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,280
I got to know that

354
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,560
there was a batch of poisonous
powder missing in the capital.

355
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,920
I was afraid that someone meant to
cause trouble during the banquet.

356
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,880
Therefore, I checked

357
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,280
everything needed during
the fireworks show.

358
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,240
I found nothing.

359
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,240
Until right before the banquet,

360
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,560
I found out there were
poisonous powder in the fireworks.

361
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,560
It is a serious incident.

362
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,680
Hence, I informed
Your Majesty immediately,

363
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,080
and made a plan to
attract the real mastermind.

364
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
How dare they've planned to do this!

365
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,240
Luckily we found it out now.

366
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,960
Now, we know nothing of their next plan.

367
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
How about we take the chance...

368
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,480
Brother destroyed

369
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,000
the fireworks light-up setting secretly,

370
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,320
and placed guards where
the fireworks were set off.

371
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,880
Is it true?

372
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,200
Yes.

373
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,800
I've sent Liu Yu and others to protect
His Majesty in secret.

374
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,280
When they were about
to set off the Auspicious,

375
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,800
we'd be able to

376
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,800
find the real mastermind.

377
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,280
Detective Su, it's here!

378
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,320
-Stop it!
-Detective Su?

379
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,200
How come she's here?

380
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Do we need to stop them?

381
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,200
Stay still first.

382
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,480
Wait a bit.

383
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,840
Stop it!

384
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,720
Go!

385
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,440
Yes.

386
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,160
Catch them all!

387
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,200
You knew it all.

388
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,360
You just left the city then,

389
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
and I didn't have
chance to inform you yet.

390
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,880
Good that we're all OK.

391
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,120
In that case,

392
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,720
why do you need to

393
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,040
replace the real
craftsmen with the fake?

394
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,800
Although Liu Xuan was
the culprit of this case,

395
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,040
to implement such a complicated plan

396
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,280
was beyond his capability.

397
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
Behind Liu Xuan,

398
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,160
someone has been helping him

399
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,840
to complete the plan.

400
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,920
And this person

401
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,000
is Prince Yun.

402
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,000
Prince Qi,

403
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,040
you've failed in your rebellion,

404
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,680
and now you want to frame me?

405
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
You can't say that without evidence.

406
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Don't be nervous, uncle.

407
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,680
I'll submit the evidence now.

408
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,840
After the incident was exposed,

409
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,400
Prince Yun couldn't wait

410
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,240
to send someone to poison the fake craftsmen,

411
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,600
asking them to commit suicide.

412
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,280
So, we turned their trick into ours.

413
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,240
Faked the death so that they could escape.

414
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,360
Bring her in.

415
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,040
Zhang, please identify

416
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,320
who sent you the
poisonous pills in the jail?

417
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,000
It's her,

418
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,720
the maid of Prince Yun.

419
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,040
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

420
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,480
Prince Qi kidnapped my maid,

421
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,080
and I don't know where they found

422
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,960
three unidentified craftsmen.

423
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,800
They're framing me.

424
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,200
Your Highness, please believe me.

425
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,240
Prince Yun,

426
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,360
you killed Lei Zheng publicly back then

427
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,560
to protect yourself.

428
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,480
You want to play the same trick again?

429
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,560
You're a Bai Liang criminal,

430
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,560
you have no right to
speak in the main hall.

431
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,320
Prince Yun...

432
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
Su Ci, go on.

433
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

434
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,200
my actual name is Bai Yian.

435
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,320
I'm from the Bai Liang Clan.

436
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,200
I was rescued by someone to survive.

437
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,440
I've hidden my real name until today.

438
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,000
I made a vow since I was a kid

439
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,240
that I would investigate the
Bai Liang Clan case

440
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,360
and the truth about the
death of the late emperor.

441
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,240
Back then,

442
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,680
after the Bai Liang brocades
were stitched into clothes,

443
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,480
during the washing process
in the Laundry Bureau,

444
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,800
Prince Yun

445
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,960
sent his suicide squad

446
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,880
to put poison into the washing water.

447
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,240
You criminal,
you're talking nonsense!

448
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,600
I knew that you'd never
admit without evidence.

449
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,200
Rushuang.

450
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,560
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

451
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,480
Eunuch Li.

452
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,440
This is

453
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,720
the confession letter from

454
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,160
the suicide squad sent by Prince Yun.

455
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
This letter has recorded

456
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,800
the process of Prince Yun putting
poison in the washing water.

457
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:23,848
(Confession letter from the suicide squad)

458
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,320
So, who instructed you to kill

459
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,400
kill the late emperor?

460
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,480
It was Prince Yun.

461
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,440
He instructed me

462
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
to poison the laundry water.

463
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,320
You must have thought that
your suicide squad was dead.

464
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,440
But you can never
take everything into account.

465
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
She was lucky enough to escape

466
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,280
and lived secretly for seven years

467
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,120
just to prove your crime back then.

468
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,160
Nonsense!

469
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,760
You're not qualified to
stay in the Mingjing Office.

470
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
With mere a confession letter,

471
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,480
do you think you can frame me and
accuse me of killing the late emperor?

472
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,320
You denied that your maid
poisoned the witnesses.

473
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,640
You also said that the confession
letter written by your suicide squad

474
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,160
was fake.

475
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,560
Speaking about fake,

476
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,040
the conspiracy letter that accused

477
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
we Bai Liang Clan was fake!

478
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,040
The handwriting was so familiar.

479
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,200
It's written by Lei Zheng.

480
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,680
What's on the letter?

481
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,360
Lei Zheng?

482
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,160
This is the treason letter

483
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,400
of Bai Liang Clan with Fan Yan Na.

484
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,280
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

485
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,200
After the late emperor passed away,

486
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
Prince Yun asked Lei Zheng
to fake a conspiracy letter

487
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,880
and framed the Bai Liang Clan chief.

488
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,200
Then, Lei Zheng requested the
previous Minister of War, Liang Feng

489
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
to find a student
who was good at imitating handwriting.

490
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Finally, they found Li Mu in Qifu Town.

491
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,520
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

492
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,600
This is the proof left by Li Mu.

493
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,120
You're a devil from Bai Liang Clan,
you're still trying to frame me!

494
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,600
Prince Yun, shut up!

495
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:28,084
(Fake conspiracy letter)

496
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,440
Su Ci,

497
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,120
I would like you

498
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,960
to tell me all the truth
about this incident.

499
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,280
Yes, Your Highness.

500
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,680
Prince Yun put the poison onto
the Bai Liang Brocade back then.

501
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,400
The poison that he put
was a kind of chronic poison.

502
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,240
Therefore, it wouldn't put the late
emperor to death immediately.

503
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,040
The poison only caused
the body to be weak.

504
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,800
No wonder before the
late emperor passed away,

505
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,960
he's growing weaker and weaker.

506
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,360
But Prince Yun

507
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,680
knew Your Highness was

508
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,280
searching a  tonic for the late emperor.

509
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Therefore, he mixed the catalyst

510
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,640
of this poison into the tonic

511
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,320
and offered to Your Highness.

512
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,400
After the late emperor ate the tonic,

513
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,920
the poison in his body
became more effective

514
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,400
and

515
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,400
he died immediately.

516
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,160
It turns out to be...

517
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,680
It turns out to be I...

518
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,080
It turns out to be I was the one who
caused the death of the late emperor.

519
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,560
Mother.

520
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,800
Maids.
Send her to rest.

521
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,520
Yes.

522
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,880
Late emperor...

523
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,720
Late emperor...

524
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,160
Late emperor...

525
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,160
That's so treacherous.

526
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,320
Your Majesty,

527
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,000
everything that Su Ci said just now

528
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,200
was just to frame me.

529
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,160
Prince Qi and Su Ci intended
to conspire against you.

530
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,840
I destroyed their plan.

531
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,800
Therefore, they frame me.

532
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,680
Your Majesty, I'm telling the truth.

533
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,000
You are going to die soon and
yet you still dare to quibble here!

534
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,880
After the late emperor passed away,

535
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,560
you formed alliance
with the enemies

536
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,960
and started wars.

537
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,520
You commanded the former
Minister of War, Liang Feng

538
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,200
to break the bridges

539
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,360
during the war between
our army and Fan Yan Na,

540
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,000
so that we couldn't get support on time.

541
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,600
This is the blood letter

542
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,640
left by General Zhang Yuhua
before he passed away.

543
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,680
While he and a few thousands of soldiers
from Liang Dynasty were fighting the enemy,

544
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,680
you trapped them in
Honggu until they died.

545
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,120
So it is.

546
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,120
They'd never spare you

547
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,160
even if they died.

548
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,920
Your Highness.

549
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,280
Your Highness.

550
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,200
Treason is a serious offense,

551
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,760
if you don't have solid evidence,

552
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,320
you'll have to bear the
responsibility of framing the officials.

553
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,400
Solid evidence?

554
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,960
In a while,

555
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,280
he will show the evidence

556
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,640
to everyone.

557
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,080
What happened?

558
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,200
What happened?

559
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
Is it the sound of shouting and killing?

560
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:41,661
(West Gate)

561
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,800
What happened?

562
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,520
Let me tell all of you.

563
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,800
My army has surrounded the palace.

564
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,760
You're deceiving the
emperor and being rebellious.

565
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,560
He's treacherous!

566
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,560
Even though you've found out the truth now,

567
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,040
there's nothing you can do.

568
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,760
Prince Yun,

569
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,280
How dare you rebel!

570
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,920
Nephew,

571
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,240
I just want to get back my own thing.

572
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,760
Uncle,

573
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,360
aren't you afraid that your
name will be blackened forever?

574
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,160
Blackened?

575
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,320
Who will blacken my name?

576
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,720
After tonight,

577
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,960
It's me

578
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,440
who decide the history.

579
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,920
Prince Yun, how dare you!

580
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,880
Yes.

581
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,760
This...

582
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,600
This...

583
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,520
This...

584
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,120
Everyone, listen!

585
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,040
You still have chance

586
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
to surrender now.

587
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,760
You have been planning

588
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,840
for this conspiracy plan for some time.

589
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,840
You're right.

590
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,320
The reason I killed the late
emperor seven years ago

591
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,720
was to become the emperor.

592
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,560
But, the last emperor was well prepared.

593
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,400
He passed the tiger tally to Xiao Yanzhi.

594
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,840
Otherwise,

595
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,400
how could all of you survive until today.

596
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,240
Over the years, you're
wary of Prince Qi,

597
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
you weakened his military power,

598
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,920
and you pushed down
the old officials on purpose.

599
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,160
You made me surrender to you

600
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,840
and listen to your command.

601
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,480
Xiao Yanzhi should have died

602
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,720
at the Honggu battlefield.

603
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,120
But you came back alive.

604
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,520
Yes.

605
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,880
Because today,

606
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,280
I will avenge for the dead,

607
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,880
those in the Honggu Battle,

608
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,960
those innocent

609
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,000
Bai Liang Clan members,,

610
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,960
and others who died

611
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,000
because of your conspiracy.

612
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,280
I'll fight for their justice.

613
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,840
Those lives were nothing

614
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,640
during my journey to success.

615
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,880
You're lucky

616
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,840
to live until today.

617
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,440
Shut up!

618
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,520
You shut up!

619
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,480
Nephew,

620
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,440
you're such a young emperor.

621
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,200
You should just be a puppet.

622
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,520
Then, I don't have to waste so
many efforts to go against you.

623
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,880
You've been more and more
disobedient in these two years.

624
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,000
That's why you used
the disaster relief fund

625
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,720
to buy your private horses
and feed your soldiers.

626
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,120
Because you don't
deserve to be at the position.

627
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,120
I

628
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,600
am the future of Liang Dynasty.

629
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,360
This...

630
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,680
Ming, you're coming.

631
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,640
Xie Beiming, how come you...

632
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,020
Stop!

633
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,900
Who are you?

634
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,540
Su Ci from Mingjing Office.
Urgent mater. I need to enter the city.

635
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,140
Open the door!

636
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,740
