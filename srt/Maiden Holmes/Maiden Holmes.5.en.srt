(Episode 5)

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,360
Little Fei Yuan,

16
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,680
your cooking is delicious.

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,440
Right?

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm glad that you like it.

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
It's very delicious.

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,320
Brother Pei, where did you find this guy?

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,840
Can you lend him to me for a few days?

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,720
You wish.

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm just joking.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,080
There's a scent of wine in this dish.

25
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,120
This dish is called drunken chicken.

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,240
That's mine.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Are you alright?

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,720
Here, drink some water.

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,080
Brother Su,

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,480
are you alright?

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm fine.

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,840
That's great then!

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,320
Let's have another cup.

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,240
Here.

35
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Just a little.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,840
Alright.

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,800
I'll fill my cup too.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,400
To express my sincerity,

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,360
I'll down it first.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
Xie...

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
Brother Su, you're a good drinker.

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,240
That's enough.

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,200
Here, I'll fill another cup.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,080
Drink some wine.

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,480
I'll fill mine to the brim too.

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,480
Come, Brother Su.

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,560
Brother Su.

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,000
Brother Su,

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
are you alright?

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,520
Young Master,

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,400
is Detective Su drunk?

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm not drunk.

53
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,720
Brother Su.

54
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,400
Where are Rushuang and Brother Xie?

55
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,600
They've gone upstairs to rest.

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
We'll send you to your room.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,720
Alright.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
Come, Fei Yuan. Hold him up.

59
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,640
Alright.

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,480
Brother Su, what's the matter?

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,040
This...

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm stuck to the chair.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm stuck to the chair!

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,240
Why am I stuck?

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,880
Alright, Brother Su.

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,760
You're drunk.

67
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,120
I'll send you to your room, alright?

68
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,120
Brother Pei,

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,560
I've been thinking to ask you a question.

70
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,800
Go ahead.

71
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,920
Have you drunk wine with Prince Qi?

72
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
I think so.

73
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
I envy you.

74
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,800
Detective Su,

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,240
actually, it's not that difficult

76
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,600
to meet Prince Qi.

77
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,800
Really?

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,680
Fei Yuan,

79
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,560
let me tell you.

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,200
Thanks for your help this time.

81
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,000
Fei Yuan is a lad.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,680
Thank you.

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,840
You'd better bother me.

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
The drunk Detective Su looks scary.

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,360
I'll leave him to you.

86
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm leaving.

87
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,480
I've got another question.

88
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,720
Go ahead.

89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,440
One, two, three, four.

90
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,880
Which one is you?

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,480
I'm here.

92
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,120
Look carefully.

93
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,440
Alright, I'll send you to your room.

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,040
What's the weapon Prince Qi used

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,280
in war?

96
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,880
-What's his favourite wine?
-Be careful.

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,280
I'll drink with him.

98
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,320
Over here.

99
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,120
This way.

100
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,120
This isn't your room.

101
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,840
This is my room.

102
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,920
Your room is over there.

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,640
Don't...

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,240
I don't need support.

105
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,360
I can walk on my own.

106
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Fine.

107
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,080
Walk a few steps then.

108
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,000
Walk a few steps.

109
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,520
Walk.

110
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Stand up.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Look, you're taking advantage of me this time.

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,760
I'm a real man.

113
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,720
I should be carefree.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,080
I won't sweat over trivial matters.

115
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,160
Alright.

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,240
I've reached.

117
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,880
I've reached my room.

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
I've reached my room.

119
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,280
Why does the room look weird?

120
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,040
Who moved my things?

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,080
Why is the room spinning?

122
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,400
Spinning.

123
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
The room isn't spinning. You're spinning.

124
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm not spinning.

125
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Stop spinning.

126
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,360
Brother Pei,

127
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,000
why do you keep spinning?

128
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm not spinning.

129
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,000
You're the one.

130
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,080
You're drunk.

131
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm not spinning.

132
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Come on. I'll send you to your room.

133
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm drunk.

134
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,040
Come on.

135
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm drunk.

136
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,160
I'm going to bed.

137
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
I'm going to bed.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's my bed!

139
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,760
Brother Su!

140
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,920
Brother Su, wake up quick.

141
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,080
I'll send you to your room.

142
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,240
Don't call me Brother Su.

143
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm obviously younger than you.

144
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,960
What should I call you then?

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Little Su?

146
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,760
This...

147
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,240
You can call me that.

148
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,480
That's it.

149
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,480
Alright, I'll send you to your room.

150
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,480
Brother Pei,

151
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,400
please

152
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
stop spinning.

153
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,880
Brother Su,

154
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,280
I want to let you in on a secret.

155
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,720
What's

156
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
the secret?

157
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,600
Actually, you've always been

158
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,520
a good man.

159
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,320
You...

160
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Stop moving.

161
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,320
Let's sleep.

162
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
Little Su, wake up.

163
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,760
It's so hot.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,559
It's so hot.

165
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,360
It's so hot.

166
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,840
It's cool.

167
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,400
It's cool.

168
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,520
It seems like

169
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,960
when you're awake,

170
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,880
I'll be reprimanded for being a rogue again.

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,520
Brother Pei,

172
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,840
do I have

173
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,720
any chance to...?

174
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,200
It's so cool.

175
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,040
I must have been out of my mind.

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,720
It's so embarrassing.

177
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,880
No.

178
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,400
Since the official silver has been found,

179
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,960
I can't stay here any longer.

180
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,680
I must return to the capital to report it.

181
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,640
This isn't right.

182
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,960
Why do I look like I'm running away?

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm disguised as a man now.

184
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,320
Why should I run away?

185
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
No.

186
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,240
I'll just do it.

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,040
What?

188
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
He left just like that?

189
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,680
Brother Su didn't even bid us farewell.

190
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,040
That's so ungentleman.

191
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,960
That's right.

192
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,520
Didn't we drink together last night?

193
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,760
Brother Pei,

194
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,760
aren't you close to Brother Su?

195
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Did he say why he left?

196
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,520
I guess he returns to the capital.

197
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,440
Return to the capital?

198
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,480
No.

199
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,160
I must find Brother Su.

200
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,920
Rushuang,

201
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,720
didn't you agree

202
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,240
to return to Feiyun Manor with me?

203
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,360
Why do you want to find him?

204
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,680
Rushuang!

205
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,080
Pack up.

206
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,000
We'll return to the capital.

Alright.

221
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,680
Stabilize them.

222
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,640
We're finally here.

223
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,160
Boss, 3 guest rooms please.

224
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm so sorry.

225
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,320
We only have 1 room left.

226
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,400
Boss.

227
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,960
It's not about money.

228
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,640
Even if you pay more,

229
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,920
I can do nothing to help.

230
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,680
There's only 1 room left.

231
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,680
Didn't you notice

232
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,040
there's a lady with us?

233
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,920
Brother Xie, don't make it difficult for him.

234
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,400
We'll look for another inn.

235
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,400
My guests,

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,720
I have to remind you.

237
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,440
Within 10 miles,

238
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,800
there are no other inns available.

239
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,520
We're the only one here.

240
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,600
Why don't you make do for a night?

241
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,640
You call this as a make do?

242
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,200
No.

243
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,160
It's fine.

244
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,080
We're all in the Jianghu.

245
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,240
It's not a big deal.

246
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,880
Furthermore, we're friends.

247
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,000
I trust you.

248
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
We'll make do for a night then.

249
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
So please sleep with your clothes on.

250
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,160
No.

251
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,680
Rushuang trusts you jerks

252
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
but I don't.

253
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,560
Brother Xie,

254
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,160
aren't you a jerk too?

255
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
I...

256
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,520
I'm different.

257
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,160
Boss, where do you live?

258
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,000
I live in my own room of course.

259
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,280
What about this?

260
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,680
Since we're going to make do,

261
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,040
why don't you do us the kindness?

262
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,280
Rent us your room.

263
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,800
You'll sleep with your worker.

264
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,120
You're right.

265
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,760
I'll clean up the room for this lady.

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Wait.

267
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,440
Boss,

268
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,400
why not you agree to another request?

269
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,960
Rent us your worker's room too.

270
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,280
Young Master,

271
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,880
why do you need another room?

272
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,520
This is really impossible.

273
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,920
So, look. This...

274
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
Let's go.

275
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,600
Alright.

276
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,200
Three of us will make do for a night.

277
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,240
Sounds good.

278
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,920
We'll sleep together.

279
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,840
Let's go.

280
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,080
Little Su,

281
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
why are you so late?

282
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,480
There are no other inns within 10 miles.

283
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,720
Do you want to sleep on the street tonight?

284
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,480
I'll depart now.

285
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,560
Make it quick.

286
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,240
Alright.

287
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,840
Boss,

288
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,120
please give me a room.

289
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
It's fully booked.

290
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,240
That's right.

291
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,320
We don't have any room left.

292
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,920
Looks like we'll sleep together again.

293
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,920
Who wants to sleep with you?

294
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,200
Brother Su!

295
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,840
We plan to find you in the capital.

296
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,400
We didn't expect to run into you here.

297
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,079
What a fate that both of us meet again.

298
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,160
I...

299
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,599
What the fate?

300
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,480
Brother Su,

301
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,720
you're so ungrateful.

302
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,319
Why did you leave without bidding goodbye?

303
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,599
I...

304
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,160
I was assigned to Qingshui County

305
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,599
to investigate the Robbery by Dragon King.

306
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,720
The case is now closed.

307
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,760
I have to return to the capital to report it.

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm sorry for leaving

309
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
without saying goodbye.

310
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,560
Detective Su,

311
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,120
we thought you were avoiding us on purpose.

312
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,560
Why would I?

313
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,200
We're friends.

314
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,760
Why would I avoid you?

315
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,760
Young Master,

316
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,120
is Detective Su

317
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,040
staying with us tonight?

318
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,800
I've extended my invitation

319
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,320
but he didn't agree to it.

320
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,320
I...

321
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,080
Brother Su,

322
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,440
why do you hesitate?

323
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
There's only 1 room.

324
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,440
The four of us

325
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,800
will just make do.

326
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,120
That's right.

327
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
Alright.

328
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,280
What a small bed.

329
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Brother Pei, it's just a night.

330
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,280
We'll just make do.

331
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,680
I'll go to bed now.

332
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,400
Then, I'll...

333
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,960
Will Rushuang feel afraid

334
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,720
being in the room alone?

335
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,840
Come.

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
Two of you lean over to that side.

337
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,760
Lean over to that side.

338
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Young Master, you...

339
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,880
Why do you need

340
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
such a big space for 2 persons?

341
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
Fei Yuan moves a lot when sleeping.

342
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,160
I don't want to be kicked.

343
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,360
Young Master,

344
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,760
I sleep like a log.

345
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,320
You are as what I say.

346
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Alright then.

347
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,920
As you like it.

348
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,880
Anyway, I'll listen to Young Master.

349
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,920
Brother Xie,

350
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,360
don't kick me when you're asleep.

351
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,400
Don't worry.

352
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,840
I don't kick or snatch the quilt.

353
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Sleep well.

354
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,760
Brother Xie,

355
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,440
it's a little cold here.

356
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
It's better to sleep in your clothes.

357
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,920
It's fine. I don't feel cold.

358
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,000
It's quite cold.

359
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,040
If you fall sick,

360
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,880
Miss Rushuang might be angry.

361
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,800
You're right, Brother Pei.

362
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,080
I'll sleep

363
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,560
in my clothes then.

364
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,960
You're running a fever.

365
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,720
He should feel better

366
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,200
after taking the medicine.

367
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,240
Rushuang,

368
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,200
can you check if I'm running a fever?

369
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,040
You're fine.

370
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,800
How can it be, Rushuang?

371
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,840
I feel

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,520
dizzy

373
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
and I'm shivering.

374
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,040
Rushuang,

375
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,280
make me some medicine too.

376
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,280
Why do you want to take medicine?

377
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,800
Will you make me medicine

378
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,240
if I fall sick?

379
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Of course.

380
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,920
Will you feed me the medicine?

381
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
You have your arms and hands.

382
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,960
Why should I feed you medicine?

383
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,080
You fed Brother Su medicine.

384
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
That's different.

385
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,200
That's Brother Su.

386
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,320
Su...

387
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,800
Why are we different, Rushuang?

388
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,680
Rushuang, tell me.

389
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,520
What's the difference?

390
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,960
Why is he different?

391
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,760
Why hasn't he recovered?

392
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,240
Brother Pei,

393
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,040
how's Brother Su?

394
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,680
He's still running a fever.

395
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Why has it turned worst?

396
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,280
Has he caught some disease?

397
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
What do you mean?

398
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,280
Diseases usually break out after disasters.

399
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,120
We've stayed in Qingshui County for some time.

400
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,920
And Brother Su has caught a cold.

401
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,320
I don't know either.

402
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
It's hard to diagnose at the early stage.

403
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,800
What should we do now?

404
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,680
Break the fever.

405
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,080
He would get worse if fever continues.

406
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,520
Brother Xie,

407
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
pour some wine into a basin

408
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,800
and bring it over.

409
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,560
Alright.

410
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,560
Rushuang,

411
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
here's the wine.

412
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,840
Please leave the room.

413
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,800
What do you want to do?

414
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,400
Wiping the body with wine
can bring down the fever.

415
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,040
I'll do it for Brother Su.

416
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,960
No.

417
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,680
I can't let Rushuang know about

418
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,440
Little Su's disguise.

419
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,720
I'll do it.

420
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,920
Please leave the room.

421
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
Can you make it?

422
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,160
Rushuang,

423
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,360
Brother Pei is the best person.

424
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,840
You're a lady. Brother Su is a man.

425
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,680
It's improper.

426
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,960
But I...

427
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
The longer you delay,

428
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,800
the more dangerous Brother Su's life will be.

429
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,400
Then I'll leave it to you.

430
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,520
Wait.

431
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,680
Will Young Master be in danger?

432
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
I heard that disease is contagious.

433
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,280
Don't worry, Fei Yuan.

434
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,880
I'll cook the herbs.

435
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,240
But Young Master...

436
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Little Fei Yuan, don't worry.

437
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,400
Your Young Master will be fine.

438
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,040
-Let's leave.
-But...

439
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,840
Young Master.

440
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,680
Let's leave.

441
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,880
Cover your face.

442
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Let's go.

443
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,200
Don't move.

444
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,680
Don't move.

445
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,360
I'm alone here.

446
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,800
Don't worry.

447
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,000
No one will know about your secret.

448
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
You're unconscious.

449
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,440
Don't hurt yourself.

450
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,320
Little Fei Yuan.

451
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,640
Brother Xie.

452
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,800
What's that?

453
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,240
Look!

454
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,680
Brother Xie,

455
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,760
what are you doing?

456
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,560
This is for Young Master and Detective Su

457
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,840
to supplement nutrients.

458
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,040
Little Fei Yuan,

459
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
I can let you have anything

460
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,200
but not this treasure.

461
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,440
Why?

462
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,960
Because it's mine.

463
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,640
No.

464
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,400
Can't you be more cautious?

465
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,960
Don't let anyone take you as a meal again.

466
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,240
Adoptive father,

467
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,600
I hope this letter finds you well.

468
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,320
I miss you very much too.

469
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,680
We're on the way back to the capital.

470
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,120
But my friend has fallen sick.

471
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,160
We might be delayed for a day or two.

472
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,080
The fever is finally remitted.

473
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,920
Give it to me.

474
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,160
Here you go.

475
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,920
Fei Yuan,

476
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,280
thank you for making me the medicine.

477
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,400
Don't mention it.

478
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,480
But Detective Su,

479
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,440
you made us worried sick.

480
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,160
I'm sorry

481
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,200
for making everyone worry about me.

482
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,480
Brother Su, don't say that.

483
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,360
We are...

484
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,280
Brother Su,

485
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,120
we're friends.

486
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,600
It's what we should do.

487
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Speaking of worry,

488
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,720
it's Brother Pei who worried about you the most.

489
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,880
That's right.

490
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,160
My Young Master has been anxious
for a whole day.

491
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,120
He even had no time to eat.

492
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,800
As long as you've recovered,

493
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,440
it's worth it.

494
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,760
Brother Pei,

495
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,040
when did you start calling him Little Su?

496
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,720
He's recovering.

497
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,840
He needs to take a good rest.

498
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,480
We'll need to hit the road tomorrow.

499
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,160
Let's go.

500
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,000
Then,

501
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,680
Brother Su, rest well.

502
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,920
You haven't answered me.

503
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,600
When did you start calling him Little Su?

504
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,200
Why do you call him Little Su?

505
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,320
Little Su?

506
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,040
What a mushy nickname.

507
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,720
It's fine when you get used to it.

508
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,400
-Little Su.
-Hey!

509
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,680
Don't be so noisy.

510
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,120
You'll disturb Brother Su.

511
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,600
The capital is big.

512
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,080
I guess I won't run into Brother Pei.

513
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,360
It's good then.

514
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,200
Brother Su,

515
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,320
it's my first time to the capital.

516
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,080
I don't know how it looks like.

517
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,120
The capital

518
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,600
is a bustling city.

519
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,320
I see.

520
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,160
Your Majesty,

521
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,720
Prince Qi has returned.

522
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Invite him in.

523
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,520
Understood.

524
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,080
Your Majesty.

525
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,520
Don't stand on ceremony, my royal brother.

526
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,920
Eunuch Li,

527
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,240
you may leave us.

528
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,440
Understood.

529
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,880
Any progress with the disaster relief fund case?

530
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,040
It's so beautiful.

531
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,000
Xie Beiming!

532
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,880
Xie Beiming, stop the horse cart.

533
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,880
So, this is the capital.

534
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,280
It looks great.

535
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,360
Brother Su.

536
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,640
Show me around.

537
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,440
I've got much work to do at Mingjing Office.

538
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
I might not have the time.

539
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,120
Let Brother Xie go with you.

540
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,840
That's right, Rushuang.

541
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,400
I'm familiar with everything

542
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,520
in the capital.

543
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,520
I'll show you around.

544
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,760
Alright.

545
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,840
Let's get in.

546
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,640
Let's go.

547
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,040
Sounds like the mastermind behind
is a big person.

548
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,800
We must be on our guard.

549
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,320
I've contacted the Marquis for assistance.

550
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,160
Have you already had any clue?

551
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,320
It's a conjecture.

552
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,880
It's not verified.

553
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,000
Your Majesty, please excuse me.

554
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,120
Royal brother.

555
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,880
Do you think this is the reason

556
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,480
I call for you urgently?

557
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I've a big news to announce.

558
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,080
I'm all ears.

559
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,720
Queen Mother is concerned

560
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,440
about your marriage.

561
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,680
Thank you Empress Dowager for the concern.

562
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,920
Her Highness has informed the Ministry of Rites

563
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,080
to choose a good date for concubine selection.

564
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,680
To be honest,

565
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,320
I hope you'll find the one you like,

566
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,000
who will spend her life with you.

567
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
There are many delicacies here.

568
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,360
But the most delicious ones

569
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,760
aren't at the restaurants.

570
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,880
Only the locals know about it.

571
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,600
There's a shop

572
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,200
with a tiny door.

573
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,640
But its roasted ducks

574
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,200
taste heavenly.

575
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
Its fragrance spreads widely.

576
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,960
There's a long queue every day.

577
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,760
There's also a biscuit shop.

578
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,680
Its biscuits

579
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,520
are a little burnt on the outside

580
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
but are soft inside.

581
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,760
When you bite it,

582
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,960
it's delicious.

583
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,240
There's also a dimsum shop.

584
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,800
It offers varieties of dimsum.

585
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Dingsheng cake,

586
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,040
green bean cake

587
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,040
and osmanthus cake.

588
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,600
Help!

589
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,880
Let go of me!

590
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,760
Let go!

591
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,720
Help!

592
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,000
Stop!

593
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,480
How dare you stir up troubles

594
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,720
on His Majesty's land?

595
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,920
Who are you?

596
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,880
I'm Su Ci of Mingjing Office.

597
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Let go of the lady.

598
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,280
I don't care where you are from.

599
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,120
Hit him.

600
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,200
You've overestimated your strength.

601
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,560
How dare you

602
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,360
ruin our master's plan?

603
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,960
You don't want to live any longer!

604
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,280
Do you want to bet?

605
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,240
Let's see who'll perish first.

606
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,080
Let's go.

607
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,440
Get lost!

608
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,960
You wait and see!

609
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,800
Rushuang,

610
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,120
they've been...

611
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,360
Brother Su, are you alright?

612
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,760
Are you injured?

613
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,640
I'm fine.

614
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
That's good.

615
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,440
Rushuang,

616
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,600
I was the one who fought them.

617
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,240
You're highly skilled in martial arts.

618
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
What's so great with that?

619
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,800
Brother Su has average

620
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,880
martial arts skills,

621
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
but he protected me from danger.

622
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,200
Let's head into the capital.

623
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,400
Brother Su.

624
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,520
When will you see the good in me?

625
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,720
Mingjing Office.

626
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,560
What's so great about it?

627
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,520
Father, mother.

628
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,960
I encountered many events on this trip,

629
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,239
including dangerous situations several times.

630
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,320
Luckily, I've befriended some new friends.

631
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,000
Miss Rushuang is kind and smart.

632
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,280
She knows healing skills.

633
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,960
Brother Xie

634
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,000
is simple and excellent in martial arts.

635
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,920
Fei Yuan is energetic, cute

636
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,880
and cooks well.

637
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,440
Brother Pei...

638
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,000
Brother Pei

639
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,440
is a good man.

640
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,320
Queen Mother is concerned

641
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,920
about your marriage.

642
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,200
For real men, career should come before family.

643
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,960
Royal brother,

644
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
don't fool me with these principles.

645
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,600
Royal brother,

646
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,920
has someone caught your heart?

647
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,152
♪ Let my future life write your destiny. ♪

648
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:32,034
♪ And be led astray. ♪

00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:37,841
♪ Forgive my affectionate intention ♪

650
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,354
♪ to prove that everything's hard-won. ♪

651
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,200
I want to become like him.

652
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,400
Courageous.

653
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,240
Strong.

654
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,800
Live with heart.

655
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,760
Actually,

656
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,640
you've always been

657
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,880
a good man.

658
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,600
It's cooling.

659
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,360
I've never had one before.

660
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,480
But I have it now.

661
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,380
Come in.

662
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,860
You're here.

663
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,060
Rushuang. Here.

664
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,580
You found it? That's quick.

665
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,180
Of course.

666
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,180
You may look for me
if you need anything in the future.

667
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
Thank you Brother Xie.

668
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,780
It's so complete?

669
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,900
Of course.

670
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,980
I'll definitely complete

671
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,260
what Sister Rushuang wants me to do.

672
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,100
It's so great to have these.

673
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,540
I can help Brother Su then.

674
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,380
If I had these earlier,

675
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,500
I might have found

676
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,140
what's wrong with the corpse this morning.

677
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,140
Brother Xie.

678
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,380
Brother Xie,

679
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,700
I'd like to ask you something.

680
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,340
What kind of girl does Brother Su like?

681
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,020
Rushuang, I'm a little hungry.

682
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,500
I'll get something to eat.

683
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,900
Thanks anyway.

684
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,420
Brother Su. Brother Su.

685
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,300
