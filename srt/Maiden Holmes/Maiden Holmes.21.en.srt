00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,868
(Episode 21)

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,760
That's good then.

16
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,440
Go prepare for it.

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,800
Bury my father the soonest possible.

18
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Young Master,

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
this is against the custom.

20
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,240
I call the shot in the Liang family.

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Someone's here.

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,800
Where did the old man

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
hide it?

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Is it still on him?

25
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
Why does Liang Cheng

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,320
want to bury Liang Feng in a hurry?

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,800
He stopped me from opening the coffin.

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,080
He's so anxious about the burial now.

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,920
He might be the one who killed Liang Feng.

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Afraid that you'll find evidence
in the coffin.

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,040
But

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,160
he returned only after Liang Feng's death.

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
We were there too.

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
I had a look just now.

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,680
There are

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,400
traces of turmeric on his horse's hooves.

37
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,120
But it had been raining since noon.

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
How did the turmeric get on the horse?

39
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,160
This is a clue.

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,560
No matter what,

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,520
let's find a way to open the coffin.

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,320
It's obvious that Liang Cheng

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,520
is searching for something
hidden by Liang Feng.

44
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,920
He looks very concern.

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
Perhaps we could make use of his concern.

46
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,680
What do you mean?

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,240
I want to make Liang Cheng

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,200
open the coffin for us personally.

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,000
Brother Su,

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,960
here's the stuff you want.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,480
I've brought it over for you.

52
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,680
Is it made from dark steel?

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,200
I've tried it.

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,080
Besides the key,

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,720
you won't be able to slash it open

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,800
with knife and sword.

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,960
That's great.

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you, Brother Xie.

59
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,800
Don't mention it.

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,720
Can this really work?

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,440
We'll depend on the two of you next.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Heroine Rushuang,

63
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,960
it's our showtime.

64
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,040
Take this quick.

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,840
I can't do this.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,520
I really can't.

67
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,480
What do you mean?

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Tell Liang Cheng that

69
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
you found this from his father's remains.

70
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
There are treasures inside.

71
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,920
Take it quick.

72
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,720
I can't lie to my Young Master.

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,839
How can you call this as lying?

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
You're just helping.

75
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,760
As long as you help us,

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
the money

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
will be yours.

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,440
I can't betray the Liang family.

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,640
You... I...

80
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,520
Look.

81
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
I've said this trick won't work.

82
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,120
Admit your defeat.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Let's do it.

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,920
Butler.

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,640
What are you doing?

86
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,960
What did you just feed me with?

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,160
Poison.

88
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
If you don't help us,

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,760
you'll bleed to death tomorrow.

90
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,200
Are you trying to scare me?

91
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,240
Do you think it's candy,

92
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,360
something that

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,600
a lady like you can get easily?

94
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,960
Did you see this?

95
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,120
Look there.

96
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,880
Did you see it?

97
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,160
I understand that you're loyal

98
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,440
to the Liang family.

99
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,560
You may reunite

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,880
with your old master tomorrow.

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,400
Let's go.

102
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,080
Miss, please don't leave.

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,920
I promise you.

104
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,400
That's more like it.

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,960
Here, take it.

106
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
Where's the antidote?

107
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,880
I'll give it to you
after you've done the task.

108
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,280
What if you refuse then?

109
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,800
Do you have other option

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,320
beside putting your trust on me?

111
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,480
Rushuang,

112
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,360
what poison did you feed him with?

113
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,240
What poison?

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
It's just a candy.

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
Why should I waste

116
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,440
such an expensive poison on a butler?

117
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
Rushuang, you're so smart.

118
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,360
This way,

119
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,280
we've saved the money

120
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
for the bribe and the poison.

121
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,360
Rushuang,

122
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
you can really make a living.

123
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,640
I need to talk with you.

124
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
You're just bribing a butler.

125
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Why do you need so much money?

126
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
If you continue to spend money lavishly,

127
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,480
you'll empty Feiyun Manor's fund
sooner or later.

128
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,400
It's fine.

129
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,720
I still have you to look out
for me, my Young Lady.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
Our Feiyun Manor will prosper.

131
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,120
This is yours.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,680
Knowing me is your treasure.

133
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,520
Let's not wait until this afternoon.

134
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,680
Let's look for Sister Su

135
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,440
and visit General Zhang's tomb.

136
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,240
Alright.

137
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,160
Let's go.

138
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,240
Rushuang,

139
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
let's find something to eat first.

140
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,120
I'm afraid you'll feel hungry on the road.

141
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,360
General Zhang Yuhua

142
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,120
is indeed a young hero.

143
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,120
He followed Prince Qi

144
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,160
and defeated
the enemy's 20,000 people army

145
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
with 3,000 cavalries in Kunshan.

146
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,080
It's a pity that he perished
in the Battle of Honggu.

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,360
Heard that when he died,

148
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,520
he stood on a pile of corpses

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,000
with his eyes closed.

150
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,760
What a pity.

151
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,760
General, a report from the frontline.

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,480
The trestle bridge
had been destroyed by flood.

153
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,680
The reinforcement can't reach us.

154
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
Inform General Zhang to join us.

155
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,320
General,

156
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,160
General Zhang's troop had been defeated.

157
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
The entire troop was wiped out.

158
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,920
What?

159
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,240
He has become a hero

160
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,360
but Miss Liang has become a widow.

161
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,800
Her father has passed away now.

162
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,760
Brother Pei,

163
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
what's the matter?

164
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:24,877
(Tomb of the loyal General Zhang Yuhua)

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Your Highness.

166
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,640
Sister-in-law.

167
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
Your Highness,

168
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,440
thank you for your concern all these years.

169
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,920
If my late husband knows about it,

170
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,120
he'll feel comforted.

171
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
General Zhang

172
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,600
had sacrificed himself for the country.

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,840
Sister-in-law, please take care.

174
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,200
But I would rather that

175
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,920
he wasn't so noble.

176
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,200
Sister-in-law.

177
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,040
My late husband lost his life
for the country.

178
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,080
But the others

179
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,760
stepped on his bones

180
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,840
to survive

181
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,920
and enjoy the glory and wealth.

182
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,360
Forget it.

183
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,920
Your Highness,

184
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,000
Detective Su,

185
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,120
thank you for visiting my late husband.

186
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,120
It's getting late.

187
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,480
Do head downhill earlier.

188
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,240
Miss,

189
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
did you touch the flowers?

190
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,880
I won't put the flowers there
if I knew earlier.

191
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,920
What did her maid rub on her hand?

192
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,360
It's a specially-made medicinal powder

193
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,600
for itches.

194
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,280
It can be used
to make perfume satchel too.

195
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:10,569
(Liang Mansion)

196
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,920
Why are you here?

197
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,000
Get out!

198
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,400
Get off!

199
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,080
Guards!

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,280
Are you looking for the key of the box?

201
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,160
Guards!

202
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,040
Young Master.

203
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,200
Drive them off!

204
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:39,920
How dare you?

205
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,080
Rushuang, let's get started.

206
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
Fei Yuan, good job.

207
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,920
Father,

208
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,680
I'm not filial.

209
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
Officer Liang, don't be grief-stricken.

210
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,000
By finding the truth,
Old Master Liang may rest in peace.

211
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Did you find anything?

212
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,240
There are 3 punch marks here.

213
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,600
They are different in shapes.

214
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,760
And over here,

215
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,400
there's a crescent-shaped scar.

216
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
There's indeed a bruise.

217
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,720
Could it be something from the murderer?

218
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,120
Judging from the dissipation degree
of the bruise,

219
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,480
it should have been left by the murderer.

220
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,280
Judging from the location
of bruises and wounds,

221
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,480
it might be a mark

222
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,720
from the murderer's finger accessory.

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,480
Liang Cheng,

224
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,920
you're suspected of
killing your father Liang Feng.

225
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,680
Please follow us to the County Office.

226
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,200
Su Ci,

227
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,880
are you out of your mind?

228
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,200
This is my father.

229
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,160
How could I kill my own father?

230
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,880
Really?

231
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,360
May I ask Officer Liang,

232
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
when did you arrive home
at Liang Mansion?

233
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,280
You were there too

234
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,320
when I arrived home.

235
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,440
Alright.

236
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,000
It's good that you remember it.

237
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,800
Fei Yuan, go and lead the horse over.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,880
Understood.

239
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,960
There are traces of turmeric
on its hooves.

240
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,320
The medicinal herb growers
have been drying turmeric around the city.

241
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,480
The horse might have brushed against it.

242
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Is there anything wrong with it?

243
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,240
But it rained heavily
on the day you returned.

244
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,400
The medicinal herbs have been gathered in.

245
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,120
Why are there turmeric traces

246
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,040
on your horse then?

247
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,480
So many days have passed.

248
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,960
No one can say for sure

249
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,200
about this.

250
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,400
But it has been raining these few days.

251
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,280
The only sunny day was on the day
Old Master Liang died.

252
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,400
I've checked with the horsekeeper.

253
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,880
This horse has injured his leg.

254
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,680
It has been in the mansion
in the past few days.

255
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,800
I did return one day earlier

256
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,040
to deal with the manor's affairs.

257
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,960
I didn't make it home.

258
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,720
So what?

259
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,280
Why did you lie?

260
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,320
Su Ci,

261
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm warning you.

262
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,520
Please present concrete evidence

263
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,120
when convicting a court official.

264
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,600
The cause of death is the wound
on the right forehead.

265
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,400
It can now be confirmed that

266
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,880
the murderer is left-handed.

267
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,000
Officer Liang,

268
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,240
so you're left-handed.

269
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,600
There's a crescent-shaped scar

270
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,560
on the deceased's right forehead.

271
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,080
Officer Liang,

272
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,200
you're no stranger to this thumb ring.

273
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,200
The traces of blood on it

274
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,000
must be of the murderer.

275
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,520
He must have been too flustered
that he didn't clean it properly.

276
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,800
May I have a look at your left hand?

277
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,640
Raise your hand!

278
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,040
Raise your hand!

279
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,320
Raise it!

280
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,000
Quick!

281
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,040
There will be difference in skin color

282
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,160
if you wear a ring all year long.

283
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,680
Officer Liang,

284
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,960
can you please explain

285
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
why your thumb ring

286
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,560
was stained by blood?

287
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,160
How did it end up on Old Master Liang?

288
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,800
I didn't intend to kill him.

289
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
I didn't intend to kill him.

290
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,560
I didn't intend to kill my father.

291
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,160
It was an accident.

292
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,480
It was an accident.

293
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,360
I didn't do it on purpose.

294
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,360
I didn't do it on purpose.

295
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,080
Guards!

296
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,720
I didn't do it on purpose.

297
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,440
Take him away!

298
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,080
I didn't

299
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,720
do it on purpose.

300
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,480
I didn't do it on purpose.

301
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,400
I didn't intend to kill him.

302
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,400
I didn't do it on purpose.

303
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,160
Let's head back to the mourning hall.

304
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,040
Miss.

305
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,200
Miss,

306
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,520
the antidote.

307
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,720
What antidote?

308
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,920
No!

309
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,320
Don't resort to force.

310
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,680
How can you break your promise?

311
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,800
That's just a candy.

312
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,280
Why do you need an antidote for?

313
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,920
I don't believe it.

314
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,400
It's true.

315
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,720
I don't want to waste my poison like that.

316
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,920
No.

317
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,920
Miss!

318
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,840
Miss!

319
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,800
Something bad has happened.

320
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,840
The Young Master

321
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,880
has been captured.

322
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,240
What?

323
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,200
Butler, what are these?

324
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,119
Old Master wore those clothes
when he died.

325
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,720
According to custom,

326
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,040
they must be burnt during the burial.

327
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,960
Why does the blood vivid red?

328
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,320
It looks like cinnabar.

329
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,160
Rushuang, look.

330
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
It looks like medicinal powder.

331
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,360
Are you able to tell what it is?

332
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,520
It smells like medicinal herbs.

333
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
It's angelica.

334
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,600
I can't detect the rest.

335
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,920
Here.

336
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,760
Butler,

337
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
did your old master have any illnesses?

338
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,840
What has my eldest brother done?

339
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,560
Why did you capture him?

340
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,200
Detective Su has found out that

341
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,640
your brother

342
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,080
killed Old Master Liang.

343
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Sister-in-law.

344
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,880
My condolences.

345
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,160
It's impossible.

346
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,040
He'll never do such a thing.

347
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,080
Detective Su,

348
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,880
have you mistaken?

349
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,280
Mrs. Zhang,

350
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,400
I'm sorry.

351
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,480
Miss.

352
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,720
Miss.

353
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,880
Miss.

354
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,200
Liang Cheng,

355
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,880
what really happened that day?

356
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,400
Please be honest.

357
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
That night,

358
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,320
I had an argument with my father.

359
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,000
You're such a disappointment!

360
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,960
I'll beat you to death!

361
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,040
I'll beat you to death!

362
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,320
Shut up!

363
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,120
Father.

364
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,960
Are you sure that

365
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
you only hit him once?

366
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,640
I'm sure.

367
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
It was really an accident.

368
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,040
He's my father after all.

369
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,920
Liang Cheng,

370
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,320
have a look at this.

371
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,900
(A Letter to Lei Zheng)

372
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,720
This...

373
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,280
This...

374
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,480
What does the past incident
in the letter referred to?

375
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,560
Your Highness,

376
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,440
this is a secret
between my father and Lord Lei.

377
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,680
I don't know anything about it.

378
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,800
Do you think I'll believe you?

379
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,880
I'm innocent, Your Highness.

380
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,320
I really don't know anything about it.

381
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,360
Liang Cheng,

382
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,480
you could kill your own father.

383
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,560
Of course you could refuse
to admit it too.

384
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,240
I've underestimated you.

385
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,200
I really have no idea.

386
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,400
I really have no idea.

387
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,960
Since you won't admit it
until you're faced with grim reality,

388
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,280
I'll fulfill your wish then.

389
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,040
I've all the time to interrogate you

390
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,760
in the imperial city.

391
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,200
My lord.

392
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,920
How did he locate the Liang Mansion?

393
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,600
Liang Cheng has been caught too.

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,840
He wants to reverse an old case

395
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,760
and investigate the Battle of Honggu.

396
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,000
My lord,

397
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,320
the Liang family has been close
to Lei Zheng lately.

398
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,280
Have Prince Qi found some clues

399
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
in Lei Zheng's case?

400
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,920
Didn't I tell you to root it out?

401
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,960
Please go there personally.

402
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,200
Root out the cause of the problem.

403
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,760
If Xiao Yanzhi

404
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,680
found any clues,

405
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,640
it'd be

406
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,840
a total defeat for me.

407
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,280
Do you remember the time when
we opened the coffin for autopsy?

408
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,040
We found 3 wounds
on Liang Feng's forehead.

409
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,480
Of course I remember.

410
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,880
But when we interrogated Liang Cheng,

411
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,080
he said

412
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,920
he only hit his father once.

413
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,560
Based on Liang Cheng's confession,

414
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,480
Liang Feng slipped
and hit the table corner.

415
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,400
This caused the first wound.

416
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,840
If Liang Cheng only hit him once,

417
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,200
there would only be 2 wounds.

418
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,160
Why was there a third wound then?

419
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,760
He had killed someone.

420
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,840
He'd be inevitably panicked.

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
His memory might have failed him.

422
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,680
What if there were

423
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,560
two murderers?

424
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,120
Rushuang,

425
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
what are the common herbs used
to make antipruritic powder?

426
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,440
The common herbs are angelica,
cocklebur and cinnabar.

427
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,960
Could it

428
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,400
really be her?

429
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,880
Let's go and ask again.

430
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,840
She might be hiding something.

431
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
Fei Yuan,
head to the government office at once

432
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,960
and borrow the bloody clothes.

433
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,960
Alright.

434
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Let's go.

435
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,160
Where are you going?

436
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,400
What does this mean?

437
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,280
Who's the murderer?

438
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
Stop asking. Keep up.

439
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,800
Miss,

440
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,280
Prince Qi is here.

441
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,440
Invite them in.

442
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,360
Understood.

443
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,040
This way, Your Highness.

444
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,720
Prepare the tea.

445
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
Understood.

446
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,480
Your Highness.

447
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,200
Mrs. Zhang,

448
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,160
we've few questions to inquire.

449
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,960
Detective Su,

450
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,560
you may go ahead.

451
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,840
May we have a look
at your perfume satchel?

452
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,480
It smells of dried rose root,
dried wolfberry root,

453
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,440
angelica, cocklebur

454
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,040
and cinnabar.

455
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,280
This is a medicine pouch
for treating skin disease.

456
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,800
This perfume satchel is newly-made.

457
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,520
Mrs. Zhang,

458
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,320
where's your old perfume satchel?

459
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,640
You've mentioned in your confession that

460
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,200
you only found out
about Liang Feng's death

461
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,280
the following morning.

462
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,000
Why were you

463
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,040
at the crime scene

464
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,720
before the deceased's blood coagulated?

465
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,040
You're saying I've been to the crime scene.

466
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,320
Where's the evidence?

467
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,680
Fei Yuan.

468
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,600
The medicinal powder on this clothes

469
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,040
was from your perfume satchel, right?

470
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,240
The blood stain

471
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,520
is bright red in color because it has come

472
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,440
into contact with cinnabar.

473
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,200
So what if I had been to the crime scene?

474
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,640
With such a scandal happened in my family,

475
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,560
it's natural that

476
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,280
I didn't testify against my brother.

477
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,880
But on the night of the crime,

478
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,840
you had been to Liang Feng's room.

479
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,640
He was still alive

480
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,960
when he fell to the ground.

481
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,400
You picked up a pixiu
and struck him with it.

482
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,360
Your brother Liang Cheng

483
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,640
had no idea that

484
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,200
you had been to the crime scene too.

485
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,240
The impact of the second blow

486
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,680
is much greater than the first blow.

487
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,880
You held pixiu with both hands

488
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,760
and struck him with the bottom part.

489
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,480
Your father died

490
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,200
due to both the blow from you

491
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,800
and the blow from your brother.

492
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Sister-in-law,

493
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,440
why did you do this?

494
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,600
Brother Zhang and your unborn child

495
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,000
won't want to see you in this state.

496
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,400
You're right.

497
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,040
I killed him.

498
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm the murderer.

499
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,200
Sister-in-law,

500
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,320
why did you do this?

501
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,160
I prayed for this amulet at the temple

502
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,080
before my husband went to war.

503
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,360
He kept it with him at all times.

504
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,760
I found it among his remains

505
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,280
that Prince Qi's men

506
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,040
sent home to me.

507
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,480
From then onwards,

508
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,240
I keep it by my side

509
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,520
day and night.

510
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Few days ago,

511
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,480
I found a letter

512
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,280
written in my husband's blood
in the amulet.

513
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,320
What?

514
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,800
He left behind a letter?

515
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,040
What did he write?

516
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,400
I've always thought that

517
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,600
my husband died an honor death
for the country.

518
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,560
Because that's his faith.

519
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,760
Only when I read his letter

520
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,480
that I realized

521
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,560
he died due to betrayal.

522
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,680
(Letter Written in General Zhang's Blood)
After fighting for 3 days,

523
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,360
we're still unable
to break through the siege.

524
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
After several urging,

525
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,120
there is still no movement
from the reinforcement.

526
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,960
I suspected they colluded with the enemy.

527
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,680
There is no hope of surviving this battle.

528
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,160
Please take care, my wife.

529
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,040
Brother Pei,

530
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,080
who's the traitor?

531
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Is he still alive?

532
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,720
The leader of the reinforcement

533
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,360
was Liang Cheng.

534
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,160
When brother returned home,

535
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,680
he kept telling me

536
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,520
how difficult it had been for him.

537
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,360
He fought all the way to the end.

538
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,520
But failed to save my husband.

539
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,640
I was convinced

540
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,720
by what he told me.

541
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,240
But I never thought that

542
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,960
both my father and brother

543
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,240
were murderers.

544
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,040
Was Old Master Liang involved in this too?

545
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
After I found the letter,

546
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
I wanted to ask them several times.

547
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,560
But my rationality pulled me back

548
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,160
from being impulsive.

549
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,720
Few days ago,

550
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,720
I overheard an argument

551
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
between my father and brother.

552
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,640
Father,

553
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,280
write a letter and get him

554
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,320
to assign me

555
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,840
as the Assistant Minister of War.

556
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,000
No way.

557
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,400
You'd secretly written
to Lei Zheng previously.

558
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,840
That was too conspicuous of you.

559
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,760
I just need a favor from him.

560
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,480
When he colluded with the enemy back then,

561
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,360
we helped him

562
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,520
and ignored brother-in-law's life.

563
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,560
Zhang Yuhua was just a son-in-law.

564
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,120
I'm even willing to sacrifice

565
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,600
the adopted daughter

566
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,520
for you.

567
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,880
But

568
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,520
if he finds out that

569
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,360
you'd written to Lei Zheng,

570
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,400
he won't let it go easily.

571
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,800
Who are they?

572
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,680
They never mentioned

573
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,280
the name and the identity

574
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,240
of the person.

575
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,040
Your Highness,

576
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,640
please ensure that

577
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,120
the murderer pays

578
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,000
an eye for an eye.

579
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,880
As long as I'm still alive,

580
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,720
I'll seek justice for Brother Zhang.

581
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,760
I've something else

582
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,680
to show you.

583
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,680
Sister-in-law.

584
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Sister-in-law.

585
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,800
Your Highness,

586
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,960
thank you for your concern
all these years.

587
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,560
You must not let him die an unjustly death.

588
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Don't worry.

589
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,720
I can meet him finally.

590
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,400
Your Highness.

591
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,400
Where's Liang Cheng?

592
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:52,384
(Tomb of the loyal General Zhang Yuhua.
Wife: Liang Wen)

593
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,080
I was the one
who named Brother Zhang's child.

594
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,320
When she was informed of his death,

595
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
Mrs. Zhang was so depressed that

596
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,760
she lost her child.

597
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,320
Otherwise, she wouldn't be so resolute.

598
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,000
If I'd remained by Brother Zhang side

599
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,120
and protected him,

600
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,440
he wouldn't have...

601
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,520
Brother Pei,

602
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,880
do you blame me?

603
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,480
Blame me

604
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,640
for catching the murderer?

605
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,320
How could you think so?

606
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,480
After all, Liang Feng and his son

607
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,000
colluded with enemy
and betrayed the country.

608
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,920
But Mrs. Zhang did it

609
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,720
for national justice.

610
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,960
Are you thinking that

611
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,520
Mrs. Zhang committed suicide

612
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,480
because you found the truth?

613
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,000
Isn't it?

614
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,280
She had been carrying a lot of burden.

615
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,640
I regretted that

616
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,280
I didn't realize the conspiracy earlier.

617
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,880
If I sought justice
for Brother Zhang earlier,

618
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,360
Mrs. Zhang wouldn't have gone this far.

619
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,960
But you've nothing to do with these.

620
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,240
You did what you should do.

621
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,000
But now,

622
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,760
I started to doubt

623
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,600
whether what I've done was right.

624
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
If not for my persistence,

625
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,720
Mrs. Zhang wouldn't have died.

626
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,360
Everyone must be responsible
for his own action.

627
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,880
What's the use

628
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,440
of the law

629
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,520
if everyone kills for love and hate?

630
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,320
Your responsibility is
to find out the truth.

631
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,440
There shouldn't be any doubt about this.

632
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,760
Something secret is brewing
in the capital

633
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,440
This matter has serious implications.

634
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,440
If you get involved rashly,

635
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,840
you might be in danger.

636
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,960
I'm not afraid.

637
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,440
I know that you're worried about me.

638
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,960
But you've been protecting me
all this while.

639
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,120
This time,

640
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,520
I would like to do something for you.

641
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,300
There are medicinal herbs I need there.

642
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,540
Can you accompany me to get some?

643
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,020
Alright.

644
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,380
Fei Yuan, come along too.

645
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,580
Me? But Young Master...

646
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,180
He's an adult.

647
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,060
Afraid he'll lose his way?

648
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,340
Besides, Sister Su is with him.

649
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,980
Aren't you going?

650
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,220
There are many herbs for cooking too.

651
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,340
Really?

652
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,060
