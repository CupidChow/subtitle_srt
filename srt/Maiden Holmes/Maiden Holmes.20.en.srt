(Episode 20)

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
It's moving. His tongue moved!

16
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,759
His tongue moved.

17
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,320
What about me?

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,160
You...

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,320
I didn't.

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,120
Say something!

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,600
You make me feel ashamed.

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,920
Stop eating and say something.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,720
Rushuang, why are you crying?

24
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,120
Did I say something wrong?

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
I'll make you another one

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,080
if it tastes bad.

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,440
Rushuang, don't cry.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,160
Maybe because you have your own target.

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,440
The reason I likes to travel around

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,720
and bring justice to people

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,480
is that I don't want to sit idle.

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,640
I hope I can be the one who is needed.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,480
Rushuang, you have to believe in yourself.

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,880
You can do it.

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,400
If you can't do it,

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,920
there is no one else who can

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,040
in this world.

38
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,240
My heart is beating so fast.

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
Rushuang,

40
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,720
We...

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
Are we poisoned?

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,960
Why is this idiot not
confessing his love to me yet?

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,080
Rushuang.

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,360
I specially cooked this ginseng soup for you.

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,960
Here you go.

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,680
That's good for my body, right?

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,600
You're busy with
Princess Yunchuan case recently.

48
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
You have to eat something good.

49
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,280
Right. Let me taste it now.

50
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,880
You were saying that
you cooked this soup on your own?

51
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,800
I spent two hours in the kitchen
preparing this soup.

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
Will it be tasteless?

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,400
That's impossible.

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,080
Let me taste it first.

55
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,040
It's tasty.

56
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,120
Let me taste it now.

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,360
Brother Xie, your nose is bleeding.

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
Let me wipe it for you.

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,360
Rushuang,

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,560
have I...

61
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,920
have I fallen sick?

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,920
How many ginseng did you use to cook this soup?

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,080
I used the entire thousand-year-old ginseng
to cook this soup.

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,480
The entire thousand-year-old ginseng?

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
How could you use entire one?

66
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,320
Rushuang, please don't get angry.

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,640
I've no idea that I shouldn't use
the entire ginseng for this.

68
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,000
I am so stupid. I screwed up

69
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
every single time. I...

70
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,920

I know that you won't take advantage of me.

All right. Let's sleep now.

126
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,840
You...

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,480
Do you still think that

128
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,480
I won't take advantage of you?

129
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,920
You're not that kind of person.

130
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,400
What about now?

131
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,360
I'm just kidding with you. Let's sleep now.

132
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
You're reading a letter

133
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,160
early in the morning.

134
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
You're so hard-working.

135
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,920
Lei Zheng poisoned Princess Yunchuan

136
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,520
and framed you.

137
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,360
There must be a mastermind behind all these.

138
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,600
Someone is trying to hurt you.

139
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,840
I'll never

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,840
give up on any clues that I can get.

141
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,760
That's enough. Put me down.

142
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,320
Right. Look at what I've found.

143
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,720
This is a letter from the ex-Minister of War,

144
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,320
Liang Feng, to Lei Zheng.

145
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,080
In the letter, he asked

146
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,640
Lei Zheng to make sure that Liang Cheng
passes the promotion assessment.

147
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,760
If he could do that,

148
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,960
Liang Feng will never mention
anything about what happened back then.

149
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,920
He also said that this
will bring an impact on the government.

150
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,040
It will bring an impact on the government.

151
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,760
Liang Feng was in charge of
the back-up team in the Battle of Honggu.

152
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,560
Lei Zheng was the judge for Bai Liang case.

153
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,480
Could it be that...

154
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,600
Could it be...

155
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,160
Let's go and see Liang Feng.

156
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,360
Everyone will get one.

157
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
Please look after my Rushuang from now on.

158
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,760
Sure. Congratulations, Brother Xie.

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,840
Thank you, Little Fei Yuan.

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,120
-Thank you, Young Master.
-Here, take it.

162
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,520
Mr. Xie is so generous.

163
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,160
Young Master Xie...

164
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,280
Mr. Xie is good-looking and kind.

165
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,640
You're lucky to have him.

166
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,600
He's lucky to have me.

Congratulations, Brother Xie.

170
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,160
Thank you, Little Fei Yuan.

171
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,720
Let's go.

172
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
Everyone will get one.

173
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,000
Stop right there, Fei Yuan.

174
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,760
-How many red packets have you taken?
-Thank you.

175
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
-No.
-It's okay, Rushuang.

176
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,920
I'm so happy today.

177
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,720
Here's another one for you, Little Fei Yuan.

178
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,720
Brother Xie is the best.

179
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,280
It's okay.

180
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,080
What's going on here?

181
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,680
Your timing is perfect.

182
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,440
Brother Pei, here's your red packet. Take it.

183
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,640
Brother Su, here's yours.

184
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,200
This is...

185
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,600
Today marks the first day of

186
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,680
Sister Rushuang being Brother Xie's girlfriend.

187
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,800
Well.

188
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,320
Congratulations.

189
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,360
Thank you.

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,720
Right, Young Master.

191
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,840
Where were you two yesterday?

192
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,880
You two were missing last night.

193
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,760
Last night, we were...

194
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,240
Last night, we were at Lei Mansion

195
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,320
to investigate...

196
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,040
Lei Mansion.

197
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,800
Fei Yuan,

198
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,920
go and pack up our things.

199
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,240
We're leaving for Capital Suburb later.

200
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,760
All right.

201
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,560
Is Mingjing Office

202
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,800
still investigating Lei Zheng case?

203
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,680
They've closed the book on that case, My Lord.

204
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,680
How about Xiao Yanzhi?

205
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,840
He went out of town with Su Ci.

206
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
They went out of town?

207
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,440
Yes.

208
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,520
Su Ci has applied for her leaves.

209
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,920
She was saying that
she wanted to get some rest.

210
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,240
Prince Qi is free.

211
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,560
So he went out of town with her.

212
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,920
And you believe in what they said?

213
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,160
Xiao Yanzhi seems to be free,

214
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,280
but look at what he has done so far.

215
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,120
My Lord, you are saying that...

216
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,360
We must beware of them.

217
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,120
Thing is not what it seems to be.
They're doing something secretly.

218
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,960
Yes.

219
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,320
I got it.

220
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,320
Su Ci

221
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,640
disguises herself as a man

222
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,320
and infiltrates Mingjing Office.

223
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,560
And now she has befriended Xiao Yanzhi.

224
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,920
Something is not right.

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,160
Go and look into this woman thoroughly.

226
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,840
Yes.

227
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,560
The rain has finally stopped.

228
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,900
(Capital Suburb)

229
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,200
Miss,

230
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,920
some people are looking for you.

231
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,680
Your Highness

232
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,320
Madam Zhang.

233
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,760
I'm just passing by.

234
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,000
And I thought I should pass my respect
to Brother Zhang.

235
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,600
And also to meet Old Master Liang.

236
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
But...

237
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
Brother Pei, the Brother Zhang
that you were mentioning is

238
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,000
General Zhang Yuhua?

239
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,480
This is my best friend,

240
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,040
General Zheng Yuhua's wife.

241
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,440
Madam Zhang,

242
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
they're my friends.

243
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,320
Nice to meet you.

244
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,120
General Zhang was a young hero.

245
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,240
I respect him very much. I...

246
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm so sorry for your loss, Madam Zhang.

247
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,760
How did your father pass away?

248
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,480
My father slipped and hit his head
on the corner of the table.

249
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,960
And

250
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,920
he never woke up after that.

251
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,800
Madam Zhang,

252
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,800
can you show us

253
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,560
where your father slipped and fell, please?

254
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,720
Well...

255
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,080
Madam Zhang,

256
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,400
she is Detective Su from Mingjing Office.

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,240
She will always look into the murder cases

258
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,680
that she encounters.

259
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
Can you do us a favour, please?

260
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,160
All right.

261
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
Please come in.

262
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,720
Madam Zhang,

263
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,160
did Old Master Liang hit the desk?

264
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,680
Based on the bloodstain pattern...

265
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,760
Brother Su,

266
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
what are you looking at?

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,560
How come there is bloodstain here?

268
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,000
Your Highness,

269
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,359
if you have done inspecting the scene,

270
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,520
please get some rest at the waiting room.

271
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,320
I've got to greet those
who come to pay respect to my father.

272
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,560
I'll leave first.

273
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,600
Hold on.

274
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,640
Madam Zhang, I'm afraid that
your father's death

275
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,960
is not as simple as it seems to be.

276
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,120
Sister Su, what do you mean by that?

277
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,720
I just noticed that

278
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,880
there is bloodstain on the side of
this Pixiu too.

279
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
If your father slipped

280
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
and hit his forehead on the corner of the desk,

281
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,760
why is there some bloodstain

282
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
on the side of this Pixiu?

283
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
What are you trying to say?

284
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,040
My father...

285
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,920
Madam Zhang,

286
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,000
how did your father slip and fall?

287
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,640
When did he die?

288
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,440
You don't know about all these?

289
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,400
When I was informed by my maid,

290
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,640
my father had already been moved to the bed.

291
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,320
Who found out that your father was dead?

292
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,240
The butler found out that
my father had passed away.

293
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,520
Miss,

294
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,720
Young Master is back.

295
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,280
Well then...

296
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,640
Help me take good care of our guests.

297
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,440
Yes.

298
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,160
If you'll excuse me.

299
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,040
Butler,

300
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,000
when did Old Master Liang pass away?

301
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,120
Yesterday, at dawn.

302
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,320
When I woke up in the middle of the night,
I saw some light in the study.

303
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,680
So I came here to check it out.

304
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,920
And I saw Old Master lying on the floor.

305
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,680
And he is dead.

306
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,080
Did you see anyone else?

307
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
Everyone in the mansion
had gone to bed.

308
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,360
Old Master Liang passed away yesterday.

309
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,200
It takes at least two days to travel

310
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,040
from the capital to this place.

311
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,520
How come Officer Liang

312
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,440
could get here so fast?

313
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,520
Young Master has applied for leaves earlier.

314
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,480
He wanted to come home to celebrate
the Old Master's birthday.

315
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,200
Who knows that Old Master passed away yesterday.

316
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,000
Brother Pei,

317
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,920
let's go and see Officer Liang.

318
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,760
Right.

319
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,400
Father,

320
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,040
how can you die all of a sudden?

321
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,720
I'm not a good son.

322
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,680
I couldn't get home in time.

323
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,400
I couldn't see you for the one last time.

324
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,960
Father,

325
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,520
your eldest son is back to see you.

326
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,120
Father.

327
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,560
They're weeping sadly.

328
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,160
But I feel like they are pretending to be sad.

329
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,560
What do you mean?

330
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,160
Officer Liang,

331
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,840
I'm sorry for your loss.

332
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,840
You're Detective Su from Mingjing Office?

333
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,920
What are you doing here?

334
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,320
Do I have to report my father's case

335
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,240
to Mingjing Office?

336
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,080
Officer Liang, we're not here for that.

337
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
We're just passing by.

338
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,840
Your Highness.

339
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
We're busy with my father's funeral,

340
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,880
please forgive us

341
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,960
if we can't serve you well.

342
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
We understand the situation you're facing.

343
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,640
Officer Liang, you really don't have
to worry about it.

344
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,680
Officer Liang,

345
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,840
we would like to ask your permission
to perform an autopsy on your father's body.

346
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,200
The coffin has been sealed.

347
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
We're going to lay my father to rest soon.

348
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,080
We really hope that he can rest in peace.

349
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,720
I'm so sorry.

350
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,840
I suspect that your father
was murdered by someone.

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,320
He didn't die of an accident.

352
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
The murder weapon is

353
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,320
the Pixiu in the study.

354
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,400
Officer Su,

355
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,440
why did you say so?

356
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,320
I've inspected the scene thoroughly,

357
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,680
there are a lot of things in the scene
that don't make sense.

358
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,200
It's my job to investigate a murder.

359
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,680
I hope that Officer Liang will
cooperate with us.

360
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,240
We don't need your help, Officer Su.

361
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,200
My father slipped and fell.

362
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,800
He hit his right forehead on the corner of
the desk. He died of excessive bleeding.

363
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,000
As his son,

364
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,600
I just hope that we can lay him to rest
as soon as possible.

365
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,720
I'm sorry that I can't help.

366
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,680
Officer Liang, can you repeat

367
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,080
how your father died?

368
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
He slipped and fell.

369
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,720
And he hit his right forehead on
the corner of the desk.

370
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,200
What's wrong?

371
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,240
Anyway,

372
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,040
I'd like to open the coffin
and perform an autopsy on his body.

373
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,640
Your Highness,

374
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
please help me.

375
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,880
Filial piety always comes first

376
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,840
Mingjing Office is indeed powerful.

377
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,080
But they can't put their ethics aside.

378
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
Stop humiliating me and my family.

379
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,120
Officer Su,

380
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,640
if you can show me

381
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
the warrant from Mingjing Office,

382
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,120
I'll have no choice but to comply.

383
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,600
I'll try my best to assist you
in the investigation

384
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,000
even if I was blamed for being an unfilial son.

385
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,920
But if you want to disturb my late father's soul

386
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,720
without any solid evidence,

387
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm sorry,

388
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,080
I'll never agree to that.

389
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,720
Your Highness,

390
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,560
the Liang Family has always
been loyal to the emperor.

391
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,840
Please don't humiliate us in this way.

392
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,600
If I can't even

393
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,400
lay my father to rest in peace,

394
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,040
what kind of son am I?

395
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,800
If Detective Su insists to open
my father's coffin

396
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,680
with His Highness's support,

397
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,560
you'll have to walk over my dead body.

398
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,960
Please calm down, Officer Liang.

399
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,480
Detective Su has always
enforced the law impartially.

400
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,440
She doesn't need anyone's support.

401
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,160
She does this because
she cares about your father's case.

402
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,720
But if you don't want to disturb
your late father's soul,

403
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,800
then we'll leave it here.

404
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,680
Officer Liang, I apologise for my abrupt action.

405
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,240
I'm sorry.

406
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,880
Officer Liang,

407
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,320
one of the things in your mansion
has caught my eyes.

408
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,120
I wonder if I can have it.

409
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,000
What is it?

410
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,520
The Pixiu.

411
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,880
What's wrong?

412
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,960
You're not willing to give it to me?

413
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,800
No, of course not.

414
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,320
You can have it.

415
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,200
Your Highness.

416
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,560
Officer Su.

417
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,280
Your Highness,

418
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,440
Detective Su,

419
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
my eldest brother still can't accept

420
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,920
the sudden death of my father.

421
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,360
That's why he is so emotional.

422
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,440
Please forgive him.

423
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,360
It's okay. We understand.
You don't have to send us out.

424
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,680
Hey, somebody come and help me.

425
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,480
My eldest brother brought this horse home.

426
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,080
Bring it to the backyard.

427
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,160
Yes, Miss.

428
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,480
Madam Zhang, we'll leave now.

429
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,360
Let's go.

430
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
(Yuelai Hotel)
I really think that

431
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,080
Liang Cheng must be the murderer.

432
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,280
I agree.

433
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,520
Look at how he reacted.

434
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,280
He cried just to stop Sister Su from

435
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,640
performing an autopsy on the body.

436
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,200
In my opinion,

437
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,960
we should knock those who don't
let us open the coffin unconscious.

438
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,280
Let's see who dare to stop us.

439
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,080
If we do exactly what you said,

440
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm sure they'll say Mingjing Office
doesn't play by the rules.

441
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
And that we don't respect the deceased.

442
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,840
Xie Beiming, you're a grown man.

443
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,000
Can't you think maturely?

444
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,320
After working with Little Su for so long,

445
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,240
Rushuang has become mature.

446
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,760
It seems like you're complimenting me,

447
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,240
but you're actually complimenting
Sister Su, right?

448
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,560
But I'll take it as a compliment.

449
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,480
What should we do now?

450
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,000
We can't just sit here and wait.

451
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,360
We only get a Pixiu.

452
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,800
We don't even know

453
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,560
how the bloodstain got there.

454
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,760
How do we prove that this is the murder weapon?

455
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,160
That's right, Sister Su?

456
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,400
How do you know that
the blood got onto the Pixiu

457
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,040
when the murderer hit Old Master Liang's head,

458
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,800
and not when he hit

459
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
the corner of the desk?

460
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,160
Fei Yuan,

461
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,440
can you help me get some goat intestines
and fill them with water, please?

462
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,720
Okay.

463
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,120
Goat intestines.

464
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,720
Now,

465
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,880
I'll place this at the edge of this table.

466
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,840
Brother Pei, can you hold it here for me?

467
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,480
Look at this.

468
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,680
If Old Master Liang hit his head on
the corner of the desk,

469
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,320
the bloodstain should be in fan-shaped.

470
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,080
Next,

471
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,720
I'll simulate how the Pixiu hit
Old Master Liang's right forehead.

472
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,360
Let's see how the bloodstain will look like.

473
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Brother Pei, please hold this for me.

474
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,680
Place it on your palm.

475
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,920
And place it at your right forehead.

476
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,720
Sister Su, I'll do this.

477
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,400
Rushuang, let's not do this...

478
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,520
All right.

479
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,880
Now you stand at the side of the table.

480
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,520
If Liang Feng was standing when he was hit,

481
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,880
the bloodstain would look different.

482
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,520
But of course,

483
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,960
the bloodstain changes according to

484
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,240
their positions.

485
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,840
For example,

486
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,600
if the murderer hit
Old Master Liang in this way,

487
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,920
the strength that he used wouldn't
be as strong as the one I just did.

488
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,720
The bloodstain would be different too.

489
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,320
Brother Pei, can you lower your body, please?

490
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,960
If I hit him from behind,

491
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,120
the angle will be different too.

492
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
The problem now is

493
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,720
the bloodstain found in Old Master Liang's room

494
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,440
is totally different from the result of
my first simulation.

495
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,560
Besides, the Pixiu is found

496
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,960
outside the range of the bloodstain.

497
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,640
I'll go back to my room and change my clothes.

498
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,440
Brother Pei.

499
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Sister Su,

500
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,920
I think you've crossed the line just now.

501
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,360
That's right. I'm sure
Young Master is angry now.

502
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,840
Brother Su,

503
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,880
anyhow he is a prince.

504
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,840
You put him in an embarrassing
situation just now.

505
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,880
Don't you think it's a little over?

506
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,800
You better go and comfort him now.

507
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,640
Go.

508
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,320
Brother Pei, I was too
into the simulation just now.

509
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,760
I...

510
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,240
Come back.

511
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,040
I better leave now.

512
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,680
Come back.

513
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,360
Turn around.

514
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,320
You just treated me as a prop.

515
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,000
You've nothing to say to me?

516
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,880
Well then, what do you want from me?

517
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,000
Help me wipe my body.

518
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,600
You got all these scars

519
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,920
when you fought in wars?

520
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
What do you want me to do?

521
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm still angry.

522
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,040
Help me put on my clothes.

523
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,520
Are you satisfied now?

524
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,920
No.

525
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,840
What do you want from me?

526
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,360
Are you satisfied now?

527
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,560
That's loads of things.

528
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,240
Little Fei Yuan, is it necessary to take
this hotpot with you?

529
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,480
It's heavy.

530
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,040
Don't touch my things.

531
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,680
Why? Can't I bring this along with me?

532
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,080
No. I didn't say that.

533
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,480
What are all these?

534
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,200
-Why are you taking so many things with you?
-What do you want?

535
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,560
If you're not planning to help me,
please leave me alone.

536
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,000
Stop questioning me.

537
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,880
And stop touching my stuff.

538
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,720
You, silly boy.

539
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,440
Are you starting a fight with me?

540
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,760
I...

541
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,600
What do you want to do?

542
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,280
I...

543
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,720
Turmeric.

544
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,600
The weather is so good.

545
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,160
It's sunny.

546
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,720
What's that on your forehead?

547
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,520
Fei Yuan.

548
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,280
He lost the bet in using
a hidden weapon with me.

549
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,840
Little Fei Yuan,

550
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
it's not that easy to get rid of the turmeric.

551
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,000
It's gonna be on your forehead for a few days.

552
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,760
Brother Su.

553
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,600
Turmeric.

554
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,040
The marks on Liang Cheng's horse legs.

555
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,320
They looked like turmeric.

556
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,320
Liang Cheng must be involved in this murder.

557
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,440
But I can't open the coffin now.

558
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,520
I can't perform an autopsy now.

559
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,200
Why don't I visit Liang Mansion
secretly at night?

560
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,440
And see if Liang Feng...

561
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,320
left any clues

562
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,840
on Bai Liang case behind.

563
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,520
Little Su, it's me.

564
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
What are you doing here?

565
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,160
I'm here to look for the clues that
Liang Feng left behind,

566
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,840
And check on Liang Cheng.

567
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,560
I found something here.

568
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,240
It's calligraphy in cursive script.

569
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,720
This is the mid-autumn calligraphy
in cursive script.

570
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Liang Feng had a huge collection of

571
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,480
well-known calligraphy.

572
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
All these are fakes.

573
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,040
How do you know?

574
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,240
Most of the masterpieces of these artists

575
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,640
are kept in the royal palace.

576
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,840
I don't think the emperor
will give it to Liang Feng as a gift.

577
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
That's strange.

578
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,120
Why did he keep all these fakes?

579
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
What list is this?

580
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,239

581
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,040

-Someone is coming.
