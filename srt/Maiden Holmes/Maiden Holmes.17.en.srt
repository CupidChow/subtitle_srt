(Episode 17)

15
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,680
Princess, come and practice.

16
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,520
Princess.

17
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,120
Be gentle on your fingertips.

18
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,240
I know.

19
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,880
Little Yue.

20
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,320
Why are you covering your ears?

21
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,120
She wants you to put in some efforts.

22
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,680
Your Highness.

23
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,200
You've been practising for so many days.

24
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,720
Why are you still playing so bad?

25
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,960
Li Yu said

26
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm doing well

27
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,880
in such a short period only, right?

28
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,720
Your Highness.

29
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,600
It's not been long
since the Princess started to practice.

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
If she can practice more, she will be better

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
and familiarize with fingerstyle.

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,880
This won't do

33
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,200
if you're to perform at the banquet.

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
I'll just wing it.

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,080
Your Highness.

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,160
This guqin requires a higher level of

37
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,360
fingerstyle and rhythmic sense.

38
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,640
Previously,

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,760
I made a new one for the Princess.

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,880
I'll bring it later.

41
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,720
I think it will help with
the Princess's practice.

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,520
Great.

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,560
Let her practice more for the next few days.

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,400
Yes.

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,280
You...

46
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,840
Stop!

47
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,920
Your Highness.

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,480
Go away.

49
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,360
Yes, Your Highness.

50
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
Rushuang. Brother Xie.

51
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,480
Why are you here?

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,960
You should ask your Young Master.

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,240
I've heard that you're marrying the Princess.

54
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,480
Yes.

55
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Sister Su is still in prison.

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
You're marrying the princess

57
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,240
instead of rescuing her?

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,000
You are a heartless man!

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,360
Rushuang!

60
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,120
Let go!

61
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,360
Brother Pei.

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,600
We are both men.

63
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
I will be disappointed with you

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,400
if you are really going to do it.

65
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,240
Leave if you have nothing else

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,200
to do here.

67
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,840
You...

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,320
I have to make the banquet reservation.

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm going to kill you!

70
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,960
I won't let you do that to my Young Master.

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Young Master is marrying the Princess

72
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,800
to save Sister Su.

73
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,280
Fei Yuan!

74
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,480
Fei Yuan, what do you mean?

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,840
What do you mean by
marrying the Princess to save Sister Su?

76
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,120
Brother Pei.

77
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,880
Say something!

78
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
We are all friends.

79
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
Just be frank.

80
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,560
Your Highness.

81
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,800
You will be engaged to Prince Qi two days later.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Are you happy?

83
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,440
Not really.

84
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,600
Prince Qi is inviting you
to his mansion tonight.

85
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,560
Are you feeling nervous?

86
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,480
I feel nothing.

87
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,880
How is that possible?

88
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,200
How should I feel then?

89
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360
According to plays,

90
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,720
when a girl sees a person she admires,

91
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,280
she will blush and her heart will be racing.

92
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,480
Your Highness, don't you feel that?

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,080
My heart will be racing?

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,360
That is why

95
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,040
I decided to marry the Princess.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,040
With that,

97
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:36,032
Brother Su will be released after the marriage.

98
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,760
I understand, Brother Pei.

99
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,720
I knew it. Brother Pei won't...

100
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,800
You don't really like the Princess, right?

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,640
I'm sure you know

102
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
who I like.

103
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,160
So, you are just sacrificing yourself

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,320
to save Brother Su.

105
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,720
I have no choice

106
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,200
but this.

107
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
What will you do after you save Sister Su?

108
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,640
My happiness isn't important.

109
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,880
Princess, this way.

110
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,640
Cheese?

111
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,400
Your Highness.

112
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,280
It's been a while since I had this. Delicious!

113
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
Princess, do you like it?

114
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
Not bad. It tastes the same as
the food in my hometown.

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,840
Why do you have Beirong's food

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
at your mansion?

117
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:06,032
I know you like to eat cheese, candied fruits

118
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,360
and drink kumis.

119
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,880
I asked them to prepare these for you.

120
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
I can't do nothing

121
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,400
to repay for what you prepared for me.

122
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,040
I wanted to play the guqin
during the banquet at first

123
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,960
but I have to repay you immediately

124
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,360
since I ate your food.

125
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,400
I'll show you the girls of Beirong

126
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,720
are no worse than those in Liang Dynasty

127
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,720
in terms of

128
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:27,087
music, chess, calligraphy and art.

129
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,159
Have you heard it?

130
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,400
It's so livel
in the Mansion of Prince Qi today.

131
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Of course, Prince Qi invited
Princess Yunchuan to a banquet.

132
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,480
They must've prepared a lot.

133
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,679
Prince Qi will be engaged
to Princess Yunchuan

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,120
in a few days.

135
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,960
They are a match made in heaven.

136
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,480
Exactly.

137
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,440
What did you say?

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What about Prince Qi?

139
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,160
Prince Qi and Princess Yunchuan

140
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
is getting engaged in a few days.

141
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,960
Prince Qi

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,880
is having a banquet with Princess Yunchuan now.

143
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,960
Yes.

144
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,040
Prince Qi

145
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,520
is marrying Princess Yunchuan?

146
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
Look at you.

147
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,680
Do you think
His Highness will marry you instead?

148
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
That's enough. Just ignore her.

149
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,720
There's also a banquet at night.

150
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,160
Many officials will be attending.

151
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,680
Really? Tell me about it.

152
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
Princess Yunchuan

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
is really beautiful.

154
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,760
This is

155
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,120
the way you spoke of?

156
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Come.

157
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,520
Cheers.

158
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:51,364
(Breakthrough)

159
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,800
Please excuse my bad performance.

160
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,680
Your Highness.

161
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,080
Princess!

162
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,440
Your Highness!

163
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,040
Your Highness.

164
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,920
Your Highness!

165
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,840
Your Highness.

166
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,640
Doctor Huyan, how is she?

167
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,520
Your Highness.

168
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,480
I've used acupuncture to seal

169
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,680
her artery
to her heart and lungs.

170
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,720
The Princess is safe for now.

171
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,200
-That's good.
-But,

172
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,640
if she couldn't take the antidote soon,

173
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,720
the Princess would probably die in five days.

174
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
I am useless.

175
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,160
I've never seen such

176
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,960
peculiar poison.

177
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,600
I don't know how to cure the Princess.

178
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,280
Stand up.

179
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,520
Tidy up and

180
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,200
bring the Princess back to the inn.

181
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,400
Yes.

182
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,360
Your Highness.

183
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,400
We shouldn't move the Princess around

184
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,400
with her unstable condition.

185
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,880
Why don't we let her recuperate
at the side mansion?

186
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,120
I will find all the famous physicians

187
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,000
and treat the Princess for sure.

188
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,640
Prince.

189
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,040
I trust you.

190
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,280
But Yunchuan has been poisoned here.

191
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,960
I won't let her stay here

192
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,560
no matter what.

193
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,800
Your Highness, please tell His Majesty

194
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,160
to find the antidote
and get to the bottom of this

195
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,440
so you can give us an explanation.

196
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,400
If anything happens to Yunchuan,

197
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,080
Beirong will be at war

198
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,800
with the Liang Dynasty!

199
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,000
Officer.

200
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
We've checked them with the name list.

201
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Their identities are real.

202
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,920
They do work in
the Mansion of Prince Qi.

203
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:32,024
(Breakthrough)

204
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,520
Officer.

205
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,200
Investigate carefully.

206
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,840
Yes.

207
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,400
Shuomu really said that?

208
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes.

209
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
The people of Beirong are fierce.
They like to start a war.

210
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,000
Once when a neighbouring country
abducted their crown prince.

211
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,120
They deployed their whole country's army
to annihilate a few cities.

212
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,760
Refugees were everywhere at that time.

213
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,800
Your Majesty.

214
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,080
Although Beirong
is not so powerful as Liang Dynasty,

215
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,800
many innocent citizens

216
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,440
will die

217
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,520
if a war breaks out.

218
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,080
What's your idea then?

219
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,797
Princess Yunchuan was poisoned
at the Mansion of Prince Qi.

220
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
Prince Qi should bear the responsibility.

221
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,200
But it couldn't be him
who poisoned Princess Yunchuan.

222
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,960
Both of us

223
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
know Prince Qi's personality.

224
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,400
An outsider though...

225
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,960
Also,

226
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,560
even if Prince Qi is not the culprit,

227
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,160
can Your Majesty say the same
about his men or the people

228
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,280
who work in his mansion?

229
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,040
Your Majesty, our top priority

230
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,160
is to give an explanation to Beirong.

231
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,520
This.

232
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
Please make a decision for
your people as soon as possible.

233
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,080
Your Majesty.

234
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Issue a decree.

235
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,127
Keep Prince Qi confined at his mansion

236
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,440
until the case is solved.

237
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes.

238
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,960
I hope Your Majesty can
settle it as soon as possible

239
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,640
and give Shuomu an explanation

240
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,560
to prevent a war.

241
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,160
Yunchuan.

242
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,960
Brother.

243
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,280
Am I dying?

244
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Nonsense.

245
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,320
Huyan!

246
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,720
Yes.

247
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,240
The poison is acting up again.

248
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,720
You must keep her safe

249
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,600
by hook or by crook.

250
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,560
If anything happens to the Princess,

251
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,200
Little Su cannot be saved,

252
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
and Beirong will start a war as well.

253
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,440
It will be too late by then.

254
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,319
Xiwen, take off your clothes.

255
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Your Majesty,
please forgive me for ignoring the decree.

256
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,000
Since it's urgent,

257
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,000
I have to...

258
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,720
Brother, get up.

259
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,240
I knew that you would come.

260
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,240
You're right.

261
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,880
Skip the formalities.

262
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,080
Tell me. Do you have an idea

263
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,600
to solve Princess Yunchuan's poisoning case?

264
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,160
Your Majesty.

265
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,480
Please issue a decree
for Su Ci to investigate the case.

266
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,000
But Su Ci is a criminal.

267
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,680
How can I let her
investigate the case officially?

268
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,760
No one can doubt Su Ci's investigation ability.

269
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,520
I can also guarantee with my life

270
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,720
that she won't be up to no good.

271
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
She will definitely

272
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
solve the case.

273
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,160
At that time,

274
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,960
Your Majesty can legalise female officials,

275
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,720
save me from this difficult situation

276
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
and ease the tension with Beirong.

277
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,600
You will kill three birds with one stone.

278
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,760
Alright, I'll follow your advice.

279
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,800
Princess Yunchuan was poisoned at
the Mansion of Prince Qi.

280
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,320
Prince Qi is the most suspicious.

281
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,600
Su Ci,

282
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,080
besides lying to Your Majesty,

283
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
she was also close to Prince Qi.

284
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,800
She is suspicious as well.

285
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,920
How can she investigate this case?

286
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,360
Your Majesty.

287
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,320
So far as I've known,

288
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,120
Su Ci was beaten up
in the prison of the Ministry of Justice.

289
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,160
the credibility of her testimony's is doubtful.

290
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,808
Mingjing Office

291
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,400
has also thoroughly searched
the Mansion of Prince Qi

292
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,240
and found no traces of poison.

293
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,040
You mean that...

294
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm framing Prince Qi?

295
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm just stating the facts.

296
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,520
How can a criminal
be given such a heavy responsibility?

297
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,320
An exception is needed in an emergency.

298
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Negotiation between
both countries is not going well.

299
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,320
Our top priority

300
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,840
is to find the truth and
give Beirong an explanation.

301
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,680
Your Majesty.

302
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,680
The culprit of Princess Yunchuan's poisoning

303
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
left no traces behind.

304
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,120
Now is the time to use Su Ci.

305
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
She is observant

306
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,600
and has a keen eye.

307
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,040
I can guarantee that Su Ci will solve the case.

308
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,520
Nonsense!

309
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,400
Isn't there anyone else
capable in Liang Dynasty

310
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,920
besides a woman?

311
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
I've issued the decree.

312
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,480
I see no reason to recall it as well.

313
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,960
No more arguments needed.

314
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,600
Detective Su, heed the decree.

315
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,880
Kneel down.

316
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,600
Criminal Su Ci disguised as a man.

317
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,360
She was supposed to be beheaded
for lying to His Majesty.

318
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,320
Due to her contributions
in solving numerous cases

319
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,840
in the Mingjing Office as a detective,

320
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,640
she will be pardoned

321
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,040
to investigate
Princess Yunchuan's poisoning case

322
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,560
to atone for her crimes.

323
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,960
By His Majesty.

324
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

325
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,480
His Majesty's verbal orders.

326
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Cure the Princess's poison

327
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,800
together with Ms.Rushuang.

328
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes.

329
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,682
(Capital Suburb Inn)

330
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,960
Your Highness,
thank you for giving Rushuang a chance.

331
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,640
I wouldn't have cared about the decree

332
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,960
if Huyan has a way of curing Yunchuan.

333
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Your Highness, don't worry.

334
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,080
I will definitely find the culprit

335
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,800
and give Beirong an explanation.

336
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,880
Nothing can happen to Yunchuan.

337
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,240
She looks naive

338
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,480
but she is the most sensible.

339
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,760
We don't like to forge alliance by marriage.

340
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,800
In order to improve the national relations,

341
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,600
she still followed me here.

342
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,600
If I can't

343
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
bring her back safely,

344
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,680
I will be embarrassed as her brother.

345
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,080
Detective Su.

346
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,800
This is the Miss's daily log.

347
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,080
Everything she did

348
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
was recorded here in detail.

349
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
I asked someone

350
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,040
to look around the inn.

351
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,680
Nothing unusual was found.

352
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,840
Furthermore,

353
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,800
every food that Yunchuan ate

354
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,200
was tested for poison.

355
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,800
Nothing could happen at the inn.

356
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,880
Mingjing Office also checked

357
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,640
the Princess's food and utensils she used

358
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,480
at the Mansion of Prince Qi.

359
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,560
No poison was found as well.

360
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,320
If it's neither from the Mansion of Prince Qi

361
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,840
nor from the inn,

362
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,480
how did the culprit poisoned her under

363
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,160
heavy protection?

364
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,640
Unless,

365
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,320
it wasn't the food that was poisoned?

366
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,040
Rushuang, how is it?

367
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,120
Your Highness,

368
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,720
did the Princess

369
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,920
spit up blood?

370
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,720
She did.

371
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,200
The poison seemed to slow down previously

372
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,640
but she started spitting out blood

373
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,080
when we returned to the inn.

374
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,120
The Princess is dangerous now.

375
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,520
Blood was clotted at the lungs and

376
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,040
couldn't be transported to the heart

377
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,520
that's why she spit up blood.

378
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,800
Also...

379
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,560
Be frank with me.

380
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,200
I used a needle
to prick her Taichong Point.

381
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,000
The blood is dark.

382
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,480
This poison is supposed to attack the heart.

383
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:54,984
Taichong Point is located at the foot.

384
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
It's far from the heart

385
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,920
yet it was heavily poisoned.

386
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,240
This means that she has
already been poisoned

387
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,360
for a few days.

388
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,080
What?

389
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,760
That's impossible.

390
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,160
She was fine a few days ago.

391
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,520
I also went out a few times with the Princess.

392
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,960
I didn't notice anything unusual.

393
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,680
The Princess was poisoned chronically.

394
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,320
She came in contact with the poison everyday

395
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,200
and it gets into her organs gradually.

396
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,080
When the organs can no longer take it,

397
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,560
the poison will be activated.

398
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,360
But it's a rare poison.

399
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,040
No obvious symptoms can be found

400
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,520
during the incubation period.

401
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,320
Is there a cure?

402
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,520
It is a rare poison.

403
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
I don't have a cure for now.

404
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,160
I can only take the Princess's blood sample

405
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,200
and research it for now.

406
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm counting on you, Ms. Rushuang.

407
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,200
A chronic poison

408
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,840
that needs close contact everyday.

409
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,440
The culprit can still poison the Princess daily

410
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,040
under such heavy security.

411
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,720
It can only be done by someone close to her.

412
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,680
Your Highness.

413
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
I would never dare to harm the Princess.

414
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,160
Stand up.

415
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,440
She comes from my mother's clan.

416
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,720
She's been following us since she was a child.

417
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,760
It can't be her.

418
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,960
The culprit aims to
break our countries' alliance

419
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,240
Also...

420
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,760
the marriage

421
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,800
between the Princess and Prince Qi.

422
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,400
Since they didn't achieve their goals,

423
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,040
they would not give up and would act again.

424
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,760
We can strike first

425
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,200
if we are well prepared.

426
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
I'm just worried that

427
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,040
Yunchuan will be in danger again.

428
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,440
Do you have a perfect plan?

429
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,360
Commander Fu. I need your help.

430
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,560
You just have to tell everyone

431
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,160
that the Princess has been cured

432
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,200
by an expert.

433
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,120
She can proceed with the marriage

434
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,280
after resting for a couple of days.

435
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,080
They will be nervous

436
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,360
and act again.

437
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,320
Exactly.

438
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,000
A wise plan indeed.

439
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,840
Your Highness. Detective Su.

440
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,560
I've dispersed everyone outside.

441
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,840
Your Highness.

442
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,200
Please.

443
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,760
Your Highness, please remember.

444
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,840
The Princess has never left this room.

445
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,320
Sister Su.

446
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,120
Are you going to pretend to be Princess Yunchuan?

447
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
I leave her to you.

448
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,040
No. That's too dangerous.

449
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,040
I can't let you take the risk.

450
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,760
There's no one more suitable than me.

451
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,880
But the one you're saving

452
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,360
is going to marry Brother Pei.

453
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,200
He is Prince Qi.

454
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:37,111
He has to prioritise the country's interest.

455
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:38,672
Maintaining diplomatic relations

456
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,720
is his duty.

457
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
As for me,

458
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,080
His Majesty gave me a pardon

459
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,080
to investigate
Princess Yunchuan's poisoning case.

460
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,360
Catching the culprit

461
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,560
and finding the truth

462
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,000
are my responsibilities.

463
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,160
But...

464
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,640
You...

465
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,400
As a physician,

466
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
will you care about your patient's identity?

467
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,240
No.

468
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Me neither.

469
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,400
I'm going to take care of the Princess.

470
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
Perhaps the culprit

471
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,640
applied poison on himself

472
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,760
so the Princess would be poisoned

473
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,360
whenever she got close?

474
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,720
Maybe the poisoned item

475
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,640
is something that looks normal to everyone.

476
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,120
What is it?

477
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
Fluorescent white particles?

478
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,520
What is this?

479
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,280
There were termites
in the Princess's room a few days ago.

480
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,920
They asked me
to apply an insect resistant coating.

481
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,920
Show me the coating.

482
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,000
Here it is.

483
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,440
I did nothing bad.

484
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,440
How much did you use

485
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,360
in the Princess's room?

486
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,320
Half a bucket.

487
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,880
Are you thinking about

488
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,760
why termites appeared in an inn

489
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,120
that's housing our country's guest?

490
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,040
You...

491
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,720
Why are you here?

492
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,560
What are you doing here?

493
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,800
The Princess was poisoned at my mansion.

494
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
I have to take the blame.

495
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
The culprit killed two birds with one stone

496
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
since I was the one being targeted.

497
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,440
In order to give Beirong an explanation

498
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,000
and to prove my innocence,

499
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,400
please allow me

500
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,800
to join the investigation, Prince.

501
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,040
I will trust you for once.

502
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,160
I was worried about you.

503
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
You're full of injuries.

504
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,840
You should return and treat yourself
before you come here.

505
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,080
The Princess's poison is very peculiar.

506
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,000
I can't waste any time.

507
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,560
Little Su, I...

508
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,280
I know.

509
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,920
You are going

510
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,600
to marry Princess Yunchuan to save me.

511
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,600
But you will still marry someone else.

512
00:31:59,913 --> 00:32:03,240
I don't know if I should thank you

513
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,760
or blame you.

514
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,800
I...

515
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,840
Now,

516
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,160
our priority

517
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
is to find the culprit

518
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,720
and resolve the crisis between both countries.

519
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,400
How could I forget that

520
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,560
a pine guqin would attract termites?

521
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,960
Pine guqins are most suitable for beginners.

522
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,960
That's it.

523
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,960
Yunchuan used this guqin

524
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,200
at my mansion.

525
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,960
That's right.

526
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,160
It's made by the delegation's
guqin master for Yunchuan.

527
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,880
She was interested

528
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,160
and practised for a few days.

529
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,040
Sister Su.

530
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
Did you find anything?

531
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,240
I searched everywhere.

532
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
Nothing seems unusual.

533
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,000
However,

534
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,320
the builder

535
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,800
of this inn

536
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,960
applied an insect resistant coating

537
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,320
to every wooden items here
for termite prevention.

538
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,120
There's actually a poison call Huanghuo

539
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,280
in insect resistant coatings.

540
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,400
Will the poison
from that half a bucket of coating

541
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,360
cause death?

542
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,080
Did the culprit poison Yunchuan with that?

543
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,200
Unless it's ingested,

544
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,080
otherwise, no one will be poisoned

545
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,840
let alone getting killed

546
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,840
by the negligible poison in the coating.

547
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
She was poisoned as well

548
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,880
but the symptoms are not obvious.

549
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,720
It's not severe.

550
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,360
Guards.

551
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:09,840
Yes.

552
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,040
Is it the same poison as the Princess's?

553
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,480
It's similar

554
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,639
but not identical.

555
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,520
It is strange.

556
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,040
She is the close maid of the Princess.

557
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,040
Do you think she came in contact
with the poison too?

558
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,440
I smell something strange in this room.

559
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,199
Is there an incense lit?

560
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,199
This is Yunchuan's favourite Baili Incense.

561
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,120
Are you talking about this?

562
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,120
I smell something else as well.

563
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,440
Rushuang.

564
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,960
Your Highness, it's time to act now.

565
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,360
Prince.

566
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,120
