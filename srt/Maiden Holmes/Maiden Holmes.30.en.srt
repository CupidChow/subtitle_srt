14
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,868
(Episode 30)

15
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,360
Your Highness, please take a look.

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,200
Everything is ready.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,720
Also, we're prepared
two large water tanks

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,880
in case

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,320
there's a fire.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,320
So this is Auspicious?

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,480
Yes, Your Highness.

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
More than a dozen craftsmen

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
spent nearly two months making it.

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,280
Several craftsmen couldn't stand it

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,360
and have fallen sick.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,560
You must be exhausted.

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,560
After the banquet,

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,400
I'll give everyone a handsome reward.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,040
Zhang, I'll leave it to you then.

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,320
Don't worry. Your Highness.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Are you all right?

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,080
Take it easy.

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
Get a physician to check up on them.

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
Don't let them get too exhausted.

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,680
Yes.

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
Farewell, Your Highness.

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
How's the preparation of food

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,480
coming along for the banquet?

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,880
I have checked.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,040
The food and utensils

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,560
have been checked several times.

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,600
So far, there is no problem.

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Good.

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,320
Verify it once more
with the Imperial Household Bureau.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
If there's anything,
you can ask for Eunuch Liu's help.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
Don't worry, Young Master.

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,880
From now on,

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
I'll protect you

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,640
in Brother Jiang's stead.

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Little Fei Yuan has grown up now.

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,646
(Mingjing Office)

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
Come on in.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,680
Su Ci.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,400
Here. Take a seat.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,120
How was the investigation?

57
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,675
(Case File)

58
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,750
(Case File)

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
What's with the
transportation of the poison?

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,440
This poison

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,320
is so lethal that a small amount
can be fatal.

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,760
But the most worrying thing now

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,240
is that the whereabouts

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,400
of the poison is unknown.

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,920
The Empress Dowager's birthday banquet
is around the corner.

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm afraid this is not that simple.

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Investigate it at once.

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
If you want any help,

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,480
come to me at any time.

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
All right.

71
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,240
My Lord.

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,280
Have you been feeling unwell lately?

73
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,000
When I just came in,

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,520
I smelled sulphur from you.

75
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,720
Are you on medication?

76
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,480
It's no big deal.

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,760
Perhaps, I've been too tired lately.

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
I've gotten some scabies.

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,160
So I applied some medicine.

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,680
Perhaps, it's the smell of the medicine.

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,160
Take good care of yourself.

82
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:52,880
Don't worry.

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,320
Get to your work.

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,000
All right.

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,240
Su Ci.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
About the poison.

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,040
There is nothing definite at the moment.
Keep a lid on it.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
We haven't got to the bottom of it.

89
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,600
If this gets out,

90
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,840
it will cause unnecessary panic.

91
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Yes.

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,800
The Ministry of Rites and I have agreed
on the arrangements for tomorrow.

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,560
Your Majesty, Your Highness,
please have a look.

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,160
How long will the fireworks last?

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,560
If it lasts too long, I might feel tired.

96
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,680
Your Highness.

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
There are 600 fireworks this time around.

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,240
The last one

99
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,560
called Auspicious

100
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,400
is specially made
for your birthday banquet.

101
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,920
But if Your Highness thinks
it takes too long,

102
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,360
I can cut down some of it.

103
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,880
Mother's birthday
is a national celebration.

104
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,520
Since the fireworks have been made,

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
just go with the plan then.

106
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,560
All right.

107
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,680
How's the guard arrangement?

108
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,960
All the ministers will be attending
the banquet.

109
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,240
There are some invited officials

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,880
and craftsmen who will be setting off
the fireworks.

111
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,920
There will be many people in and out.

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Don't let anything go wrong.

113
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
Don't worry, Your Highness.

114
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,080
Commander Fu and I
have made the arrangements.

115
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,480
We'll make sure everything is in order.

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,880
At that time,
there'll be strict inspection

117
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,800
at all the entry and exit points
of the palace.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
We'll make sure it's absolutely safe.

119
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,840
That's great then.

120
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,640
(Zhaoyang Stage)
Young Master, look.

121
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
The weather is so good today.

122
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,760
I was worried it would rain.

123
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,720
Your Highness.

124
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,000
Well,

125
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
do you have any further instructions?

126
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,200
Have you checked inside
and outside the palace?

127
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,160
The palace is as secure as an iron bucket.

128
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,720
Nothing will go wrong.

129
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,640
Thank you, Ziyou.

130
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,760
Come on in.

131
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,680
My Lord.

132
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,320
Why did you ask to see me
early in the morning?

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,960
The villagers in Zhushui Village

134
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,680
outside the capital got poisoned
from the drinking water.

135
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,200
Poisoned?

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
When did this happen?

137
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,160
What are the symptoms?

138
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Since last night,

139
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
many people have had vomiting, diarrhea,
and breathing difficulty.

140
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,040
Do you think it has anything to do

141
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,280
with that poison?

142
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,240
Today is the Empress Dowager's
birthday banquet.

143
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,000
That batch of stolen poison

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,880
and Tian Yong's murder.

145
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,200
Is someone trying to start a rebellion?

146
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,360
It's indeed suspicious.

147
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,400
But why did they release poison
outside the city?

148
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,120
Look.

149
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,720
The river in Zhushui Village
leads directly to the capital.

150
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
In other words,

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
it is the source of drinking water
for the capital.

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
Could it really be that batch of poison?

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,600
If they poisoned the water source,

154
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,920
the people in the capital...

155
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,559
It's too early to jump to conclusion now.

156
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,280
How about this?

157
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,960
Take a few men with you
to investigate the matter.

158
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,520
I'll examine the water in the capital.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,720
Yes.

160
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll get to it now.

161
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Hold on.

162
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,600
My Lord.

163
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,880
Today is the Empress Dowager's
birthday banquet.

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
Don't bother too many people.

165
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
Bring only a few men with you.

166
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,040
Dress up as ordinary men.

167
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,200
Yes.

168
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,080
Remember.

169
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,080
Don't get too engrossed
in the investigation. Be careful.

170
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,640
You're working too hard on investigation.

172
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,600
Just like me

173
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
when I first came to the capital.

174
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
But it's cruel and unpredictable
working in the government.

175
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,280
Remember.

176
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,080
Don't trust anyone easily.

177
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,000
My Lord.

178
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,360
You, on the other hand,

179
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,000
have been busy with work lately.

180
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,320
Take good care of yourself.

181
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
I'm fine.

182
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,720
Be careful in everything you do.

183
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,600
Don't worry.

184
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,800
I shall take my leave.

185
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,840
Be careful.

186
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,760
Detective Su.

187
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,640
Zhushui Village should be right there.

188
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,680
We're half way through the journey now.

189
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,000
Why don't we take a break here?

190
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,120
We'd better not get exhausted

191
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,960
before we get there.

192
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,960
All right. Let's take a break.

193
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,200
All right.

194
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,920
Brother Su.

195
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,640
Drink some water.

196
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,440
Thank you.

197
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,520
Rushuang, here.

198
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,440
Brother Xie.

199
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,920
When will we get there?

200
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
I guess

201
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,720
we'll only get there afternoon.

202
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,600
It's too late.

203
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,160
We have to check the villagers
who have got poisoned.

204
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,880
Even if there is nothing serious,

205
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,080
we can't go back to the palace
to watch the fireworks.

206
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Let's investigate the poisoning
at the village.

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,320
Nothing else matters

208
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
compared to the safety
of the people.

209
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,600
Rushuang.

210
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,680
If you want to watch it,

211
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,040
I'll get my men

212
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,000
to find all the best craftsmen

213
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,480
to make you the largest
and most beautiful firework.

214
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
That's good.

215
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,200
Let's hit the road.

216
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,240
All right.

217
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,440
Let's go.

218
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,160
This way.

219
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,320
What's wrong?

220
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,920
Nothing. Let's go.

221
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,120
Let's go.

222
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,560
Detective Su.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,640
There is the only river near this village.

224
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,280
It should be the source.

225
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,920
Let's get some water.

226
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,520
Rushuang, be careful.

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
Rushuang, check this out.

228
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,760
This powder is...

229
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,440
Someone really did pour
poison into the river.

230
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,960
Hope things go well
in the capital.

231
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,760
Sister Su, I'm done.

232
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's go and see the patients.

233
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,640
All right.

234
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,840
Indeed, it's not Udumbara.

235
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
It should be the thunder duke vine.

236
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
Thank goodness.

237
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,680
Sirs.

238
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm the village chief of Zhushui Village.

239
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,640
I'm Su Ci of Mingjing Office.

240
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,200
I'm here to investigate the water sources
and villagers' poisoning.

241
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,480
That's great.

242
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,640
I just came back from filing a report.

243
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,000
I thought all of  you

244
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,280
would only be here in the evening.

245
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I didn't expect you to come so quickly.

246
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,000
It's so great!

247
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,880
-Thank you so much.
-Chief.

248
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Please get up.

249
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,800
Chief.

250
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,840
When did you say

251
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,520
you went to file a report?

252
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,000
I set out before dawn.

253
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,480
I reached the government office
around 9 o'clock in the morning.

254
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,880
Besides you,

255
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,560
is there anyone else who has been to
the capital to report?

256
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,200
No.

257
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,840
Only me.

258
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,240
Miss, please take a look.

259
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,800
His pulse is different.

260
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,240
He's been poisoned with Udumbara.

261
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,160
Look.

262
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,560
There's a red line.

263
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,360
This means he was poisoned
at least five days ago.

264
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,160
This is weird.

265
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,200
We can't find the poison in the capital.

266
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,920
Why would this man

267
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,040
come in contact with it?

268
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,680
Sir.

269
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,600
What do you work as?

270
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm a craftsman from the Directorate
for the Palace Buildings.

271
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
Recently, I have been making fireworks

272
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,840
for the Empress Dowager's
birthday banquet.

273
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,080
When did your condition worsen?

274
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,160
Just a few days ago.

275
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,360
We've been busy working on
the fireworks

276
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,080
for the Empress Dowager's
birthday banquet.

277
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,240
Take it easy.

278
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,600
No.

279
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
What's wrong?

280
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,520
This is a trap.

281
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,400
Someone lured us here on purpose.

282
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,000
Something is going to happen
in the capital.

283
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,600
Today is the Empress Dowager's
birthday banquet.

284
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,240
What could possibly happen?

285
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,280
Rushuang.

286
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,560
How bad it will be
if the two jars of poison

287
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,080
are mixed in the fireworks?

288
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,320
Sister Su, are you kidding me?

289
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,720
How is that possible?

290
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,840
Answer me first.

291
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,160
This...

292
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,280
I...

293
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm not sure either.

294
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,000
But no one in the palace would survive.

295
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Also, the powder will be
deadly if it's inhaled.

296
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240
Sister Su.

297
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,960
I've prepared a huge surprise

298
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,880
for them.

299
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,000
Detective Su!

300
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,760
If we continue to ride at this speed,

301
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,760
the horses may not make it for us
to go back.

302
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,280
The city gate will be closed in an hour.

303
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
It will be too late then.

304
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,880
Let's go.

305
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,920
After tailing us for so long,

306
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,160
you have finally showed up.

307
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,240
Brother Su.

308
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,800
You go first.

309
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
It's urgent. Be careful.

310
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,440
Your Majesty.

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,680
Your Highness.

312
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,880
Shall we begin?

313
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,120
Mother.

314
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,760
Brother.

315
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,080
Let's begin.

316
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,210
(Anhua Gate)

317
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,800
Stop!

318
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,880
Who are you?

319
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,840
Su Ci of Mingjing Office!

320
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,880
Urgent mater. I need to enter the city.

321
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,800
Yes!

322
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,480
It has already begun.

323
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,840
I hope it's not too late.

324
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:30,734
(Zhaoyang Stage)

325
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,640
Mother.

326
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,360
Today's fireworks
are carefully designed by brother.

327
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,840
It's very creative.

328
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,880
Prince Qi, that's thoughtful of you.

329
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,160
It's what I should do.

330
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
But I'm getting old now.

331
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,840
I'm afraid I'd be too tired.

332
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,080
Your Highness.

333
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,120
I heard

334
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,400
that the last two fireworks tonight
are very special.

335
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,960
One of them is called Gorgeous Peony,

336
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,840
whose name is
extremely graceful and elegant.

337
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,200
As for the last one,

338
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,840
it's one of a kind.

339
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,440
It's called Auspicious.

340
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,960
It is said that there are over 100 shots
which can reach the sky,

341
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,360
like a phoenix soaring in the sky.

342
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,480
It's spectacular.

343
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,880
What a pity that

344
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,000
my wife does not feel well

345
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,720
and is unable to enjoy
such spectacular scenery with us.

346
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,680
Aunt has always loved to enjoy the fun.

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,840
She was here this afternoon.

348
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,200
But I heard she's not feeling well

349
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,640
and uncle sent her home.

350
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,520
That's right. Health comes first.

351
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,320
All of us are getting old already.

352
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,760
We can't act willfully now.

353
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,760
Your Highness is right.

354
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,720
Mother, what are you talking about?

355
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,160
You're not old at all.

356
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,520
Here, to your health.

357
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,440
Wishing you many happy returns of the day.

358
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,480
To Her Highness!

359
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,120
May Your Highness be blessed
with happiness and longevity.

360
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,680
Who's that?

361
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,040
Su Ci of Mingjing Office.

362
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,400
I have the invitation card from Prince Qi.

363
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,360
You may go in.

364
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,920
Yes.

365
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,760
It's so beautiful.

366
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,920
The Gorgeous Peony is really awesome.

367
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,160
What a rare sighting.

368
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,000
That's right.

369
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,360
Your Highness, something happened
in your residence.

370
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,160
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

371
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,960
I have been informed

372
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,200
that my wife's condition has worsened.

373
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm very worried.

374
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,600
I would like to take my leave.

375
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,040
That's not good.

376
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
Go back now.

377
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,320
Uncle, go home at once.

378
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

379
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Your Highness.

380
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,560
I shall take my leave.

381
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,040
Officer Liu.

382
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,640
Here.

383
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,760
Rushuang.

384
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,720
Listen to me.

385
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,200
Go home earlier.

386
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,280
Why?

387
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,320
Don't just use poisonous powder
whenever you encounter any danger.

388
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,760
You can still run away
if you can't beat them.

389
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,480
Rushuang.

390
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,440
When you get home, don't ever come out.

391
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,440
Are you not coming back with me?

392
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,400
I might not be coming back today.

393
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,080
Don't wait up for me.

394
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,120
I'll get going.

395
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,280
Why should I listen to that nerd?

396
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
I'll go.

397
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,640
Fei Yuan!

398
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,680
Sister Su?

399
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,200
Fei Yuan.

400
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,840
Sister Su.

401
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,520
It's great that you're here.

402
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,800
Where will the fireworks be set off?

403
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
On the south side of the square.

404
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,320
Fei Yuan.

405
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,120
Something is wrong with the fireworks.

406
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,480
They're mixed with poison.

407
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,600
What?

408
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,680
There's no time to explain.

409
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,560
Inform His Highness at once.

410
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,200
Lead the way for Detective Su.

411
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,320
I'll inform His Highness.

412
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,840
Hurry.

413
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,200
Yes.

414
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,960
Hurry.

415
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,080
Young Master.

416
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,360
Here.

417
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,480
The next one should be the Auspicious.

418
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,800
That's right.

419
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,440
I bet it will be even more beautiful.

420
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,600
Mother, the fireworks are really nice.

421
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,120
Your Majesty.

422
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,360
Your Highness.

423
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,680
The fireworks feast is about to end.

424
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,040
Things will easily go wrong
at times like this.

425
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,640
I'll check on the security matters

426
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,760
for safety.

427
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,200
Father.

428
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,160
Ming.

429
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,240
You came just in time.

430
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
The show is about to begin.

431
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Detective Su, here it is.

432
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,440
Stop!

433
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,040
Miss, please stay away.

434
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,280
Stop at once.

435
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,520
This is where fireworks are set off.

436
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,520
Please leave at once.

437
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,280
Stop!

438
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,000
Arrest them!

439
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,880
Little Su.

440
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,000
Little Su.

441
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,120
Come on.

442
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,760
Your Highness.

443
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,720
I'll leave the rest to you.

444
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,680
Yes.

445
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,680
Why did the fireworks stop?

446
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,440
Why did the fireworks stop?

447
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,720
This is...

448
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
Why did it stop?

449
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,560
Your Majesty.

450
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,600
It looks like Auspicious

451
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,560
hasn't been set off.

452
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,120
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

453
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,240
Assassins broke into the south side
where fireworks were set off.

454
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,360
They have been subdued.

455
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,440
What?

456
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,520
To ensure safety,

457
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,040
Prince Qi advises everyone
to move to the main hall

458
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,600
in case there are assassins nearby.

459
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,960
Why it's so quiet?

460
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,760
Could they

461
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,360
have discovered it?

462
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,640
Father.

463
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,120
Shall we take any actions

464
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,200
or...

465
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,720
The Auspicious

466
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,760
is just part of my plan.

467
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,360
My ultimate move

468
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,960
is yet to come.

469
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,000
No matter what happens tonight,

470
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,600
I'm going to take the throne!

471
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,840
Li Yu.

472
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Return to the banquet
and check up on the suicide squads.

473
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,280
If they fall into Xiao Yanzhi's hands,

474
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,000
kill them all.

475
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,960
Yes, my Lord.

476
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,720
Ming.

477
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,080
Prince Qi is conspiring to rebel.

478
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,200
You

479
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,160
come with me
leading troops to arrest His Majesty!

480
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,320
Yes.

481
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,160
Young Master.

482
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,600
Young Master.

483
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,720
Let me carry her.

484
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,320
We need to find a room at once.

485
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,280
Brother Pei!

486
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,800
Brother Pei, what happened to Sister Su?

487
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,440
Her head got hit hard
and she passed out.

488
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,560
Come with me.

489
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Come inside.

490
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,720
Wait for me.

491
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,240
I'll leave her to you.

492
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,200
There's poison in the fireworks?

493
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
This is an attempt to wipe out His Majesty

494
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,080
and all the officials.

495
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,400
How vicious is that.

496
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,840
It's my negligence.

497
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,680
Your Majesty, please punish me.

498
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,680
Brother, you...

499
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,520
You're in charge.

500
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,320
Do you think

501
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,280
you can just muddle through it
by saying that?

502
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,920
Your Majesty!

503
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,640
Your Highness!

504
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,160
Uncle.

505
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,280
Why are you here?

506
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,520
Your Majesty.

507
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,600
Your Highness.

508
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,440
I heard there were assassins
at the fireworks feast.

509
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,880
So I rushed over.

510
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,400
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

511
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,240
Forgive me for coming late.

512
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,720
Prince Yun, please rise.

513
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

514
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,840
This isn't just about the assassins.

515
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,200
Someone had added poison to the fireworks.

516
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,560
What?

517
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,120
How could it happen?

518
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,560
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

519
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,400
Please investigate this matter thoroughly.

520
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
Your Highness is right.

521
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,560
Please give me a chance

522
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,440
to redeem myself
and make up for my mistakes

523
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
by finding out the truth.

524
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,120
Your Majesty.

525
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,320
Your Highness.

526
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,920
The fireworks feast was supervised
by him.

527
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,680
If he led the investigation
on this matter,

528
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm afraid he'd cover up for himself.

529
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,720
So, I hope Your Majesty

530
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,480
to hand this matter over
to Mingjing Office.

531
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,800
Prince Qi.

532
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,360
You were responsible
for my birthday banquet.

533
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,720
Now, something like this

534
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,400
happened at the birthday banquet.

535
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,680
You should sit this one out.

536
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,640
Do it as suggested by Prince Yun.

537
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,520
Hand it to Officer Liu of Mingjing Office
to investigate the matter.

538
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,960
You're right, Your Highness.

539
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,920
Yes, Your Highness.

540
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,000
Since I'm a suspect

541
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,760
I shall take my leave

542
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,000
and return to my residence
waiting for the result.

543
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,560
Hold on.

544
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,960
Before we get to the bottom of things,

545
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,800
please stay in the palace.

546
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,400
What do you mean?

547
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,600
Nothing.

548
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,000
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

549
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,800
Please stay in the palace.

550
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,120
Confining and keeping me grounded?

551
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,520
Very well.

552
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,240
I shall wait here then.

553
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

554
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
After this is over

555
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,360
I'll pay Your Highness a visit
and extend my apologies.

556
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,560
Your Highness.

557
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,800
The fireworks feast
is planned and prepared by you.

558
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,640
I have some questions for you.

559
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,760
All right.

560
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll give you my full cooperation.

561
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,920
Please come with me.

562
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,400
This is the order from the Lord.

563
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,880
Your Majesty.

564
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,880
Your Highness.

565
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,320
Bad news.

566
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,200
The craftsmen in charge of fireworks
who had been caught earlier

567
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,560
just died in prison!

568
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,800
What?

569
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,040
What happened?

570
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,440
According to the coroner,

571
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,040
all of them died of poisoning.

572
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,640
Perhaps, they were killed to silent them.

573
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,800
Who did this?

574
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,120
How bold of him!

575
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,880
Summon Liu Xuan!

576
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,120
Those who are related to the case,
bring them here.

577
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,400
Have a face-to-face confrontation here!

578
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,960
Sister Su.

579
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,360
How do you feel?

580
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,840
Don't get up in a hurry.

581
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,240
How do you feel?

582
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,160
The fireworks.

583
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,160
How did it go?

584
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,080
Don't worry.
The fireworks weren't set off.

585
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,120
No one's hurt.

586
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
That's great.

587
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,120
But...

588
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,760
No.

589
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
No. Young Master is in trouble!

590
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,060
Young Master, look.

591
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,740
The weather is so good today.

592
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,740
I was worried it would rain.

593
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,300
Your Highness.

594
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,220
Do you have any further instructions?

595
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,500
Have you checked inside
and outside the palace?

596
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,540
Don't worry.

597
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,700
The palace is as secure as an iron bucket.

598
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,100
Nothing will go wrong.

599
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,820
Thank you, Ziyou.
