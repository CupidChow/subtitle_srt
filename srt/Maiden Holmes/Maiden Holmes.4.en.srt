(Episode 4)

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
You're such an interesting man.

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
I apologise for

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,240
spoiling your mood.

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,720
Get me two bottles of good wine, please.

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Besides, I'll treat

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
this gentleman over here too.

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,480
Thank you, childe.

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,320
Thank you for your treat.

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,240
Hey, you. I'm calling you.

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,560
Move a chair here.

25
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,320
All right.

26
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,880
Come here, Brother. Join me.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Come here.

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,520
Have a seat, childe.

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,760
You don't look like a citizen
from Liang dynasty.

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
Are you from the Western Region?

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
You're so observant.

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,880
Yes, I'm from the Western Region.

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,400
My father had business
with western foreign merchants.

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,440
That's why you look familiar to me.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,640
What business is your family running?

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,320
Just a small business.
It's not a big deal.

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,160
Here. Cheers.

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
You're elegant.

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,040
You must come from a notable family.

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,840
It's not convenient

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,760
to talk about this here.

42
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,400
All right.

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Childe,

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll be selecting a dancing girl

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,560
in my room tomorrow.

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,720
Would you like to join me

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
tomorrow?

48
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,680
Sure.

49
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,680
Here. Cheers.

50
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,120
Great.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,520
Cheers.

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,920
I really don't want to go.

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,200
Brother Pei

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,040
forces me to go.

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,200
Just go. That's a good place.

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,920
No, it's not good at all.

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,720
Places like that are glitzy.

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,520
A gentleman shouldn't go there.

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Don't say that.

60
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,280
Men are like that. I get it.

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,240
Rushuang,

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,320
are you giving up on me?

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,360
No.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,160
I'm sure you are.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
I get it.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,320
You've given up on me.

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,360
What's he talking about?

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,960
Come in, please.

69
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,880
You're beautiful.

70
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,440
It's been ages since
I met a beauty like you.

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,200
Great!

72
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,600
Work hard tonight.

73
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,800
You'll be rewarded.

74
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,960
Yes.

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,320
What's wrong?

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm not going.

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,280
Go by yourself if you want.

78
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
I wonder who will be selected.

79
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,600
Right. The result is not out yet.

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,680
That's enough. No point in guessing that.

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,600
Hold on for a while.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,560
Not bad.

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,680
Go in.

84
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
Remove your veil and
let me take a look at your face.

85
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,920
Master,

86
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,800
if you want me to remove my veil

87
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,800
just take it slow.

88
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,400
If you can't fulfil my requirement later

89
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,400
it's not just your veil I'm going to remove.

90
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,000
Here.

91
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,840
Cheers.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,840
Cheers.

93
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,040
I can't believe someone in Qingshui County

94
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,360
knows the Zhezhi Dance of the West Region.

95
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,400
Unbelievable.

96
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,920
Great job.

97
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,080
You can go now.

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,720
Please leave now.

99
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,040
Are you rejecting me to draw my attention?

100
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
Interesting.

101
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,840
Master Sha,

102
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
you've to share this beauty with me.

103
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,320
Master Sha.

104
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
Just stop dancing.

105
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,640
Come and

106
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,400
drink with me.

107
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,480
Master,

108
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,200
why don't I perform another dance for you?

109
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Great!

110
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,960
Great!

111
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,200
Let's dance together.

112
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,520
Why is the bottom

113
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
part of this chest so thick and solid?

114
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,640
You...

115
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,120
Shouldn't you...

116
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,160
I should be unconscious

117
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,680
and lay there with Sha Du,

118
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,680
right?

119
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,360
You think I couldn't see through

120
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,240
your little tricks?

121
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,800
What are you doing here?

122
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,400
Do you know me?

123
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,040
Stop talking nonsense. Give me that.

124
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,800
Something is going on in the room. Come on.

125
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,600
Master Sha.

126
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,440
Master Sha.

127
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Master Sha.

128
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,600
Stop right there.

129
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Wake up, Master Sha.

130
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,040
Stop right there.

131
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,800
Master Sha.

132
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Dance.

133
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,200
-Let's drink.
-Master Sha.

134
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,800
Could it be you?

135
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,040
He is so frivolous

136
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,800
and filled with lust.

137
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
Why am I angry?

138
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,600
Officer Su.

139
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,520
Officer Su, open the door.

140
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,400
Officer Su.

141
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,400
What's wrong?

142
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,440
Young Master was drinking with a man

143
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,320
and the man is dead now.

144
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,320
Please go and take a look now.

145
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,600
What happened?

146
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,840
The victim is Sha Du from the Worry-free Bar.

147
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,360
He was murdered just now.

148
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,320
And the suspect is Brother Pei.

149
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
How did this man die?

150
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,120
How is this happening?

151
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,360
He must be the murderer.

152
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,200
Right.

153
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,480
He's so arrogant.

154
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
Why is this happening?

155
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,760
God knows.

156
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,640
He thought he is beyond the law.

157
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,640
Young Master.

158
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,240
I'm Su Ci from Mingjing Office.

159
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,200
Please help us, Officer Su.

160
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,520
Are you all right, Young Master?

161
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,040
Brother Pei, what is going on?

162
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,800
There's no person in charge
in the County Court recently.

163
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,120
I'm worried about this.

164
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,480
Right.

165
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,160
The murderer is over there.

166
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,920
Then I'll leave it to you, Brother Su.

167
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,480
Brother Su,

168
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,560
don't you need me to report the case to you?

169
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,800
I can look into it myself.

170
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,960
I'm going to stay over there.

171
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,840
No sign of poisoning.

172
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,240
There's no wound on his body.

173
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
But I found this in his mouth.

174
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,320
What's this?

175
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,120
This is called the golden leaf.

176
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,960
People eat this to regain their energy.

177
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,840
But if one eats too much of it

178
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,280
it will easily cause a sudden death.

179
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,240
You really are a woman.

180
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,360
It's cold.

181
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,720
What's going on?

182
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,080
I'm not sure.

183
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,720
Right.

184
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,760
I think he died of alcohol overdose.

185
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,440
There's nothing much to be investigated.

186
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,320
You're right.

187
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,200
It's been so long and they don't let us go home.

188
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,320
This is unacceptable.

189
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,080
Young Master,

190
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,600
why doesn't Officer Su say something?

191
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Can she solve the case?

192
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,200
Just wait for it.

193
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,400
She's about to make it.

194
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,880
Officer Su,

195
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,520
why don't we...

196
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,160
The victim didn't suffer
a sudden myocardial infarction.

197
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,960
He was murdered.

198
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,880
What? He was murdered?

199
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,240
And the murderer is still here in this room.

200
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,080
It's not a sudden death?

201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,040
The murderer

202
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,200
should be Childe Pei.

203
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,240
You...

204
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,520
Childe Pei.

205
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,680
Right. He's the murderer.

206
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,240
I think that he is the most suspicious too.

207
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,720
Who sat here last night?

208
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,000
Please show yourself.

209
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,280
Do you remember who sat here last night?

210
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,280
We did.

211
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,600
Both of them?

212
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,760
Who are they?

213
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,840
They don't look like murderer.

214
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
That's right.

215
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,920
What's wrong?

216
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,560
What do they have to do with this case?

217
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,680
Right.

218
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,680
According to the trajectory
of the murder weapon,

219
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,920
the murderer

220
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,079
was near this table.

221
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,200
Brother Su,

222
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,920
what's the murder weapon?

223
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,160
There's no sign of the murder weapon.

224
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,280
It's an ice needle.

225
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,560
Ice needle?

226
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,720
What's an ice needle?

227
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,680
We really didn't murder him.

228
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,280
Yes.

229
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,000
Please think about it carefully.

230
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Was there anyone else around you

231
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,000
when Sha Du died?

232
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,200
No.

233
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,760
I didn't notice there's anyone around us too.

234
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,440
Right.

235
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,320
We were drinking just now.

236
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,120
Boss,

237
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,600
your tobacco bag is wet.

238
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,040
That's not a big deal.

239
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,160
That's not a big deal.

240
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,880
If your tobacco bag is wet,

241
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,680
the tobacco inside it can't be used anymore.

242
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
That's not a big deal.

243
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,200
In that case, can I borrow it
to juice up my brain?

244
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,160
I remember it now.

245
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,200
Boss Ye was here proposing a toast

246
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,480
when the foreigner died.

247
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,480
Yes.

248
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,320
Right. I saw it too.

249
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,800
Brother Su.

250
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,360
Brother Su, watch out!

251
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Stop it.

252
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,400
I...

253
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,560
Well...

254
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,360
How's she?

255
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,440
She's dead.

256
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,320
Alas.

257
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
What are you talking about?

258
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
I haven't figure out

259
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,280
why she murdered Sha Du.

260
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,160
Nor do I know who is
behind all these.

261
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,920
Is it related to the death of Magistrate Kong?

262
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,520
Well, Hong Ye was very loaded.

263
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,480
There are gems on her clothes.

264
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,440
Her clothes are much more beautiful

265
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,880
than those of the Lixiang Restaurant owner.

266
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
Rosin powder.

267
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,320
Hong Ye was secretive.

268
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,960
We couldn't find anything in her room.

269
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
The ledger.

270
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,320
I'm going to take a look at Sha Du's room.

271
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,960
Me too.

272
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,400
Let's go, Young Master.

273
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,480
Brother Su, you seem familiar with

274
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,800
the location of the secret drawer.

275
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,520
Well, there are only
a few types of secret drawers.

276
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,440
I've seen them before,
of course I'm familiar with it.

277
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,040
I see.

278
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,120
Well,

279
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,520
a dancing girl

280
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,960
sneaked into this room as well.

281
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,960
What dancing girl?

282
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,320
Was she beautiful?

283
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,320
You know me well.

284
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,440
My eyesight is bad.

285
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,680
I couldn't see her face clearly.

286
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,840
But

287
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,080
she must be beautiful I suppose.

288
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,880
Sha Du did ask all the dancing girls

289
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,160
to dance in the main hall.

290
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
We must find her out.

291
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,880
If Sha Du spent less time
on the ladies and wine,

292
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,840
maybe he could live a little longer.

293
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,120
Brother Pei,

294
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,920
you've got to learn from this lesson.

295
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
Stop living a life like this.

296
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,280
You're right, Brother Xie.

297
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
I owe it to you, Brother Su.

298
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,960
Thank you so much for your help.

299
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
I'm just doing my job.

300
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,720
Rosin powder again.

301
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,320
Officer Su,

302
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,000
someone is looking for you.

303
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,640
I...

304
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,760
I'm not sure if this is useful to your case.

305
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,960
It's okay. Just tell us what you know.

306
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,880
Our boss

307
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,760
had a lover.

308
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,640
What's so strange about that?

309
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,800
He's very weird.

310
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,840
No one knew his whereabouts.

311
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,480
None of us knew about him.

312
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,040
Then how do you know about it?

313
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,200
One day...

314
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,280
Boss.

315
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,640
Boss, something bad happened.

316
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,600
What's wrong?

317
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,000
Childe Wang and Master Sun get into a fight.

318
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,360
A rectangular scar.

319
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,160
Do you still remember what it looked like?

320
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,680
Here you go, Officer.

321
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,440
I've never seen a stamp like this before.

322
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,000
Brother Su,

323
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,960
do you think that

324
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,000
this scar looks like
the one being stamped on prisoners?

325
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,080
Where did you get this ledger?

326
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
It's a coincidence.

327
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,440
Someone helped me to get this.

328
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,240
I've glanced through this ledger.

329
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,640
Sha Du was very discreet.

330
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Nothing was recorded

331
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,840
on the black market deal in these five years.

332
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,160
But the amounts of the recent deals

333
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,800
match that of

334
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,080
the lost official silver.

335
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,720
This batch of disaster relief silver

336
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,480
has mostly gone into the black market.

337
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,560
Prince,

338
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm afraid someone is plotting surreptitiously.

339
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,080
Magistrate Kong.

340
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,760
Sha Du.

341
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,400
Hong Ye.

342
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,160
This arrow

343
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,640
is the assassin's weapon by the Qingshui River.

344
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,000
It doesn't look like the ordinary arrow.

345
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,920
It looks like the arrow produced in Beirong.

346
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,560
I've written a letter.

347
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,480
Send this arrow along with the letter

348
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
to the marquis.

349
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,320
Yes.

350
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,000
Hold on.

351
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,520
Check the background of Su Ci
from Mingjing Office.

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,520
I need to take a look at the ledger.

353
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,960
Who's there?

354
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,720
It's so hot here.

355
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,640
Brother Su,

356
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,360
what are you doing here?

357
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,760
Brother Su,

358
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,920
are you sleepwalking?

359
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,560
Brother Su, you sleepwalk to my room.

360
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,120
Do you have any feelings for me?

361
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,520
Who has feelings for you?

362
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,840
Since Brother Su is not sleepwalking

363
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,880
and you don't have any feelings for me,

364
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,840
what are you doing here in my room

365
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,640
at midnight?

366
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,440
Are you here

367
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,480
to discuss the case with me?

368
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,960
Yes.

369
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,200
I'm here to discuss the case with you.

370
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Is it about the dancing girl that I told you?

371
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,560
You find her suspicious too?

372
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,120
It won't be a problem

373
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,560
if you want to find her.

374
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,800
I heard that

375
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,880
although that dancing girl is a rookie

376
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,720
she was selected on that day

377
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
and outstripped all other beauties.

378
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,560
All dancing girls in the bar

379
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,040
have a deep impression on her.

380
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,400
If you don't mind

381
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,120
tomorrow I can...

382
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,840
I'm the dancing girl.

383
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,560
She admits it pretty easily.

384
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,600
I heard that Magistrate Kong

385
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,160
was closed to Sha Du before he died

386
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,320
from the government office.

387
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,400
It's hard to befriend Sha Du.
But he liked beautiful women.

388
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,680
So

389
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,920
I disguised myself as a woman.

390
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,280
I see.

391
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,560
But

392
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,680
you looked great in woman's clothes.

393
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
I thought you were a woman too.

394
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,040
Well,

395
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,520
I got the idea from Thousand-faced Man.

396
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,480
Well, you did sacrifice a lot

397
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,440
for your duty.

398
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,000
Sha Du did say that

399
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,680
he didn't just want to remove

400
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,760
your veil.

401
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,280
You...

402
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,320
He was such a scumbag for saying that.

403
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,280
He was bad.

404
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,120
What are you doing with that

405
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,880
in the middle of the night?

406
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,280
I...

407
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,360
Actually, that day

408
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,440
I went to investigate Sha Du on purpose.

409
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,440
I'm serious.

410
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,680
I heard that

411
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,000
a black market trader
checked into Worry-free Bar.

412
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,360
I was wondering

413
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,960
if he had anything to do with
the disaster relief fund.

414
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,880
So I befriended him on purpose.

415
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,560
Well, you seemed to enjoy yourself that day.

416
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,840
I did that to deceive Sha Du.

417
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,080
Hold on.

418
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,280
Don't you want to know my discovery?

419
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Take a look at this.

420
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,040
It's the same day
as we found the official silver in the river.

421
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,560
There really was some deal between

422
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,040
Magistrate Kong and Sha Du.

423
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,720
And now the money and the stocks are all gone.

424
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
The relevant people

425
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,480
are all dead.

426
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,160
No.

427
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,560
The pieces of silver should be here.

428
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,920
Today,

429
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,520
when I was checking
Sha Du's and Hong Ye's rooms,

430
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,160
I noticed that both of their clothes

431
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,920
had rosin powder on them.

432
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
Besides that,
the soil that covered the rosin powder

433
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,840
found on Sha Du's shoes looked fresh,

434
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,400
which means

435
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,600
they were there recently.

436
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,920
In that case,

437
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,680
they must have put the pieces of silver

438
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,080
in a warehouse.

439
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
When they were leaving the warehouse

440
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,400
the rosin powder got stuck
on their clothes and shoes.

441
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,080
Rosin powder

442
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,000
is normally stored in a cool and dry place.

443
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,720
Dry.

444
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,040
Most residents live
in the southwest part of the County.

445
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,760
The weather there is perfect.
And there are a few rivers.

446
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,720
The North-east region
is located on higher ground.

447
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,480
The forest at the border is thick.

448
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,240
The wind is blocked by the hills.

449
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,880
So it is at the mountain foot in the northeast.

450
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,600
There's a road on each side.

451
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,120
Which road should we take?

452
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,640
Don't tell me we're mistaken.

453
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,280
It's not like a warehouse

454
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,640
is in such middle of nowhere.

455
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,320
Over there.

456
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,040
Look. We've found it.

457
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,400
It seems like it's hard to open this lock.

458
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,400
Brother Xie,

459
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,360
that's amazing.

460
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,600
Well.

461
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,120
Here it is.

462
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,560
There're lots of dishes today.

463
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,080
Little Fei Yuan, you're awesome.

464
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Have a seat.

465
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,720
Brother Su,

466
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,960
I'd like to propose a toast for you
before we eat.

467
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,120
Brother Su,

468
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,720
you solved the Robbery by Dragon King

469
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,040
and recovered the disaster relief fund.

470
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,560
This is a good deed.

471
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,600
Cheers.

472
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,920
Cheers, Brother Su.

473
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,640
You've solved a big case. Congratulations!

474
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,840
I can't...

475
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,080
I know you can't drink wine.

476
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,360
But you can learn, right?

477
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,640
As a man

478
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,320
how can you not drink wine?

479
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,080
Come on.

480
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,480
Right. Just drink a little.

481
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,200
Since everyone is so happy, right?

482
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,760
That's right.

483
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Come on.

484
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,800
Let me drink for him.

485
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,640
Brother Pei,

486
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,960
how can you drink on his behalf?

487
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,720
Right.

488
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,720
He can't drink, so let me take it for him.

489
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,320
All right.

490
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,080
This wine tastes good.

491
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,800
This is a special wine from Feiyun Manor.

492
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,120
You can only find it here.

493
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,320
I'll use tea as a replacement of wine
to express my gratitude.

494
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,719
First of all, I'd like to thank Little Fei Yuan.

495
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,760
You prepared all the dishes
that we're going to have.

496
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,080
It's been a long time since I've dined at ease.

497
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,000
This is for you.

498
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,159
Cheers.

499
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,080
Officer Su,

500
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,320
if you want to eat delicious dishes,

501
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,400
just come to the capital and find me.

502
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,360
Okay.

503
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,960
Brother Xie,

504
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,360
you're so enthusiastic.

505
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,639
You saved people under any circumstances.

506
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,360
You're a truthful man.

507
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
This is for you.

508
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,880
Brother Su,

509
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,679
you flatter me

510
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,280
with all the good words.

511
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,199
Cheers.

512
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,440
Rushuang,

513
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,120
thank you for helping me to solve the case.

514
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,600
You're honest and truthful.

515
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,400
I envy that.

516
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,640
Just envy?

517
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,840
Do you like me?

518
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,880
Sure.

519
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,240
Of course I like you.

520
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,800
Brother Pei,

521
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,560
Thank you for telling me Prince Qi's story.

522
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,040
That's...

523
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,640
That's it?

524
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,880
Brother Su has made a great speech.

525
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,400
Let's propose a toast for this.

526
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
You're right.

527
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,080
Cheers.

528
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,920
Come on.

529
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,360
Cheers.

530
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,560
I'm going to dive in now.

531
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,840
Right.

532
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,200
I'm hungry,

533
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,920
Little Fei Yuan,

534
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,120
your cooking is delicious.

535
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,960
Right?

536
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,760
I'm glad that you like it.

537
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,040
It's very delicious.

538
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,960
Brother Pei, where did you find this guy?

539
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,320
Can you lend him to me for a few days?

540
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,640
You wish.

541
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
I'm just joking.

542
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,840
There's a scent of wine in this dish.

543
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,800
This dish is called drunken chicken.

544
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,720
That's mine.
