(Episode 3)

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Get out!

16
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,640
We're both men.

17
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,320
Why do I have to step outside?

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,240
Are you all right?

19
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,640
I'm fine.

20
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,640
I brought you the ointment.

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,160
All right. Leave it at the door.

22
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,680
I'll get it later.

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
All right.

24
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,600
Young Master.

25
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,240
Are the noodles I made so awful?

26
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,960
Noodles?

27
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,880
What noodles?

28
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,240
The noodles, Young Master.

29
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,600
You've been staring at it.

30
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
I'll eat it at once.

31
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,160
Here.

32
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,760
Here, drink the soup.
It helps with digestion.

33
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,440
This is...

34
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,040
You didn't see it.

35
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
Such a large truck of food

36
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
is enough to keep the disaster victims fed for days.

37
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,720
You managed to raise food so quickly.

38
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,240
It looks like Ms. Rushuang
has put in a lot of effort.

39
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,560
That's for sure.

40
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Without Rushuang,

41
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
it would be impossible for me

42
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,280
to raise so much food myself.

43
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Such small matter isn't worth mentioning.

44
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
Rushuang is just so awesome.

45
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Officer Kong.

46
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
What do you mean by this?

47
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,280
I received a report from Lord Hu

48
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,480
that someone had trespassed
on private property,

49
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,800
injured the servants,

50
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,560
and looted property.

51
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
The perpetrators

52
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,920
were extremely arrogant

53
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,480
and tipped people into destitution.

54
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,840
I'm here to arrest them.

55
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Who did you say were the perpetrators?

56
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,920
Who trespassed on private property?

57
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,040
Who looted property?

58
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,040
That's him!

59
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,200
And this woman as well!

60
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,040
How could you

61
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,120
lie through your teeth?

62
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,160
We borrowed the food.

63
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,760
I've written the promissory note!

64
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,760
That's a bloody lie!

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,440
You got the food by robbing?

66
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,440
Rob the rich and help the poor.

67
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,680
Besides, we didn't steal.
We merely borrowed it.

68
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
Brother Xie even paid the interest.

69
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,720
Officer Kong.

70
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,360
Is there any misunderstanding?

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,200
Is there?

72
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,760
No!

73
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,400
I didn't see the promissory note...

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,800
nor the banknotes!

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,040
These two are the main culprits.

76
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,400
Those two are their accomplices.

77
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,600
Nonsense!

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
There's irrefutable evidence.
Arrest them.

79
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Anyone who dares to fight back

80
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,320
will be executed on the spot.

81
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,640
How dare you!

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Kong Wude.

83
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,160
Do you have no regard for Mingjing Office?

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,440
I received no official files
from Mingjing Office

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,360
that they would send people
to investigate the case.

86
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,720
You used a fake token

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,000
to impersonate the government official.

88
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
This is punishable by death.

89
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,760
It's not every day that we come by

90
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,240
such shameless people like you.

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,920
Cut the crap.

92
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,720
Arrest them.

93
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,680
Try me!

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
Who is that?

95
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,080
Who attacked me?

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,560
I never do such a thing.

97
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Arrest them! All of them!

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Interrogation by torture!

99
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,720
Who dares to do that?

100
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,400
Lay down the weapons!

101
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,480
Kong Wude.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,400
Still won't surrender?

103
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,040
Young Master.

104
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,440
Am I too late?

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,720
Just in time.

106
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,120
Kong Wude.

107
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,840
When you transported the official silver
to Qingshui County,

108
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,440
you ordered people to sink it
into the water

109
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
and blew up the bottom of the ship.

110
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,320
Then, you sank the boxes full of stones

111
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,880
into the water as well

112
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,080
to substitute them

113
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,600
when salvaging the sunken official silver.

114
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,320
The testimony from both of them

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,320
and this ship plank
can explain everything.

116
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,880
My Lord.

117
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,040
I wonder where you've found these two men

118
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,600
and this ship plank.

119
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,240
What can it prove?

120
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,920
Fei Yuan!

121
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,720
Bring them in!

122
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:22,393
(Fairness and Integrity)

123
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,080
My wife.

124
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,760
Mother.

125
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,320
My Lord.

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,480
This is the Magistrate Kong

127
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,880
who ordered me
to seize their families

128
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,280
and used it to blackmail us

129
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
into being silent
about the disaster relief fund.

130
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,440
Our hands are tied.

131
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,039
My lord, please investigate it thoroughly!

132
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,039
It was him!

133
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,840
He made us swap the official silver

134
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,360
with the boxes full of stones.

135
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,120
The process is exactly the same

136
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,600
as what you just said earlier.

137
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,160
That's a bloody lie!

138
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,600
A bloody lie!

139
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,760
Detective Su.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
Detective Su, it's not true!

141
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,080
Don't believe their lies.

142
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
All lies!

143
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,400
Detective Su, I'm telling the truth!

144
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,480
Detective Su!

145
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,360
Such hard facts!
You can't get away with it!

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,200
Take him in custody!

147
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Yes!

148
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
Detective Su!

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,840
Detective Su, please trust me!

150
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,360
Let's go.

151
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,160
Detective Su!

152
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
Detective Su, please investigate it!

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,120
Detective Su!

154
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,840
Little Fei Yuan has claimed
the leading role today.

155
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,520
That's right.

156
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Not only did Fei Yuan lead the officers to come,

157
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,840
he also saved the families
of those officials.

158
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,400
Brilliant.

159
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
That's because our young master is smart.

160
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,880
He had it all thought out.

161
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,800
Really?

162
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
So it was Brother Pei
who had it all arranged.

163
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,480
Fortunately, he came in time.

164
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,960
I was worried that things would get ugly

165
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,480
with Kong

166
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,320
so that we wouldn't get away with it.

167
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,240
Rushuang, don't worry about that.

168
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,160
They are just some useless underlings.

169
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm here. It's all going to be fine.

170
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,560
Fine. You're the best.

171
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,640
Here, take this.

172
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,960
Don't worry.

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,960
One by one.

174
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,800
Thank you.

175
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
Next.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,520
Thank you.

177
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,600
This is great. Look over there.

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,840
Thank you, sir.

179
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,640
It's my turn.

180
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
Everyone gets one. Don't push.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,640
Next.

182
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you.

183
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,680
Cheers!

184
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,240
Brother Su, why aren't you drinking?

185
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,080
I can't drink.

186
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
I'll replace wine with tea.

187
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,400
To you, Brother Pei.

188
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,920
Thank you for your help.

189
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,440
You're welcome.

190
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,440
But how did you come up with the idea

191
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,720
to send Fei Yuan to the office
and save them beforehand?

192
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,280
If things were like what you said

193
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
that Kong Wude swapped
the disaster relief fund,

194
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,520
he must have had backup

195
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,000
and left a way out for himself.

196
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,600
I merely sent Fei Yuan there
to check things out.

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,800
He happened to save them
in the process.

198
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,920
Brother Pei.

199
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,640
Next time,

200
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,040
ask me along

201
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
if you're up to something so exciting.

202
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,000
And Rushuang too.

203
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,800
That's very meticulous of you

204
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,480
with such a well-thought-out plan.

205
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,360
But still, Brother Su goes one better.

206
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
You've solved
the Dragon King Robbery just like that.

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,920
What's so great about that?

208
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,160
If it was nothing great,
why hadn't you thought of it?

209
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
This...

210
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,880
Everyone is a master
in his own special field.

211
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,760
Brother Su got brians,
and I, the martial skills.

212
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,280
Although Brother Su caught Kong Wude,

213
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
the people have rice to eat

214
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,000
all thanks to you and me.

215
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,080
Rushuang.

216
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,920
Don't you want to pursuing justice with me

217
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,440
to rob the rich and help the poor?

218
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,600
We'll easily make mistakes
with the latter.

219
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,360
Let's just go with the former.

220
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
If Ms. Rushuang
were to get on the battlefield,

221
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,360
she must be a titan.

222
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,440
No way.

223
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,160
How can girls be on the battlefield?

224
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
That's so dangerous.

225
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
Why can't girls get on the battlefield?

226
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,120
There were even stories

227
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,480
of Hua Mulan
taking her father's place in the army.

228
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
That's right.

229
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,040
Women can do what men can do.

230
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,040
I think

231
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,800
women should be allowed
to serve as officials.

232
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,800
All right. I'll just eat.

233
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,080
Brother Su, what do you think?

234
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,240
Well, girls...

235
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,120
should just play the zither
and do embroidery.

236
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,360
Just leave the dirty work

237
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,360
to us, the men.

238
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,400
Right, Brother Xie?

239
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
What do you think?

240
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,600
Brother Xie, I'm sorry.

241
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,800
I...

242
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,640
A great man doesn't stand on trifles.

243
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,560
It's fine.

244
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,640
You're right.

245
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
I agree with you.

246
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Brother Su.

247
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,520
Do you like girls who play the zither

248
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,520
and do embroidery?

249
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,720
Rushuang.

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What does it have to do with you
of what he likes?

251
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,840
What do you know?

252
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,240
Why wouldn't I know?

253
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,520
You just don't get it.

254
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Don't interrupt when the adults are talking.

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,360
Eat up.

256
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
Little Fei Yuan is right.

257
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,680
You just don't get it.

258
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
-You don't get it.
-I...

259
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,640
Stop talking. Eat up.

260
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,320
Adoptive father.

261
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,800
I'm doing great here.

262
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Don't worry about me.

263
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,320
When I passed by Qingshui County,

264
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,360
I saved a girl who was offered as a sacrifice.

265
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,200
Although she knocked me out,

266
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
she was really pretty.

267
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,880
We even became friends.

268
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,960
Right!

269
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,800
Guess who I ran into here?

270
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,240
It's Prince Qi!

271
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,120
He's just like how I imagined him to be.

272
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,560
He's a good man
with strong sense of justice.

273
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,800
We solved a case together

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,040
and robbed the rich to help the poor.

275
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,120
My Lord.

276
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,400
We failed.

277
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,280
If so, tie up loose ends.

278
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,440
Leave no clues behind.

279
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,480
My Lord.

280
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
It was my negligence

281
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,520
for not noticing it earlier

282
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,440
and gave Prince Qi the chance
to intervene.

283
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Losing a tiny pawn like Magistrate Kong

284
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
revealed Prince Qi's true nature

285
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,360
that he has kept hidden for years.

286
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,280
From what I see,

287
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,480
it's a good thing.

288
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,640
Brother Pei.

289
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,720
You were staring into space just now.

290
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,640
Are you thinking
where the disaster relief fund is?

291
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Kong Wude pleaded not guilty.

292
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,520
But the silver concerns
the people's livelihood.

293
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,960
I have no leads now.

294
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,960
Indeed, it makes me feel uneasy.

295
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,400
If all the officials can be like you,

296
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,600
the officialdom will be so much simpler.

297
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,520
Brother Pei.

298
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,960
Are you still working for Prince Qi?

299
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,360
Why did you suddenly ask that?

300
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,560
Not anyone can deploy an army

301
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,600
from the state government
in such a short notice.

302
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,320
I it's Fei Yuan who used
Prince Qi's token

303
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,400
to deploy the army so quickly.

304
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,520
It looks like nothing gets past you.

305
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,400
From the looks of it,

306
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,960
Prince Qi isn't crushed

307
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,000
after suffering a setback.

308
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,120
He has been protecting everyone

309
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,920
in his own way.

310
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,160
Why do you like Prince Qi so much?

311
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,760
Because I think

312
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,000
he's a pure person.

313
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
I've never heard such description before.

314
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,040
He changed already hopeless situations
when he's young.

315
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,920
But he withdrew himself in his prime.

316
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,280
This isn't something
that anyone can do.

317
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,080
Besides,

318
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,200
he could have the chance to rule the world

319
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
but he had no desire for it.

320
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,640
Calm and carefree.

321
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,080
A very chivalrous man.

322
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,600
But there are rumours

323
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,120
that he was forced

324
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,040
to give up his military power

325
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,720
in order to protect himself.

326
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,280
When he returned from the war in the south,

327
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,120
everyone revered him.

328
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,240
If he wanted to be in power

329
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,920
no one could lay a finger on him.

330
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,440
Not everyone

331
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,920
can resist the temptation of power.

332
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,560
Perhaps

333
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,560
he found it boring.

334
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,960
I want to be like him too.

335
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,320
Brave.

336
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,040
Strong.

337
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,800
Does as he pleases.

338
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
How is the moonlight tonight?

339
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
It's beautiful.

340
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,600
What a shame.

341
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
I haven't had time

342
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,079
to gaze at the moon for years.

343
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,359
So do I.

344
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,440
Mother!

345
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,840
Young Master!

346
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,520
This is bad!

347
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,080
This is bad.

348
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,520
Magistrate Kong is dead.

349
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,800
What?

350
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,280
People hanged dead look so horrible.

351
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,760
Rushuang, don't go.

352
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
You'll get nightmares.

353
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,840
I'm not afraid.

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,760
Besides,

355
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,320
the dead can't speak or move.

356
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,080
What's there to be afraid of?

357
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,040
Both of you are men.

358
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,800
But take a look at Brother Su.

359
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,080
It's moving!

360
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,840
His tongue moved!

361
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,360
His tongue moved.

362
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,800
You scared me.

363
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,360
Brother Xie, don't be afraid.

364
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,760
That's normal.

365
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,440
Generally, people who hang themselves

366
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,440
won't necessarily
stick their tongues out.

367
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,800
If the rope is above the Adam's apple,

368
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,680
the tip of the tongue
will press against the upper jaw.

369
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,520
So the tongue won't stick out.

370
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,360
If it is under the Adam's apple,

371
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,240
the tip of the tongue will stick out.

372
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,480
I see.

373
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,840
Brother Xie.

374
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,720
I just recalled
that I came here in a hurry.

375
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,440
I think I didn't tie my horse up.

376
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,400
Can you help me check on it?

377
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,840
Sure. No problem.

378
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,840
Rushuang, stop looking. Hurry.

379
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,680
Why are you pulling me?

380
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Tie up the horse.

381
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,960
Why must you dragged me out here?

382
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,640
Girls shouldn't be seeing this.

383
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,040
Why not?

384
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,640
It's just bad.

385
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
Don't see it.

386
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,080
Brother Xie.

387
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,320
Are you afraid of corpses?

388
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,200
How would I possibly be afraid of corpses?

389
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
I'm a real man. How would I possibly be scared?

390
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,600
Why were you shaking...

391
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,360
Rushuang, look.

392
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,120
The horse might run away.

393
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,960
No, your legs were shaking.

394
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,680
No.

395
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,360
I practised martial arts yesterday.

396
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,200
Your face turned pale.

397
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,960
I did the horse stance yesterday.

398
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,080
-So I'm a little tired.
-Stop pretending.

399
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,320
How is it?

400
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,880
Was he killed?

401
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
Based on the clues that we have now,

402
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,520
it was indeed a suicide.

403
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,200
Simply put.

404
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,600
The biggest difference
between suicide and homicide

405
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,880
lies in the characteristics

406
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,960
of the groove formed
between the noose and the neck.

407
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,400
For suicide,

408
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,160
the ligature mark are inverted triangles.

409
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,120
The lowest part has the deepest mark.

410
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,160
It fades upwards from both sides.

411
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,000
But homicide is different.

412
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,640
The murderer put the rope

413
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,480
around the victim's neck.

414
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,360
So the ligature mark on the neck

415
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,120
of a strangled person

416
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,040
is usually oblique shaped

417
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,480
continuous and uninterrupted.

418
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,800
Even the knots on the rope
will have marks.

419
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,520
Compared to the suicidal ligature mark,

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the ligature mark on the victim's neck

421
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,560
should be more prominent

422
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,760
complete

423
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,120
and shallower.

424
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,360
Brother Su.

425
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,520
I'm sorry.

426
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,360
I'm sorry, Brother Pei.

427
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,440
I don't mean it.

428
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,840
I was so engrossed in it.

429
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,720
I'm so sorry.

430
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,200
It seems like it is quite risky

431
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,920
to handle a case with you.

432
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,400
Are you all right?

433
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
It's fine.

434
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,160
It's taking them so long.

435
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,200
Why isn't Brother Su out yet?

436
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,320
Rushuang, don't be afraid.

437
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,160
Rushuang, don't be afraid.

438
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,040
-It's fine.
-Who's afraid?

439
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,120
You startled me.

440
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,520
Rushuang, it's fine! I'm here!

441
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,720
Rushuang, I'm here!

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,800
Those are just some fireflies.

443
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,400
What's there to be afraid of?

444
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,920
You're a big guy but just so timid.

445
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,080
I'm speechless.

446
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,000
Earlier, Magistrate Kong

447
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,520
bit the bullet
and refused to plead guilty.

448
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,080
But at night, he killed himself
to escape punishment.

449
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
I smell a rat.

450
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,440
Tomorrow, I'll get another coroner

451
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
to perform another autopsy

452
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
on Magistrate Kong's body together.

453
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,200
Don't' worry.

454
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,200
I will bring the truth to light.

455
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,680
I believe you.

456
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,680
Brother Pei.

457
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,400
This is for you.

458
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,400
What do you give me your silk scarf?

459
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,280
You should cover the scar on your neck.

460
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,120
I...

461
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,920
Actually, I didn't know just now.

462
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,440
I...

463
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,760
The legal codes of Liang
are divided into six parts.

464
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,400
Theft and robbery law,
treason law, prisoner law,

465
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,680
law of arrest, miscellaneous law,
and criminal law.

466
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,320
The basic content is roughly
divided into three parts.

467
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,600
What are you

468
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,440
muttering about?

469
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,120
I was saying...

470
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,440
I didn't hear clearly.

471
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,120
I...

472
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,760
I'm sorry.

473
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,680
Brother Su.

474
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,320
You finally came out.

475
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,000
Why are you

476
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,640
looking at me?

477
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,160
Why are your cheeks so red?

478
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,280
I...

479
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,040
The morgue is too hot

480
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,760
and it's airtight.

481
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,040
Brother Pei.

482
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,080
Why is there a silk scarf

483
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,280
around your neck?

484
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,040
The morgue is too dark and cold.

485
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,440
It's to keep warm.

486
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,320
You said it's cold.

487
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,880
And he said it's hot.

488
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,200
So is it cold or hot in there?

489
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,520
Wait up!

490
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,040
Don't leave me here, Brother Pei!

491
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,400
Wait for me!

492
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
I want to take you home.

493
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,200
Stop!

494
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,720
Stop!

495
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,520
Young Master.

496
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,280
Young Master, what's wrong?

497
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,280
Are you all right?

498
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,920
Are you sick?

499
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,640
Young Master.

500
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,320
Your situation

501
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,160
is like when you just returned
from the battlefield.

502
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,640
But...

503
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,680
you haven't been like this
for a long time.

504
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,400
It's the Hu Man grass.

505
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,840
Back in the morgue,

506
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
I could smell something
from Magistrate Kong's body.

507
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,240
I found it familiar at the time
but didn't pay heed to it.

508
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,640
Now that I think of it,

509
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,120
it's the smell of Hu Man grass.

510
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,320
Hu Man grass?

511
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,760
What's that?

512
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,160
It's a potent poisonous weed
from Fan Yan Na.

513
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,480
If poisoned,
he will be hallucinated

514
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,880
and suffer excruciating pain.

515
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,080
Many people can't stand the pain

516
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,680
and resort to suicide

517
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,120
to end their lives

518
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,600
and get rid of suffering.

519
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,120
I'll check on the body again later.

520
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,680
Brother Su.

521
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,360
I'm good at toxicological examination.

522
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,480
I'll go with you.

523
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,160
Sure.

524
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Rushuang.

525
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
I heard

526
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,720
that girls have to keep looking
at nice things

527
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,280
to become more beautiful.

528
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,040
Let's not go to places

529
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
like morgues.

530
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Is that so?

531
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,320
I can just keep looking
at Brother Su then.

532
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,480
This is...

533
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,960
I'm not going.

534
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,520
I have things to do at Feiyun Manor.

535
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,800
Don't go then.

536
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,920
Young Master.

537
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,480
You need to apply medicine to your eyes.

538
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,240
Let's not go out later.

539
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,600
I won't be going then.

540
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,720
Otherwise,

541
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,080
he's not going to spare me.

542
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,920
Such a brilliant poisoning method.

543
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,480
It will take a few days
to gather at the limbs and joints.

544
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,280
It's difficult to detect it at first.

545
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,880
Magistrate Kong got what he deserved.

546
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,600
But the poisoner was too ruthless.

547
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Someone doesn't want us
to investigate this case.

548
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,560
I'm afraid
there's a bigger conspiracy behind this.

549
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,720
As your instructions,

550
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,760
Que Shi powder has been added to the silver

551
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
when molding.

552
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,288
Even if it's recast,
the mark will not disappear.

553
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,560
We've been keeping an eye on it for days now.

554
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,280
The secret guards managed
to track them down.

555
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,320
Where did they find it?

556
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,560
A dancer at Worry-free Bar.

557
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
It is said to have been given to her

558
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,400
by a Fan Yan Na merchant
who rented the place

559
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,840
for a period of time.

560
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Worry-free Bar?

561
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,520
Worry-free Bar?

562
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,520
That's right.

563
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,640
The food was sent to the prison

564
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,000
by a worker from Worry-free Bar.

565
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,560
Magistrate Kong used to go there

566
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,080
to drink with a wealthy merchant.

567
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,200
A wealthy merchant?

568
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,040
That's right.

569
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,560
His name is Sha Du.

570
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,400
He has business dealings

571
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
between the borders
of Fan Yan Na and Liang.

572
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,520
Fan Yan Na?

573
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,000
He often reserves

574
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,600
the most expensive private room
in Worry-free Bar.

575
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,840
It's called...

576
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,800
It's called Tianzi Hall.

577
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,680
Jeez.

578
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,560
You need to drink too. Not just me alone.

579
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,080
I've prepared some wine
and great dishes for you upstairs.

580
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,040
Here. This way, please.

581
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,800
Sir, don't just stand there.

582
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,200
Come with me.

583
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,600
Let's go.

584
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,480
Let's go.

585
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Let's go.

586
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,360
This way, please.

587
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,320
Sir, please take a seat.

588
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,480
Both of you are so good-looking.

589
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,000
Make yourselves at home.

590
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,120
Tell me.

591
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,480
What kind of girls do you like?

592
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:56,920
I'll make the arrangement for you.

593
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,960
No, thanks.

594
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,840
Sir.

595
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,160
Worry-free Bar is more than just a place

596
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,160
with music and dance performances.

597
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,960
The girls here

598
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,840
are very considerate

599
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,160
and gentle.

600
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,160
I told you!

601
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,280
We don't need any!

602
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,080
We're here to listen to the music.

603
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,160
That's all.

604
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,720
You'll change your mind
when you see my girls.

605
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,800
Wait here!

606
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,400
I said no!

607
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,640
None of them will look
as good as Rushuang.

608
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,480
Brother Pei.

609
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,600
Don't let the girls drink with us.

610
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,520
If Brother Su and Rushuang find out,

611
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
they'll surely make fun of us.

612
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,600
No way.

613
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,240
What's wrong if Brother Su knows?

614
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,840
I would have asked him along

615
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,920
if he didn't have things to do today.

616
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,960
You...

617
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,800
You can get a girl if you want.

618
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,720
Don't get one for me.

619
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,480
I don't want any.

620
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,720
I don't want any.

621
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:48,040
(Worry-free Bar)
Go away! Leave!

622
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,880
You...

623
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,720
Go away! Leave!

624
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,160
Why won't you let us in?

625
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,200
Did you make a reservation?

626
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,800
You...

627
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,920
Do we have to?

628
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,960
Of course.

629
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
This is WORRY-FREE BAR.

630
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,520
Not just anyone can enter.

631
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,360
You're looking down on us, huh?

632
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,400
Believe it or not!
I'll use the poison and...

633
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Come here.

634
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
Rushuang, calm down.

635
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,800
We're here for investigation.

636
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,520
But they won't let us in.

637
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,440
I should just knock them out
with the poison.

638
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,880
Then, he'll let us in.

639
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,560
All right now. Stop messing around.

640
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,000
Let's think of some other ways.

641
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,400
Mess around?

642
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,680
Brother Su, I have an idea.

643
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,200
What is it?

644
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,520
Watch me.

645
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,880
Take care, sir!

646
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,240
You again?

647
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,240
I'm looking for someone.

648
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,040
Looking for someone? Who?

649
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm looking for my man!

650
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,560
He's not here.

651
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,880
He came here to find other girls behind my back!

652
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,720
I'm telling you!

653
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,360
I'm going to kill this unfaithful man!

654
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,960
Whichever eye he used
to look at the girls,

655
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,680
I'm going gouge that eye out!

656
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,720
What a handsome man.

657
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,440
Gentlemen, here come the girls.

658
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
Hurry! Fill up the cups.

659
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,960
Serve them.

660
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,480
Sir, have a pastry.

661
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,400
No.

662
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,320
Sir, drink up.

663
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,800
No!

664
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,720
Don't touch me!

665
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,280
My heart is taken.

666
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,480
All right.

667
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,400
Since he doesn't like it, you can leave.

668
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,640
All right. Let's not force him.

669
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,200
Hai Tang, serve them.

670
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,800
All right.

671
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,880
Come with me.

672
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,040
Yes.

673
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,560
Good wine.

674
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
Sir, I don't think I've seen you before.

675
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,400
Is this your first time here?

676
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,320
Miss.

677
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
May I know how to get to Tianzi Hall?

678
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,560
It's located at the end of the corridor.

679
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,200
Thank you.

680
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,680
Boiled eggs can reduce swelling.

681
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,680
Thank you.

682
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,520
Don't get in my way!

683
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,880
You can't go inside!

684
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,840
Miss, you can't go inside!

685
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,200
Don't touch me!

686
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,280
You...

687
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,360
Sir, here.

688
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,600
Xie Beiming?

689
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,920
Brother Pei?

690
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,040
Rushuang?

691
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,920
Why are you here?

692
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,920
Get out at once!

693
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,920
Stop!

694
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,720
What are you doing?

695
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,600
Get your hands off!

696
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,200
Get out!

697
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Let go of me!

698
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
What are you doing?

699
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,240
I'm doing this for your own good!

700
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,120
-What about me?
-You.

701
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,760
What about me?

702
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,600
You...

703
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,040
You came here
to find other girls behind my back.

704
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,720
I didn't.

705
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,320
No?

706
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,320
It's Brother Pei.

707
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,680
Pei? What Pei?

708
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,840
Talk to Brother Pei!

709
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,400
Do you have to come
just because he asked you to?

710
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,480
Come here!

711
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,800
Get out of the way!

712
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,680
He dragged me here with me.

713
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,600
Come here!

714
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,240
Miss, please leave.

715
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,920
Miss!

716
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,280
Trying to hide, huh?

717
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,120
Get out!

718
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,760
Master Sha Du from Tianzi Hall

719
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,920
has made a huge arrangement for tomorrow.

720
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,360
I heard that the big shots
from around the place will be here.

721
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,440
But only one will be chosen.

722
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm afraid I won't win it.

723
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,960
How do you know if you don't try.

724
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,720
What are you doing?

725
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,360
Rushuang, hear me out.

726
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,880
Brother Pei made me come here.

727
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
I really don't want to come.

728
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,960
Miss, knock it off.

729
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,160
Rushuang, I won't come here again.

730
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,040
I won't come here again.

731
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,040
Won't come again?

732
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,160
Stop!

733
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,920
Kick them out of here!

734
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,960
-Don't touch me!
-Don't touch her!

735
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,920
-Don't touch me!
-Don't touch her!

736
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,240
-I can leave on my own!
-Leave!

737
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,080
Hurry!

738
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,760
Brother Pei!

739
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,280
You got me into a big trouble!

740
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,200
Get out!

741
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,840
Get out!

742
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,920
Sir, drink this to calm your nerves.

743
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,040
Sir, it's fine now.

744
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,440
Please continue your meal.

745
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
This is Worry-free Bar.

746
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,980
Brother Pei, why did you bring me here?

747
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,900
It's boring to investigate the case alone.

748
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,180
Let's go inside and grab a drink with me.

749
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,300
Brother Pei.

750
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,100
All my life,
I've never been to a place like this.

751
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,820
Besides,

752
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,060
whenever I listen to these songs,

753
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,980
I tend to get sleepy.

754
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,100
How about this?

755
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,180
You can go in and have some fun.

756
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,420
I'll head back first.

757
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,420
You're here now anyway.

758
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,380
Have a drink with me.

759
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:09,980
Jeez, I…

760
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,780
Come on.

761
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,900
Sir, please hold on.

762
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,300
Have you made reservations?

763
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,420
What's the matter? Is it a full house?

764
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,380
I can tell it's your first time here.

765
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,140
Not just anyone

766
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,740
can come to Worry-free Bar.

767
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,460
Perfect.

768
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,420
Brother Pei, let's go back.

769
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,340
There is a famine in Qingshui County.

770
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,300
It's very inappropriate of us

771
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,100
to have a feast here.

772
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,060
Brother Pei, we should just go back.

773
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,300
Brother Xie, since we're here,
we might as well stay.

774
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,860
Come again next time.

775
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,580
Is that all right?

776
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:51,820
Thank...

777
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,580
Sir, this way, please. Don't just stand there.

778
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,140
Let's go. Come with me.

779
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,260
-Come on in.
-Let's go.

780
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,260
