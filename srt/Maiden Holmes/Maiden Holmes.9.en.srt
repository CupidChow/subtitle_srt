(Episode 9)

15
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,080
Father.

16
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,320
Zhi.

17
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,400
Come here.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,800
Take a seat.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,200
Father.

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,680
I know about the list of candidates

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,160
for Prince Qi's Princess Consort.

22
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,400
Did you tell her about it?

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,800
Sorry, my Lord.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,280
It's my fault.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,560
Father, don't be mad.

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,440
That's what I want.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,800
Don't blame Ying Ying.

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,880
You're dismissed.

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,880
Here. Take a seat.

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,960
Zhi.

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,480
You should be able to tell

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
there's something fishy
behind the list, right?

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,080
I know.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,080
No young aristocratic ladies are chosen.

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,760
It's obvious

37
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,040
who's behind it.

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,600
Since you know,

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,600
why do you want to risk it

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,920
and insist on marrying
none other than Prince Qi?

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,760
I once said

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
that my husband

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,000
must be like you.

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,440
Loyal, brave, unyielding,

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
smart and bold.

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
A real gentleman.

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,440
Prince Qi

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,240
is that kind of man.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,160
Wait for me!

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
This place is so beautiful.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,320
The view is really good.

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,880
Miss, pick a wishing lamp.

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,160
(Puhua Temple)
Brother Su.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,320
Is this your first time here

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
like me?

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,880
Rushuang.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,480
There are so many fun places
in the capital.

58
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,040
I can go with you.

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I...

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
You...

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
Toss higher.

62
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,110
(Miraculous Fortune-telling)

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
It's so lively.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
How did the murderer choose his victim?

65
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,760
And how did he get their information?

66
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,200
Why are all the worshippers girls?

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Rushuang, here's the thing.

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,040
Puhua Temple is famous

69
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,680
for people praying for marriage.

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,390
I've heard that the prayers
are often answered.

71
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,680
Really?

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
You can pray for marriage
right over there.

73
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,400
Did you see that tree?

74
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,640
That tree is called the marriage tree.

75
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,560
You have to write your name

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,640
and the person you like on a board

77
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
and toss it on the tree.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,920
Then, you can stay together forever.

79
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,200
Young Master.

80
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,800
Seize the opportunity
to pray for your marriage.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,120
It just so happens that recently...

82
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,160
What is it?

83
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
It just so happens

84
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,680
that Young Master's family
has arranged a marriage for him.

85
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,000
Brother Su.

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,600
I would like to pray for marriage too.

87
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,360
Why don't you come with me?

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,080
It should be

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
right there!

90
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
What about me?

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,120
Brother Xie.

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
It looks like you're the one

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
who should be worried.

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
Little Su.

95
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,720
I'll surely help you

96
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
so that you can be yourself in the public.

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
Fang, are you here
to pray for marriage too?

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,160
What brings you here?

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
What are they doing over there?

100
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,800
If you can throw the copper coin
into the lotus flower,

101
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,360
your wish will come true.

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,280
Really?

103
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
I'll give it a try.

104
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,920
Throw gently.

105
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,320
I hope Brother Su and me...

106
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
Rushuang, this is awesome!

107
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,240
Your wish is going to come true.

108
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm counting on that, Little Fei Yuan.

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
Let's check out the marriage tree.

110
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,840
Let's go.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,720
Let's go.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,240
(Meditation Room)

113
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,280
Not bad.

114
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
Take a look.

115
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,640
Young man.

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,760
You're ruining other people's destiny.

117
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,720
-You should be kind.
-Keep your voice down.

118
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,160
I know. I'm sorry.

119
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm leaving.

120
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,560
This is an auspicious oracle.

121
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,840
The names are written on it.

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,520
Why didn't you go

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
and join them for fun?

124
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,160
This wooden board seller

125
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,080
comes in contact
with many girls every day.

126
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,760
Little Su.

127
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I hope

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
you can cut loose once in a while.

129
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,800
She's destined to be a lone star

130
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,040
who causes the death of her family and friends

131
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,640
and lead a lonely life.

132
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,160
How can she cut loose?

133
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
If you say another word,

134
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,440
I'm going to make you
the star of loneliness.

135
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,920
It's the trick that they use.

136
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,960
Don't mind him.

137
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,320
Let's go.

138
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,760
Sir.

139
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,760
You two have a similar fate.

140
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,440
Your parents have passed away.

141
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,280
One is the Solitary Star

142
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,960
and the other is the Widow Lodge.

143
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,960
But

144
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,760
if both of you can make a pair,

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,840
the propitious star governing marriage
will ascend.

146
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,200
The Solitary Star will find its partner.

147
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,240
You two Solitary Stars
can supplement each other.

148
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,760
You'll have a blissful life

149
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,160
and stay loving and grow old together.

150
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,320
Both of us are men.

151
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,040
Don't spew nonsense!

152
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
About that.

153
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,080
Only God knows.

154
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,280
You know, and I know.

155
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,400
Wait, Sir.

156
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,960
Why don't you buy a love lock?

157
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,800
You'll be locked together
for a lifetime

158
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,400
and no one can tear you apart.

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,600
Indeed, both of us

160
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,280
become acquainted because of a lock.

161
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,200
It's just

162
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,240
some tricks

163
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,640
to fool the ignorant girls.

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,040
Rushuang.

165
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,280
What did you write?

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,600
It's better for kids like you not to know.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,920
What's the big deal?

168
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
(Fei Yuan, Young Master)
You can see mine.

169
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,400
Little Fei Yuan.

170
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,720
This is to pray for marriage.

171
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,120
You wrote your name
and your young master's.

172
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,800
What is this? Do you want to get married?

173
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,200
What's wrong?

174
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,960
Fei Yuan, ignore him.

175
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,880
Let's toss our tablet.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,050
This is...

177
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,850
(Su Ci, Dong Rushuang)
This is...

178
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,320
This is...

179
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,680
Rushuang.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,240
Don't force yourself to toss it

181
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,640
if you can't do it.

182
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,440
No way.

183
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,880
I must find a way to get it up there.

184
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,880
It's up there now!

185
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,840
Fei Yuan.

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let's go and find Brother Su.

187
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,880
Let's go.

188
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,880
Xie Beiming.

189
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,920
(Xie Beiming, Dong Rushuang)

190
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,280
Let's go home now.

191
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
Mom, this is tasty.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm not eating.

193
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,760
Brother Pei,
why do you keep looking at me?

194
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,160
You jumped up and down earlier.

195
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,160
But you don't seem exhausted.

196
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,920
You've got quite good at kung fu.

197
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,920
Brother Pei.

198
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,040
Don't ever tell Rushuang about it.

199
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,240
Is it obvious

200
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
for me to do this?

201
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Not at all.

202
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,880
I'm relieved to hear that.

203
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,760
It's extremely obvious.

204
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,080
Brother Pei.

205
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,360
I've made it so obvious now.

206
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,400
But Rushuang...

207
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,200
Does it mean I don't stand a chance?

208
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,360
Brother Xie.

209
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,160
Don't worry.

210
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,040
It's impossible
for Little Su and Rushuang to be together.

211
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,520
That's right!

212
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
Why did I forget that?

213
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,120
Yes, it's impossible.

214
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,200
I'm relieved now.

215
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,680
Yan Zhi.

216
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,400
Xu Zhi?

217
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,280
I almost couldn't recognize you.

218
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
Where's Brother Pei?

219
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,000
Brother Pei?

220
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
He's...

221
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
I didn't expect to run into you here.

222
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,040
Brother Su, what's wrong?

223
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,120
Are you feeling unwell?

224
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,120
I...

225
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,840
I have a stomach ache.

226
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,160
A stomach ache?

227
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,760
But you're holding your chest.

228
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,760
Why would you
get a stomach ache all of a sudden?

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
I...

230
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,720
I feel sick in my stomach
from time to time these days.

231
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
It's not a big deal.

232
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,280
I'm surprised you still remember.

233
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,190
(Pei Mansion)

234
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Here, Young Master.

235
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,880
How do you feel?

236
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,720
Young Master.

237
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,000
Have you seen the candidates list
for Princess Consort?

238
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,200
Ms. Xu Zhi is also on the list.

239
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,040
Xu Zhi?

240
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,840
That's right.

241
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,720
I heard from Brother Jiang

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,040
that her name was suddenly added
to the list.

243
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,760
Young Master.

244
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,600
I think Ms. Xu is pretty good.

245
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,320
You've known each other
since youth, right?

246
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,960
I think

247
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,840
she must really like you.

248
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,000
That's why she made efforts to be on the list.

249
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,200
Was it her that you met

250
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,840
at Puhua Temple?

251
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,800
Young Master.

252
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,080
What did you say?

253
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,280
Young Master.

254
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,920
Why don't you seem to care?

255
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,800
It's selecting your consort.

256
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,680
I'm aware of that.

257
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,400
Come on.

258
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,810
(Name-list of the candidates)

259
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,400
He said he's not interested.

260
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,760
But he secretly looked at the portrait.

261
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,920
Why does this girl

262
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,400
look so familiar?

263
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,430
(Su)

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,120
Su?

265
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
Detective Su?

266
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,080
Does the young master

267
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,800
like...

268
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,760
men?

269
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,760
Miss, congrats.
You've got your wish fulfilled.

270
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,320
It's just the beginning.

271
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,280
My wish hasn't come true yet.

272
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,560
It's obvious that in terms

273
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,200
of family background and looks,

274
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,240
Prince Qi and you make a perfect match.

275
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,360
Look at you.

276
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,000
You honey-lipped girl.

277
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Someone is too happy to notice

278
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,960
my presence.

279
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,360
-Father.
-Master.

280
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,960
It's been tough on you
in the past few days.

281
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,240
Zhi.

282
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
The official list has been announced.

283
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,800
Don't worry now.

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,880
Here.

285
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,160
Zhi.

286
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm going away tonight

287
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,640
and won't be back for some time.

288
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,160
After I leave,

289
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,280
you must take good care of yourself

290
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,160
especially after you enter the palace.

291
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,760
You need to be careful
in everything you do.

292
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,520
Is this how

293
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,320
the Imperial Astronomer works?

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Calm down, Your Highness.

295
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,640
Calm down, Your Highness.

296
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,960
Marquis Zhenyuan
probably pulled some strings

297
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,240
and got Xu Zhi on the candidate list.

298
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,920
Marquis Zhenyuan
guards the Northern Xinjiang.

299
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,560
He commands a massive military force.

300
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,240
I can't let him
form a marriage alliance with Prince Qi.

301
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,400
But this list has already been sent out.

302
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm afraid Prince Qi has received it.

303
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,000
So what if he gets the list?

304
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,760
They delivered themselves
right on the chopping block.

305
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,880
All right.

306
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,960
Don't blame me for not showing you mercy.

307
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,560
Ms. Xu.

308
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,720
Other candidates have already
entered the palace.

309
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,590
They live next door.

310
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,160
This is your room.

311
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,720
Ms. Xu.

312
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,760
Here we are.

313
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,520
Ms. Xu.

314
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,520
I'm Xiao Yun.

315
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,120
I'm in charge of your daily necessities.

316
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,120
If you need anything,

317
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
just let me know.

318
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,680
Thank you.

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,680
It's my job.

320
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,720
Miss.

321
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,920
What are they doing?

322
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,520
They are betting on
Prince Qi's consort candidates.

323
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,400
Miss, are you interested to place a bet?

324
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,280
If you win, you can make a fortune.

325
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,720
The names on the plates

326
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,680
are the candidates
for Prince Qi's consort?

327
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,760
That's right.

328
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
It looks like Ms. Xu is quite popular.

329
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,160
That's right.

330
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,840
Rushuang.

331
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,200
Brother Xie.

332
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,880
Here.

333
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,800
Take a seat.

334
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,800
Why did you ask me here?

335
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,400
You've been working so hard
to do investigation lately.

336
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,120
I asked you out
so that you can relax.

337
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,400
Here. Drink some water.

338
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,000
You Feiyun Manor are quite good businessmen.

339
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,720
You're using Prince Qi
to make money.

340
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,080
Well, we're expanding the business.

341
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,280
Young Master.

342
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,040
We discovered

343
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
several wedding dress suicide cases.

344
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,520
We've sorted out the details.

345
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,400
Please have a look.

346
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
Give them to me.

347
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,200
(Case File)

348
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,640
Rushuang, there you go.

349
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,840
Well done.

350
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,880
Keep searching.

351
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,040
Search the cases in all the nearby counties.

352
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,240
Yes.

353
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,520
Not bad, Brother Xie.

354
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,560
You're getting better at it now.

355
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,280
These are the ones
that we have found so far.

356
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,520
There are many coincidences among these cases.

357
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,320
It's most likely a serial murder.

358
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,720
The murderer looks for designated targets

359
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,480
in a designated place.

360
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,480
But

361
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,920
I still can't confirm

362
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,800
his pattern of murders.

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,240
If that's the case,

364
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,920
the murder must be very smart
with odd behaviour.

365
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,080
Arrest him as soon as possible.

366
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,000
Got it.

367
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,840
It's time to eat.

368
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,400
What a sumptuous meal.

369
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,920
Here.

370
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,160
Why are you looking at me?

371
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,480
Where's Brother Pei?

372
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,000
Young Master went for a matchmaking session.

373
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,800
He won't be back for dinner.

374
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Eat up.

375
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,200
What did you say?

376
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Brother Pei went for a matchmaking session?

377
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,240
That's right.

378
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,680
My young master is so outstanding.

379
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm sure all of you know that.

380
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,560
Many people got in line waiting for him

381
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,400
as soon as he returned to the capital.

382
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,480
Can't help it though.

383
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,520
That's no big deal.

384
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,880
Let me tell you.
Those coming Feiyun Manor

385
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,240
to propose marriage every year...

386
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,960
Rushuang.

387
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,080
Not a single one comes.

388
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,400
So,

389
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,040
Brother Pei is really outstanding.

390
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,520
I'm so impressed.

391
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,840
Little Fei Yuan.

392
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,200
Which lady is on the blind date
with your young master?

393
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
How does she look like?

394
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,000
Do you have her portrait?

395
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,520
There are six of them.

396
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,640
I won't be able to finish
telling you the whole story.

397
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,240
But they are all gentle
and virtuous ladies

398
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,160
with suitable background.

399
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
I think none of them
strikes Brother Pei's fancy.

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,880
That's impossible.

401
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,040
They all have been screened.

402
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,600
He'll surely find one
that strikes his fancy.

403
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,760
Besides,

404
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
he has reached the age of marriage.

405
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
He'll get married for sure.

406
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,920
I'm full already.

407
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,120
Enjoy yourselves.

408
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,440
I'm going to rest.

409
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,320
Brother Su, you...

410
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,680
He didn't even take a single bite.

411
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,960
Why would he be full?

412
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,520
That's so weird.

413
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,590
(Legal Code of Liang Dynasty)

414
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,040
He can marry anyone he wants.

415
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,080
What does it have to do with me?

416
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,080
Brother Su.

417
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,280
Are you asleep?

418
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,000
Come in.

419
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,960
Rushuang.

420
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,280
You didn't eat much just now.

421
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,440
Is something troubling you?

422
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm fine.

423
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,720
I've made you some dessert.

424
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,840
Give it a try.

425
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,760
Thank you, Rushuang.

426
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
It's fine. Try it.

427
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,960
Is it good?

428
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,560
Not bad.

429
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,520
Brother Su.

430
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,960
Actually, I know what's on your mind.

431
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,200
You're only a few years
younger than Brother Pei.

432
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,280
Actually, you've also reached
the age of marriage

433
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,320
I'll be frank with you.

434
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,240
Since I was a child, I swore to myself

435
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,600
that I didn't want
to see the people suffer injustice.

436
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,560
If this wish is not fulfilled,

437
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,440
I won't think about a romantic relationship.

438
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,440
But a man can live and work better

439
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,040
if he has a wife and a family.

440
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,840
Only then can the world be in peace.

441
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,960
I have no home, no job,
no property, no land.

442
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
I don't want to be a drag on any Miss

443
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,000
living a hard life with me.

444
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,870
What if there is a girl

445
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,760
who doesn't care
about your pay and wealth

446
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,280
and wants to be with you

447
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,680
and to take care of you?

448
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,960
This...

449
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,800
When it comes to marriage,

450
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,320
it's better if both agree to it.

451
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
But if it's unrequited love,

452
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,200
I'm afraid it's going to be tough.

453
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,920
My father once told me

454
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,200
that it's not easy

455
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,640
to meet someone we like in our lives.

456
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,560
So we have to cherish it

457
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,440
and don't let go.

458
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,040
Rushuang.

459
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,360
I...

460
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,880
Little Su.

461
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,000
Brother Pei, come on in.

462
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,920
Rushuang.

463
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,760
I'll make you some pastries.

464
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,840
Brother Pei.

465
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,560
Were you

466
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,520
standing at the door?

467
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,920
I just came back.

468
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,040
I heard you had an upset stomach.

469
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,480
Are you feeling better now?

470
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm fine.

471
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,960
If there's nothing else,

472
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,840
you should head back and rest earlier.

473
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,960
I've been at Mansion of Prince Qi all day long.

474
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
I'm indeed exhausted.

475
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,880
Mansion of Prince Qi?

476
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,520
But didn't Fei Yuan say that you were...

477
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,080
What did Fei Yuan tell you

478
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,280
that I was doing?

479
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,520
Nothing.

480
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,240
If there's nothing else,

481
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm going to read some book later.

482
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,280
All right.

483
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,040
I'll get going then.

484
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,640
Little Su.

485
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,320
Will you marry someone you don't like?

486
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
No.

487
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,600
What a coincidence.

488
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
Neither will I.

489
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Miss.

490
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,000
I've heard from the others

491
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,120
that Prince Qi and you
were childhood sweethearts?

492
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,280
We met at a very young age.

493
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,000
All these years

494
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,720
he hasn't changed at all.

495
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
You're so outstanding.

496
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm sure you'll become
Princess Consort Qi.

497
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,760
All right now.

498
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,680
The Empress Dowager will summon us tomorrow.

499
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
Serve me to bed.

500
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,320
All right.

501
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,680
Miss.

502
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,080
Miss?

503
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,360
I'm here to serve you wash up.

504
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
Miss?

505
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Somebody help me!

506
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,440
Is anyone there?

507
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,000
Brother Pei.

508
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,720
Why are you here?

509
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,000
This is my residence.

510
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,760
Where shall I be if I'm not here?

511
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,400
As for you,

512
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,920
how long

513
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,160
are you going to be here?

514
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,320
Rushuang is staying here, right?

515
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,520
Wherever Rushuang is,

516
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,920
that's where my home will be.

517
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,200
Brother Pei.

518
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,120
Why are you so relaxed?

519
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,720
Have you finished

520
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,120
of the princess consort selection?

521
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,480
Are you really

522
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,000
going to pick one of the candidates?

523
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I heard

524
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,000
that Feiyun Manor opened a gambling business.

525
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,520
Are you here

526
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,880
to worm it out of me?

527
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Brother Pei.

528
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,840
I'm really concerned about you.

529
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,440
I hope you can marry someone you like.

530
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,960
Of course, at the same time

531
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
to gain profits for Feiyun Manor.

532
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,040
If that's the case,
I earnestly thank you

533
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,640
for your concern.

534
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,280
Don't mention it.

535
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,480
Brother Pei.

536
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,760
Judging from your expression,

537
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,080
it looks like you have found a solution?

538
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,320
The selection of princess consort

539
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,360
isn't just my private affair.

540
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,680
Many people in the government

541
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,440
are trying to pry into it.

542
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,840
They are wary of it.

543
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,400
So the person that I choose

544
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
has to be someone to their liking.

545
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,920
Well, Brother Pei.

546
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,360
Who do they want you to choose?

547
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,120
Actually, the six finalists

548
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,360
are to their likings

549
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,480
except for Xu Zhi.

550
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,680
Except for Xu Zhi?

551
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,240
I get it now.

552
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,840
Except for Xu Zhi,

553
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,520
the remaining five
are from families with weaker influence

554
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,800
who are of no help to you.

555
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,080
So

556
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
whoever you pick,

557
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,480
they'll be happy with it.

558
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,560
This is...

559
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,440
Are you really going to choose Xu Zhi?

560
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,760
I'll choose Ms. Jiang.

561
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,920
Ms. Jiang's mother

562
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,520
has been in poor health in recent years.

563
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,840
She's recuperating at home.

564
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,320
Recently, her condition got worse.

565
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm afraid her days are numbered.

566
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,680
I get it again.

567
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,360
If Ms. Jiang's mother died,

568
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,760
she would have to mourn
not getting married in three years.

569
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
Given your tricks,

570
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,760
this marriage will get past

571
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,000
in less than three years.

572
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,240
Brother Pei, there's one thing though.

573
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,880
You can run, but you can't hide.

574
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,400
What about next time?

575
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,560
His Majesty and the Empress Dowager

576
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,680
aren't so open-minded as me.

577
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,440
If they know about Brother Su and you...

578
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,720
Even they gave you the nod,

579
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,760
the officials and people

580
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,400
wouldn't agree to it.

581
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,840
After all, you're Prince Qi.

582
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,600
You need to have your children.

583
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,440
If I were you,

584
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,080
my adoptive father
would break my leg.

585
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,520
Not to mention you...

586
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,160
Your Highness.

587
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,840
Xiwen.

588
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,000
Didn't I tell you

589
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,640
not to come here?

590
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,480
It's fine. Go on.

591
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,680
Your Highness.

592
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,160
Xu Zhi was dead.

593
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,640
What?

594
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,960
The shoes print.

595
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,920
Drag marks.

596
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,280
How come there is powder here?

597
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,520
The decorative pattern.

598
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,360
The shoes wear out at the heels.

599
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,320
Why don't the footprints match?

600
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,560
Come here.

601
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,680
Take them back.

602
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,280
Yes.

603
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,200
Detective Su.

604
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,880
I've checked.

605
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,800
Ms. Xu came into contact
with very few people

606
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,320
after entering the palace.

607
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,640
Besides her maid, Xiao Yun,

608
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,800
she merely had connections

609
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,320
with a few candidates.

610
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,360
The selection is rather complicated.

611
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,720
Many people are involved.

612
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,080
Have you checked everything out?

613
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,760
I've cross-examined all

614
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,680
but one person.

615
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,600
It's Qu Linjiang, the painter

616
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,520
who drew her portrait

617
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,680
because he's not usually in the palace.

618
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,200
All right.

619
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,520
Let's start the investigation

620
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,800
from her maid, Xiao Yun.

621
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,000
My Lord.

622
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,580
(Mingjing Office)

623
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,080
My Lord.

624
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,080
It's all my fault.

625
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,120
It's all my fault.

626
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,520
I knew the palace is a dangerous place.

627
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,040
Yet, I let you have it your way.

628
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,150
That kind of place

629
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,190
isn't meant for a naive girl like you.

630
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,280
Had I known this would happen,

631
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,760
I shouldn't have brought you back here!

632
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,760
My Lord.

633
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,120
My condolences.

634
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,760
Who did this?

635
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,520
We have launched
a full-scale investigation into it.

636
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,280
Liu Xuan.

637
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,480
We both know

638
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,480
that my daughter

639
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,240
did not die in the hands of one person.

640
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,680
If you can get to the bottom of things,

641
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,240
I hope

642
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,280
that truth will come to light.

643
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,080
I'll surely do my best.

644
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,820
I'm full already.

645
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,260
Enjoy yourselves.

646
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,460
I'm going to rest.

647
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,700
Brother Su, you...

648
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,420
He didn't even
take a single bite.

649
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,500
Why would he be full?

650
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,460
He did so whenever
hearing Brother Pei's matchmaking.

651
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,740
That's just so weird.

652
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,700
Do you think

653
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,700
Detective Su is envious that my young master

654
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,960
went to a matchmaking session?

655
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,380
You won't get it.

656
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,900
Eat up.

657
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,580
-Is it good?
-Yes.

658
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:21,860
Not bad.

659
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,340
Brother Su.

660
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,900
Actually, I know what's on your mind.

661
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,820
You're only a few years
younger than Brother Pei.

662
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,340
Actually, you've also reached
the age of marriage.
