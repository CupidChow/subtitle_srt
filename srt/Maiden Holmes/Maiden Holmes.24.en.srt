14
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,868
(Episode 24)

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,760
Actually, Bai Sheng...

16
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
was my father.

17
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,800
Bai Liang Clan was slaughtered.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,240
I'm the only one

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,920
survived.

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,680
So you're also a Bai Liang criminal?

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,960
No.

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,600
I don't mean that.

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,600
It's just...

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
It's too dangerous.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,160
I need to hide you.

26
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,280
Yes.

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
You'll be dead if anyone from

28
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,880
the palace

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
finds out you're still alive.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,640
I have an idea.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,840
Feiyun Manor has an inn at the desert.

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,280
Brother Su, you can go there.

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,520
It's a vast with less people,
far from the capital.

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,680
No one knows you.

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,200
Brother Pei.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,160
You might have to suffer a bit.

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,560
It's alright.

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,760
He's used to not having a proper job.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,720
It's better to go away with her.

40
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
All right. Let's go there then.

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,600
You should stay away from me.

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
Given my identity,

43
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,640
I'll be a drag on you.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
Besides, someone is trying kill us.

45
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
It's too dangerous to be with me.

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,080
You're afraid we'd get implicated.

47
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,960
That's why you came here yourself

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,400
to investigate those
who forged the letter?

49
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,920
Sister Su.

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,320
To me, you're like my own sister.

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
Everything concerns you concerns me.

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
If I saw you as a drag,

53
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,760
I would have avoided you

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,040
when I found out your gender.

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,200
But I'm still with you.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,200
I agree, Brother Su.

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,120
At worst,

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,120
we can just live in seclusion.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,320
Wherever Rushuang goes,

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
I'll go.

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,120
Thank you.

62
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,600
But

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,920
Her identity is a sensitive issue.

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,760
So

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,920
before the truth comes to light

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
be sure to keep it a secret.

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, Sister Su.

68
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,840
You disguised as a man
in Mingjing Office

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,480
just to investigate
the Bai Liang case, right?

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Now I have found the first evidence

71
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,440
to reverse the verdict for my clan.

72
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,040
Does it mean the verdict can be reversed

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,640
with the evidence?

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm afraid not.

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,120
Why?

76
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
Aren't these letters

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,480
hard evidence?

78
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Yeah.

79
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,120
Lei Zheng, Liang Feng,

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,400
and Li Mu are dead.

81
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,760
What if others say that the letter
written by Lei Zheng

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,880
is ghostwritten too?

83
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
You're right.

84
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,720
And the killer is dead too.

85
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,840
Otherwise, we could get
some information from him.

86
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,280
I want to check the assassin's body.

87
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
This is...

88
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,720
As I expected.

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,720
He also had a burnt mark
on his body.

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,040
He had it.

91
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,640
So did Lei Zheng.

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,760
What exactly does it mean?

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,680
Xiwen said

94
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,920
that no one in Beirong

95
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,360
wore this burnt mark.

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,200
It seems it has nothing to do with Beirong.

97
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
It should be the unique mark

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,000
of the mastermind behind.

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,000
From Qingshui County
to Yunchuan's poisoning case.

100
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
And finally here.

101
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,600
Those with the burnt mark

102
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,920
have been tailing us.

103
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,400
There's only one man

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,040
who can train so many suicide squads

105
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,640
and make Lei Zheng so loyal to him.

106
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,720
Do you mean

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
the Prince Yun?

108
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,200
What's wrong with you?

109
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
I'm fine.

110
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,920
I knew it.

111
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
You're afraid of corpses.

112
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,000
You're a big guy. Come on!

113
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Go out.

114
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,120
Go out.

115
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,680
Brother Xie.

116
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,720
Do you recognise the burn mark?

117
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,040
No.

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,800
I have never seen it.

119
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,400
It feels a little suffocated.

120
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,800
I'll be outside for a while.

121
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,280
He is so timid.

122
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,458
(Maoyuan Inn)

123
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
Ming, not bad.

124
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,320
You're getting stronger.

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,840
Look at you. Drenched in sweat.

126
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,520
Keep practising.

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,040
My Lord.

128
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,080
All your arrangements are done.

129
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
Could my adoptive father

130
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,760
be Prince Yun?

131
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,960
Xie Beiming!

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,240
Xie Beiming!

133
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,280
Rushuang.

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,760
What's wrong?

135
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,320
You're not yourself.

136
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,840
Are you not feeling well?

137
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,080
Rushuang, I'm fine.

138
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,240
Let me check your pulse.

139
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,040
Rushuang, I'm fine. Really.

140
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,120
Let me see.

141
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,600
There's nothing wrong.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
But why do you look so pale?

143
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,640
You didn't seem to have a good appetite.

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,120
Perhaps the corpse

145
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,880
affected my appetite.

146
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,760
I knew it. You coward.

147
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
Open your mouth.

148
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,720
What is this?

149
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,040
The Calming Pill that I made myself

150
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,280
to treat depression

151
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
if you come across
something you shouldn't see

152
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,039
or doing things you shouldn't do.

153
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,480
From Qingshui County,

154
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,000
Prince Yun's men have been following us

155
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,320
all the way until now.

156
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
It's obvious that someone's

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
giving away our plans.

158
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Your Highness suspects

159
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,200
there's a spy here.

160
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Only you and Fei Yuan knew

161
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,680
that I went to Qingshui  Country.

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,960
The trip later wasn't
planned beforehand.

163
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,960
The searching for Li Mu this time

164
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,840
was also unplanned.

165
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
Even I wasn't sure

166
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,480
where I could find Little Su.

167
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,920
Only Fei Yuan,

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Rushuang

169
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,480
and Xie Beiming

170
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,600
know exactly where we are.

171
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
It's time to eat! Hurry!

172
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,440
What have you made this time?

173
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,200
I caught a pigeon

174
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,600
and wanted to cook it for Detective Su.

175
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,520
But

176
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,560
Brother Xie insisted
that it's his pigeon.

177
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
So I let it go.

178
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,160
Brother Xie.

179
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,480
Why you keep a pigeon?

180
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,520
To send letters home.

181
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,120
My adoptive father loves to read

182
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,520
my stories in jianghu.

183
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,000
So I need to tell him in detail.

184
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,760
A chatterbox.

185
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,520
Could it be him?

186
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,120
Xie Beiming has an adoptive father.

187
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm leaving.

188
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,560
Rushuang.

189
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,720
If...

190
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,920
If...

191
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,800
If I accidentally made a blunder,

192
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,440
would you forgive me?

193
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
That depends on what blunders
you have made.

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,920
What have you done wrong?

195
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,960
You went to the brothel?

196
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,800
I...

197
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,400
No.

198
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,320
No brothel is around.

199
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,560
-You fall in love with other?
-Rushuang.

200
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,800
No.

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,480
I...

202
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm saying if.

203
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,120
Really?

204
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,720
As long as you're faithful,

205
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,000
I can forgive you.

206
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,280
Well...

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,040
What if...

208
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm not?

209
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,280
I'll forsake you then.

210
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,120
Get a good rest.

211
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,680
(Capital)

212
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:13,076
(Mansion of Prince Yun)

213
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,080
Who are you?

214
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,960
-Who are you?
-How dare you trespass here?

215
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,720
Get out of my way!

216
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,320
Prince Yun! Come out!

217
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,400
Stop!

218
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,880
It's really him.

219
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,720
Why did you do this to me?

220
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,095
Why did you make me unrighteous?

221
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,640
Don't talk to me about righteousness!

222
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,960
In the imperial court,

223
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
it's a dog-eat-dog world.

224
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,520
If I do nothing,

225
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,640
Xiao Yanzhi will frame me up.

226
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,040
Why did you hide from me

227
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,080
that you're the Prince Yun?

228
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,280
My son.

229
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,880
I'm a person of high authority.

230
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,880
I have too many enemies.

231
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,240
I concealed my true identity from you

232
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,200
to keep you safe.

233
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,440
To keep me safe,

234
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,680
you sent Peng Yi and the others
to chase me down.

235
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,640
Peng Yi knows you.

236
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
How would he possibly kill you?

237
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,760
Where's Peng Yi now?

238
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,440
He's dead.

239
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,680
Dead?

240
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,680
So

241
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,800
Xiao Yanzhi survived again.

242
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,400
Peng Yi has served you for so many years.

243
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
He's dead now.

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Don't you feel the slightest bit upset?

245
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,480
He couldn't make it to
come back alive.

246
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,200
Why should I be upset?

247
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,800
How about me?

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,960
If I died,

249
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,160
would you be upset?

250
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,400
Ming.

251
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,720
You're different from them.

252
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,960
You're my adopted son.

253
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,040
My adopted son.

254
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,520
Adopted son?

255
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,480
You just want to make use of me.

256
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,680
Ming.

257
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,920
I raised you up.

258
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,000
Are you not aware

259
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,000
how I've been treating you?

260
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,000
Your father and I were best friends.

261
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Before he died, he entrusted you to me.

262
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,200
All these years

263
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,080
I never let you get involved
in the imperial court affairs.

264
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
I've kept my promise

265
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,000
to your father.

266
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,400
But

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,840
in order to get news about Prince Qi

268
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,840
you made me write letters to you.

269
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,320
Ming.

270
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,240
It's so silly of you.

271
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,200
Have you not been writing to me

272
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
before you met Prince Qi?

273
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,200
Besides

274
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,320
I've sent my men to keep an eye
on Xiao Yanzhi.

275
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:28,361
I just coincidently got the news

276
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,360
from your letter.

277
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,440
Son.

278
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,040
I know you're a good

279
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,080
and simple-minded kid.

280
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,520
But right now

281
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,640
you're already involved in it.

282
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm afraid

283
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,320
it's not that easy to get away now.

284
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,440
Ming.

285
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,280
I heard

286
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,160
you fell in love with a girl

287
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,120
named Rushuang.

288
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,400
Right?

289
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,680
You're a grown-up now.

290
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,000
It's about time you get married.

291
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,080
I've been looking forward to it

292
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,760
when I can enjoy
the bliss of a happy family.

293
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,280
All right now.

294
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,880
Ming.

295
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,520
For the sake of you
and Ms. Rushuang's future,

296
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
you should figure out

297
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,360
who is the one you should follow.

298
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Ming.

299
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,840
You should return to Prince Qi.

300
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,680
If you have any news, inform me at once.

301
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,640
All right?

302
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,920
It's dangerous.

303
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,560
Ming.

304
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,160
You need to watch out for yourself.

305
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,520
Xie Beiming has disappeared

306
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,880
upon returning to the capital.

307
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
Where has he gone to?

308
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,520
Good!

309
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Adoptive father.

310
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,640
Adoptive father.

311
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,760
You're a clever boy.

312
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,600
Your sword skills have improved a lot.

313
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,160
Adoptive father, you once said

314
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,640
as long as I get better at it,

315
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,560
you'll give me a real sword.

316
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,080
Ming.

317
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
When have I not kept my promise?

318
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Thank you.

319
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,280
Ming.

320
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,520
Don't get anxious.

321
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,760
I heard you were injured.

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,680
Is it severe?

323
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,480
I'm fine.

324
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,360
Let me see.

325
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,880
Come on.

326
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,840
It's quite a deep cut.

327
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,360
Why were you so careless?

328
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
It's quite a deep cut.

329
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,240
It pains me to see you get hurt.
Do you know that?

330
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,880
You'd better be careful from now on.

331
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,840
I heard

332
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,600
you fell in love with a girl

333
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,680
named Rushuang.

334
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:16,521
For the sake of you
and Ms. Rushuang's future,

335
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,800
you should figure out

336
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,880
who is the one you should follow.

337
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,640
I'll take good care of you.

338
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,600
I'll take care of you

339
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
forever.

340
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,960
Rushuang.

341
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,280
If I disobey my adoptive father,

342
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,840
he'll surely harm you.

343
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,720
I can't even protect you.

344
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,680
Why?

345
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,600
Why did you make me unrighteous?

346
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
What should I do?

347
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,640
Shopkeeper!

348
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
Another pot of wine, please!

349
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:15,163
(Pei Mansion)

350
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,520
What's this?

351
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,320
It's the clothing that poisoned
the late emperor.

352
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,360
The two key evidence

353
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,920
convicted the Bai Liang Clan.

354
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,560
One was the letter of treason
forged by Li Mu.

355
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,320
The other one

356
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,560
was the poisonous clothing.

357
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,400
So I took the clothes from the palace

358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,320
to let Ms. Rushuang check.

359
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,080
Perhaps, there'll be any new clues.

360
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,960
I'll surely do my best.

361
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,720
If the poison was put on
the Bai Liang brocade in the palace,

362
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,400
all we have to do is investigate

363
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,400
each procedure of handling the clothing.

364
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,960
So we might find out when

365
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,640
and where things went wrong.

366
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,960
Laundry Bureau?

367
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,200
Why did you take me here?

368
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,360
Specific personnel are responsible
for the tributes,

369
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,640
from warehousing to tailoring

370
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
and to daily safekeeping.

371
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,240
All will go through strict examinations.

372
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,200
It would be quite difficult

373
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,960
if the person behind this

374
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,000
wanted to tamper with it
in these procedures.

375
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,480
(Laundry Bureau)
While the Laundry Bureau

376
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,920
is the easiest among all

377
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,600
for them to tamper with the clothes.

378
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
Come on. I'll take you to meet someone.

379
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,920
Your Highness.

380
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,800
Rise.

381
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

382
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,160
Eunuch Liu.

383
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,000
This is Detective Su of Mingjing Office.

384
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I've heard about you.

385
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,520
I've never thought
Detective Su is so young.

386
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,840
Eunuch Liu.

387
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,760
We're here to...

388
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,640
I understand.

389
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,680
The late emperor took great care of me.

390
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,600
After that incident, everyone was scared.

391
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,800
So

392
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,560
I have been waiting.

393
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,640
Waiting?

394
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,080
Waiting for someone
to investigate the matter.

395
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,160
So you mean,

396
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,000
the truth of
the late emperor's sudden passing

397
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,040
was not revealed.

398
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,880
I dare not make
any groundless accusations.

399
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,480
At the time of the incident,

400
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,120
I was just the Chief Eunuch of
the Imperial Household Bureau.

401
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,360
What I'm saying today
was what I witnessed.

402
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,480
Eunuch Liu, tell us.

403
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,400
Before the late emperor was poisoned,

404
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,000
the female chief of the Laundry
Bureau died of a sudden illness.

405
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,960
Was her in charge of washing

406
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,080
the late emperor's clothes?

407
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,280
When the late emperor was still alive,

408
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,720
no one cared about her death.

409
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,320
According to the rules of the palace,

410
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,720
the body was merely taken
outside the south gate of the city...

411
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,640
and be buried in a place
called the Trench Cemetery.

412
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,880
A few days later,

413
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,280
her body

414
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,120
was excavated for some reason.

415
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,560
It was burned to ashes!

416
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,840
It sounded like
they were destroying evidence.

417
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,000
After the late emperor passed away,

418
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,960
The investigator said

419
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,480
that the Bai Liang brocade was poisonous.

420
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,440
The more I thought about it,
the stranger it got.

421
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,080
But soon after, the Bai Liang Clan
was exterminated.

422
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,680
So it was left unsettled.

423
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,240
Strange indeed.

424
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,440
But the body had been burned.

425
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,360
It's been so many years.

426
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,400
I'm afraid there is no way to verify it.

427
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,560
That female chief was very skillful.

428
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,680
She was good at fixing various brocades.

429
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,600
Even if it was as delicate and
complex as Bai Liang brocade,

430
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,360
she could sew seamlessly
and make it look flawless.

431
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,640
Sometimes, the Imperial Household Bureau

432
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,840
would ask for her help

433
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,160
when they encountered
picky imperial consorts.

434
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,640
What a shame.

435
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,000
Eunuch Li.

436
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,240
Do you remember anything else?

437
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,120
If anything was odd

438
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,720
this was the only thing.

439
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,400
I just recalled.

440
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,120
There was something else.

441
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,440
Eunuch Liu said

442
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,720
a few palace maids who fell ill

443
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
were sent out of the palace.

444
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,040
However,

445
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
when he checked the records later,

446
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,160
he discovered that the departure
of those palace maids

447
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,680
wasn't recorded.

448
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,800
Could it be possible

449
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,360
that they didn't fall sick

450
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,680
but got poisoned instead?

451
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
We agree.

452
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,200
As long as we could locate them,

453
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,200
I could tell if they were sick

454
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,720
or poisoned

455
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,800
by their symptoms.

456
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,560
I heard that retired palace maids

457
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,920
were sent to Erheng Street in Chengnan.

458
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,240
We can go there.

459
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,840
If it was deliberately planned

460
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,200
these maids

461
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,200
would have been secretly placed elsewhere

462
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,040
instead of staying together
with other maids or eunuchs.

463
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,680
Well, if someone hid them,

464
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,600
where should we go to find them?

465
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
Brother Xie, you're back!

466
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,520
Are you having a discussion?

467
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,440
I'll return to my room.

468
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,240
Brother Xie.

469
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,720
I need your help.

470
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,240
That's right.

471
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,720
We're counting on you

472
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,240
to find people or news.

473
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,400
What's wrong?
Why do you seem listless?

474
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,320
Are you sick?

475
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,360
Rushuang, I'm fine.

476
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,560
I merely drank too much yesterday.

477
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,040
I've got a hangover.

478
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,160
Who are you looking for?

479
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,760
We are looking for the maids

480
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,200
who were dismissed from the palace
a few years ago.

481
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,360
We suspect

482
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,240
that they're related to the
poisoned Bai Liang brocade.

483
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,200
OK.

484
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,560
I'll try.

485
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,800
Well, we'll leave it

486
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,840
to you two.

487
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,840
Little Su and I are going into the palace.

488
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,480
What for?

489
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,640
Anything related to the late emperor

490
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,840
should be investigated
regardless of its importance.

491
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,400
All were recorded in the daily log

492
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,840
and stored in Hongwen Hall.

493
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,520
Perhaps, we can find some details.

494
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,600
That's great.

495
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Let's go now.

496
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,880
You cannot get into the palace

497
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,680
wearing like this.

498
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:10,530
(Hongwen Hall)

499
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,680
Your Highness.

500
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,720
Rise.

501
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,080
Your Highness.

502
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,680
Why does this eunuch look so unfamiliar?

503
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
I'm going to Hongwen Hall
to check some records.

504
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,840
So I got this idle eunuch

505
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,400
from the Imperial Household Bureau

506
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,480
to help me carry some books.

507
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,600
Actually,

508
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,440
I was just transferred to the
palace a few days ago.

509
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,000
-Well, firstly...
-All right now.

510
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,080
Leave us.

511
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,560
Yes.

512
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:50,133
(Hongwen Hall)

513
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,840
Miss, take a look.

514
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,760
It's all homemade.

515
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,960
Yes, I was attracted by the fragrance.

516
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,960
Check this one out. It's really not bad.

517
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,560
Look.

518
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,400
Rushuang, I know it's you.

519
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,160
How did you know?

520
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,400
I've already put on the mask.

521
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,360
That's so smart of you.

522
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,400
Why are you here?

523
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,960
Well, you're trying to locate them
on your own.

524
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,120
So I wanted to keep you company.

525
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,760
What's the matter?
You don't want me around?

526
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,440
No. Well...

527
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,480
It's tiresome to search for people.

528
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
You should head back first.

529
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,680
Why are you alone?

530
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,040
Where are your buddies around you?

531
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,200
I...

532
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
I don't want to rely on others.

533
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,720
Fine. So be it.

534
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,280
Nothing is too difficult for us,

535
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,760
as we take up arms for justice after all.

536
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,680
Isn't it?

537
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,480
I heard that a few Buddhist nuns

538
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,360
came to Jintai Temple a few years ago.

539
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,720
I think they might be those palace maids.

540
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,760
Why don't we check it out?

541
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,840
I still...

542
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,800
Let's go.

543
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,680
How old were you in the 11th
year of Liangde's reign?

544
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,680
The 11th year of Liangde's reign?

545
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,040
I was nine.

546
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,280
Why did you ask it?

547
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,200
What did you see?

548
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,160
It says here

549
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,680
that you once lost to the then
Crown Prince in archery.

550
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,800
In the end,

551
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,880
you lost your temper and bit an eunuch.

552
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,560
Those making the compilation
were just taking revenge on me.

553
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,680
I'm not that ignorant.

554
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,800
Well, why did you bite the eunuch?

555
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,120
That time

556
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,560
the then Crown Prince and I
were practising archery.

557
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,880
The empress,
namely the present Empress Dowager

558
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,160
was with him looking out for him

559
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,960
motivating him

560
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,240
and wiping his sweat.

561
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,680
But as for me...

562
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,680
There was an eunuch

563
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
who wanted to wipe my sweat.

564
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,800
But I bit him out of anger.

565
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,240
I was just...

566
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,680
You were missing your mother.

567
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,520
Actually

568
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,360
I'd never seen my mother.

569
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,960
Not long after she gave birth to me,

570
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,680
she passed away.

571
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,840
I grew up watching His Majesty

572
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,040
being pampered by the then empress.

573
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,720
I was so envious.

574
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,680
But I didn't know how it felt like.

575
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,000
I never liked celebrating the
new year since I was little.

576
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,840
During the festival

577
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,120
my siblings were accompanied
by their mothers.

578
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,320
But I was all alone.

579
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,680
So

580
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,400
I would miss my mother the most

581
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,440
during each new year.

582
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,880
It's fine now.

583
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,720
It's been so many years.

584
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,320
I'm getting used to it.

585
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,400
Actually

586
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,640
I miss my mother very much too.

587
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,320
I often thought to myself.

588
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,440
Back then,

589
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,480
if she hadn't hidden me in the well

590
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,720
I wouldn't have survived until now.

591
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
I'm sorry

592
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,200
for making you upset.

593
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,960
It's not your fault.

594
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,360
For the sake of my family and my clan,

595
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,480
I must find out the truth.

596
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
It's all my fault
for getting there too late.

597
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,400
I couldn't do anything for you.

598
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
I'm so grateful

599
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
for what you've done for me.

600
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,680
I'm not just doing this

601
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,920
for you.

602
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,520
I'm doing it for myself too.

603
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,040
I'm going to vindicate the Bai Liang Clan

604
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,440
and clear your parents' name.

605
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,880
Only then,

606
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,360
can you be with me with no qualms.

607
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,840
We can have our own family.

608
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,560
We can have our own close relatives.

609
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
Our family?

610
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,160
Our family.

611
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,280
We can have our own kids.

612
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
Then, we'll have grandchildren.

613
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,720
We'll become a big family.

614
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,280
At that time, we will make up

615
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,440
for everything we have lost.

616
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,640
Really?

617
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,440
Of course.
