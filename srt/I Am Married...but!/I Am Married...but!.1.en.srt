1
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:11,541
Happy birthday!

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,291
Happy first birthday!

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,750
So cute!

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,541
Look at her high-bridged nose.

5
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:17,458
Just like her dad.

6
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:18,375
That's true!

7
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,708
They have the same nose!

8
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,375
- So prominent!
- Yeah, just like her dad.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,083
<i>Nonsense!</i>
<i>You're lying through your teeth.</i>

10
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,625
<i>Her dad's nose is so flat.</i>

11
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,458
The baby's eyes are so big.

12
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,250
She got them from her mom.

13
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,250
<i>Everyone knows the mom</i>
<i>had cosmetic eye surgery.</i>

14
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,166
I-Ling,

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,291
long time no see!

16
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,875
The baby is so cute!

17
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:44,916
Yeah.

18
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,250
I-Ling,

19
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,208
do you feel like having a baby,
like everyone else?

20
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,833
<i>Do you feel like dying at a funeral?</i>

21
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,500
<i>Marriage and having children</i>
<i>are like contagious diseases.</i>

22
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,833
Congratulations!

23
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,333
<i>A few years ago, when I had turned 30…</i>

24
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,083
They look so happy!

25
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,958
<i>Friends see others getting married</i>
<i>and feel like it's their turn.</i>

26
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,000
<i>It's like at a graduation ceremony.</i>

27
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,875
<i>It's like watching your classmates go up</i>
<i>to receive their diplomas,</i>

28
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,125
<i>while you're still retaking classes.</i>

29
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,250
<i>You naturally feel left behind</i>

30
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,708
<i>and catch the "marriage fever."</i>

31
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,708
- Congrats!
- <i>Here's some fruit for you.</i>

32
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,625
<i>Enjoy!</i>

33
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:37,541
I-Ling, you're 30.
Get married, or you might miss out.

34
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,458
Meet someone!

35
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,833
Look,

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,833
over there,

37
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,458
at the man in the dark suit.

38
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,041
That's my nephew!

39
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,583
He has a car,

40
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,500
a house,

41
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,958
and respects his parents.

42
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,083
This kind of guy is the best!

43
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,000
Auntie, have some watermelon!

44
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,625
- It cools you down.
- This grainy texture, I don't like it!

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,041
Let me introduce you to someone.

46
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,833
With your great qualities,

47
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,250
staying single must mean you're too picky!

48
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,416
You really shouldn't be too picky.
It's just about living life together.

49
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,416
How about it?

50
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,500
<i>You're picky about watermelon,</i>

51
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,083
<i>so why can't I be picky?</i>

52
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,666
At 18, I moved alone to Tainan
for school and work.

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,333
I paid for my tuition and living expenses.

54
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,291
I graduated
and relocated to Taipei for work.

55
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:34,375
Despite the high rent,
I managed to send money home every month.

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,750
I'm so outstanding.

57
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,000
Why settle in marriage?

58
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,916
There are just too few outstanding men.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,666
Why blame me for being picky?

60
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,000
When you finally get married,

61
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,791
you see others having kids
one after another.

62
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,750
It feels especially contagious.

63
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,541
You find babies adorable
when you see them.

64
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,708
The baby's head smells so soothing.
I want one too!

65
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,125
But did you know?

66
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,291
Pregnancy might cause stroke,
retinal disease,

67
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,875
hypertension, diabetes, epilepsy,

68
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,791
and tearing from vagina to anus.

69
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,750
Congratulations!

70
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,333
When are you due?

71
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,083
Honey,

72
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,166
my mom said not to get home too late.

73
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,000
Why?

74
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,416
She's cooking tonight.

75
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,916
Can we not go home for dinner today?

76
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,333
She said my uncles are coming over,
and she hoped…

77
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,833
we could all eat together.

78
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,250
Didn't we just eat together last week?

79
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,500
Yeah.

80
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,250
MOM: A HAPPY FAMILY REUNION.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,958
IN-LAW: A HAPPY FAMILY REUNION.

82
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:57,333
MOM: STAY SAFE, SKIP THE BOOZE.

83
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,500
<i>Ultimately,</i>

84
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,583

87
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,791
Screw you!

88
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,958
What the heck?

89
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,958
What's wrong? Can't you hold it together?

90
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,583
Just one second more!

91
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,125
How am I supposed to edit this?

92
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,083
Not happy with him? Solve it after work.

93
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,250
Going back and forth makes
it hard for both you and me!

94
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,166
<i>Advertising sells a lifestyle,</i>

95
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,208

105

Hello?

106
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,791
The director's there?

107
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,083
Why did he arrive so early?

108
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,916
Okay, I'll pack up and head over now.

109
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,500
Fuck!

110
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,625
Fuck!

111
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,625
Are you okay?

112
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,375
Sorry.

113
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:57,916
Are you okay?

114
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:58,958
I'm fine.

115
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,916
You're bleeding.

116
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,625
Where is it broken?

117
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,750
Let me see.

118
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,958
How did this happen?

119
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:09,958
Hello?

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,208
Can you hear me?

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,083
Don't panic.

122
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,500
I'll call an ambulance.

123
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,666
I'll take you to the hospital.

124
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,208
Do you want to go to the hospital?

125
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,000
You…

126
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,166
have a nosebleed.

127
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,291
<i>Life, like editing,</i>

129
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,041
<i>The difference is, life has no script.</i>

131
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,541
I am Zeng Xue-you,

132
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,541
as in Cheung Xue-you.

133
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,666
Are you an engineer?

134
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,291
Have a seat.

135
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,666
The disc and read/write head seem fine.

136
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,750
It's not making strange noises either.

137
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,208
The motor drive is stable,

138
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,458
so the data inside should be fine.

139
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,791
Thank God.

140
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:05,708
Yeah.

141
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,791
By the way, are you using Windows or Mac?

142
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,541
Mac.

143
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,000
For Mac,
I'll back it up on a new one for you,

144
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,041
so your data won't get damaged
when you return.

145
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,708
Thanks.

146
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,500
I am really sorry.

147
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,958
You're hurt, yet…
you're helping me with this.

148
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,416
Have you eaten? Can I buy you some food?

149
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,000
No need, I've already eaten.

150
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,541
I ate and was on my way back when…

151
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,875
I am sorry.

152
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,833
No, I'm really sorry too.

153
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,083
Let it run for a moment.

154
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,666
This brand is amazing.

155
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,666
I had a small one before.

156
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,083
What are the maximum storage capacities?

157
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,375
This one is 12TB,
and it can go up to 60TB.

158
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,208
Awesome.

159
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,125
Yeah.

160
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,750
How about home and business hard drives?

161
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,291
What's the difference?

162
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,875
Usage time differs.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,125
Businesses can use it 24 hours a day.

164
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,041
With a five-year warranty,
that's 43,800 hours.

165
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,958
For home use, it's 10,000 hours max.

166
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,875
Business-grade hard drives

167
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,208
use premium capacitors
made from high-quality materials

168
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,583
Oh, I see.

169
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,208
I'll buy the business one.

170
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,791
Doesn't HDD have one with a max of 16TB?

171
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,791
I had a RAID 5
with five hard drives but only 1TB.

172
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,625
What are you laughing at?

173
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,333
Nothing.

174
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,666
This is the first time…
a girl talks to me about hard drives.

175
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,791
Done.

176
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,208
How much for this hard drive?

177
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,541
Free of charge.

178
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,708
No way, a 4T drive must be expensive.

179
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,625
No, really, it's a gift from me.

180
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,250
Did you just hit your head?

181
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,125
No, I have plenty here.

182
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,875
I don't really need this one.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,916
You can have it.

184
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,125
Really?

185
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:35,958
Yeah.

186
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:38,791
Really?

187
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,458
Yeah.

188
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,375
HARD DISKS LAST FOREVER,

189
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,916
TRUE LOVE LASTS A LIFETIME.

190
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,958
Good luck with your film!

191
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,125
Thank you.

192
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:06,916
Bye.

193
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,208
Bye.

194
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,541
Wait.

195
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,083
Wait.

196
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,166
<i>Some say</i>

197
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,333
<i>men fall in love easily,</i>

198
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,750
<i>because they mistake an erection</i>

199
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,708
<i>for a pounding heart.</i>

200
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,333
<i>But I don't have a penis, so…</i>

201
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,375
<i>it must be my heart racing.</i>

202
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,458
PRESENT

203
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,250
Mom.

204
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,291
Sleep. It's still early.

205
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,083
It's 5:00 a.m. Go to sleep.

206
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,166
It's okay.

207
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,583
I'm just taking out the trash. Sleep. No…

208
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,041
I'll handle it.

209
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,375
I-Ling.

210
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,500
Are you throwing out all these bags?

211
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,541
Yeah, I don't want them.

212
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,708
Can I have them?

213
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,250
I'll use them as trash bags!

214
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,125
Okay.

215
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,250
Thank you.

216
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,208
Sleep.

217
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,708
I-Ling.

218
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,875
Are you throwing out this pen too?

219
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,333
Yes, because it's out of ink.

220
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,666
Can I have it?

221
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,125
Okay.

222
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,250
Thanks.

223
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,333
Sleep.

224
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,500
Mom.

225
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,000
I can wash it,

226
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,166
just leave it there.

227
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,416
I'll handle it!

228
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,958
You young people work hard every day.

229
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,833
You must be tired and exhausted.

230
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,125
You should sleep more.

231
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,375
Sleep more. Go.

232
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,375
Here.

233
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,208
Sleep.

234
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:07,958
My underwear.

235
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,416
Damn it!

236
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,250
Three years ago,

237
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,666
we got married and were supposed
to live here for one year.

238
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,791
It's been three years.

239
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,708
When will you tell your mom
we're moving out?

240
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,958
Housing prices have soared.
Let's wait, okay?

241
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,500
It's always expensive.

242
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,375
But if we move out now,

243
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,958
we'll need to pay for a mortgage,

244
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,583
that would make things tougher.

245
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,333
Didn't we already discuss this?

246
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,250
Just buy what we can afford!

247
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,958
When will you tell your mom?

248
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,250
I…

249
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,416
Xue-you,

250
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,208
breakfast is ready!

251
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,250
I'll tell her.

252
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,583
You always say that.
You say that all the time.

253
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,250
- Mom, good morning.
- Good morning.

254
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,166
Eat your porridge while it's hot.

255
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,083
Okay.

256
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,666
Today's ribbon fish may be too salty.

257
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,666
Try it.

258
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,416
How is it? Too salty?

259
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,458
It's just right.

260
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,833
I told you not to talk while eating fish,
or you'll choke on a bone.

261
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:56,916
Remember?

262
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,666
I made your lunch box.

263
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,125
Xue-you, eat more vegetables.

264
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,583
So cute.

265
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,250
How is it?

266
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,166
Delicious.

267
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,083
Really?

268
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,000
Let me taste it.

269
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,875
Here, you try it too.

270
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,125
Delicious.

271
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,500
Egg?

272
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:37,916
Two.

273
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:38,916
Two eggs.

274
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:55,750
Mom.

275
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:58,875
Let me.

276
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,125
Thank you.

277
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,041
No big deal.

278
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,291
Mom, take a break.

279
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,333
Bye, Mom and Dad!

280
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,291
Bye, Mom and Dad!

281
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:56,166
<i>We've been living here for three years.</i>
<i>I still feel like an outsider.</i>

282
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
<i>Is he the one?</i>

283
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,291
<i>Everyone is born with half a soul.</i>

284
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,541
<i>Only by meeting your match,</i>

285
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,625
<i>do you become whole.</i>

286
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,125
<i>Your soulmate</i>

287
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,166
<i>is on</i>

288
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,916
<i>Soul Mate Hub.</i>

289
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,291
Nice.

290
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,625
This part is well-edited.

291
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,541
That's right.

292
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,500
My heart skips a beat.

293
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,250
I also love this version the most.

294
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,875
So… is this the final cut?

295
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:37,708
Okay.

296
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,875
Thank you. Great job!

297
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,583
- Thank you. Great job!
- Great job!

298
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,916
Thanks, Director!

299
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,125
No, thank you.

300
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:48,125

- Download it!
- Thanks.

308
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,708
This app is purely text-based.

309
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,375
No photos,

310
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,291
just soulful connections.

311
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,208
And…

312
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,708
it's also for married people.

313
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,666
I am single.

314
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:18,916
Take a seat.

315
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,666
- Leave some nice comments.
- Take a seat.

316
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,000
Take a seat.

317
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,041
Thank you all.

318
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,916
It's no trouble,

319
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
not at all.

320
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,791
Remember to give us five stars!

321
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:34,875
Sure.

322
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,625
No problem.

323
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:37,541
Thanks.

324
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,041
Ask me anything!

325
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,833
That's not necessary.
It's all explained clearly.

326
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,833
YOUR NICKNAME

327
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,916
SUNNY
LOGIN

328
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,166
- Bye. Safe travels.
- Thank you. Great job.

329
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,291
Take care.

330
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,000
That was too much!

331
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,791
Keep your voice down!

332
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,041
They pushed us to download it
and promoted cheating.

333
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,958
Doesn't it sound quite sexy to you?

334
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,166
IN-LAW: GUA-GUA'S EATING ON HIS OWN.
ADORABLE!

335
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,375
Is that your son?

336
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,416
He's so grown-up.

337
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,875
The neighbor's kid.

338
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:24,750
Your mom-in-law is giving you
some clever, subtle hints.

339
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,500
Doesn't she know you don't want kids?

340
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:27,416
She knows,

341
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,083
but knowing and accepting
are two different things.

342
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,250
She keeps saying,

343
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,541
"It's up to you,

344
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,125
whether to have kids or not."

345
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,916
She wishes a baby would pop out
the moment I open my legs.

346
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,291
She's such a hypocrite!

347
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,958
Don't you think it's ironic?

348
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,875
Everyone, both men and women, say,

349
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,041
"Study hard,
grow up, and strive to get a good job."

350
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,000
But after 30, everyone says,

351
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,375
"Women shouldn't love work so much."

352
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,625
"Get married earlier."

353
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,500
"Have kids earlier."

354
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,708
That's strange.

355
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,333
Why should women over 30

356
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,833
only aim to be good wives and mothers?

357
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:06,833
Were you joking when you told me
to work hard for 30 years?

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,833
NaNa,

359
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,208
what do you want to eat?

360
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,875
Why not ask me?

361
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,041
You have a lunchbox.

362
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,750
You can have it.

363
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,750
Don't be so picky.

364
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,250
She cooks for you every day.

365
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,541
So sweet!

366
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,833
Low oil, low salt, no scallions.

367
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,375
Try eating this every day!

368
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,583
That's so healthy.

369
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,083
Your mom-in-law loves you.

370
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,166
Grilled meat rice?

371
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,125
Love you!

372
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,458
You two jerks!

373
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,250
- <i>Match.</i>
- Oh my God.

374
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,333
How many dating apps are you using?

375
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,250
More than ten.

376
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:50,958
What?

377
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,041
No one wants me anyway!

378
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,708
It's good that you know.

379
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,166
Just don't say it out loud.

380
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,291
Look, so many young people,
even younger than you.

381
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,375
18, 20, 20, and 18 years old.

382
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,000
<i>This is Paul.</i>

383
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,750
<i>He got divorced four years ago</i>
<i>because his wife cheated on him.</i>

384
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,916
<i>Now, he's a golden bachelor.</i>

385
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:15,458
Honey.

386
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,666
- Call me as soon as you land.
- <i>Okay.</i>

387
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,500
- Do you remember the due date?
<i>- April…</i>

388
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,333
April 29th.

389
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,208
<i>That's NaNa.</i>

390
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,333
<i>She's dated men of all zodiac signs.</i>

391
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,666
<i>She accidentally got pregnant by an Aries.</i>

392
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,958
<i>She wants a baby, not a marriage.</i>

393
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:40,875
- Didn't you watch that yesterday?
- I want to watch it again with subtitles.

394
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,875
- You didn't understand it without them?
- Not really.

395
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:47,083
I just want to see my idol's cute face.

396
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:50,791
<i>This is Chi.</i>

397
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,416
<i>She's a proud single person.</i>

398
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:55,375
<i>She only admires Korean idols on TV,</i>

399
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,416
<i>avoiding regular guys to stay carefree.</i>

400
00:25:58,708 --> 00:25:59,958
How about

401
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,583
we have stir-fry tonight?

402
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:04,333
- Let's go eat at that place…
- Stir-Fry Heaven.

403
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,166
Stir-Fry Heaven.

404
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,041
It's His Sis Day.

405
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,875
That's too much!

406
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,375
<i>Every Friday night,</i>

407
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,750
<i>my sister-in-law's family dines with us.</i>

408
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,750
Read me a story please, Aunt.

409
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,458
<i>My in-law makes eight dishes and one soup,</i>

410
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:30,666
<i>making every week</i>
<i>feel like a New Year holiday.</i>

411
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,625
Just a moment, wait a bit.

412
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,208
<i>The busiest place is the bathroom.</i>

413
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,458
"I can't help but feel sad, holding…"

414
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:43,208
<i>Someone's always in there.</i>

415
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,791
"Ran out, holding back tears."

416
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,750
"The prince and princess
lived happily ever after."

417
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:48,750
The end.

418
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,958
One more book.

419
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,208
I just read that one.

420
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,958
Read it again, please.

421
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:00,875
Chloe,

422
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:01,791
did you notice

423
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:02,916
that the prince

424
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,041
always looks the same?

425
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,291
Fairy tales are all lies,

426
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,000
the prince was a bigamist.

427
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,541
What is a bigamist?

428
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,750
A bigamist

429
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,208
means…

430
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:17,625
He married Snow White already,
but now he wants to marry Sleeping Beauty,

431
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:18,958
then the Little Mermaid,

432
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,541
and Cinderella too.

433
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:21,791
Look,

434
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,791
his smile is shameless.

435
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:24,958
I'm telling you,

436
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,333
make sure you choose wisely.

437
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,375
Don't end up with someone like this.

438
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:31,625
You're a liar.

439
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,333
You should eat more vegetables.

440
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:53,250
<i>I forgot to mention my dad-in-law.</i>

441
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,291
<i>He usually plays chess with himself.</i>

442
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,750
<i>If you talk to him…</i>

443
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:04,416
Voltage is classified as
low, high, or ultra-high.

444
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,208
Household voltage is 110V

445
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,708
or 220V.

446
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,875
- 3,000V.
- Give the meat to Xue-you.

447
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,708
3,300V,

448
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,458
11,000V,

449
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:18,333
22,000V.

450
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:22,791
Ultra-high voltage can reach 161,000V.

451
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,458
<i>He's retired from the power company.</i>

452
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,583
<i>My mom-in-law does everything.</i>

453
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,916
<i>He's like a plant at home,</i>

454
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,916
<i>and you barely notice him.</i>

455
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,208
Come on, eat more vegetables.

456
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,875
I-Ling.

457
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,333
Mom.

458
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,333
Thank you.

459
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,083
Thanks.

460
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:01,500
Not at all.

461
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:24,875
I-Ling, thank you.

462
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,166
<i>For what?</i>

463
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:27,416
<i>You're not helping.</i>

464
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,291
I've thought of a secret.
I tried it with your brother-in-law.

465
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:35,500
It's the position that got us Chloe.

466
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,333
I don't want kids.

467
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:39,750
Raise your butt

468
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,416
when you make love.

469
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,875
I don't want kids.

470
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,541
Then, lift your leg as high as possible.

471
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,708
Stretch the… as much as you can.

472
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:51,083
and… when it's inserted inside…

473
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,833
Reach the deepest spot,

474
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,375
and wait there.

475
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,125
Don't move.

476
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,791
There's a cockroach.

477
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:00,750
Mom!

478
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:04,000
Mom!

479
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:07,583
Where? Mom.

480
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,500
Where?

481
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,791
- Here.
- Where?

482
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,583
- Take it.
- Here you go.

483
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:16,416
- You…
- No.

484
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,708
Here.

485
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,083
I think you're so sexy now.

486
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,041
Really?

487
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,250
I'll take out the trash later too.

488
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,875
You're awesome!

489
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,041
Remember,

490
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,958
if Mom asks us to go pray tomorrow,
tell her I have to work early.

491
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:05,666
I can't take any more exorcism.
Every time, it feels like I'm going blind.

492
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,125
Okay.

493
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,875
Xue-you.

494
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,333
Leave it.

495
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,625
I'll wash it, just leave it.

496
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,625
Go… go eat some fruit. Go.

497
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,708
Leave it.

498
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,666
Thanks, Mom.

499
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,875
I-Ling.

500
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,208
Yes, Mom.

501
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:23,750
Tomorrow is the 15th.

502
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,500
Come pray with me.

503
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,375
It's better to pray every month.

504
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,333
Mom, she works early tomorrow.

505
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,500
Is that so?

506
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,708
- When do you start?
- I need to be at the office by 9:00.

507
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,083
That's so early.

508
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,500
We'll go at 5:00 then.

509
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:46,833
We'll make it on time.

510
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,250
Bodhisattva, bless us with children

511
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:13,708
and grandchildren.

512
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,125
Please.

513
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:18,041
May our bloodline
be blessed to live on forever.

514
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:21,833
Bodhisattva, bless the Zeng family
with grandchildren.

515
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,708
Please, Bodhisattva, bless them.

516
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,333
While the Bodhisattva

517
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:34,166
practiced deep wisdom.

518
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,375
He saw that all five aggregates are empty

519
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,166
and he frees from all suffering.

520
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,583
Sariputra,

521
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,833
form is not different from emptiness,

522
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,708
emptiness is no different from form,

523
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:49,208
Form is emptiness, and emptiness is form.

524
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:51,875
I want a divorce.

525
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,791
SOUL MATE HUB: HI SUNNY,

526
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:00,750
LOOKING FOR A SOUL MATE MATCH FOR YOU!
