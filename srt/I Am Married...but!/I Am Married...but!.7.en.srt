00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,750
<i>Lin I-ling.</i>

2
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,458
<i>Lin I-ling.</i>

3
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,458
<i>Lin I-ling.</i>

4
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:38,583
<i>Use me.</i>

5
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,666
<i>I</i>

6
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:47,708
<i>want kids.</i>

7
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:49,875
Honey.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,375
Honey, what's wrong?

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,416
I want kids.

10
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,416
You want a baby?

11
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,666
What did you say?

12
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,583
You…

13
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,333
You just said you want a baby.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,125
Who said that?

15
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:09,958
You did!

16
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,500
Me?

17
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:12,791
<i>Yeah.</i>

18
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,000
<i>You!</i>

19
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:16,875
Shit!

20
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,083
Again?

21
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,041
- What the heck?
- <i>What the heck?</i>

22
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,333
<i>I'm your uterus.</i>

23
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,916
<i>I want to have a baby.</i>

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,875
Honey.

25
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:25,791
You…

26
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,833
You decided you want to have a baby?

27
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:30,416
<i>Use me!</i>

28
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,375
<i>Use me!</i>

29
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,083
<i>Use me!</i>

30
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:34,250
I need to go.

31
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,208
Don't mess with me!

32
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,666
How could you be my uterus?

33
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,875
Your voice sounds so smoky.

34
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,166
<i>You're so rude!</i>

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,083
<i>You know,</i>

36
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:51,166
<i>my voice used to be</i>
<i>as sweet as Taylor Swift's.</i>

37
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,125
<i>It's smoky because I was yelling at you.</i>

38
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>My throat is so hoarse now.</i>

39
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,541
How could you go
from Taylor Swift to Donald Duck?

40
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,833
- I'm begging you, don't lie.
<i>- Shouldn't I be the one begging you?</i>

41
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,333
<i>I see eggs fail to implant</i>
<i>and die every month.</i>

42
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,166
<i>Imagine that.</i>

43
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,208
<i>Can you imagine how awful that is?</i>

44
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>Tick tock,</i>

45
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,500
<i>tick tock, tick tock…</i>

46
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,000
Beep, beep, beep…
What are you beeping about?

47
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,250
<i>Time flies.</i>

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,666
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

49
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,666
<i>You're already at high pregnancy risk.</i>

50
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,000
<i>If you don't have one now,</i>

51
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,458
<i>you might not be able to later.</i>

52
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,166
Stop the emotional blackmail.

53
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,291
Having kids is a choice,
not an obligation.

54
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,791
<i>Who said anything about</i>
<i>choice versus obligation?</i>

55
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,958
<i>Your eggs aren't fresh anymore.</i>

56
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,250
<i>That's a fact.</i>

57
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,875
<i>Are you sure you don't want kids?</i>

58
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,458
- I…
- <i>Really sure?</i>

59
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,083
<i>Like, you'll never regret it?</i>

60
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,708
Are you working late?
Or are you waiting for your girlfriend?

61
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,375
I haven't found the one yet.
What else can I do?

62
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,541
What a pity.

63
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,291
I could make a flyer to help you find one!

64
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,500
Go home early. Don't work so hard.

65
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,875
Okay, good night.

66
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:50,791
Good night.

67
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,458
TO SUNNY: DON'T WASTE TIME WAITING.

68
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,500
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST TRY.

69
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,166
Time flies.
The baby's one month old already.

70
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,458
Kids seem to grow up fast,

71
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,791
but raising your own feels so slow.

72
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,958
I'm on call 24/7!

73
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,500
- How long have I been burping him?
- Half an hour.

74
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,083
- My hand's about to fall off.
- You can rest when it actually falls off.

75
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,500
Keep going.

76
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,208
A-Nan.

77
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,666
- Can I try holding him?
- Okay.

78
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,125
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

79
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,708
I… wait.

80
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,625
Be careful, Zeng Xue-you.

81
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,000
Sure. You can try.

82
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,541
- Be careful.
- Careful.

83
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,625
- Hold his back.
- Slowly.

84
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,291
- Right.
- Like this.

85
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,875
Hold on… Don't let go.

86
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,041
- Don't let go.
- I got it.

87
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,000
- Here you go.
- Let go.

88
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,916
Yeah…

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,125
A bit higher…

90
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,500
Like this?

91
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,541
- Yeah.
- Right.

92
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,166
- Cup your hands like this.
- Cup them.

93
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,125
Yeah, and then go up.

94
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,625
- Like this?
- Yeah, cup your hands.

95
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,583
Is this okay?
Are you comfortable like this?

96
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,083
<i>Look at this.</i>

97
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,083
<i>So healing.</i>

98
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,125
<i>So sexy.</i>

99
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,791
Oh, dear.

100
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,583
<i>Please use me!</i>

101
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,458
<i>Use me!</i>

102
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,625
Listen, think carefully before having
a baby. I feed him a dozen times a day.

103
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,083
Then I burp him, change his diaper,

104
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,625
get him to sleep,
and then it's milk time again.

105
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,083
You never have a free moment.

106
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,833
Even going downstairs
feels like going abroad.

107
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,083
Nights are the worst.

108
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,958
He won't stop crying.

109
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,500
I can't sleep at all.

110
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,000
Chi.

111
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,166
Chi.

112
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,416
Give me that.

113
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,500
The baby is crying.

114
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,000
He is crying.

115
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,791
- No.
- The baby is crying.

116
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,541
- No.
- The baby is crying.

117
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,625
No, keep it down.

118
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,041
He isn't crying.

119
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,833
Did I hear wrong?

120
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,750
Are you that scary?

121
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,666
Tell me.

122
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,458
He's burping.

123
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,333
Magic hands.

124
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,291
I didn't expect you to be so good!

125
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,541
Can you come every day, please?

126
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,750
Can I?

127
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,166
<i>Did you see that?</i>

128
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,625
<i>He's such a great teammate.</i>

129
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,833
He's so cute.

130
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,000
<i>I'm serious.</i>

131
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,541
<i>You won't regret not having kids,</i>

132
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,125
<i>but he…</i>

133
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,666
<i>He definitely will.</i>

134
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,458
He laughed.

135
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,500
- I've never heard him laugh out loud.
- Did he?

136
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,333
That was so cute.

137
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,875
What did you just do?

138
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,666
I just… I…

139
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,750
I…

140
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,750
Like this?

141
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,250
Smile again.

142
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,833
He smiled.

143
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:29,791
Like this?

144
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,000
He likes the "doo-doo" sound.

145
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,791
He smiled.

146
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,541
That was so cute.

147
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,166
NaNa said A-Nan didn't hold the baby
until a week after he was born.

148
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,958
Really? Why?

149
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,208
I don't know.

150
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,166
Maybe he's scared.
He's feeling the weight of responsibility.

151
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,750
He said cameras come with thick manuals,

152
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,083
but babies come with nothing.

153
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,041
That scared him.

154
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,416
Having a kid isn't like getting married.
Couples can get divorced.

155
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,166
But once the baby is born,

156
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,791
there's no going back.

157
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,083
Every decision affects

158
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,666
their whole life.

159
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,083
A-Nan decided to stay though.

160
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,833
I won't run away either.

161
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,333
Are you sure?

162
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,000
We won't know for sure
until the baby's born.

163
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,208
I promise I won't run.

164
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,083
What makes you so sure?

165
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,666
I have faith in us.

166
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,291
<i>Lin I-ling.</i>

167
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,041
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

168
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,666
<i>He may not know how to be a good husband,</i>

169
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,666
<i>but he'll definitely be</i>

170
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,250
<i>a great dad.</i>

171
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,541
What's wrong?

172
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,375
I am sorry.

173
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,041
Why are you apologizing?

174
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,166
I don't know, but…

175
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,666
Better safe than sorry.

176
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,458
Okay.

177
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,833
Why not try?

178
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,083
If it happens, we'll have one,

179
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,000
but just one.

180
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,083
Really?

181
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,750
What? Take it or leave it.

182
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,666
No…

183
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,666
I want to try

184
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,000
to have one child.

185
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,458
Raising a kid is expensive.

186
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,500
Okay, money.

187
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,291
I can work overtime.

188
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,583
It can be frustrating.
You won't have time to play.

189
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,666
Okay, no play, I won't play.

190
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,375
I'll get fat during pregnancy.

191
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,833
Yeah, like a pig! That's fine.

192
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,416
You'll still be cute,
even if you look like a pig.

193
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,333
You swear?

194
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,125
I swear, even if my wife Lin I-ling
gets fat as a pig, I'll still love her.

195
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,041
I won't dislike her.

196
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,083
You just called me a pig, Zeng Xue-you!

197
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,750
Honey.

198
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,666
What?

199
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,083
Thanks.

200
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,375
<i>I'm having contractions.</i>

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,875
<i>Finally, our day has come</i>

202
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:42,416
<i>Let's make a baby</i>

203
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,125
<i>Our ancestors are here</i>

204
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,291
<i>To say "thanks!"</i>

205
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:55,541
<i>Keep our family going</i>

206
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,000
<i>Love is all we need</i>

207
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,333
<i>We can do this again</i>

208
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,583
<i>Let's do this again!</i>

209
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,291
<i>With love</i>

210
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,416
<i>Do it one more time!</i>

211
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,625
These dishes are great

212
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,166
for girls.

213
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,458
Amaranth is a good source of iron.

214
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,666
Pig's feet are packed with collagen.

215
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,250
The yam in the chicken soup

216
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,541
helps with ovulation.

217
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,041
You need to eat well to get pregnant.

218
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,458
Here, have some meat.

219
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,916
It's good for you.

220
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,416
Eat!

221
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,250
Thank you, Mom.

222
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,541
How is it?

223
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,083
<i>Still no green onions, ginger, or garlic.</i>
<i>No salt.</i>

224
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,500
It's so… organic.

225
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,583
Natural is the best.

226
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,791
You-you, here, this is yours.

227
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,125
For me?

228
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,708
Enjoy.

229
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,708
Use the Egg Hunter app
to track your ovulation.

230
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,666
It's super handy!

231
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,791
When your egg is ready, it beeps.

232
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,541
When it beeps, you two should do it.

233
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,875
Actually, the more you do it, the better.

234
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,250
How often do you do it?

235
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm not keeping track.

236
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,125
Listen to me.

237
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,750
Don't wait more than five days, okay?

238
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,666
Or his sperm

239
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,833
will go bad.

240
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,333
You need to release it before then.

241
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,375
It's like buying lottery tickets…
The more you buy, the better your chances.

242
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,333
Just do it more often, okay?

243
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,375
Me and your brother-in-law?
We get it done in three minutes.

244
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,125
<i>That's quicker than taking a dump!</i>

245
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,750
If we're into it,
we last three and a half minutes.

246
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,083
<i>Egg!</i>

247
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,625
<i>Egg!</i>

248
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,083
<i>Egg!</i>

249
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,125
YOUR EGG'S READY. IT'S TIME TO GO.

250
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,250
<i>Lin I-ling, did you say you wanted a baby?</i>

251
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,916
Let nature take its course.

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,583
No need to stick to a schedule.

253
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:29,458
<i>At this age, nothing's natural.</i>
<i>One less egg means one less chance.</i>

254
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,625
<i>My eggs are crying.</i>

255
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,458
What?

256
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,208
- When do you need to get to the office?
- 9:00 a.m.

257
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,875
What? Wait, what do you mean? Wait.

258
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,166
What do you mean?

259
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,708
Wait.

260
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,625
Wait.

261
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,333
Chicken and yams boost fertility.

262
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,875
Drink all the Chinese medicine.

263
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,083
<i>Egg!</i>

264
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,000
"Get tips for getting pregnant here."

265
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:11,666
"Jumping rope can
stimulate ovulation and boost fertility."

266
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,333
"Try 500 jumps before sex."

267
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,708
After 500 jumps, I'd be dead,
how could I do it then?

268
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,333
<i>If you've decided, make it quick!</i>

269
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:27,458
<i>You know raising a child takes strength,</i>
<i>and it only gets harder as you age!</i>

270
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,333
<i>"The three best positions</i>
<i>to get pregnant."</i>

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,958
"Missionary position, doggy style,
and spooning position."

272
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,750
"Remember to raise your legs after sex."

273
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,875
"It's best to stay inverted."

274
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,166
- Higher?
- Okay.

275
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,208
One, two, three.

276
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,833
And the pillow. One, two, three.

277
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,250
- How is that?
- How is what?

278
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,708
Too high, again.

279
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,625
Zeng Xue-you!

280
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,625
Take a big bite.

281
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,625
Drink chicken soup.

282
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,750
Great!

283
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,416
You have to finish your Chinese medicine.

284
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,625
It's impossible.

285
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,958
I can only do 100 jumps.

286
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,500
Honey.

287
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,666
Make it quick.

288
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,791
Do it fast.

289
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,125
- I want to sleep now.
- Now?

290
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,375
You look tired.

291
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,708
It doesn't matter.

292
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,833
I'll just lie here.

293
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:41,958
You move.

294
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,458
- Are you sure?
- Quick.

295
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,291
Here.

296
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,708
This is chicken essence.

297
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:51,916
Drink this first.

298
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,666
Yes,

299
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,083
I think your belly's getting bigger.

300
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,791
Is it?

301
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,458
Eat more.

302
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,375
Here.

303
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,083
- Eat more.
- Thanks, Mom.

304
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes, take a big bite.

305
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,250
One more bite.

306
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,291
Nice.

307
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,666
Honey.

308
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,333
Mom, let me check on her.

309
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,541
Honey, are you okay?

310
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,250
For real?

311
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,458
If I'm pregnant now,

312
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,166
then the baby is due…

313
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,916
<i>In June of next year.</i>

314
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,833
That's so soon!

315
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,958
I must go to a postpartum care center.

316
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,583
<i>Don't dream of it.</i>

317
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,458
<i>Mom will take care of you.</i>

318
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,583
She better not do that or I'll take
the kid and run back to my folks.

319
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,666
<i>You think you can get away?</i>

320
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,166
How long is maternity leave?

321
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,791
Half a year

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,958
or a year?

323
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,208
I hope it's a girl.

324
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,583
Girls are cuter.

325
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,250
Should we set a rule,

326
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,125
like she can't date until college?

327
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,333
Or maybe until she's 25?

328
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,916
Twenty-five…

329
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,500
Honey?

330
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,208
Senpai…

331
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,250
Senpai?

332
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,083
The purchase order's ready.
Can you check it?

333
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,333
Sure.

334
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,458
This screen is lame.
Replace it with higher-end one.

335
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,625
Lighting and VFX companies
demand high-performance hardware.

336
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,083
Alright.

337
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,500
Let me see.

338
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,708
Replace this one.

339
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,291
Yes.

340
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,666
The hardware can't run this.

341
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,083
Not this. Sorry.

342
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,916
I'll get some water.

343
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,041
- Sorry.
- Senpai, sorry!

344
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,875
Was that cold or hot?

345
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,916
Wipe it.

346
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,458
Wipe the floor…

347
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,000
Sorry. I have to go to the bathroom.

348
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:34,875
Lu…

349
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,583
Lu?

350
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,416
I have a spare shirt. Do you want it?

351
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,833
Sure.

352
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,750
- Senpai, just a second.
- Sure.

353
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,041
Thanks.

354
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,916
Sorry, I usually wear this when I ride
my scooter. It might smell bad.

355
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,416
Not at all.

356
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,500
- No.
- Really?

357
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,083
- It doesn't smell bad?
- No.

358
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,791
I'll return it to you later.

359
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,375
I'll just let you be.

360
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,333
Thank you, Senpai.

361
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,291
You're welcome.

362
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,958
The baby kicked again.

363
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,166
Yeah. That was a strong kick.

364
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,500
Can I even have a baby?

365
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,208
If I can't, why ask me in the first place?

366
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,291
Are you there?

367
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,375
Can you say something?

368
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,625
Why did you ask me to use you?

369
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,458
Hello?

370
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,166
<i>No expectations,</i>

371
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,583
<i>no disappointments.</i>

372
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,500
<i>If something is destined to fail,</i>

373
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,000
<i>don't try at all.</i>

374
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,000
- Why are you here?
- Do you live here?

375
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,791
- I live here.
- I'm delivering medicine.

376
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:05,916
You go first.

377
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,708
You are here to deliver medicine?

378
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,250
An old man hurt his foot.

379
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,375
He can't walk,
so I'm delivering his medicine.

380
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,625
You're so sweet to come

381
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,458
all this way just to deliver medicine.

382
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,583
It's my job.

383
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,833
I'm so lucky to have run into you here.
