1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,250
Why are you wrapped in a towel?

2
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,250
I forgot my underwear.

3
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,166
Are you naked?

4
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,041
You have broccoli on your head.

5
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,375
- You're too much! How could you hit me?
- You were even worse.

6
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:42,208
It took you all day to clean up the table
and you never washed the dishes.

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,500
You didn't ask me to.

8
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,166
Are you a soldier
that can only follow exact orders?

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,375
How'd you know to buy toys
when I didn't ask you?

10
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,333
You didn't even clean up
the soda you spilled.

11
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,125
I didn't see it.
If I had, I would've cleaned it.

12
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,416
You didn't see it?

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,750
And no one puts pizza

14
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,541
straight into the fridge.

15
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,458
That's gross!

16
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,291
The box was too big.

17
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,666
You could use a plate.

18
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,708
The fridge is too full.

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,958
And you could just tell me.

20
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,833
Why did you hit me?

21
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,875
Why didn't you mention
that it's our anniversary today?

22
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,500
I knew you'd forget.

23
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,958
You forget every year.

24
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,041
You said you wanted to watch a movie.
I rushed to shower, and then what?

25
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,000
I thought you remembered.

26
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,125
It's not like that.

27
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,208
You know
I don't like the ritual of anniversaries.

28
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,041
Just remind me next time.

29
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,750
It's really weird.

30
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,875
You can forget your underwear

31
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,333
but remember our anniversary?

32
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,916
I have yearly reminders set on Google.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,916
That's not romantic.
Can you make it sound more romantic?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,916
Honey,

35
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,083
how can I be romantic?

36
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,250
You always forget. How can I be romantic?

37
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:21,958
Okay.

38
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,416
Sorry.

39
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,000
It was my bad.
It bad of me to act like that.

40
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,708
- I shouldn't have hit you with pizza.
- Or with any food!

41
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,916
Okay, listen.

42
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,583
I, Lin I-ling, swear

43
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,500
I won't hit Mr. Zeng with pizza

44
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,083
or any other food anymore.

45
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,916
Sorry!

46
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,875
Thanks to my no-underwear,

47
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,166
and very talented hubby.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,458
<i>Wake up, Xiu Yan, don't leave me.</i>

49
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,125
Why are you crying?

50
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,333
If I die one day,

51
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:20,875
would you remarry?

52
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,416
Why the weird question?

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,541
Of course not!

54
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,125
Don't be fooled by movies.

55
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,208
Only movie characters stay single.

56
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,375
In real life, 99.9% remarry.

57
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,166
I don't want to.
Getting married is a hassle.

58
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,208
You could make it easy.

59
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,875
There's no need for a banquet,

60
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,375
or wedding photos.

61
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,250
- Just sign the license.
- I don't want to.

62
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,375
Why?

63
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,208
Remarrying won't make me happier.

64
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,500
Oh really?

65
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,250
Why's that?

66
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,708
Because I just want to be married to you.

67
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,458
I should ask you
if you want to move too, right?

68
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,875
So,

69
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,833
do you want to move?

70
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,125
Honestly, I don't care
if we move out or not.

71
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,541
I just feel fine

72
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,791
staying here.

73
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,333
But if moving out makes you happy,

74
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,875
then let's move out.

75
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,958
Okay.

76
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,833
When your uncle pays you back,

77
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,250
we'll move.

78
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,083
- Once my uncle pays, we'll move.
- Promise?

79
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,166
Promise.

80
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,541
Break your promise
and you'll lose the pecker.

81
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,833
Can I lose something other than my pecker?

82
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,750
Such as?

83
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,666
I'm not sure.

84
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,583
But I just think it'd be nice to…

85
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,291
keep my pecker.

86
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,625
Yeah?

87
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,333
Yes, honey.

88
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,250
Is that right?

89
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,125
Yes.

90
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,125
You sure?

91
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,625
Babe, what are you up to?

92
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,791
Guess!

93
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,708
Wait!

94
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,958
Babe, wait!

95
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,625
Wait!

96
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,541
Come on.

97
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,833
- Wait!
- Come on.

98
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,375
Babe, wait!

99
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,791
You're on me, babe.

100
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,250
Move down a bit, please.

101
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,375
- You-you?
- <i>Shit!</i>

102
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,250
Move!

103
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,125
You-you.

104
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,125
Move!

105
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,500
Mom.

106
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,416
Why are you back so soon?

107
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,875
Auntie's fine now.

108
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,958
There was nothing I could do,
so I came back early.

109
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,041
What's up with the light?

110
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,875
I'm not sure.

111
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,375
Maybe it got scared.

112
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,833
LOVE IS EASY,

113
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,375
HARMONY IS TOUGH.

114
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:22,916
Hey, Mr. Wang!

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
- Excuse me.
- Senpai.

116
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,000
Why didn't they send someone
who can handle this?

117
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,791
- Sorry.
- What a waste of time.

118
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,208
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

119
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,666
- It's okay.
- Sorry, Director.

120
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,750
They're fixing it.

121
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,416
- Sorry, but thanks for coming.
- No worries.

122
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,458
You'll be able to handle this soon.
So, the machine won't turn on?

123
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,750
The indicator light's fine,
so it's not a hard drive issue,

124
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,708
but the machine keeps beeping.

125
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:54,083
Let's listen to the sounds it's making.
One, then three, then one short beeps.

126
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,541
For Phoenix, one short beep
followed by three or four short beeps

127
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,750
means it's a memory issue.

128
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,416
I'm impressed by how you nail it
just by the sound.

129
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,625
You'll get it if you keep practicing.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,916
Each brand makes different sounds.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,958
You can take notes.

132
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,708
Award makes a long "beep" sound

133
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,208
AMI is like…

134
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,833
If it's eight short beeps…

135
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,583
- then it's a graphics card issue.
- Okay.

136
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,125
Do you want to go pick up Shu first?
I can handle things here.

137
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,250
It's alright.

138
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,958
My mom's been helping out recently.

139
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,833
This is my job.

140
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,583
- I can't let you do all the work.
- No worries.

141
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:36,583
Let's find the issue now,
swap in a new memory, then run a test.

142
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,083
It'll take about 20 minutes.

143
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,000
Alright.

144
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,416
I'll tell them.

145
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,583
Wait.

146
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,583
I'll leave this to you.

147
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,458
- I'll do the talking.
- Alright.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,041
Your company's process sucks.

149
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,250
It's been down for a long time,

150
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,500
and you sent someone unprofessional.

151
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,208
It was fine during the test,
now there are tons of issues.

152
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,833
What exactly needs replacing?

153
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,125
Sorry, we need to swap the memory.

154
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,333
How long will it take?

155
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,250
Twenty minutes.

156
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,291
Twenty minutes?

157
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,250
Sorry.

158
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,708
You've wasted a whole fucking day.

159
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,375
How can I explain this
to the director team?

160
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,625
I'm really sorry.

161
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,333
What the heck?

162
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,625
Sorry, Mr. Wang. I'm really sorry.

163
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,083
Sorry, within 20 minutes,
I believe we can fix this.

164
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,250
Sorry.

165
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,083
Where should I massage?

166
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,916
Between the thumb and index finger.

167
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,500
- You do it so well.
- This is the acupuncture point.

168
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,166
Press here to relieve headaches
and shoulder pain.

169
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,750
Will you massage my hand
if I say I can't breathe well?

170
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,750
- If you're having trouble breathing, here.
- Your hands feel so strong.

171
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,125
It feels so good!

172
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,458
What do you think this is, a deli?

173
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,625
Listen.

174
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,458
People nowadays are complicated.

175
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:05,125
Be careful when making friends.
Many girls just love to have fun.

176
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,916
It's hard to find a girl as good

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
as my daughter.

178
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,875
Listen, my daughter teaches
at a nursery school.

179
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,458
She's pretty great!

180
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,833
- Thank you.
- I want go home.

181
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,666
Sure, I'll take you home.

182
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,708
Hey, little man. This is for you.

183
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,708
Bye.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,250
Stop by our place sometime!

185
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,708
- Sure.
- Bye.

186
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,333
<i>Don't talk in a baby voice.</i>

187
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,916
Last time was awkward. Sorry!

188
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,750
I'm here to pay you back.

189
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,625
Thank you.

190
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,041
No worries.

191
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,625
This is green tea.

192
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,833
- Do you want some?
- Yeah, thanks!

193
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,166
How's that wound?

194
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,208
It's fine. It's healed now.

195
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,125
I hope it'll heal quickly.
Take care of it.

196
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,791
<i>Why are you being shy?</i>

197
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,083
<i>You're not a girl, you're a married woman!</i>

198
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:14,958
That teacher…

199
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,958
at the nursery school…

200
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,333
She is great.

201
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,333
The women in the neighborhood

202
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,291
are more eager than I am
to find me a match.

203
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,166
Aren't dating apps all the rage now?

204
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,625
You should give one a try.

205
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,375
There's this dating app that recently
went viral. It's called Soul Mate.

206
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,500
Have you heard of it?

207
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,416
Are you using it?

208
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,708
I met a girl on there.

209
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,916
She has a unique point of view.
I had a great chat with her.

210
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,083
But…

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,958
What?

212
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,875
Well…

213
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,166
she's already married,

214
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,958
so I'll just be pen pals with my soulmate.

215
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,875
- What do you talk about?
- A lot of things.

216
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,583
Sometimes we talk about movies.
Sometimes about marriage.

217
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,541
- Married?
- Not yet.

218
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,458
You?

219
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,375
Married.

220
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,583
Do you like movies?

221
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,833
We recently talked about prose.

222
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,083
About prose?

223
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,875
"When you meet the one among the millions,

224
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,625
when amid millions of years,
across the borderless wastes of time,

225
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,625
<i>you happen to catch him or her,</i>

226
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,708
<i>neither a step too early</i>
<i>nor a step too late…"</i>

227
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,916
<i>When you meet the one, seize the moment.</i>

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,958
Once lost,

229
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,708
it's gone.

230
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,333
What?

231
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,625
Nothing.

232
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,125
I have to go.

233
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,708
Bye.

234
00:12:58,958 --> 00:12:59,833
It still won't open?

235
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,708
Strange, they fixed it this morning.
It's broken again?

236
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,041
The power's out?

237
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,166
Watch out for the cables.
Don't move yet. Wait.

238
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,125
Careful, here.

239
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,750
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

240
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,625
- Thanks.
- Let's go outside.

241
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,333
Watch out for the ramp.

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,250
It's dark outside. The power's out.

243
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,416
- I'll go check.
- Check the computer?

244
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,458
The power's out. It's dark outside.

245
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,458
"Kaohsiung power plant failure
causes nationwide outages."

246
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,291
He writes using Zhuyin.

247
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,208
So, what now?

248
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,583
I guess we wait.

249
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,083
Is it stuck?

250
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,666
It derailed this morning
Now I'm not sure what's wrong.

251
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,583
Is it dangerous if you push it?

252
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,916
Are you in a hurry?

253
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,208
No.

254
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,208
It's a blackout.
Everywhere else is dark anyway.

255
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,416
Hold on.

256
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,125
How did you come up with this?

257
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,083
I learned survival skills
when I went camping.

258
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,250
But honestly,

259
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,791
this is all I know.

260
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,833
No signal.

261
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,166
No power.

262
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,666
No signal.

263
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,208
This feels like a doomsday movie,

264
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,458
like zombies are out there.

265
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,916
Good thing the door's stuck. We're safe.

266
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,791
Good thing we have drinks.
We won't die of thirst.

267
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,125
Good thing we have food.

268
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,041
Sweet and savory too.

269
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,583
Perfect.

270
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,958
Too bad it's a bit hot now.

271
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:45,000
You can stick this
on the back of your neck to cool down.

272
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,833
<i>You've reached the voicemail of…</i>

273
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,458
Not going through?

274
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,750
No.

275
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,916
Is Shu alright?

276
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,000
My place has power.

277
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,416
He's doing homework.

278
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,333
Great.

279
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,041
Lu…

280
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,541
Come with me.

281
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,708
Look at all the stars!

282
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,958
There's no light pollution.

283
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,000
Have you always
been into computers, Senpai?

284
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,375
I…

285
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,000
I majored in Chinese.

286
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,000
Chinese?

287
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:23,916
Yeah.

288
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,125
That's so impressive!

289
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,041
Impressive?

290
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,791
Why?

291
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,500
My mom thought it was a good idea
for me to be a Chinese teacher.

292
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,166
That's why I majored in Chinese.

293
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,333
How did you learn to fix computers?

294
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,583
One of my roommates
studied electrical engineering.

295
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,666
He liked a junior in our faculty.

296
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:47,125
I said, "Teach me how to fix computers.
I'll write your love letters."

297
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,916
I copied a lot of Eileen Chang
and Xu Zhi-mo's works.

298
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,750
Shu writes love letters, too.

299
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,083
Really?

300
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,208
To whom?

301
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,833
To the girls in his class.

302
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,250
He writes with Zhuyin.

303
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,791
"You're as pretty as this flower."

304
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,708
Then he drew

305
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,333
a flower beside it

306
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,583
and wrote,

307
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,458
"To my wife, I love you."

308
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,208
He has a wife already?

309
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,333
Yeah.

310
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,166
It makes me sad as a mom.

311
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,333
He said he'd marry me the other day,

312
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,333
but then got a wife right away.

313
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,916
He's growing up so fast.

314
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,666
At this rate,

315
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,291
you'll have a grandchild by the time
Shu finishes nursery school.

316
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,958
He'll soon say,

317
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,083
"Mom,

318
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,333
leave me alone."

319
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,958
I'm gonna be a lonely old lady soon.

320
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,416
Come on.

321
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,083
You won't be alone.

322
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,041
You're so kind.

323
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,958
You'll find someone soon.

324
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,083
You think so?

325
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,875
I won again.

326
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,333
You suck.

327
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,541
No way. One more game.

328
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,791
I really want ice water.

329
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,625
I put it in the freezer
right after the power cut,

330
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,958
so it's probably not that cold.

331
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,416
Thanks.

332
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,125
It's so quiet outside.

333
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,083
It feels like camping.

334
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:17,708
- How many people usually camp with you?
- About three or four. All college friends.

335
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,041
After everyone started working,
it got hard to find time to go again.

336
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,708
Sometimes I go alone,

337
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,583
and when I see the stars,

338
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,291
I think would be nice

339
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,791
to share the moment with someone.

340
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,833
Haven't you met anyone?

341
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,125
I had a girlfriend.
We dated for three years.

342
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,083
We planned to marry two years ago,

343
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,083
but broke up during the preparations.

344
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,708
What happened? Why?

345
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,791
Maybe I wasn't good enough.

346
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,375
My family sells bentos.
Her folks are both doctors.

347
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,625
They had different views on weddings.

348
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:02,166
My family wanted a local <i>Liushuixi</i> banquet
feast. Hers preferred a hotel banquet.

349
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,833
We fought a lot

350
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,291
over small things.

351
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,708
On the day of our
engagement photo shoot,

352
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,000
she never showed up.

353
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,541
And that was the end.

354
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,833
So I decided to go work in Australia.

355
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,166
I just wanted to exhaust myself,
so I couldn't think about it.

356
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,458
It's not that you're not good enough.

357
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,708
If she loved you,

358
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,166
a local feast or hotel banquet
wouldn't have mattered.

359
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,500
So, why did you open a pharmacy?

360
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,875
This has been my dream since high school.

361
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,458
I think

362
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:52,791
it's pretty cool
to help heal people's pain.

363
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,541
You should thank your ex-fiancée,

364
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:00,208
because not getting married back then
gave you the chance to chase your dream.

365
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,458
Sometimes when bad things happen,

366
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,125
I think maybe

367
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,916
it's for the best later.

368
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,041
Right.

369
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,791
I should thank her

370
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,541
for backing out before the wedding.

371
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,333
That's how I ended up meeting you here.

372
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,791
I just won again.

373
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,541
Why do I always win?

374
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,291
Then I guess I'll need you
to stay and play with me until I win.

375
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,000
Let's go. One more round.

376
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,083
You go first.

377
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,958
<i>Marriage is the most irrational contract…</i>

378
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,833
<i>It's one signature to last a lifetime.</i>

379
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,125
<i>But how is it possible</i>

380
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,708
<i>to not to feel attracted to others</i>
<i>for 50 or 60 years?</i>

381
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,125
<i>"When you meet the one among the millions,</i>

382
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,833
<i>when amid millions of years,</i>
<i>across the borderless wastes of time,</i>

383
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,583
<i>you happen to catch him or her,</i>

384
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,458
<i>neither a step too early</i>
<i>nor a step too late,</i>

385
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,208
<i>what else is there to do except</i>
<i>to ask softly: "So you're here, too?"</i>
