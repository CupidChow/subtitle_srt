1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,625
<i>Hello? How can I help you?</i>

2
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:17,916
Lu.

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,166
It's me.

4
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,416
<i>You'll reach voicemail;</i>
<i>charges start after the beep.</i>

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,666
<i>You'll reach voicemail;</i>
<i>charges start after the beep.</i>

6
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,750
Where have you been?

7
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,291
Honey. Sorry, my…

8
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,833
My phone died.

9
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,083
Where have you been?

10
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,125
I…

11
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,541
somehow fell asleep

12
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:22,750
at my colleague's.

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,666
Which colleague?

14
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,291
Lu.

15
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,791
Why did you go to her place?

16
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,916
I just wanted to escort her home.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,458
The clients pressured her

18
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,708
to drink at our dinner.

19
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,416
I thought it was a bad idea,
so I drank them for her.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,708
You drank her drinks?

21
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,291
You don't drink,

22
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,583
yet you helped her?

23
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,583
Sorry. I didn't mean to,
but they kept pressuring her.

24
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,958
I didn't know what to do,

25
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,166
so I drank her drinks.

26
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,125
Why did you sleep at her place?

27
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,416
I know it sounds weird, but I was…

28
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,250
I was dizzy
after drinking too much, and then…

29
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:05,916
And then…

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,833
Somehow…

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,583
I just felt asleep.

32
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,708
But I swear that nothing happened.

33
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,666
I slept on the floor.
I came home as soon as I woke up.

34
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,916
I swear I didn't do anything stupid.

35
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,833
Please trust me. I didn't do anything.

36
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,375
For real, please trust me.

37
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:49,958
Honey.

38
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,041
I…

39
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,666
Mind if I shower?

40
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,833
Why do you need to?

41
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,000
I smell terrible right now.

42
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,083
And we…

43
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,583
should get ready for work.

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,041
QIANG: MEETING AT 9:00 AM

45
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,333
<i>Never ever…</i>

46
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,416
Never ever…

47
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Never ever check his phone.

48
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,583
If you see something unexpected,

49
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,666
that very moment

50
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,291
will haunt you forever

51
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,041
and you'll never trust anyone again.

52
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,833
You're lucky if you find proof.

53
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,250
If you don't find proof,
but still suspect he's having an affair,

54
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,333
that's the scariest part.

55
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,875
Then you're doomed.

56
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,541
Whenever he answers a call
or checks his message,

57
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,291
it'll look suspicious.

58
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,666
If he didn't cross the line,
don't push him away.

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,958
Damn, then he might just actually run off
with someone else.

60
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,541
Are you talking about yourself?

61
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,166
Yeah.

62
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,916
That's how I made my ex-wife run off.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,750
But Xue-you is as innocent as Snow White.

64
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,916
He wouldn't cheat.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,166
But Snow White was tricked.
The witch could kill him.

66
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,125
How could Lu be the witch?

67
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,500
She seems harmless.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,208
The harmless ones are the most dangerous.

69
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,583
Honey, you…

70
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,000
I didn't know you were meeting me here.

71
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,958
It's nothing special.

72
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,250
I was thinking

73
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,500
we haven't been out to eat in a long time.

74
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,208
What would you like to eat?

75
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,083
- No clue.
- Senpai…

76
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,416
- Let's see.
- Then…

77
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,000
Honey.

78
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,125
Let's check out a restaurant nearby.

79
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,458
All right.

80
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:36,791
Let's go.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,833
Hello?

82
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,125
No, I'm not sleeping. Wait a second.

83
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,708
Really?

84
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,833
RAIN: WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET?

85
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,333
SUNNY: IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

86
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,375
THANKS FOR CHATTING WITH ME.

87
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,958
BUT LET'S SAY GOODBYE HERE.

88
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,750
<i>I take it back.</i>

89
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,666
<i>Actually I want to meet you.</i>

90
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,125
<i>Let's meet.</i>

91
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,875
SUNNY: I'M WAITING FOR YOU
INSIDE THE RESTAURANT.

92
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,208
Are you Mr. Chen?

93
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,166
It's all arranged.

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This way, please.

95
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,791
Can I take your order, please?

96
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,666
Sorry, I have to leave now.

97
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,625
"SOUL MATE"

98
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,375
WANT TO MEET?

99
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,458
THANKS FOR CHATTING WITH ME.

100
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,541
LET'S SAY GOODBYE HERE.

101
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,708
Can I take your order, please?

102
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,583
Sorry.

103
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,625
Honey, what do you want?

104
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,416
Sorry, we need a bit more time.

105
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,333
Thanks.

106
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,708
Did you try to date Sunny for casual sex?

107
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,000
How is that possible? I knew it was you.

108
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,583
You knew?
Nonsense, how would you know it was me?

109
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,291
You left you phone at home the other day,

110
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,291
and I accidentally…

111
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,333
SOUL MATE: HI SUNNY, LOOKING FOR

112
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,166
A SOULMATE MATCH FOR YOU!

113
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,708
The client asked us to download it.

114
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,416
I didn't mean to date anyone.

115
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,958
And you? Why did you download it?

116
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,333
I just wanted to know
what was on you mind.

117
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,916
<i>Do you know why the divorce rate is high?</i>

118
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,458
<i>Because men only try hard before marriage.</i>

119
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,375
After that, they think they scored.
Now they can take it easy.

120
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,250
But to women,

121
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,375
it's not a sprint,

122
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,958
but a marathon.

123
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,708
The end is still a long way off.

124
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,583
<i>If you don't even try</i>
<i>and I'm the only one running,</i>

125
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,250
why should I stay married?

126
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,833
<i>Do you mean you want a divorce?</i>

127
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,541
<i>That's why…</i>

128
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,666
<i>I've been trying harder.</i>

129
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,833
Honey.

130
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,250
It's late, let's go home.

131
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,166
Honey.

132
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,416
Honey.

133
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,750
<i>To save more money,</i>

134
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,583
I'll cancel all my life insurance
and investments.

135
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,000
My dad will lend us money
if it isn't enough.

136
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,458
I'll tell Mom.

137
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,416
Wait.

138
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,708
Let me tell her.

139
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,208
<i>It turns out that a person you hate</i>
<i>can also be lovable.</i>

140
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,375
<i>Honestly, I don't care</i>
<i>if we move out or not.</i>

141
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,083
<i>I just feel fine</i>

142
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,291
staying here.

143
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,041
But if moving out makes you happy,

144
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,541
then let's move out.

145
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,125
Great!

146
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,833
When your uncle pays you back,

147
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,083
we'll move.

148
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,750
Once my uncle pays, we'll move.

149
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,958
<i>In a lifetime, you'll like many people,</i>

150
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,666
<i>but</i>

151
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,125
<i>you'll love only one.</i>

152
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,333
You are the best.

153
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,458
Okay.

154
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,041
Don't cry…

155
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,333
<i>If you have a helpful partner,</i>

156
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,000
<i>having a baby isn't such a bad idea.</i>

157
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>Don't waste time waiting.</i>

158
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,083
<i>You have to at least try.</i>

159
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,666
What makes you so sure?

160
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,916
I have faith in us.

161
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,958
Now I have mixed feelings.

162
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,916
Somehow, this is touching,

163
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,125
but I also want to hit you.

164
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,958
Why'd you say no
when I asked if you were married?

165
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,541
You lied about camping.

166
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,291
I… just didn't want to give myself away.

167
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,083
You never thought about coming clean?

168
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,958
I did, but in a subtle way.

169
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:04,958
When?

170
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,750
<i>Love's easy,</i>

171
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,083
<i>harmony is tough.</i>

172
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,666
See? I dropped a hint.

173
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,666
What do you mean?

174
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,916
A Jacky Xue-you Cheung song.

175
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,125
That isn't his song.

176
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,291
But it is.

177
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,166
"<i>Love's easy, harmony's tough"</i>
is not the song's name.

178
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,958
It's "<i>Love's tough."</i>

179
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,291
Is that right?

180
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,666
Wait.

181
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,708
How did you get
the app to match us as soulmates?

182
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,750
That was as easy as pie.

183
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,333
I just checked all
your ideal partner types in the app.

184
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,250
SELECT TRAITS

00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,625
<i>"Please select your traits."</i>

186
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,375
Traits.

187
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,208
<i>"What traits do you want in a soulmate?"</i>

188
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,333

<i>"What interests</i>

- Camping.
<i>- Camping.</i>

197
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,625
Well, you played it smart.

198
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,708
It was easy.

199
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,250
It doesn't use data analysis.
You just select all the options you like.

200
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,958
A better design would include
a psychological test to reveal your true

201
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,333
personality and character.

202
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:38,250
The questions should be carefully crafted
so people can't cheat like we did.

203
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,583
Is that right?

204
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,041
So…

205
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,833
What about you?

206
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,166
You…

207
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,000
Why did you ask Rain out?

208
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,166
Did you want to do…

209
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:55,958
with Rain?

210
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:56,916
Do what?

211
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,791
I knew it was you. Okay?

212
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,000
How?

213
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,083
- I looked at your phone.
- What?

214
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,708
You're quite good at it
chatting like it's nothing for so long.

215
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,416
- You looked at my phone?
- What? Did you forget?

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,875
You were drunk and stayed at Lu's.
It's hard to believe you two did nothing.

217
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,708
We really did nothing.

218
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,416
And Lu was not drunk at all.

219
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,916
She wasn't drunk?

220
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,208
Then why did you escort her home?

221
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,875
Why did your shirt smell like her perfume?

222
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,708
- Smell like her perfume?
- Yeah.

223
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,708
- You mean my scooter shirt?
- Yes.

224
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,500
Honey, that was because…

225
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,708
She spilled coffee on herself at work,

226
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,375
so I let her use my shirt.

227
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,666
She took it home to wash it.
That's why it smells like her perfume.

228
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,833
Honey, wait. I know it sounds weird.

229
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:45,750
But believe me,

230
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,500
I didn't do anything stupid with Lu.

231
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,125
You are so sweet.

232
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,541
You gave her your shirt.
You escorted her home…

233
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,208
You might as well take her kid to school!

234
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,125
Honey, no.

235
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,333
I didn't do anything stupid with Lu.

236
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,750
Really, nothing happened.

237
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,958
Honey.

238
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,791
It's not what you think.

239
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,875
Not what I think? Then how was it?

240
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:06,875
Tell me.

241
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,833
Excuse me.

242
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,791
This is the last call for orders.

243
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,291
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,625
Honey, sorry.

245
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,041
Should we order something?

246
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,625
Order your ass! I'm leaving.

247
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,625
Honey.

248
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,541
Honey!

249
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:31,833
Honey!

250
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,208
Zeng Xue-you.

251
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,083
It's okay if you guys did it.

252
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,375
Please just tell me.

253
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,291
Say something!
You being quiet pisses me off.

254
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,250
No, honey.

255
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,333
Something's off.

256
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,541
Rain's usually chatty and bold.
What's up with you?

257
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,958
That was on the internet,

258
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,125
not face-to-face.

259
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,666
So?

260
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,416
Do you mean you don't want to see my face?

261
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,208
No, honey.

262
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,666
Right. Whatever you want.

263
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,708
Don't follow me.

264
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,625
Honey.

265
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,666
Don't follow me!

266
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,833
SUNNY: I'M GONE NOW.

267
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,666
SUNNY: CAN YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH NOW?

268
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,375
WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY?

269
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,416
<i>On that day,</i>

270
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,625
<i>Lu and I left together and shared a cab.</i>

271
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,875
<i>In the cab,</i>

272
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,750
<i>Lu told me something.</i>

273
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,791
Senpai.

274
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,666
Your phone's ringing.

275
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,625
Senpai.

276
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,666
I've been holding back my crush on you.

277
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,791
Every day I see you…

278
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,291
I try hard to convince myself

279
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,625
that I don't like you.

280
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,458
I never liked you.

281
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,291
I've been trying so hard tell myself

282
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,833
that I can't have feelings for you.

283
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,458
But,

284
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,916
that's not easy.

285
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,458
What should I do?

286
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,291
What should I do?

287
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,375
Senpai.

288
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,875
We're at my place. Please wake up.

289
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,333
Don't fall asleep again.

290
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,625
Let me know when you get home.

291
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,000
Bye, Senpai.

292
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:07,916
Bye.

293
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,125
Excuse me,

294
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,500
please make a U-turn.

295
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,250
Go back to the last stop.

296
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,083
Senpai, I'm sorry.

297
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,875
I only have juice in the fridge.

298
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,666
Want some water instead?

299
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,625
I'm good, thank you.

300
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,250
I'll get you some water.

301
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,708
Lu, wait.

302
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,208
Um…

303
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,166
You said I'm a responsible

304
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,541
and skilled person, but I…

305
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,041
Thank you for the praise.

306
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,583
But honestly,

307
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,375
I'm not as great as you think.

308
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,291
I…

309
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,875
I snore in my sleep.

310
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,000
I…

311
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,250
I leave the bathroom door open.

312
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,791
If my wife argues with my mom,

313
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,500
I'll pretend I have to work late

314
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,083
just to avoid going home.

315
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,708
I'm far from perfect.

316
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,583
If I gave you that impression, I…

317
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,125
I apologize.

318
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,125
I might have some tea in the kitchen.
Let me check.

319
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:22,916
<i>I think…</i>

320
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,000
<i>I'll never meet anyone quite like you…</i>

321
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,583
<i>but I'll try to find someone even better.</i>

322
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,708
<i>Thank you, Senpai.</i>

323
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:58,291
THANK YOU? SCREW YOU.

324
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:13,541
SO YOU WENT TO HER PLACE
JUST TO TURN HER DOWN?

325
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,041
YEAH.

326
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,666
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO IN THE FIRST PLACE?

327
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:25,333
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT
WITHOUT PISSING YOU OFF.

328
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,541
ARE YOU PISSED OFF?

329
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,541
I NEVER WANTED TO DATE ANYONE ELSE.

330
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,416
I ONLY LOVE YOU.

331
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,083
You make me sick.

332
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,708
You sure can text anything.

333
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,708
Have you ever played truth or dare?

334
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,500
Nope.

335
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,416
Never?

336
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:03,708
Rock, paper, scissors.

337
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,416
Truth.

338
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:14,791
Are you serious?

339
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,125
Come on, ask away.

340
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,833
Then…

341
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,833
Are you still mad at me?

342
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,625
Are you sure?
Why don't you ask me something else?

343
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,916
Take the opportunity.

344
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,625
I just want to know.

345
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,500
I'm not mad now.

346
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,666
What for?

347
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,875
You turned her down,

348
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,250
and she accepted it.

349
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,833
She's a wise girl.
She deserves a pat on the back.

350
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:48,541
Keep your distance and don't be too nice,
or she might misinterpret you.

351
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,875
That's what leads to office romances.

352
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:53,583
You've been chatting with Rain.

353
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,750
Do you like him?

354
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,125
I think he is nice.

355
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,541
Blame my husband.

356
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:05,750
He spent three years saying empty words
about moving out.

357
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,750
When you said divorce, did you mean it?

358
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:11,250
One question at a time.
You have to win to ask another one.

359
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,166
Dare.

360
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,333
Are you sure?

361
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:27,583
Truth will be easier.

362
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,208
I'm a mean person.

363
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:30,375
No you're not, honey.

364
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,291
Dare.

365
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,041
Confess your love to the restaurant owner.
Blow him a kiss too.

366
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:44,666
Come on. You asked for it.

367
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,625
I'll look weird.

368
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,083
- You chose this.
- Nope.

369
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:49,750
What?

370
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:50,666
Hurry up.

371
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,708
Nope.

372
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,583
Are you backing out? I'll divorce you.

373
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:57,500
Come on.

374
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,083
Sir.

375
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,125
Hello, sir.

376
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,833
Sir, um…

377
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:10,208
The food is really good today.

378
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,291
I like you very much.

379
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,541
Thank you.

380
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,458
What?

381
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:27,750
That'd be weird.

382
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,250
Sir.

383
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,583
I'm sorry.

384
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,625
Excuse me. I need a restroom break.

385
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,458
Sit down.

386
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:46,583
Come on.

387
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:47,916
Again?

388
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,291
Pretty!

389
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,000
Place them around your face.

390
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,375
Hold your face.

391
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,375
Look at me.

392
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,500
Look to your right.

393
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,125
Come on.

394
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:12,708
I don't want to.

395
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,916
Choose truth then,
or beat me at rock, paper, scissors.

396
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:18,916
Come on.

397
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:25,125
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- You're very unlucky today.

398
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,041
Truth, then.

399
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,000
Finally.

400
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:40,041
I'll let you ask me this one. Ask away.

401
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,875
Did you really want to divorce me?

402
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,916
Some of the times you pissed me off,

403
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,416
I did want a divorce.

404
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,041
But if I had done it,

405
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,791
I think you would've cried like a baby,
so I didn't.

406
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,958
Really?

407
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,958
Is there anything you want me to improve?

408
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:05,833
Just…

409
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,250
try not to get angry easily.

410
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,791
No, I really don't know what to say
when you're angry at me.

411
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,791
Putting pizza in the fridge
without a cover?

412
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,750
I'm supposed to be angry!

413
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,833
There wasn't enough room the other day.

414
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:23,875
Don't blow up all at once.
Start with small emotions.

415
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,833
And don't hit me.

416
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,541
All right.

417
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,500
I'll start with small emotions.

418
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,291
Please share your true feelings with me.

419
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,541
It's okay
if you want to text me your thoughts.

420
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,000
One more question.

421
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:49,083
Why did you marry me?

422
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,375
You have no idea?

423
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:52,500
I didn't tell you?

424
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:54,250
No, you didn't.

425
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,833
Do you remember
the first time you stayed at my place?

426
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:05,125
We planned to dine out and watch a movie,
but you got tied up with work.

427
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,541
The client wanted a new cut.

428
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:10,625
I worked hard to deliver it.
I totally forgot you were at my place.

429
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,750
Stop nudging me! I'm working on it.

430
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,208
Are you trying to drive me mad?

431
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:23,125
It's not an instant rice roll.
This takes time.

432
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,875
This is the à la carte menu.
You have to wait.

433
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:27,791
Fuck!

434
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:43,291
I haven't taken out the trash
in two weeks.

435
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,333
I'm running out of toilet paper.

436
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,458
I'm running out of sanitary pads.

437
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:50,791
I'm screwed!

438
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:56,625
I waste my life revising all these cuts.
Yeah, keep doing this to me.

439
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,875
I have nothing better to do.

440
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,875
This clip is fucking crap.

441
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,541
Finally!

442
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,958
Screw them!

443
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,083
Do you want to eat something?

444
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,250
I forgot you were here.

445
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,291
Have you eaten?

446
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,333
Yeah, I ate something already.

447
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,791
Have you been watching TV?
Why is it on mute?

448
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,625
You were working.
I didn't want to distract you.

449
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,333
I threw out your trash too.

450
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,000
And…

451
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:50,958
Your bought me toilet paper?

452
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:51,875
Yeah.

453
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,291
And…

454
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:55,833
And that thingy.

455
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,958
What?

456
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,375
That thingy.

457
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:02,458
Hard drive?

458
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,083
- No.
- A 5T hard drive?

459
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,208
- No, it's…
- A bare disk?

460
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:06,666
- No.
- An external hard drive case?

461
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,791
I didn't know what model you use,
so I bought them all.

462
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:28,666
What "model"?

463
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,916
Nobody says that.

464
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:43,250
<i>That was the moment I knew</i>
<i>that I wanted to marry you.</i>

465
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,125
<i>I love you for who you are,</i>

466
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,541
<i>and I appreciate</i>
<i>that you let me be myself.</i>

467
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,916
<i>You didn't try to change me.</i>

468
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:21,875
Fuck!

469
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,875
Fuck!

470
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,958
Are you okay?

471
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,416
Do you ever think that

472
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,416
if I had driven here
a second earlier or later…

473
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,791
We might have missed each other.

474
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,458
Why did you go by Rain?

475
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,250
Because it was raining when I met you.

476
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,166
Was it?

477
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,125
Then why did you go by Sunny?

478
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,750
Because it was sunny when we met.

479
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,666
Was it?

480
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:04,791
Wait.

481
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,166
Wait.

482
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,750
Do you remember the granny
that we saw on the street?

483
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,166
She rode her scooter in the rain,
wearing a swimsuit.

484
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,375
I remember. It was impressive.

485
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:01,666
That was so cool.

486
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:14,500
Three, two, one!

487
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,666
Honey, are you serious?

488
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,375
<i>The so-called "one"</i>

489
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,125
<i>may not meet all your ideal requirements…</i>

490
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:34,916
Right away.

491
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,208
<i>Domestic violence?</i>

492
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:41,916
<i>You two might not chat all day long…</i>

493
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,833
Honey!

494
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,750
<i>…but they love the real you.</i>

495
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,750
<i>They don't give up easily,</i>

496
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,250
<i>even when the journey gets tough.</i>

497
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,416
I'm waiting.

498
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,333
Okay.

499
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,875
I got your favorite peanuts.

500
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,375
Here. Have some while they're warm.

501
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,250
I also got some leaflets.
Maybe they'll want to take a look at them.

502
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:40,000
DOWNTOWN APARTMENT

503
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,750
<i>The price and the princess</i>

504
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:45,375
<i>lived happily ever after.</i>

505
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:47,708
Left or right?

506
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,000
Right or left?

507
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,250
Right or left?

508
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,958
Right or left? Let's turn right.

509
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,458
- You just said right!
- Didn't you say left?

510
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,750
<i>- How is that even possible?</i>
- It's okay. Wait for me over there.

511
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,833
<i>Even the ice at the North Pole is melting,</i>

512
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,333
<i>so nothing lasts forever.</i>

513
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,625
Let's go.

514
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,583
Yeah.

515
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,125
What would you like to eat later?

516
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,500
I'd like to eat…

517
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,208
I'm a bit embarrassed to say it.

518
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,708
"Embarrassed" isn't in your vocabulary.

519
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,750
I'd like to eat at…

520
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:23,708
this place.

521
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,666
How about a rice roll with shrimp?

522
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:31,833
I actually want a burger.

523
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:32,750
Sure.
