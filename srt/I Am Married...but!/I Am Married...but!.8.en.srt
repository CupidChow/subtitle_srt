1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,250
- Why are you here?
- Do you live here?

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,875
- I live here.
- I'm delivering medicine.

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,083
You go first.

4
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,250
You're so sweet

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,833
to come all this way
just to deliver medicine.

6
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:29,875
It's my job.

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,083
I'm so lucky to have run into you here.

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,583
You… How have you been lately?

9
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,333
You look tired. What's up?

10
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,583
No, I'm fine.

11
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,625
I'm okay.

12
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,208
But you don't look fine.

13
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,708
Did someone bully you?
Tell me, and I'll talk to them.

14
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,916
Well, are you sure you're okay?

15
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,666
It's nothing.

16
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,083
I just feel like

17
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:03,541
some things just don't work out…
no matter how hard I try.

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,833
Maybe it won't turn out so bad.

19
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,541
Remember what you told me last time?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,291
Sometimes, when bad things happen,
it may be for the best later.

21
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,041
To me,

22
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,416
you're really special.

23
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,500
I'm here for you, whenever you need me.

24
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,416
He's the owner of the pharmacy
up the street.

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,208
He's here to deliver medicine.

26
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,333
He's very nice and sweet.

27
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,375
<i>What am I saying?</i>

28
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,333
Hello.

29
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,541
Hello.

30
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,916
This is my husband.

31
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,166
You went out of your way
to bring medicine here. Thanks.

32
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,125
It's no trouble.

33
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,333
It's nearby anyway.

34
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,833
If you need anything,

35
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,541
feel free to come see me.

36
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,208
Thank you.

37
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,125
Good night.

38
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,791
Good night.

39
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:36,708
Good night.

40
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,500
Let's go upstairs.

41
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,791
So…

42
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,208
So?

43
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,291
Nothing. Forget about it.

44
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,208
SPECIALIZED IN TREATING INFERTILITY

45
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,041
You think I'm infertile?

46
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,291
No. How could I possibly think that?

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,458
What is this then?

48
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,375
TO SUNNY: IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING
WHEN THINGS DON'T GO RIGHT.

49
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,375
I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE

50
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,000
WHEN YOU NEED ME.

51
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,583
CONSULTING ROOM 1

52
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,458
There are 51 patients ahead of us.

53
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,041
When will it be our turn?
Tomorrow morning?

54
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,541
I'm already getting brain fog.

55
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,291
No way.

56
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,166
They might skip some numbers.
Some people might not show up.

57
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,708
You won't have to wait long.

58
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,833
Why do others get pregnant so easily?

59
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,833
Why do I work so hard

60
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,875
for nothing?

61
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,375
How unfair is that?

62
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,250
Honey, listen to me.

63
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,916
Everyone's body is different.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,208
- Don't pressure yourself.
- Of course you don't feel pressured.

65
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,125
You don't get shots.

66
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,083
You don't take meds.

67
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,375
What are you looking at?

68
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,500
Sorry.

69
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,750
You know what your mom thinks of me.

70
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,125
Your sister's so young.
She's already got a kid.

71
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,833
<i>Actually, when it comes to having kids,</i>
<i>women take center stage.</i>

72
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,791
<i>Men are just supporting actors,</i>

73
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,666
<i>playing all kinds of small roles.</i>

74
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,166
<i>But you at least</i>
<i>have to be a good handyman,</i>

75
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,500
<i>because it's on when she says it's on.</i>

76
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,958
Wake up.

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,583
Wake up.

78
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,500
What's up?

79
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,125
I'm ovulating. Hurry up.

80
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,791
Now? What time is it?

81
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:50,708
Three o'clock.

82
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:54,875
What's wrong?

83
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,291
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

84
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,416
I'm coming.

85
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,875
I'm okay.

86
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,333
Are you… are you all right?

87
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,166
Give me a second.

88
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,541
- Give me a second.
- Okay.

89
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,875
<i>When making babies becomes a chore,</i>

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,500
<i>injuries are just part</i>
<i>of a handyman's job.</i>

91
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,625
Honey.

92
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,958
Wake up.

93
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,750
I went to ask for this talisman from
the Goddess of Childbirth this morning.

94
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,583
I've heard
that a lot of women get pregnant

95
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,166
within a month of drinking this.

96
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,125
Drink.

97
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,083
You have to drink it all for it to work.

98
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,291
<i>Of course, you have to be a good teammate.</i>

99
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,833
<i>You have to empathize.</i>

100
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,416
<i>If you don't empathize,</i>

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,708
<i>you're not a human,</i>

102
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,625
<i>you're a pig.</i>

103
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,875
I know you've been
working on this for months.

104
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,750
It doesn't mean you have to see a doctor,

105
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,000
but this is one of my former students.

106
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,041
She'll arrange an appointment
if you call her.

107
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,958
<i>The hardest role to play is the bad guy.</i>

108
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,750
Really.

109
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,083
I really don't want
to make her see a doctor,

110
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,708
but she's getting old.

111
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,291
If there's a problem, don't put it off.

112
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,875
<i>How do I tell her this?</i>
<i>It's game over no matter what I say.</i>

113
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,541
Do you think I'm infertile?

114
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:01,958
<i>Game over.</i>

115
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,958
No. How could I possibly think that?

116
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,375
What is this then?

117
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,416
This… Mom…

118
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,000
Mom said it's one of her former students.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,833
So Mom thinks I'm infertile?

120
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,958
No, Mom…

121
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,750
Mom… Mom said that…

122
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,166
we don't have to go.

123
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,791
"You don't have to go"
means "you have to go."

124
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,708
What do you think?

125
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,583
What do I think?

126
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,625
<i>I can't tell her to go. She'd be mad.</i>

127
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,000
<i>But I also can't tell her not to go.</i>

128
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,625
<i>She'd think I don't care.</i>

129
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,500
It's your decision.

130
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,208
My decision?

131
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,625
Why should I decide?

132
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,375
Doesn't this involve us both?

133
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,791
Yes.

134
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,708
Yes.

135
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,666
<i>But the small roles don't get a say.</i>

136
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,666
Number 146.

137
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,625
Number 146, Ms. Lin.

138
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,041
Ms. Lin, let's check out

139
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,958
the report from last week.

140
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,291
Let's see the numbers.

141
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,125
Well,

142
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,250
your endocrine values
and ovarian function are normal.

143
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:28,833
This

144
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,375
AMH value

145
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,958
is the egg count.

146
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,958
It's usually an important indicator

147
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,958
for assessing fertility.

148
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,333
This number should be
between two and five.

149
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,250
But this number

150
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,041
usually decreases with age.

151
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,416
We can see your current value.

152
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,583
It is still four.

153
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,833
That means it's sufficient.

154
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,208
You're in good shape.

155
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,416
You shouldn't have any problems
getting pregnant.

156
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,583
So we should keep making…

157
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,041
No, trying.

158
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,333
I suggest that Mr. Zeng
get examined as well.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,208
We have good soil,
but we also need good seeds, right?

160
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,916
Abstain for three to five days.

161
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,791
Then journey to the west to give a sample.

162
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,333
Journey to the west

163
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,625
to give a sample?

164
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,041
Right.

165
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,333
Go west.

166
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,041
You'll see a lounge.

167
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,708
We'll collect your semen there.

168
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,125
LOUNGE

169
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,708
What the hell is this place?

170
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,500
OCCUPIED

171
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,916
<i>BLUE MONROE</i>

172
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,791
How old is this movie?

173
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,333
1984.

174
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,375
I wasn't even born yet.

175
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,375
That's crazy.

176
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,666
<i>After School.</i>

177
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,333
AFTER SCHOOL

178
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,041
Why is there no signal?

179
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,250
It's occupied.

180
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,583
How long have I been in here?

181
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,125
Ten minutes?

182
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,375
Fifteen minutes?

183
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,208
Have I been in here too long?

184
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,750
It'd be bad to leave too quickly.

185
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,833
You're taking forever.
Why aren't you out yet?

186
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,166
You're taking forever.
What's wrong with you?

187
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,166
Don't mess with the door.

188
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,791
The toilet's next door.

189
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,250
Stop messing with the door.

190
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,833
I have to pee.

191
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,958
I said wait.

192
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,458
Before bestowing one with greatness,

193
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,458
Heaven tests their resolve,
starves their body,

194
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,791
disrupts their actions. Focus.

195
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,458
Too long!

196
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,208
Thanks for your hard work.

197
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,625
Mr. Zeng, do you usually
use condoms for contraception?

198
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:11,958
Yes.

199
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,750
Let's look at the sperm count.

200
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,541
In general, it should be
more than 15 million per milliliter.

201
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,916
But Mr. Zeng, we found out that your count

202
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,916
is zero.

203
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,666
ABNORMAL

204
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,000
It's also known as azoospermia.

205
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,708
Do you feel like
you've been wasting condoms?

206
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,625
Don't despair.

207
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,833
Right now, there's no sperm in your semen.

208
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,750
It doesn't mean the testicles
aren't making sperm.

209
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,625
All we need…

210
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,208
is to catch a sperm.

211
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,250
Then it's possible to conceive.

212
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,041
Mr. Zeng, please go to the urologist

213
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,791
for a checkup.

214
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,958
Please take off your pants.

215
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,583
- Now?
- Yes.

216
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,166
First, I'll take a look.

217
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,083
Then,

218
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,958
I'll have a touch
to check for varicose veins.

219
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,583
You can take them off now.

220
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,541
<i>Don't get hard.</i>

221
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,750
<i>Don't get hard at all.</i>

222
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,666
Good.

223
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,791
The size of the testicles is normal.

224
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,416
It looks like there are no varicose veins.

225
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,458
Let's do

226
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,958
a prostate exam.

227
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,791
Now please bend your knees.

228
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:12,791
Wait.

229
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,875
Excuse me, where is the prostate?

230
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,500
I'm going to stick my finger
about four centimeters into your anus

231
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,375
to touch your prostate.

232
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,833
Relax.

233
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,041
I do this a lot.

234
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,500
But…

235
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,166
But it's…

236
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,541
It's my first time.

237
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,166
I know.

238
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,208
I will

239
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,875
be gentle.

240
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,833
Wait.

241
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,958
Wait.

242
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,166
Take a deep breath.

243
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,166
Relax.

244
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,416
I'm going in.

245
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,541
Your prostate's fine too.

246
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,166
We'll take a slice

247
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,791
to see if we can find any sperm
in the tissue.

248
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,666
A slice.

249
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,666
From where?

250
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,791
Your testicles.

251
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,333
A testicular biopsy.

252
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,833
A testicular biopsy?

253
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,250
It's like this.

254
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,291
We open up the testicle.

255
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,541
We peel off the skin

256
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,125
like an onion, layer by layer.

257
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,333
When the testicle is exposed,

258
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,750
we take out the tissue

259
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,666
to see if there's any sperm in it.

260
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,000
We start with the left one. If there
aren't any there, we do the right one.

261
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,000
We'll see if the right side…
Before surgery…

262
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,500
Open up the testicle…

263
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,250
Take a slice…

264
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,500
Slice…

265
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,708
Slice…

266
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,000
IN SURGERY

267
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,375
<i>Relax.</i>

268
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,583
Don't be nervous.

269
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,458
Don't be nervous.

270
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,958
Great.

271
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,333
Good.

272
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,416
Take a deep breath in a minute.

273
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,416
It's time for anesthesia.

274
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,833
Take a deep breath.

275
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,333
Do you feel that?

276
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,375
Yes.

277
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,375
<i>Yes.</i>

278
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,833
<i>I feel that.</i>

279
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,333
<i>You're yanking on my balls.</i>

280
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,083
Can you still feel this?

281
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,208
Yes.

282
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:27,541
<i>You're yanking on my balls.</i>

283
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,041
<i>You're yanking on my balls.</i>

284
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,541
SUPER JUICY BRAISED MEATBALLS

285
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,958
How to make super juicy braised meatballs.

286
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,416
Here's a little secret for you.

287
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,583
Add bread flour to the meat.

288
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,666
Massage for five to ten minutes.

289
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,166
That way, your meat will be more elastic.

290
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,458
Then we take out the right size of meat

291
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,791
and tap it.

292
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,791
Let the air out.

293
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,333
Look.

294
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,416
Super elastic…

295
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,916
Let's get ready to deep-fry it.

296
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,708
Once it's fried,

297
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,000
boil it in the soup.

298
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,208
Then the breading

299
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,083
starts soaking in the broth.

300
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,250
That's how you make
your meatballs extra juicy.

301
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,958
And we're done.

302
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,791
Super juicy braised meatballs.

303
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,041
Great.

304
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,666
Hello? Mom.

305
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,500
<i>Are you there yet?</i>

306
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,333
We're here.

307
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,000
<i>How's the guesthouse?</i>

308
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,000
It's all good.

309
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,541
<i>Good.</i>

310
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:53,166
<i>You decided to go on the trip last minute.</i>
<i>I was afraid the guesthouse would be bad.</i>

311
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,500
It's not.

312
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,000
It's very quiet here.

313
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,791
<i>What is You-you doing?</i>

314
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,083
<i>Why didn't he answer the phone?</i>

315
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,875
He's sleeping.

316
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,166
<i>Then don't wake him up.</i>

317
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:10,791
<i>Okay then.</i>

318
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,333
<i>How was your report?</i>

319
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,625
My results

320
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,708
aren't ready yet.

321
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,666
There were many patients.
We're still waiting.

322
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,416
<i>Tell me when you get the results.</i>

323
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:25,875
Sure.

324
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,833
Sure.

325
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,333
<i>You two have fun.</i>

326
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,708
<i>Let me tell you this.</i>

327
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:33,125
<i>A-jiao said her son and his wife</i>
<i>conceived while on vacation.</i>

328
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,375
<i>When you're relaxed, it comes naturally.</i>

329
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,083
<i>I'll leave you be.</i>

330
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,500
<i>When You-you wakes up,</i>
<i>tell him to call me.</i>

331
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:42,708
<i>Bye.</i>

332
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,208
Okay, Mom, bye.

333
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,791
Good, they're still there.

334
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,791
Of course they're there.

335
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,166
It was a slice, not a removal.

336
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:10,916
Are you okay?

337
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,083
I'm okay.

338
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,250
The doctor said
it may hurt for a day or two.

339
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,791
You should be fine
by the time we get home.

340
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,583
What is the result?

341
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,208
My sperm.

342
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,083
How many are there?

343
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,291
Are you hungry?

344
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,666
You've been fasting.

345
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,458
Do you want some beef noodles?
There's a famous restaurant nearby.

346
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,750
Or do you want rice?

347
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,166
I'll go get it.

348
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,208
How many are there?

349
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,625
Did they find any?

350
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,416
<i>When someone you care about</i>

351
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,875
<i>is really sad</i>

352
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,083
<i>but they don't say anything,</i>

353
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,500
<i>what should you do?</i>
