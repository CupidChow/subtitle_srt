1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,208
…which can remove all suffering

2
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,791
for it is authentic.

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,375
Know that Prajnaparamita is
the great transcendent mantra,

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,541
proclaim the mantra that says

5
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,625
Go. Go to the…

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,041
Chanting at 5:00 a.m.?

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,666
<i>It's scarier than a horror movie.</i>

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,041
<i>At least once a week,</i>

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,666
<i>I think about divorcing him,</i>

10
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,875
<i>and beating him to death 100 times.</i>

11
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,291
It's from a new fried chicken shop
on 139th Lane. Try it.

12
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,416
We'll get more if it's tasty.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,875
<i>I don't have a bad life.</i>

14
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,083
<i>It's just the little things</i>
<i>keep building up,</i>

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,208
<i>like water slowly boiling over,</i>

16
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,250
<i>until it explodes.</i>

17
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,875
Right? It doesn't taste that bad.

18
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,416
SOUL MATE HUB: HI SUNNY,

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,791
WE'VE FOUND YOUR SOULMATE - RAIN.

20
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,458
COMPATIBILITY: 98%

21
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,583
WRITE TO THEM NOW!

22
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:02,791
What's wrong?

23
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,083
When will you tell your mom?

24
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,083
I'll tell her later.

25
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,875
You said that before.

26
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,625
We've repeated this conversation
hundreds of times.

27
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,750
When will you tell your mom
we're moving out?

28
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,583
Honey.

29
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,500
Honey.

30
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,250
Morning.

31
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,250
Did you eat?

32
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,541
You make a good couple.

33
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:41,583
Life is all about freedom and happiness.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,250
Grandma is going to have some fun.

35
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,500
<i>I'm a civilized woman</i>

36
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,125
<i>Wherever I go</i>

37
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,916
<i>I go free and at ease</i>

38
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,583
Did you see that grandma in swimsuit?

39
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,208
Yeah.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,125
Were we hallucinating?

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,125
Nope.

42
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,875
<i>You only live once</i>

43
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,708
<i>No do-overs</i>

44
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,791
<i>How you live</i>

45
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:22,916
<i>- Is up to you</i>
<i>- Life is all about freedom and happiness.</i>

46
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,166
Honey.

47
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,083
Honey.

48
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,000
Mom.

49
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,833
Thank you for tidying up.

50
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,458
Thank you for cooking every day.

51
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,708
Thank you for giving us
a place to stay for free.

52
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,416
Why are you being so polite?

53
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,416
You married into our family.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,291
You're one of us now.

55
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,583
I want to…

56
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,125
<i>Get a divorce.</i>

57
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,416
I want to…

58
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:04,916
I want to

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,166
move out.

60
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,916
Coward.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,750
<i>Why didn't I say I want a divorce?</i>

62
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm not a coward.

63
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,541
I'm giving my husband one more chance.

64
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,208
MESSAGE FROM YOUR SOULMATE, RAIN.

65
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:47,125
HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

66
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,916
<i>Are you looking for a soulmate?</i>

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,875
<i>Don't be naive.</i>

68
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,833
There's no such thing.

69
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,375
20 M², 15M TWD.
80% FINANCING.

70
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,583
360 INSTALLMENTS.
DOWN PAYMENT: 3M TWD.

71
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,666
OUR SAVINGS: 1,978,000 TWD.

72
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,375
<i>Some people say that marriage</i>
<i>is either heaven or hell.</i>

73
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,791
STILL SHORT BY 68,000

74
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,458
<i>But it's somewhere in between.</i>

75
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,166
<i>That's real life.</i>

76
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,916
<i>First, we need to prepare a four-by-four…</i>

77
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,250
Let's visit three places today,
starting with this one.

78
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,333
"45 exclusive apartments
with genuine hotel management."

79
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,125
"Move in with just a suitcase"?

80
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,500
It's not like regular hotel management.

81
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,166
They partner with a hotel.

82
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,958
You can have a five-star chef come over.

83
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,500
There are even free buffets on holidays.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,166
<i>Elite people.</i>

85
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,666
<i>Honorable service.</i>

86
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,833
<i>Sky garden</i>

87
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,125
<i>and sky fitness.</i>

88
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,875
<i>Coming home feels like a vacation.</i>

89
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,791
<i>Premium living starts here.</i>

90
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,500
But isn't the property management fee
very high?

91
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,958
The shared areas are huge.

92
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,125
Could this…

93
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,541
Could this be a bad deal?

94
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,541
Right.

95
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,750
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

96
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:58,875
This one then.

97
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,291
"Mozart's Sunshine House."

98
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,125
<i>Mozart's Sunshine House.</i>

99
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,208
<i>Two bedrooms, and one bathroom.</i>

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,416
<i>Small shared areas</i>
<i>means low management fees.</i>

101
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,583
<i>New decor.</i>

102
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,250
<i>Cozy living starts here.</i>

103
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,625
Mom said if we buy an old house,
don't buy one that's been decorated.

104
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,833
Because if it has issues,
you won't even see them.

105
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,833
The renovation cost is added to the price.

106
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,250
Right.

107
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,708
Your mom's right about everything.

108
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,083
Spend your money wisely.

109
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,000
Look.

110
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,708
TWO-STORY HOUSE,
88.8 MILLION TWD, 42 YEARS OLD.

111
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,416
<i>888 stands for good fortune!</i>

112
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,583
<i>Affordable.</i>

113
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,833
<i>Two-story standalone house.</i>

114
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,208
<i>Renovate it to your liking.</i>

115
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,208
<i>Ample street parking.</i>

116
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,250
<i>Land for gardening.</i>

117
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,958
<i>Countryside living begins here.</i>

118
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:28,875
This seems nice.

119
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,875
It's just two million per square meter
and the two floors are huge.

120
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,000
Isn't it?

121
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,041
The second floor is yours,
and we don't need to buy a parking space.

122
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,666
And we can grow plants
like in the <i>Animal Crossing</i> game.

123
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,083
Yeah, it's fun.

124
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,458
Let's see this one first.

125
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,250
But it…

126
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,750
Isn't it a little far from here?

127
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,666
You see.

128
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,291
It's not far.

129
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,458
It's a 30-minute drive.

130
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,125
But we'd need to buy a car,
which means a car loan.

131
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,375
We can buy a used car

132
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,708
for around 100,000 TWD.

133
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,250
We'll split the down payment and mortgage.

134
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,625
The total price is low.
It's not too stressful, so it's fine.

135
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,791
No, it's not a matter of stress.

136
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,916
This house is over 40 years old.

137
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,000
The plumbing and gas must be redone.

138
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,791
And renovations will be expensive.

139
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,666
I asked my interior design friend.

140
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,500
He said if we keep it simple,
we can do it for under a million.

141
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,875
One million…

142
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,250
One million, really?

143
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,041
Okay, so every day we'll have to…

144
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,916
wake up earlier for work.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,833
And there might be traffic jams
during the commute.

146
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,458
Is that going to be a waste of time?

147
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,041
<i>Traffic jam my ass.</i>

148
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,625
<i>That's a waste of time? The time you spend</i>
<i>playing with Legos is the real waste.</i>

149
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,958
Honey.

150
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,000
Is living at home that bad?

151
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,583
In fact, Mom said…

152
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,666
What time is it?

153
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,875
Now?

154
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,708
It's 10:40 a.m.

155
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,958
In about five minutes,

156
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,416
you mom will enter and ask

157
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,666
what we want for lunch.

158
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,750
Actually, there's something
I'd like to taste.

159
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,833
But living here,

160
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,458
I'm too embarrassed to try it.

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,416
Do you think we can sneak a taste

162
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,083
in five minutes?

163
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,250
Four minutes and thirty seconds left.

164
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,583
Xue-you.

165
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:03,833
Xue-you.

166
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,583
What do you want for lunch?

167
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,208
Let me think.

168
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,125
You-you Baby.

169
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,291
Let's go see the house after lunch, okay?

170
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,750
Let me think.

171
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,875
How about fried rice?

172
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,458
How about that?

173
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,458
Let's go see the house after lunch.

174
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,125
Xue-you.

175
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,041
How about that?

176
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,500
Baby.

177
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,541
Okay.

178
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,208
Wait.

179
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,791
Mom, what's up?

180
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,625
You don't feel well?

181
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,583
You're feeling sick?

182
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,416
<i>Oh, please.</i>

183
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,791
Okay, bye.

184
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,125
Mom doesn't feel well.
I'm going to take her to the doctor.

185
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,750
You check it out first.

186
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,375
I'm leaving.

187
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,708
Bye.

188
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,041
<i>Damn it.</i>

189
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,166
It's fine.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,208
I can do it myself.

191
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,500
I can do it myself.

192
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,291
What we see here

193
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,291
is an apartment complex.

194
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,583
There's a lot of green space nearby.

195
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,875
So, from this view,

196
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,500
there's no obstruction.

197
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,375
Honey, what do you think of this place?

198
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,375
It's a good fit.

199
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,458
If your husband wants to know more,

200
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,208
feel free to contact us anytime.

201
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,333
Hello.

202
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,250
Ms. Lin.

203
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,291
Hello.

204
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,083
FOR SALE

205
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,333
SCHOOL DISTRICT APARTMENT
32.5 MILLION TWD.

206
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,958
YOUR SOULMATE RAIN JUST MESSAGED YOU.

207
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,375
RAIN: PERHAPS SOULMATES ARE RARE,

208
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,291
BUT STILL, THEY'RE THERE.

209
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,583
Where did this poet come from?

210
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,416
<i>Why do you think people get married?</i>

211
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,291
RAIN: TO BOND WITH SOMEONE.

212
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,625
<i>Is it a bond, or bondage?</i>

213
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,666
Why is it bondage?

214
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,583
You think being with someone means
one plus one equals two.

215
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,250
But it doesn't.

216
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,416
It's one plus one equals one.

217
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,250
Because no matter what you do,
eat, drink, poop, pee and sleep,

218
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,916
you adjust to their preferences.

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,625
You become half of yourself.

220
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,041
So it's not a bond.

221
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,083
It's bondage.

222
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,750
Don't think of it as "adjusting."
Think of it as "sharing."

223
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,625
A lot of couples

224
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,333
are totally different people.

225
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,958
Compromising all the time

226
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,125
is a pain,

227
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,875
but it's also a way
of seeing new perspectives.

228
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,333
It can be fun.

229
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,708
Take eating,

230
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,666
for example.

231
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,625
Food always tastes better

232
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,541
when you share it.

233
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,458
Don't you think?

234
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,125
So you think my partner and I
should have opposite personalities?

235
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,666
Beauty and the beast
also go well together.

236
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,916
How old are you?

237
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:12,833
Thirty.

238
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,166
Married?

239
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,833
Not yet.

240
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:18,875
You?

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,833
Married.

242
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,375
Do you know why the divorce rate is high?

243
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,791
Because men only try hard before marriage.

244
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,708
After that, they think they scored.
Now they can take it easy.

245
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,833
But to women,

246
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,083
it's not a sprint.

247
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,666
It's a marathon.

248
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,375
The end is still a long way off.

249
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,083
If you don't even try
and I'm the only one running,

250
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,333
why should I stay married?

251
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,250
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,750
It sounds like

253
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,750
I'm blaming every man in the world.

254
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,416
No offense taken.

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,583
It's good to know how you feel.

256
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,208
It's like

257
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,833
You're a real poet.

258
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,708
Do you like movies?

259
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:11,791
I like hiking

260
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,125
and camping as well.

261
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:15,958
Camping.

262
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,458
I always wanted to go,

263
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,666
but never did.

264
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,750
Why?

265
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,916
No one else is interested.

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,583
I'm not motivated to go alone.

267
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,083
Well, if we get the chance,

268
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,541
let's go together.

269
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:10,791
Just a second.

270
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,500
Did Mom see a doctor?

271
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,625
Mom said after she went home and rested,

272
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,250
she felt better.

273
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,333
Really?

274
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,625
Let's visit these tomorrow.

275
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,500
That…

276
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,791
Which one?

277
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,416
That…

278
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,708
Which one?

279
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,875
Mom…

280
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,125
She…

281
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,125
She…

282
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,041
Well…

283
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,416
Say that again.

284
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,916
Who did you lend money to?

285
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,875
My uncle's eldest daughter.

286
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:56,416
- Who is she?
- She's studying her master's in the U.S.

287
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,333
- Mom says she graduates in a year.
- What do I care if she graduates or not?

288
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,666
Don't study abroad if you can't afford it.

289
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,041
Right.

290
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:04,958
But…

291
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,041
But mom lent the money to my uncle.

292
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,875
I'm too embarrassed
to ask my uncle to pay me back.

293
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,500
Why are you embarrassed? It's your money.

294
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,000
Also why is your mom

295
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,583
managing your money?

296
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,333
It's not like that.

297
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,625
Mom said when my sister was studying,
my uncle helped out.

298
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,125
So he helped your sister,

299
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,375
not you.

300
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,791
But mom said we help each other
in a family.

301
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,666
Also mom said my uncle
will pay me back next year.

302
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,125
What if he doesn't?

303
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,250
How much longer do we have to save?

304
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,625
Three years

305
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,541
or five years?

306
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,416
Zeng Xue-you.

307
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,958
You said a family helps each other.

308
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,083
So what am I to you?

309
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,250
Before you lent the money,

310
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,833
did you discuss it with me?

311
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,625
Aren't we a family?

312
00:18:59,125 --> 00:18:59,958
Honey.

313
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,708
Of course we're a family.

314
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:03,958
Honey.

315
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,458
Hello.

316
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,541
Dad.

317
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:22,916
To save more money,

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,125
I'll cancel all my life insurance
and investments.

319
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,291
My dad will lend us money
if it isn't enough.

320
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,500
Your dad, really?

321
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,375
How much?

322
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,833
And when do I pay it back?

323
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,333
You don't have to pay.

324
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,958
My dad said it'll be in my name.

325
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll tell Mom.

326
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:43,916
Wait.

327
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,333
Let me tell her.

328
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,250
The house in her name?

329
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,791
Is that a good idea?

330
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,416
Then you'd be living at your wife's place.

331
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,666
If someone asks,

332
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,375
won't you be embarrassed?

333
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,583
Who is "someone"?

334
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,208
Who would ask?

335
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,916
Who would be embarrassed?

336
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,041
Are you embarrassed?

337
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,541
No, I don't feel like that.

338
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,458
And why is it your wife's place?

339
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,041
So what? Is that embarrassing?

340
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,583
No, Mom…

341
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,166
Mom, she's just conservative.

342
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,375
Is it okay to buy it in your name then?

343
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,375
Is that a good idea?

344
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,625
Would the in-laws think

345
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,000
we're taking advantage of them?

346
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,291
It wouldn't sound good if word gets out,

347
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,125
would it?

348
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,166
Then we rent.

349
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,916
Renting a place wouldn't be
that much of a problem, right?

350
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,416
Renting?

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,166
When you rent a place,

352
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,541
you're helping the landlord
pay the mortgage.

353
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,916
Is that a good idea?

354
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,125
I think you'd better save up first.

355
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,458
I bought this place

356
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,458
by saving up bit by bit.

357
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,083
Housing prices are so high now.
Why don't you stay here?

358
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,000
It's for your own good.

359
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,541
Does that sound good?

360
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,166
Right.

361
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,125
She's right.

362
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,166
It's for our own good.

363
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,416
You stay here.

364
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,416
I go.

365
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,333
Honey.

366
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,750
No, honey.

367
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,000
Honey.

368
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:19,875
Honey.

369
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,208
Honey.
