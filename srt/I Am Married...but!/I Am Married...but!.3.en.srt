1
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,416
Move forward a bit.

2
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,333
Here. Want me to go further?

3
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,166
Zeng Xue-you.

4
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,416
Bring it back to me!

5
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,333
What?

6
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:16,458
What?

7
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,333
Move forward a bit.

8
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,833
Move your butt forward.

9
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,750
Sorry.

10
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,458
How did I end up with you?

11
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,375
Ready?

12
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,333
Yep.

13
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:40,791
Hold on tight!

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,250
TO SUNNY: MAYBE IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHO'S FASTER OR SLOWER.

15
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:55,625
MAYBE YOU'RE GOING DIFFERENT PLACES.

16
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,416
Time to clock out!

17
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Time to clock out.

18
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,291
Time to clock out.

19
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,916
Bye, everyone.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,833
Bye, A-chi. Bye.

21
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,750
Bye.

22
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,583
Work is done.

23
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,208
<i>Wives often wonder</i>

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,833
<i>why their husbands work overtime.</i>

25
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,583
<i>The answer is actually simple.</i>

26
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,916
<i>It's because…</i>
<i>they just don't want to go home.</i>

27
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,583
SPACIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL THREE-BEDROOM HOUSE

28
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,458
THE KING OF BUILDING BLOCKS

29
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,750
I'll leave this to you.

30
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,375
Sorry, I have to go pick up my kid.

31
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,291
Okay.

32
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,208
Thank you.

33
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,125
Bye.

34
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,041
- Bye.
- Bye.

35
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,000
Bye.

36
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,125
Are you working overtime today?

37
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,500
Yeah,

38
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,625
that's rare.

39
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,250
Don't you usually eat at home?

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,666
My wife is mad at me.

41
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,750
Mad about what?

42
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,333
She's mad mom won't let us move out.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,125
Not only is your wife upset,

44
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,666
- but your mom is upset too.
- Oh no!

45
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,333
Awesome!

46
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,250
Everyone,

47
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,000
my wife took our daughter to her mother's.

48
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,875
Congratulations!

49
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,708
Lu, is your son at Healthy Daycare?

50
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,750
- Yep.
- Awesome!

51
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,833
The stir-fry place next door
to the daycare is great, everyone!

52
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,000
Everyone,

53
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,833
this is a great moment.

54
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,375
- Boss.
- Here.

55
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,750
Here are your beers.
Tell me if you want more.

56
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,708
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:13,791
Hey.

58
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,458
How long is your wife visiting her mom?

59
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,875
Three days.

60
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,625
Three days.

61
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,458
Let's celebrate!

62
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,750
Shu,

63
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,541
I'll drink juice with you.

64
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,916
Don't any of you like to go home?

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,833
It's not that I don't like going home,

66
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:38,708
but sometimes after working all day,
I just want to collapse on the couch.

67
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,416
My wife will say,

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,791
"Baby, will you check the kids' homework?"

69
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,125
"I've been talking business all day.
Can I just rest at home?"

70
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,083
"Let me rest." But then she gets upset.

71
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,708
"I also have to work. I'm tired too."
Blah, blah, blah.

72
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,375
Yeah. Everyone knows you're tired.

73
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,291
Right?

74
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,291
We are tired, too.

75
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,250
- Yeah.
- Right?

76
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,583
Do clothes need to be washed every day?
The dishes can wait.

77
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,708
Listen to this. My wife says
dirty dishes attract cockroaches.

78
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,625
- Right.
- Then I won't wait until tomorrow.

79
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,625
But I can rest for a bit first.
It's not like I'm not helping.

80
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,750
"Just wait a second."

81
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,416
Never!

82
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,333
If my wife hears "wait a second…"

83
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,000
What do you talk about at home?

84
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,833
What can we talk about?
We say the same few words every day.

85
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,416
"Did you buy dinner? Pick up the kid?"

86
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,791
"Did you pay the mortgage?
Take out the trash?"

87
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,458
Every day's the same thing.

88
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,500
Seriously, the same few sentences.

89
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,333
What about A-chi?
He leaves as soon as work ends.

90
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,541
He's different.

91
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,500
No.

92
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,958
- Before he picks up his kid…
- He waits three hours.

93
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,750
Three hours?

94
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,333
He waits in the car to kill time.

95
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,000
What does he do in there?

96
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,875
Nothing really. He sleeps,
plays games, watches the NBA…

97
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,458
He seems more at home in his car.

98
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,750
You know how his desk is super messy?

99
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,291
<i>He piles up a lot of trash,</i>

100
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,166
<i>but his car is super clean.</i>

101
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,750
<i>He also has an air purifier in it.</i>

102
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,875
<i>And he even uses essential oils.</i>

103
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,083
He loves his car more than his wife.

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,833
Hey,

105
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,291
what about your wife?

106
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,250
Yeah.

107
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,375
She…

108
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,833
She scolds me sometimes.

109
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,458
But I think

110
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,875
it's scarier when she's quiet.

111
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,708
I'm drinking from a glass.

112
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,625
Trust me,
when I peed just now, I sat down.

113
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,958
I took a shower this morning.

114
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,208
Why get so worked up about it?

115
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,208
Why should she be mad?

116
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,541
I just didn't notice.

117
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,625
Right?

118
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,833
Right?

119
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,333
Let's cheers!

120
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,416
Right?

121
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,375
Yeah.

122
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,541
Be careful next time, okay?

123
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,125
Look carefully. Check next time.

124
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,166
Alright, it's fine.

125
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,500
Let's drink.

126
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,125
But women work long hours like men,

127
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,083
and then handle the kids and housework.

128
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,000
It's exhausting.

129
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:14,916
No.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,208
- Actually, this is a social issue.
- True.

131
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,708
Women can say they're tired,

132
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,208
or that they have cramps,

133
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,458
or they feel moody.

134
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,833
But guys can't complain.

135
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,541
We're expected to bear
the weight of responsibility.

136
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,500
Women are usually loud,

137
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,541
but cry when something happens
and expect us men to fix it.

138
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,000
In fights, we have to apologize,

139
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,750
even when it's not our fault, or we risk
an argument that lasts all night.

140
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,666
Please, no.

141
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,791
She brings up old stuff to scold me.

142
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,708
It's exhausting.

143
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,916
We men

144
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,166
are taught to endure pain.

145
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,166
Since childhood, we've been taught
that men do not shed tears.

146
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,083
But sometimes, I just want to cry.

147
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,166
We're mentally tired too.
At home, I just want to slack off.

148
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,583
- It's not too much to ask!
- It's not too much to ask!

149
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,541
All right. Let's drink.

150
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,458
Cheers!

151
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,708
- Let's drink.
- Cheers!

152
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,750
Cheers!

153
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,833
Eat shit!

154
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,458
Men love to make excuses

155
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,500
for being lazy

156
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,083
and stupid.

157
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,833
Men intentionally mess things up

158
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,416
to irritate you, so you have to intervene.

159
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,083
Jerks.

160
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,333
Don't be angry.

161
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,125
Forgive them.

162
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,958
Men are slow to mature.

163
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,583
They mature at 40.

164
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,041
I don't think they're mature even at 40.

165
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,208
That's because

166
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,208
they start aging quickly.

167
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,833
After everyone sings "Happy Birthday"
on their 40th birthday,

168
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,333
they immediately start aging.

169
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,791
They're only mature for one day?

170
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,416
No, dear, I'm telling you

171
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,125
there's no perfect partner.

172
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,958
Good men are raised.

173
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,708
It's like teaching a dog.

174
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,666
You throw him a piece of meat,
then say "shake."

175
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,250
Throw him more,

176
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,291
say "shake."

177
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,208
Look. That's his reflex.

178
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,916
Right?

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,750
He eventually connects meat

180
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,208
with "shake."

181
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,458
Then he understands what you mean.

182
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,583
I gave him meat alright.

183
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,333
What else does he want?

184
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:09,291
If he wants me to do tricks,
we need to move out first.

185
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,833
For you, moving out is freedom, but
for him, it's disrespecting his parents.

186
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,708
Think about him, okay?

187
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,916
Disrespectful my ass!

188
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,916
He says it's respect, but he
just enjoys being babied by his mom.

189
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,333
If you move out, you'll become his mom.

190
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,625
I want to move out
and help him become independent.

191
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,833
But when we're living at home,
anything I do is stopped by his mom.

192
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,041
He's lived at home for 30-plus years.

193
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,750
Asking him to move out

194
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,791
is like forcing him to cut ties.

195
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,500
You're forcing him
to choose you and his mom.

196
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,041
Could you choose?

197
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,166
That's so reasonable… Not!

198
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,416
I'm not asking him to never see his mom.

199
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,666
After moving out,
he can still go home whenever he wants.

200
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,666
I want a divorce.

201
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,083
Divorce.

202
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,791
Divorce.

203
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,666
Those who threaten divorce every day
never do it.

204
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,583
What are you doing here?

205
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,625
Drinking.

206
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,833
- You have no wine at home?
- No 10k wine at home.

207
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,208
10,000 TWD?

208
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,500
This bottle costs 10,000?

209
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,500
Who bought it?

210
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,791
I got it from a vendor.

211
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,541
Does he like you?

212
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,666
Yeah.

213
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,333
Ugh.

214
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,666
I've tried not to smile at him.

215
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,000
Lucky you!

216
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,083
Breakfast with a secret admirer.

217
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,458
Bus rides with strangers
that flirt with you…

218
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,333
You're a man magnet!

219
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,833
Chi, if I were you,

220
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,083
I would date a guy

221
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,208
with every zodiac

222
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,791
and every star signs.

223
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,083
No.

224
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,958
Dating is so troublesome.
Debating on restaurants takes forever.

225
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,583
If he wants something I don't,
I still have to go along.

226
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,375
Then I pay for food I don't even want.

227
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,333
It's such a bad deal.

228
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,750
Food should be something you crave.

229
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,833
Not sure why she's talking about food,
but what she said is inspiring.

230
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,625
She's happy every day!

231
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,791
What are you doing here?

232
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,458
Drinking wine worth 10,000 TWD.

233
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,416
Don't you have any friends?

234
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,000
I have friends, okay!

235
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:11,708
I have a friend who fucking loves whining.
She does whatever she wants.

236
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,375
If her husband weren't so nice,
he would've killed her by now.

237
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,416
To clarify,

238
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,958
who does whatever they want?

239
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,583
Says the one who wanted
to take home a bathtub she found.

240
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,458
There you go
bringing up college stuff again!

241
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,541
It would've come in handy
as a great movie prop.

242
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,333
- Riding a moped with a bathtub?
- We could've put it on our heads.

243
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,916
It's dangerous.

244
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,291
You two were friends in college?

245
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,791
They also dated.

246
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,250
Did you make out?

247
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,083
We never did that.
We broke up after a week.

248
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,916
A week? It was more than a month.

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,416
Thirty-seven days!

250
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,791
Really?

251
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,333
Thirty-seven days?

252
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,291
How could I be that nice?

253
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,500
So you two…

254
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,166
So lame!

255
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,416
Thirty-seven days without… It was so sad.

256
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,583
No.

257
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,208
We didn't party or drink.

258
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm coming straight home.

259
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,583
- Bye.
- Bye.

260
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,375
I catch the bus there.

261
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,291
Bye.

262
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,291
Bye.

263
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,583
Let's go home now.

264
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,291
Let's go play on the slide!

265
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,916
Shu.

266
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,833
Has it been a month since you joined us?

267
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,041
One month exactly.

268
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,916
So far so good?

269
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,333
I still have a lot to learn.

270
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,208
Sorry for clocking out
immediately every day.

271
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,541
No worries.
I know you need to pick up Shu.

272
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,083
Thank you.

273
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,000
Can I ask you a question?

274
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,541
Here it goes.

275
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,166
Are you…

276
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,416
divorced?

277
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,125
I never got married.

278
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,583
Sorry.

279
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,458
After I graduated from college,

280
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,333
and I came to Taipei
with Shu's dad to find a job.

281
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,916
only to find that
I was pregnant when I got the job.

282
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,791
I wanted to marry and kept the baby,
but he wasn't ready.

283
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:50,333
He kept asking me to get an abortion,
and we argued a lot.

284
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,541
One day, when I came home,

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,916
all his stuff was gone.

286
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,333
He just left.

287
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,333
He didn't say anything.

288
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,541
Did…

289
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,791
Did he know you had baby Shu?

290
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,500
But

291
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,166
he never showed up.

292
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,000
Later, I found out that…

293
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,666
he got married soon after he left.

294
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,458
Once, Shu asked me,

295
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,708
"Why don't I have a dad?"

296
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,541
"Is it because I'm bad?"

297
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,958
Sometimes,

298
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,541
seeing other families together
makes me sad.

299
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,333
Did I make the wrong choice?

300
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,458
I didn't give Shu a full family.

301
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,083
I'm being emotional.

302
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,583
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,458
Sorry, I couldn't find any tissue.

304
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,666
What about you?

305
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,375
Don't you want kids?

306
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,541
Me?

307
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,625
I really do.

308
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,208
But my wife…

309
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,041
doesn't want kids.

310
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,041
Before marriage,
I knew she didn't want them.

311
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,916
But,

312
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,041
I've always wondered if

313
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,083
she'd change her mind later.

314
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,833
She hasn't?

315
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,750
No.

316
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:35,750
What is this?

317
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,666
Is this for me?

318
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,125
Mom, I want to marry you.

319
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,458
You want to marry me?

320
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,958
Yes, I want to marry Mommy.

321
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,750
But I want to date someone else.

322
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,208
You'll have your own wife.

323
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,833
I'll divorce her first.

324
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,916
Are you done playing? Ready to go home?

325
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,250
- I'm going to catch you.
- I'm right here.

326
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,375
I'm going to catch you.

327
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,166
Your son runs so fast.

328
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,041
Where are you?

329
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,375
Gotcha!

330
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,375
Gotcha!

331
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,041
Gotcha!

332
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,333
Gotcha!

333
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,250
Gotcha!

334
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,041
Give me your umbrella.

335
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,125
Thank you.

336
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,083
Okay.

337
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,500
- I'll hold it.
- It's fine. I can manage.

338
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,291
<i>Do you need a ride?</i>

339
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,833
No need.

340
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,166
Go to sleep now.

341
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,583
I'm going to sleep.

342
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,500
Me too.

343
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,250
You should go home.

344
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,625
I will.

345
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,541
Good night.

346
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,958
Good night.

347
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,208
I am really tired.

348
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,708
I am tired.

349
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:47,708
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO'S FASTER OR SLOWER.
MAYBE YOU'RE GOING DIFFERENT PLACES.

350
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,750
<i>Why would they head to different places?</i>

351
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:01,416
MAYBE NO ONE ASKED HIM
WHERE HE WANTS TO GO.

352
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,458
Or maybe

353
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,666
he changed his mind on the trip.

354
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,625
Isn't that how travel works?

355
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:21,083
After walking for a while,
you might want to go other places too.

356
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,250
Then why didn't he say it?

357
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,833
Maybe

358
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,666
doesn't want to ruin a fun trip.

359
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,125
Where are you from?

360
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,041
Taipei.

361
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,291
Maybe we'll meet someday.

362
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,875
We might have

363
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,250
met before.

364
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,041
Like what Eileen Chang said about love.

365
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,708
"When you meet the one

366
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,791
among the millions,

367
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,083
when amid millions of years,

368
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,458
across the borderless wastes of time,
you happen to catch him or her,

369
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,541
neither a step too early

370
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,958
nor a step too late,

371
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,875
what else is there to do

372
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,541
except to ask softly,

373
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,166
'So you're here, too?'"

374
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,375
Why does it

375
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,166
sound a bit sad?

376
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,041
Because love is unpredictable.

377
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,958
When you meet the one, seize the moment.

378
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,833
Once lost,

379
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,208
it's gone.

380
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,333
We better not meet.

381
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,291
Why?

382
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,083
If we meet,

383
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,458
you'll discover that

384
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,125
I'm a blunt,

385
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,041
wild person. Not mother material.

386
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,458
You

387
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,916
don't like kids?

388
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,541
I have a sister,

389
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,333
and two brothers.

390
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,708
My family sells red tortoise cakes

391
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,708
at the market.

392
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,583
When I was young, my parents were busy.

393
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,041
They didn't have time for us.

394
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:09,666
I had to take care of my siblings.

395
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:16,416
I've been a mom since I was ten.
I raised three kids.

396
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,500
I feel like I've had enough.

397
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,833
I don't want to eat veggies.

398
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,833
Mom, my sister
isn't eating her veggies again.

399
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,208
I don't want to eat veggies.

400
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,125
Eat it!

401
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,708
I don't want to eat veggies.

402
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,583
Mom,

403
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,458
my little brother
took his diaper off again!

404
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,666
I don't want to eat veggies.

405
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,416
Baby?

406
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:07,833
Baby?

407
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,708
Mom, the baby's gone!

408
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,250
Mom.

409
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,041
Mom, baby.

410
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,583
Mom, I stepped in poop!

411
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,666
Mom.

412
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,166
What should we have for breakfast?

413
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,916
It's morning already?

414
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,000
Alright,

415
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,166
I'll poop for you later.

416
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,208
Can I borrow your motorcycle?

417
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,250
Calm down.

418
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,500
I told Xue-you

419
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,041
you stayed here.

420
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,333
I'm not worried about him,
I'm worried about his mother.

421
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:10,666
<i>Even in a million years, we won't meet,</i>

422
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:15,000
<i>because I'm going to die today.</i>

423
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,166
<i>Shit!</i>

424
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:32,708
Ms. Wu,

425
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,541
I didn't see your son's wife today.

426
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,541
She didn't come home yesterday.

427
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,250
Really?

428
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,208
Where did she stay?

429
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,333
At her friend's.

430
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,541
Why are young people so casual now?

431
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,375
Ms. Wu, is her friend a guy or a girl?

432
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,208
I didn't ask.

433
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,541
It's young people stuff. Let's not gossip.

434
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,333
Ms. Wu, you're too kind.

435
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,083
That's why she's getting bossier.

436
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,458
How can a married person
sleep away from home?

437
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:58,583
Is this okay?

438
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:01,583
Times are different now.

439
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:04,083
Young people want their own lives.

440
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,333
We must respect them.

441
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:08,833
Don't mind, don't ask, don't nag.

442
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,500
If you overreact,

443
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,958
they'll be unhappy.

444
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,125
But no one does that.

445
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,875
- See you around.
- Okay.

446
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,750
I heard she doesn't want kids.

447
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:22,000
- She just wants to have fun.
- Her son is so pitiful.

448
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:25,333
- Who are we talking about?
- Ms. Wu.

449
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:28,750
- Her son's wife slept at someone's place.
- Yeah.

450
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,583
Her son's wife
slept at someone else's place?

451
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:35,458
You slept with people!
Your whole family slept with people!

452
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,416
Is this her son's wife?

453
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,333
Yeah.

454
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,458
That's what she said.

455
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,750
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

456
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,791
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

457
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:57,708
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

458
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,125
Are you okay?
