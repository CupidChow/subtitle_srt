1
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:09,416
Her son's wife
slept at someone else's place?

2
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,333
You slept with people!
Your whole family slept with people!

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:17,375
- Is this her son's wife?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,000
That's what she said.

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,291
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,083
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,625
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,041
Are you okay?

9
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,500
Are you feeling sick?

10
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,916
Do you want to sit down?

11
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:01,666
CHIEH, PHARMACIST

12
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,250
Have…

13
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,625
we met before?

14
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,791
Do you live around here?

15
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,875
Then maybe we have met.

16
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,500
Are you dizzy?

17
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,791
A little.

18
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,208
I'll give you some headache
and stomach medicine, okay?

19
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,291
Try to drink this before drinking wine.

20
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,041
It will ease your hangover.

21
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,666
GRAND OPENING, 12% OFF

22
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,666
Is your pharmacy new?

23
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,000
It opened a month ago.

24
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,333
If you have any medication problems,

25
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,291
you can call me
from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.

26
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,291
I'll be here.

27
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,500
So are you the owner?

28
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,750
You're so young to be the owner.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
<i>No matter how old a woman is,</i>

30
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,916
<i>when she talks to someone she likes,</i>
<i>her voice turns into a baby voice.</i>

31
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,625
I worked in Australia for a year

32
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,166
and saved enough money

33
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,291
to open this store.

34
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,291
I had a friend who worked in Australia.

35
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,125
Did you work on a farm?

36
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,583
I did.

37
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,333
The work was seasonal.

38
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,000
I picked grapes in spring
and tomatoes in the summer.

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,750
In winter, I spent two months
in a Christmas tree factory.

40
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,333
Christmas tree?

41
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,250
Christmas tree factory?

42
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,333
Right.

43
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,166
Before Christmas,

44
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,500
I'd go to the airport,

45
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,416
markets,

46
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,791
and offices

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,333
to decorate Christmas trees.

48
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,291
It was fun.

49
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,666
But

50
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,750
on Christmas Day,

51
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,708
while everyone was having a good time,

52
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,041
I got fired.

53
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,958
It's like <i>Nomadland</i>.

54
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,958
Do you like that movie too?

55
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,666
There is a line in it that stuck with me.

56
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,083
They don't say goodbye. They say…

57
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,541
I really like the poem in the movie.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,958
<i>I heard a lady once say</i>

59
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,458
<i>that when she saw</i>
<i>the actor Gong Yoo in person,</i>

60
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,416
<i>she could feel her cervix dilating.</i>

61
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,666
<i>I thought she was exaggerating.</i>

62
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,041
<i>But I can feel it now.</i>

63
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,083
<i>I'm about to give birth.</i>

64
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,666
Mom said she'll vacuum later.

65
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,500
What's wrong?

66
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,083
Nothing.

67
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,583
It's just that, for a moment,

68
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,166
I forgot I'm the most famous slut
within 100 miles.

69
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,750
TO SUNNY: WHERE THERE'S LIFE,
THERE'S HOPE.

70
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,083
GOOD THINGS HAPPEN

71
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,541
WHEN YOU STAY HOPEFUL.

72
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,500
These are the lunch boxes. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Eat them in that order.

73
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,333
If it's still not enough,
there are fruit and veggies down there.

74
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,916
If it's still not enough,
there's meat in the freezer.

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,541
Take out the meat
and defrost it in the fridge.

76
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,458
When it's done,

77
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,666
put it in the sink.

78
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,125
If that's still not enough,
Lan on 139th Lane

79
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,541
will give you free food.

80
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,166
- Okay.
- Mom, don't worry.

81
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,416
- The car's here.
- Already?

82
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,750
Quick.

83
00:07:56,583 --> 00:08:00,083
Remember, don't let your father eat food
that's too oily, salty or sweet.

84
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,208
Remind him to take his pills
after every meal.

85
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,666
I'll put the meds here.

86
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,875
No problem.

87
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,666
This is what happens when you get old.
My aunt fell down.

88
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,833
She may need surgery.

89
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,625
I'm going to take care of her.
I'll be back in five days.

90
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,333
Mom, the key.

91
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,250
Have a safe trip.

92
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,166
Okay.

93
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,458
Take care.

94
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,375
Don't come out now.
You'll get the floor dirty.

95
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,333
It's fine, alright.

96
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,083
Call us when you get there.

97
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,458
Bye, Mom.

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,291
Am I smiling?

99
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,000
Am I being a jerk?

100
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,250
I'm happy that your mom

101
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,125
is visiting her injured aunt.

102
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,500
It's fine. I'll keep your secret.

103
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,625
Really?

104
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,875
Is there a secrecy fee?

105
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,875
I usually offer a one-year warranty
plus 90 days of technical support.

106
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,583
- I'll have to pay after a year?
- But you're my lifetime member.

107
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,666
So it's free.

108
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,333
You've got a nice business here.

109
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,375
Lunch's my treat.

110
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,333
What do you want to eat?
Taiwanese or Thai?

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,916
Or barbecue?

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,041
Barbecue?

113
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,916
But didn't mom cook?

114
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:36,958
It's like a New Year's Eve party.
Let's eat out and get some MSG first.

115
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,375
But my mom prepared five lunchboxes.

116
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,125
It's a waste if we don't eat them.

117
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,708
Now what?

118
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,250
Right. You'll go to hell for wasting food.

119
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,416
Go reheat the food.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,833
Barbecue for me.

121
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,208
Barbecue, really?

122
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,208
Yes.

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,583
You can stay

124
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,916
or come with me.

125
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,208
I'll go with you.

126
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,666
Yes, spicy and salty, this way please.

127
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,666
Let's go.

128
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,791
Hello.

129
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,375
Please confirm your order.

130
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,875
Two pizzas for today.

131
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,000
One jalapeño.

132
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:16,916
One smoked bacon.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,291
Three egg tarts and two sodas, right?

134
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,791
We didn't…

135
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,916
We didn't order delivery.

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,458
Wrong address?

137
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,500
<i>Who is that?</i>

138
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,000
<i>It's my dad-in-law.</i>

139
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,125
That'll be 1.1k TWD.

140
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,416
I love eating the crust.

141
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,125
Did you know

142
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:50,458
they put cheese into the crust
for the first time in 1998?

143
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,250
Now it's popular.

144
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,458
Eat the crust first,

145
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,458
then eat the rest.

146
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,083
Dad.

147
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,625
You're eating too fast.

148
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,875
Slow down.

149
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,583
Eat while it's hot.

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,916
Both of you

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,833
eat up now.

152
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,208
I see they

153
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,166
have a new flavor.

154
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,541
Sukiyaki beef.

155
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,458
But

156
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,875
I didn't order that.

157
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,083
I don't eat beef.

158
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,833
I have an affinity for cows.

159
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,291
When I was young,

160
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,625
my house was very remote.

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,500
I had no one to play with.

162
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,708
My mom told me to herd the cows.

163
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,791
I was five.

164
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,958
I'd walk a cow around like this.

165
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,333
I spoke to the cow every day.

166
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,875
I named her

167
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,458
A-hong.

168
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,208
She knew her name.

169
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,208
Later, A-hong got too old.

170
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,083
She died.

171
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,416
At that time,

172
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,083
I cried for a few days.

173
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,208
After A-hong died,

174
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,250
I had no one to talk to.

175
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,458
I had to

176
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,333
talk to the sea.

177
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,875
Do you know

178
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:02,916
what the sea

179
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,083
told me?

180
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,208
I know.

181
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,291
Do you know what

182
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,625
happened to the chicken

183
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,333
when it fell into the sea?

184
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,416
This is a dad joke.

185
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,875
Salty chicken.

186
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,333
No. Chicken fish.

187
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,000
Mom.

188
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,000
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

189
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,125
We're eating now.

190
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,500
<i>What are you eating?</i>

191
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,833
We're having p…

192
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,500
Pork!

193
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,666
Pork,

194
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,541
broccoli,

195
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,916
pineapple,

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,083
chicken,

197
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,125
and…

198
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,666
potato.

199
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,708
<i>That's not enough. Eat more.</i>

200
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:58,875
<i>Also,</i>

201
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,083
<i>the temperatures are dropping tonight.</i>

202
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,208
<i>Remember to wear more clothes.</i>

203
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,250
Okay.

204
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,625
<i>How old is he?</i>

205
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,666
<i>Doesn't he know what to wear?</i>

206
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,250
<i>By the way,</i>

207
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,291
<i>I forgot to vacuum this morning.</i>

208
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,041
<i>Tell you wife I'll handle it</i>

209
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,375
<i>when I'm back.</i>

210
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:15,750
<i>Also,</i>

211
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,416
<i>two drops of oil fell</i>

212
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,541
<i>inside the fridge.</i>

213
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,750
<i>Tell her not to touch it at all.</i>

214
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,875
<i>I'll handle it when I'm back.</i>

215
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,416
Got it. No problem.

216
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,833
Don't touch it at all.

217
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:26,750
<i>Bye.</i>

218
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,041
Bye, Mom.

219
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,083
- Mom said the floor and the fridge…
- Got it.

220
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,250
Don't touch.

221
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,458
If she tells me not to deal with it,
it means I have to deal with it.

222
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,541
<i>Who on earth said</i>
<i>that marriage is a happy ending?</i>

223
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,625
<i>It's the beginning of an endurance exam.</i>

224
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,500
This is…

225
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,833
How old is he?
He's still dropping food on the floor.

226
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,000
<i>No, dear, I'm telling you.</i>

227
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,958
there's no perfect partner.

228
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,791
Good men are raised.

229
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,000
If you move out, you'll become his mom.

230
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,791
<i>Okay.</i>

231
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,750
<i>Let's use these five days to work on him</i>

232
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,208
<i>and spark his urge to move out.</i>

233
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,416
You-you baby.

234
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,375
Do you want to watch a movie tonight?

235
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,916
Okay, where?

236
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,875
In the private room next door.

237
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,125
Sure.

238
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,083
Can you help me clean up the table first?

239
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,666
Wait a minute. Right away.

240
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,666
Is it wait a minute

241
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,125
or right away?

242
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,041
Right away.

243
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,333
I'm waiting.

244
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:52,958
Okay.

245
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,125
I'm sorry, Zeng's ancestors.

246
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,916
But the next few nights,
I'll be busy with your grandson.

247
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,958
We might disturb you.

248
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,500
If you don't mind,
please take a vacation and go outside.

249
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,416
If you hear any gossip
while you're out and about,

250
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,041
don't take it personally.

251
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,625
I really didn't cheat on him.

252
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,250
I'm not a slut.
I only sleep with your grandson.

253
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,791
Don't you worry.

254
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,791
Thanks for your blessing
and understanding.

255
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,333
Hold on.

256
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,291
Don't clean up.

257
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,291
Otherwise, I lose.

258
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,291
<i>Hang in there.</i>

259
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,833
<i>Hang in there.</i>

260
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:58,333
<i>Love is patient, love is kind</i>

261
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:03,083
<i>It does not envy</i>

262
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,500
<i>It does not boast, it is not proud</i>

263
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,458
<i>Love avoids shame</i>

264
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,125
Damn it.

265
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,375
He's buying toys again.

266
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,083
What happened to saving money?

267
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,375
Don't get mad.

268
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,833
Otherwise I lose.

269
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:01,500
<i>Love is not self-seeking</i>

270
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,291
<i>It is not easily angered</i>

271
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,125
<i>It keeps no record of wrongs</i>

272
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:13,125
<i>Love despises injustice</i>
<i>And rejoices the truth</i>

273
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,250
No matter what the game is,
the one who gives up first will lose.

274
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,416
It's hard to tell

275
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,916
if you'll win or lose

276
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,666
until the end.

277
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,208
Right away.

278
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,291
Dad.

279
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,958
Are you okay?

280
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,208
Dad's belly hurts. I'll go get meds.

281
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,375
Remember to clean up the table.

282
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,291
Okay.

283
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,333
How much?

284
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,541
Do you feel sick?

285
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,708
It's not for me.

286
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,750
Is it for a senior or a child?

287
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,750
A senior.

288
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,375
Stomach ache or bloating?

289
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,333
I think both.

290
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,625
Do you want to try this?

291
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:41,500
It's mild and the tablets are small.
It's easier for seniors to swallow.

292
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,333
It's 320 TWD after the discount.

293
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,500
Sorry, I forgot my wallet.

294
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,375
No worries.

295
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,375
Take it for now.

296
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,833
No, I'll go get the money.

297
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,916
Pain relief comes first. It's really okay.

298
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,375
Thank you.

299
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,750
How's your hand?
Did you put something on that?

300
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,000
It's okay. It's just a small cut.
It doesn't hurt much.

301
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,500
Which means it hurts.

302
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,875
Even the smallest wounds
need to be treated with care.

303
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,375
Give me a second.

304
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,500
Okay.

305
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,875
Keep the wound dry.
Change the bandage at least once a day.

306
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,708
Take care of yourself

307
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,666
before taking care of others.

308
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,708
You look different today.

309
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:22,958
You look pretty.

310
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,625
<i>Love is patient, love is kind</i>

311
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:53,125

312
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:57,541

<i>Love despises injustice</i>
<i>And rejoices the truth</i>

318
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,458
Dad.

319
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,958
Enough is fucking enough!

320
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,083
Honey. Honey, what's wrong?

321
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,041
What's wrong?

322
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:14,666
Honey!

323
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,291
Honey!

324
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,208
Honey!

325
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,500
You-you baby.

326
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,708
Domestic violence?

327
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:46,125
<i>It turns out that people who annoy you</i>
<i>can also have their cute moments.</i>
