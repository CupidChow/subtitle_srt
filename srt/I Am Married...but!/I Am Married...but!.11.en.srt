1
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:43,000
Stop sending her to the tutoring center.
Let me tell you. A kid like her…

2
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,541
- Oh, you're awake.
- You're awake.

3
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,041
- Want some sunflower seeds?
- Have some tea.

4
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:50,958
Come on.

5
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,583
Do you want coffee?

6
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,750
I'll make it for you.

7
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,708
What are you doing?

8
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,666
What do you want?

9
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,291
What's wrong?

10
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,291
I dreamed we were sleeping
in the living room.

11
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,625
DOUBLE HAPPINESS

12
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,208
Are we going to sleep in the living room?

13
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,083
No way.

14
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,875
I'll talk to Mom later.

15
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,666
Hello, Aunts and Uncles.

16
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,125
Aunts…

17
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,291
Sit.

18
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,000
The great compassion mantra works.

19
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,000
When my mom had spinal surgery,

20
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,916
that's what I recited to her.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,916
She couldn't even walk.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,833
Now

23
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,500
she can go out on her own.

24
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,458
So, you have to recite it 49 times a day.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,500
You have to ask Buddha sincerely.
Atone for the karma of your past life,

26
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,250
and you'll be blessed with a child soon.
A firstborn son.

27
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,458
Also, you can't eat meat.

28
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,666
Be a vegetarian.

29
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,833
Got it?

30
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,250
Drink, it's hot.

31
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,958
Your aunt stood in line

32
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,250
in the middle of the night
to buy you this.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,375
This is Chinese medicine.

34
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,291
They sell limited quantities of it
every day.

35
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,625
I got in line at 4:00 o'clock
this morning to buy it.

36
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,083
It works.

37
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,958
Drink one bowl after each meal.
It absolutely works.

38
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,333
Don't listen to those Western doctors.

39
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,708
They say there's no hope.

40
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,375
Do you really believe them?

41
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,875
There's hope.

42
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,750
Here, drink it while it's hot.

43
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,791
Drink it now.

44
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,208
Okay. Thanks Mom.

45
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,208
Thanks, Aunties.

46
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,125
Be careful.

47
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,250
The love of an Auntie…

48
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,916
This tastes

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,291
very special.

50
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,208
Why does it taste like fish?

51
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,583
It's donkey-hide gelatin.

52
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,750
It's nourishing.

53
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,541
It's expensive.

54
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,875
What's donkey-hide gelatin?

55
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,000
Donkey skin.

56
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:14,708
Donkey skin?

57
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,500
I'm not supposed to eat meat, right?

58
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,208
Chinese medicine doesn't count.

59
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,916
- Don't worry.
- It's not meat.

60
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,541
It's not meat.

61
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,541
This is medicine
full of love from your aunties.

62
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,875
- Drink.
- Take a sip. Be brave.

63
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:27,875
Take a sip.

64
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,125
Done. Good.

65
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,583
Take a bigger sip.

66
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,750
Mom.

67
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,166
Mom.

68
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,041
- I need to talk to you.
- Go ahead.

69
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,083
What's up?

70
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,833
Let's go upstairs.

71
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,708
Just say it here.

72
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,125
Why go upstairs?

73
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:55,791
What's the matter?

74
00:03:59,083 --> 00:03:59,916
I…

75
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,500
Actually…

76
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,416
It's me.

77
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,333
I…

78
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,333
I…

79
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,708
I…

80
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,125
Mom.

81
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,666
- We're back.
- Why are you guys so late?

82
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,875
Hi, Aunts and Uncles.

83
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,375
Everyone's here.

84
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,875
I'm here.

85
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,791
Everything is fine.

86
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,916
I'm here.

87
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,625
Cousin-in-law,

88
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,541
cheer up!

89
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,250
Good. Everyone's here.

90
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,291
It's okay.

91
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,875
It's okay. Everyone's here.

92
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:36,791
Drink…

93
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,125
More. Drink up.

94
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,458
- Drink up.
- Well done.

95
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,208
That's great.

96
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,958
Two more sips.

97
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,875
I'm telling you, don't be discouraged.

98
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:55,791
I had

99
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,458
four artificial inseminations

100
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,708
and one in vitro.

101
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,333
They all failed.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,958
Afterwards,

103
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,916
I found this Dr. Huang on the internet.

104
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,291
After taking the right medicine,

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I got pregnant right away.

106
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,458
Come. I'll make an appointment now.

107
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,375
Cousin-in-law…

108
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,208
In fact, infertility treatment is

109
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,333
all about regulating your circulation.

110
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,000
Once in a while,
press this acupuncture point.

111
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,208
You feel it, right?

112
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,125
Yes.

113
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,041
Also, this…

114
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,916
acupuncture point

115
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,625
is good for menstrual problems
or endometritis.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,375
- Okay.
- The best one is…

117
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,125
this acupuncture point.

118
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,916
Fuck!

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,833
What's wrong?

120
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,166
It's really heating up my whole body.

121
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,625
It works.

122
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,000
Thanks everyone.

123
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,208
You've come all this way today.

124
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,500
Thank you.

125
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,708
Honey?!

126
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,125
- Everyone's tired.
- Yeah.

127
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,500
Yes, thanks everyone.

128
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,791
- You've got it.
- Get some rest.

129
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,625
- Bye.
- Bye, thanks.

130
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,541
Bye.

131
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,458
- Bye.
- Thanks.

132
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,125
- Bye.
- Thanks.

133
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,166
Get some rest.

134
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,083
We have a guest.

135
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,083
Please come in.

136
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,375
Thank you for coming all this way.

137
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,958
The bed's upstairs.
We need to get it down and put it here.

138
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,583
It should face north.

139
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,625
You got it.

140
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,958
I'll take them up.

141
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,916
Don't move the wrong one.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,583
The bed. You forgot.

143
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:34,875
So accurate.

144
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,833
What else did you give?

145
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,291
- The Qilin's blessing.
- Mom.

146
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,333
Mom.

147
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,041
Mom.

148
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,125
This is a nice place to for the bed.

149
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,250
There's no direct sunlight.

150
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,916
It's well-ventilated.

151
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,541
The air conditioning is within reach.

152
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,208
This is good.

153
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,541
Great.

154
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,041
Sister.

155
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,916
You'll have to add a partition.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,833
Add a partition?

157
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,875
Yes, for privacy.

158
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,625
Everyone goes in and out here.

159
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,875
Right.

160
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,458
But you have to tell the carpenter

161
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,791
not to build it up to the ceiling.

162
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,833
Otherwise there'll be no air flow.

163
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,000
What about the partition door?

164
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,875
- Where should we put it?
- The door?

165
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,083
Ask the carpenter.

166
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,500
We don't know where to put it.

167
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,416
Ask the carpenter.

168
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,500
The carpenter knows best.

169
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,333
I-ling, come.

170
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,791
It's almost noon.

171
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,083
Drink it while it's hot.

172
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,083
Sister-in-law.

173
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,333
Sister-in-law.

174
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,750
Let me do it.

175
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,291
You go and sit down.

176
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,250
- Go rest. Let me do it.
- Mom.

177
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,000
It's noon. It's the second bowl.

178
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,166
You'll have another bowl later tonight.

179
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,208
Drink up.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
You're doing great.

181
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,416
Keep it up.

182
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,375
- You're doing great.
- Keep it up.

183
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,541
Be brave. Take a gulp.

184
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,125
Drink.

185
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,708
You-you!

186
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,250
Why are you drinking it?

187
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,791
That's for infertility.

188
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,125
Why are you drinking it, You-you?

189
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,041
You-you!

190
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,458
You-you!

191
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,583
What are you doing?

192
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,500
You-you!

193
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,166
You-you!

194
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,750
I'm barren.

195
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,208
Of course you are.

196
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,291
You're a boy.
Of course you can't bear a child.

197
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,791
You can't get pregnant.

198
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,125
What are you saying?

199
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:01,916
Mom.

200
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,166
I'm serious.

201
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,958
It's me who's infertile.

202
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,666
Mom.

203
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,666
Why are you up so late?

204
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm old. I can't sleep.

205
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,666
You go to sleep.

206
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,583
I'm fine.

207
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,208
Let me.

208
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,875
Mom.

209
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:49,958
It's fine. Let me.

210
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,041
Here.

211
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,791
Mom.

212
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,708
How old were you at the time?

213
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,000
You're so chic.

214
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,125
Thirty-something.

215
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,666
A young lady.

216
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,708
Look at this one.

217
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,375
His eyes were so big.

218
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,291
He was startled by the flash.

219
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,791
He threw up all over me
after we took the picture.

220
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,291
He was a frail kid.

221
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,166
He was hard to take care of.

222
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,625
When he was in nursery school,

223
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,666
he'd always catch a cold or get diarrhea.

224
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,750
We saw the doctor so often it scared me.

225
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,000
So,

226
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,125
I stopped feeding him take-out food.

227
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,583
I didn't know how to cook at first,

228
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,333
but that's why I learned to cook.

229
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,416
I had to work

230
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,583
and take care of my kid.

231
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,125
It was exhausting.

232
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,875
Every time I went to the temple, I prayed.

233
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,750
"Buddha,

234
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,000
take care of You-you."

235
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,291
"Let him eat well, sleep well,

236
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,541
grow up strong."

237
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,958
Maybe I hate too much corn.

238
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,333
I loved corn when I was pregnant with him.

239
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,875
Did I eat too much corn?

240
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,958
Maybe that's why…

241
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,791
I must've done something wrong.

242
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,208
Sorry… for moving the bed downstairs.

243
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,250
You have to sleep on the floor tonight.

244
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,166
It's fine. Don't worry.

245
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,625
Mom.

246
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,125
You did nothing wrong.

247
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,625
You must've done something right

248
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,666
if You-you
can sleep on the floor and still snore.

249
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,375
I'll take the bed up.

250
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:00,875
Don't do it.

251
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,208
It's very heavy.

252
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,125
Don't do it.

253
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,250
I can do it.

254
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,666
If it's dismantled,
one person can move it.

255
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,166
- Can you?
- I can.

256
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,541
I have lots of experience.

257
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,958
I lived in Taipei for ten years
and I've moved six times.

258
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,500
That's about once

259
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,958
every two to three years.

260
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,750
Once, I lived in a place for only
six months. The landlord kicked me out.

261
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,875
He sold the place.

262
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,875
Renting is like living in
someone else's home.

263
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,875
Then every time I moved,

264
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,000
I thought, "One day,
I'll have my own place."

265
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,041
Dad.

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,583
What are you doing up?

267
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,875
Dad, go back to bed.

268
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,458
Let me do it.

269
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,083
Dad, be careful.

270
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,125
What are you guys doing?

271
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,041
Are you awake?

272
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,083
Give us a hand.

273
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,000
Be careful.

274
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,083
Did you know you can't

275
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,250
lick your elbow

276
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,666
with your tongue?

277
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,875
Dad, we've heard this one before.

278
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,333
Then do you know what'll happen

279
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,750
if you manage to lick it?

280
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,041
Do you?

281
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:35,750
What'll happen?

282
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,083
There will be saliva on it.

283
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,000
- Hurry up. Get up there.
- Hurry up. Get up there.

284
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,791
It's heavy.

285
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,083
Hurry up.

286
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,125
Turn carefully.

287
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,041
Mom, turn.

288
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:05,958
I can do it.

289
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,166
Zeng Xue-you.

290
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,791
Sorry.

291
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,458
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET UP?

292
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,541
- Did you go to lunch?
- Yes.

293
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,708
Have you eaten?

294
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:55,791
Not yet.

295
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,250
Did you bring a lunchbox?

296
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,583
Yes.

297
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,375
Then have some more.

298
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,083
I made extra when I made Shu's lunchbox.
Thank you for the toy gift.

299
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,666
It's roast pork in ginger sauce
with onions and a little vinegar.

300
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,250
It might be a bit sour.

301
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,708
I don't know if you'll like it.

302
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,500
Let me try.

303
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,750
Is it too sour?

304
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,916
No.

305
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,833
It's tasty.

306
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,875
Great.

307
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,125
You are really awesome.

308
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,166
Oh, yes.

309
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,458
How is the toy coming along?

310
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,208
I'll show you. I have a video.

311
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,250
<i>Sort them by color.</i>

312
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,583
<i>Good.</i>

313
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,500
<i>Let's see who finishes first.</i>
<i>What color are you separating?</i>

314
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,416
<i>White.</i>

315
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,125
<i>Is it done?</i>

316
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,375
<i>So what's next?</i>

317
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,458
<i>Sort them by size.</i>

318
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,041
<i>Sort them by size, okay?</i>

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,916
<i>I'll give you ten seconds.</i>
<i>It seems I'm almost done.</i>

320
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,666
Sorry, I-ling is calling me.

321
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,791
Hi, honey.

322
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,625
I'm eating.

323
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,208
Have you eaten?

324
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,625
I have to meet a client this afternoon.
I might get off work a little late.

325
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,708
Okay.

326
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,791
Let's meet at the movie theater tonight.

327
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,250
Okay.

328
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,958
<i>DR. KIWI</i>

329
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,625
I'LL HANG AROUND FOR A WHILE.

330
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,250
TAKE YOUR TIME.

331
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,416
I'M ALMOST DONE.

332
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,250
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I LEAVE.

333
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,208
Have some tea.

334
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,666
Thank you.

335
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,958
Here. We'll count on you both from now on.

336
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,375
Cheers to our collaboration.

337
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,041
Let's go.

338
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,125
Boss.

339
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,375
Are you leaving?

340
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,375
I haven't eaten yet.

341
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,458
What do you want to eat, boss?

342
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,916
- Let me see what's good.
- Sure.

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,666
- You go order.
- Have a seat.

344
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,625
- Sit down.
- Here.

345
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,541
Get some drinks.

346
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,541
No problem.

347
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,708
Please, sit.

348
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,833
Miss Chen.

349
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,083
Don't you have to pick up your kid today?

350
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,375
My mom took him to Taichung.

351
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,083
That's great.

352
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,125
- You got a break today.
- Not really.

353
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,791
Cheers.

354
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,083
Here.

355
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,250
Miss Chen, drink a bit.

356
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,041
Thank you.

357
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:04,958
Just a little.

358
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,250
I don't drink too much.

359
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:07,916
Just enjoy your break.

360
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,416
Relax.

361
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,333
Good for you.

362
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,875
It's not easy to raise a kid on your own.
Let me know if you need help.

363
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,708
If you want to go somewhere,
I'll give you a ride. Don't be shy.

364
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,666
Here.

365
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,583
Bottoms up.

366
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,083
The boss is drinking.
Bottoms up, everyone.

367
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,166
You're awesome!

368
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,125
Good, you can drink.

369
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,916
Go again.

370
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,833
Boss.

371
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,291
To you again.

372
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,208
Come on.

373
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,333
Bottoms up.

374
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:49,791
Drink some more.

375
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,833
It's nice to drink together.

376
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,708
- Boss, I really…
- Go again.

377
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,958
I really can't drink more.

378
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:56,875
Go again.

379
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,291
May I ask you a personal question?

380
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,625
It's okay if you don't want to answer.

381
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,583
Sure.

382
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,500
Ask away.

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,791
How long have you been married?

384
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,666
It's been four years.

385
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,791
How did you two meet?

386
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,958
I accidentally hit him with my scooter.

387
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,916
We got married one year later.

388
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,250
It was a bit impulsive.

389
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,375
Are you happy?

390
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,916
That's a tough one.

391
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,333
That's hard to answer.

392
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,791
It's not as simple as "yes" or "no."

393
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,666
We argue a lot.

394
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,833
Every time we fight, I think,

395
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,041
"Wouldn't life be easier
if I were single?"

396
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,458
"Why did I get married?"

397
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,000
It's so tiring to be bound
to another person.

398
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,833
But when we manage
to get through difficulties together,

399
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,458
I feel happy all over again.

400
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,583
Maybe that's what marriage is.

401
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,416
Maybe marriage isn't all about happiness.

402
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,333
Maybe it's about

403
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,625
working together to move forward

404
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,333
and finding ways

405
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,333
to get closer to happiness.

406
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,750
Meeting someone to walk that path with

407
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,333
might just be
the greatest happiness of all.

408
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,625
I hope one day

409
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,583
I can meet someone just like you.

410
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,916
Are you sure?

411
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,208
Last time I got mad,

412
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,041
I hit my husband with pizza.

413
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:08,583
A Taoist Master told me
he's tough enough to handle me.

414
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,458
My friend is here.

415
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,291
So…

416
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:31,791
Bye.

417
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,291
Bye.

418
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,375
Here.

419
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,791
Have another drink.

420
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,333
Boss, I'll pass. You guys enjoy.
I can't drink any more.

421
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,458
We just opened this bottle.
Let's finish it.

422
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,708
I really can't.

423
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,458
You're spoiling the fun. Help me out.

424
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,583
Just drink with us, okay? What do you say?

425
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,083
Boss, let me drink with you.

426
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,708
But you don't drink, right?

427
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:24,958
Right.

428
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,250
That's rare. I've never
seen you drink before.

429
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,583
Here.

430
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,500
Is this enough?

431
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,416
Yes.

432
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,666
Really?

433
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,375
Seriously?

434
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,250
Cheers.

435
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,458
He's serious.

436
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,500
You're so cool.

437
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,625
Senpai, don't drink that.

438
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,833
- I didn't know you could drink.
- He drank it all.

439
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,041
He had a trick up his sleeves.

440
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,666
- Come on, again.
- He can drink.

441
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,375
I'm impressed, Mr. Zeng.

442
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:51,416
Again.

443
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,958
Come on.

444
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,166
Bottoms up.

445
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,541
ZENG XUE-YOU: I'M STILL WITH MY CLIENTS.

446
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,916
SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE IT.

447
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,958
Let's wait then.

448
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,166
Thanks.

449
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,958
When I got here,

450
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,500
I bumped into someone's churros,

451
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,333
and something got in my hair.

452
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,958
It's okay now.

453
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,000
LET'S GO OUT TO EAT.

454
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,291
Hi, do you have any painkillers?

455
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,166
How can I help you?

456
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,041
I'm on my period.

457
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,000
Does it hurt a lot?

458
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,541
Would you like to take a pill now?

459
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,291
- Sure.
- Please sit here.

460
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:50,958
How are you?

461
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,291
I'm fine.

462
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,500
Are you feeling dizzy?

463
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:54,416
A little.

464
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,125
Rest up.

465
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,375
Thanks for coming to the movies with me.

466
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,208
Otherwise I'd still be crying

467
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,708
at home alone.

468
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:07,208
After a breakup,
you need someone to talk to.

469
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,458
I'm here for you, whenever you need me.

470
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:18,666
To me

471
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,958
you're very special.

472
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,083
I'm here for you, whenever you need me.

473
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,333
<i>It turns out that when people</i>

474
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,916
<i>a simple caring word</i>

475
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,791

476
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,083
Are you okay?

477
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:42,291
<i>It shines so brightly that it blinds you,</i>
<i>shutting out everything else around you.</i>

478
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,791
Will you massage my hand
if I say I can't breathe well?

479
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,125
Your hands feel so strong.

480
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,083
Hey, little man.

481
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,083
Bye.

482
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,000
Let me see.

483
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,625
Have you noticed that

484
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:01,458
the prince always looks the same?

485
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,458
<i>THE LITTLE MERMAID</i>
<i>SNOW WHITE</i>

486
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,916
<i>You thought the prince had come</i>
<i>to save just you.</i>

487
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,500
<i>But he has actually been saving…</i>

488
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,416
Let's go.

489
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,666
<i>…the whole world.</i>

490
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,708
<i>It was very nice to meet you.</i>

491
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,875
<i>I really appreciate you chatting with me.</i>

492
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,833
<i>But let's</i>

493
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,958
<i>say goodbye here.</i>

494
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,333
Miss Chen.

495
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,625
My car is outside.

496
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:54,875
Let me give you a lift.

497
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:55,916
I'm good.

498
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,750
Thanks, boss.
We can call a taxi ourselves.

499
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,208
Don't be so polite.

500
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,291
It's no trouble at all.

501
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,250
It's okay.

502
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,208
Thank you, boss.

503
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:07,166
- Come on.
- I'm good. Thanks, boss.

504
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,541
Let's go together.

505
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:11,916
What's the matter?

506
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,708
Thank you.

507
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,708
Thank you.

508
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,125
Okay. Thanks for having me.

509
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:18,458
I'm pleased we're working together.

510
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,833
Miss Chen, come on. Let's go.

511
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,875
My car is right outside.

512
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,041
Miss Chen.

513
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,458
Where are we?

514
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,500
Senpai.

515
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,208
This way.

516
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:11,083
Senpai.

517
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,583
Senpai, your phone.

518
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,750
Senpai, your phone is ringing.

519
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,875
