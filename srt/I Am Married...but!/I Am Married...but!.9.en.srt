1
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:17,541
MAYBE HE JUST NEEDS TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

2
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,958
KNOWING YOU CARE FOR HIM

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,333
IS ALL HE NEEDS.

4
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,041
<i>I want to let you know that</i>

5
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,750
<i>It's actually good</i>

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,833
<i>To have me around</i>

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,666
Great job.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,791
They are back.

9
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:34,833
Mom.

10
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,083
Did you have fun?

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,750
Yes…

12
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,333
That's good.

13
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,166
Put the luggage down. Put it down.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,541
I prepared some fruit.

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,833
Here, have some.

16
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,375
Put it down. Have some fruit.

17
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,291
Take a seat.

18
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:48,875
Take a seat.

19
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,916
Chloe was so amazing at school today.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,666
It was an amazing performance.

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,625
She did all the movements properly.

22
00:00:58,708 --> 00:00:59,958
She was the best.

23
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,375
Unlike other kids who couldn't keep up.

24
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,083
You could really see
that our family has great genes.

25
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,541
Chloe,

26
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,916
show your uncle and aunt what you did.

27
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,208
Come on.

28
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,833
<i>Do you like me? Do you like my look?</i>

29
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:19,500
<i>Do you like me? Do you like my red hair?</i>

30
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,500
<i>Do you like me? I am strong and kind</i>

31
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,541
<i>I want to let you know that…</i>

32
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,458
<i>What is the result?</i>

33
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,583
<i>My sperm.</i>

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,875
How many are there?

35
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,333
Did they find any?

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,458
Great job.

37
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,458
Amazing.

38
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,791
How come you are so amazing?

39
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,750
Chloe,

40
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,333
you will have playmates

41
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,083
when we have more kids in the household.

42
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,458
A boy or girl?

43
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,833
Do you want a boy or a girl cousin?

44
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:57,958
A girl.

45
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,125
Not a boy?

46
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,291
I want a girl cousin.

47
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,458
Okay, then.

48
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,125
One boy and one girl, okay?

49
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,041
Okay.

50
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:06,958
Great.

51
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,583
We want both.

52
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,833
Okay.

53
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,250
One boy and one girl.

54
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,875
<i>How many are there?</i>

55
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,166
None.

56
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,000
None?

57
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,625
Not even one?

58
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,333
Are they sure?

59
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,708
Or…

60
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,333
Should we do it again?

61
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,000
The doctor said…

62
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:25,041
if we still want kids…

63
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,250
we could use a sperm donor

64
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,791
or adopt.

65
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,375
But we can take our time.

66
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,583
We can discuss it later.

67
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,458
There's no rush.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,083
CAUSE OF AZOOSPERMIA

69
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:27,208
IS THERE ANY CHANCE TO CONCEIVE
AFTER AZOOSPERMIA TREATMENT?

70
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,958
- It leaves at 7:50 a.m.?
- Yes.

71
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,458
Finish breakfast fast.

72
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:53,750
Mom?

73
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,125
Mom?

74
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:58,958
Mom?

75
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,166
Are you all right?

76
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:01,791
Mom?

77
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,625
I have been teaching for 30 years.

78
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,875
My work was all about teaching

79
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,791
the principes of being a good person

80
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,208
and conducting oneself properly.

81
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,166
You should never lie.

82
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,875
You-you,

83
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,750
you never used to be like this.

84
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,916
Why don't you tell me
about your problems anymore?

85
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,916
She knows.

86
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,666
How?

87
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,166
No idea.

88
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,416
Mom.

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,708
Open the door, okay?

90
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,916
Let's talk.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,083
It's easier to talk face-to-face.

92
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,708
Ask her to open the door.

93
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,500
She'll listen to you. Ask her.

94
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,416
Mom.

95
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,041
Open the door, okay?

96
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:08,791
Mom.

97
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,291
SURGICAL FEE

98
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,916
Tell me.

99
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,541
You didn't go on a trip, did you?

100
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,791
You went to the hospital, right?

101
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,791
I knew you didn't want kids,

102
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,916
but I didn't push you to.

103
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,041
I hoped you would
make the decision on your own.

104
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,625
And I respect that.

105
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,666
But no matter how small the baby is is,

106
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,833
it's still a life.

107
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,125
You should respect it.

108
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,458
How could you
have an abortion so casually?

109
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,250
Mom,

110
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,375
we didn't.

111
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,000
Who told you that?

112
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,375
Yeah, Mom. We did not have an abortion.

113
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,916
What kind of surgery
did you have at the hospital?

114
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,625
Mom.

115
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,166
We did some tests at the hospital, then…

116
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,166
to see if there is…

117
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,875
like…

118
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,625
to see…

119
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,750
see if I have…

120
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,375
like…

121
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,500
Mom…

122
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,833
So,

123
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,500
I did many tests.

124
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,791
The doctor said

125
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,250
I had a tumor in my uterus,

126
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,041
so I had surgery

127
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,291
to remove the tumor,

128
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,833
which was a success.

129
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,250
But the doctor said that
I cannot get pregnant anymore.

130
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,791
Mom, sorry.

131
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,500
We didn't mean to hide it.

132
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:17,208
We didn't tell you because we
really didn't know how to break it to you.

133
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,083
Sorry, Mom.

134
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,250
Zeng Xue-you, I can catch the next bus.

135
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,750
Slow down.

136
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,291
Zeng Xue-you,
why did you run the red light?

137
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,708
Are you mad?

138
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,958
Yes, I am.

139
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,416
What are you talking about?
Why are you upset?

140
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,791
Why did you say that?

141
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,333
What?

142
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,333
Why did you say that to Mom?

143
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,666
I don't care.

144
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,416
Mom knew that I didn't want kids.

145
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,458
It's easier to say I can't have kids.

146
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,500
Why are you upset?

147
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,416
I care.

148
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,375
Let me deal with my own stuff, okay?

149
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,666
BEEF SOUP?

150
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,708
BRAISED NOODLES? FRUIT ICE!

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Chill.

152
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,000
We followed the script.

153
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:25,916
It will pass.

154
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
- What do you want to eat later?
- No appetite.

155
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,041
No?

156
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,083
What's wrong with you?

157
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,916
This is Tainan.

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,750
Don't you eat like a pig
every time you come to Tainan?

159
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,500
Director, thank you
for coming all this way.

160
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,333
I heard that you used to study film here.

161
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,625
We both went to college here.

162
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,666
They're homegrown talents of our Tainan.

163
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,916
The video has great vibes.

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,916
Thank you.

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,083
Thank you.

166
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,583
Let's hear the chairman's opinion.

167
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,833
What's wrong with this video?

168
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,333
Every frame is so short.
It's hard to see what's happening.

169
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,750
Our company is 40 years old.

170
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,958
It has made many commercials.

171
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,583
It hasn't done anything like this.

172
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,541
Who approved this script?

173
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,458
Wasn't the script
approved by the chairman himself?

174
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,458
I am really sorry.

175
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,250
We will remind him.

176
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,791
Sorry.

177
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,375
Could we adjust the pace a bit?

178
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,041
I don't think we can slow it down,
because this one…

179
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,416
Your products are targeting
young people, right?

180
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,875
If we slow it down,

181
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,416
we'll miss your target.

182
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,833
- So maintaining the pace…
- Director, we're really sorry.

183
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,916
To be honest,

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,666
the chairman is old.

185
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,208
His memory is deteriorating.

186
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,416
He forgot that he had read the script.

187
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,416
His eyes are deteriorating, so it's hard
for him to see things that move fast.

188
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,833
I say

189
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,375
we slow it down.

190
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,666
Making it more artsy isn't bad.

191
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,041
Isn't that what you film people love?

192
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,041
Sorry, we are really sorry.

193
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,916
How long will the changes take?

194
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,250
Maybe…

195
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,541
a couple of days.

196
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:33,791
Okay?

197
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,791
We are really sorry.

198
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,833
Because our chairman has a busy schedule,

199
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:43,125
is it possible
to have it by tomorrow morning?

200
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,583
Possible?

201
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,083
Tomorrow and the day after
differ by about 20 hours.

202
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,416
How could it be possible?

203
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,750
We take it step by step

204
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,166
when we hit on girls.

205
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,000
Stripping off a woman's clothes
on the first date is called rape.

206
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,666
They're mocking us when they say
"We are sorry."

207
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,166
"We're sorry you have to stay overnight
to make edits."

208
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,583
"We'll book you hotel rooms."

209
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,041
"Sorry?" Their constant apologies
felt so hypocritical.

210
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,666
What if I needed to breastfeed?

211
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,916
Why are you all hyped up,
talking about rape and breastfeeding?

212
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,083
Yes.

213
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,083
Life is tough.

214
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,791
What is it? Did you two fight again?

215
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,208
What about?

216
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,541
Here's your order. It's hot.

217
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,458
You don't want any?

218
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,708
Hurry up and eat
so we can finish editing and go home.

219
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,625
Be quiet.

220
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,375
My soul has been tortured

221
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,541
and is now broken.

222
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,875
Let me enjoy the food first.

223
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,083
Eat shit.

224
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,666
It's so good

225
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,791
and so tender.

226
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,166
Why is it so good?

227
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,583
It's so good.

228
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,041
HONEY I-LING

229
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,666
Senpai,

230
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,166
are you going to answer that?

231
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:31,791
No.

232
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,125
Sorry.

233
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,083
Sorry.

234
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,125
I HAVE TO DELIVER A CLIP TOMORROW.

235
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,208
I WON'T MAKE IT HOME TONIGHT.
PLEASE TEXT ME BACK.

236
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,416
Senpai,

237
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,083
I can help you.

238
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,041
- It's heavy.
- That's all right.

239
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,708
Just leave them.

240
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,083
- I got it, really.
- Put it down. Let me do it.

241
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,041
Here.

242
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,000
Stop.

243
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,833
- No, it's too big.
- It's okay.

244
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,625
I can manage.

245
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,541
I got it.

246
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,625
- Do you need to rest?
- No, I'm fine.

247
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,250
- I got it, really.
- You don't have to.

248
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,416
- I got it.
- Watch out.

249
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,208
Watch your back.

250
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,166
It's okay.

251
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,125
What's so funny?

252
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,416
It's very funny.

253
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,458
Keep clear.

254
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,625
I'm doing inventory.

255
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,916
Excuse me.

256
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,875
I like moving stuff.

257
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,666
So you like torturing yourself?

258
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,083
Those things are so heavy!

259
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,875
At least I feel useful that way.

260
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,208
And not like a total failure.

261
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,708
You aren't a failure.

262
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,208
If it weren't for you,
I would have been fired.

263
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,166
Why? You learn fast.

264
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,833
Thanks to you.

265
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,833
Whenever you're around, I feel safe.

266
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,833
Senpai, if you need help,

267
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:45,958
please let me know.

268
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,625
Because I really like you…

269
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,583
like how you've taught me so much.

270
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,000
Keep up the good work.

271
00:18:59,083 --> 00:18:59,916
Lu.

272
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,625
- Would you like beef noodles?
- Okay.

273
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,541
Okay.

274
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:04,958
Hold on.

275
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,208
- One for me too, please.
- You too?

276
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,791
Yeah, that's rare.

277
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,833
No lunchbox today?

278
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,000
My mom went to pray.

279
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,083
Really? Where?

280
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,625
Hualien.

281
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,000
Hualien? Why so far away?

282
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,250
The fertility goddess is there.

283
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,625
It works.

284
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,416
After praying there,
infertile people can have babies.

285
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:26,791
Senpai,

286
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,166
with your situation,
you should have a dozen babies.

287
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,583
God. Senpai, you must be busy every night.

288
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,916
I-Ling isn't home.
She went on a business trip.

289
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,458
Senpai,

290
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,625
I love you.

291
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,708
I love you.

292
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,791
Me too, Senpai.

293
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,541
- I love you too, Senpai.
- Let's hang out at your place.

294
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,000
- Count me in.
- I love you.

295
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,416
You sure you don't even want one bite?

296
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,041
Are you sure?

297
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,375
It's almost gone.

298
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,375
Give it to me.

299
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,333
No.

300
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,541
Give it to me.

301
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,166
This is so delicious.

302
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,708
How come it tastes the same
after all these years? It's so impressive.

303
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,750
Right?

304
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,041
In this world,

305
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,416
there's nothing beef soup can't fix.

306
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,833
Eat away all your worries.

307
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,541
I'm eating it up.

308
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,208
It's good, right?

309
00:20:59,125 --> 00:20:59,958
So good.

310
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,583
- Let's get fruit ice after this.
- Fruit ice?

311
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,833
I can't eat any more.

312
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,791
It's so good.

313
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,375
I can feed myself.

314
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,583
- Eat it. It's okay.
- I…

315
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,500
Eat it.

316
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,541
Thumbs up.

317
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,250
I'm like a stuffed pig right now.
I can't eat any more.

318
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,750
- Aren't we getting meatballs after this?
- I can't eat anymore.

319
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,833
You can.

320
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,291
Are you on that dating app again?

321
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,875
It's none of your business.

322
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,333
"Time will heal…"

323
00:21:59,125 --> 00:21:59,958
What?

324
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:00,875
Keep typing.

325
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,708
"Time will heal the pain of a breakup."

326
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,083
"Maybe the one

327
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,625
is still waiting for you."

328
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,041
Why are you so pretentious?

329
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,666
It's so unlike you.

330
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,791
This is me.

331
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,375
This is the real me.

332
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,541
I only lower my level when I talk to you.

333
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:25,583
- You're really shameless, aren't you?
- I'm fine.

334
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,541
Check, please.

335
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,458
SOUL MATE

336
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,083
So good!

337
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,666
- The fried chicken's here.
- I got it.

338
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,750
Who wants some Coke?

339
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,166
Who wants Coke?

340
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:15,791
Hold on.

341
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,875
Sprinkle that on. Add some spice.

342
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,750
Hold on. I'll get some glasses.

343
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:22,708
No need.

344
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,291
Drink from the bottle.
Your wife isn't here.

345
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,541
Senpai, free your soul.

346
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,458
From the bottle.

347
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,375
Man.

348
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,375
- Free your soul.
- Drink.

349
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,833
Free your soul.

350
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,541
Napkins.

351
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,625
Amazing!

352
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,500
Everybody, here we go.

353
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,708
It's a strip club.

354
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,458
So many girls.

355
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,291
Here, Senpai.

356
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:00,041
- It's your turn.
- Senpai.

357
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,750
- Try it.
- Try it.

358
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,125
Try it.

359
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,958
- Listen, Senpai.
- You guys have fun.

360
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:09,250
Pick the one you like, give her money,
and she'll follow you and dance for you.

361
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,208
The left one or the right one?

362
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,583
The right one, Senpai.

363
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,458
Pick that one, Senpai.

364
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,583
Bring her outside.

365
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:26,250
Car sex!

366
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,416
It's shaking hard!

367
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,208
So fun.

368
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,208
- Did someone order food?
- It's the snacks.

369
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,416
No, we ordered fried food.

370
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,625
Let me check.

371
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,250
No, we just the fried food, right?

372
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,250
And some other snacks too.

373
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:47,750
Senpai.

374
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:51,958
Say hello.

375
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,083
Hello.

376
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,041
Look who's here! It's Lu and Shu.

377
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,208
- Where are my pants?
- No idea. You're messy!

378
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,750
- Who took my pants?
- Over there.

379
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
- Did you two take the stairs?
- Yes.

380
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,500
Your floor is really high up!

381
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,250
Yes.

382
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,916
It's scorching outside.

383
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,041
So…

384
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,250
Change the channel.

385
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,166
Quick.

386
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:26,750
We…

387
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,750
Yes, you guys made it.

388
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,833
Good. Goal.

389
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,416
Okay. Come on in.

390
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:40,875
Guys,

391
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,291
say hello.

392
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,375
- Sit down.
- Have some fried food.

393
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,291
- Want some Coke, Shu?
- We have many soda drinks.

394
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,833
Excuse me. My wife is checking on me.

395
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,041
Let me take a selfie.

396
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay, let's do it.

397
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,333
Put the bad stuff away.

398
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:56,958
No sugary drinks or fried food.

399
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,458
Sorry. No Coke. No sugary drinks.

400
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:01,375
No Coke, right?

401
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,875
Okay, it looks fine.

402
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,208
- Lu, you got cut off. Come closer.
- Okay.

403
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,125
- Closer.
- Come here.

404
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,041
Closer.

405
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,708
Closer.

406
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:13,625
- Closer.
- Closer.

407
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:14,541
Okay.

408
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:15,458
Okay, here.

409
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,750
One, two, three.

410
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,875
- Thank you all.
- Thank you, Senpai.

411
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:23,666
It's safe now. The alarm is off.

412
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,416
Shu,

413
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,833
here's your drink.

414
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,666
- Thank you, Senpai.
- My pleasure.

415
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,416
I washed your shirt. Thank you.

416
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,500
You are welcome.

417
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,750
I added a scent booster to it. Smell it.

418
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,791
Really? Let me smell.

419
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,000
It smells so good.

420
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,458
This scent is called morning violet.

421
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:47,791
The same as mine.

422
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,375
Okay, he gets it.

423
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,458
Cover your belly. Sit down.

424
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,333
Shu.

425
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,625
Have you seen the night view?

426
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,833
- I will take you to have a look, okay?
- Okay.

427
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,000
Come, I'm going to pick you up.

428
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,541
One, two, three.

429
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,250
Here, hold tight.

430
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,291
Come, let's go upstairs.

431
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:10,750
Come, Shu.

432
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,208
Here is the switch.

433
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,166
On the left.

434
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,916
It's a temple.

435
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,833
And a police station.

436
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:21,750
And that?

437
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,291
It's a shopping mall.

438
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,458
- Shu, do you want to play?
- Okay.

439
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,375
I'll teach you

440
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:28,416
how to build one.

441
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,333
Okay.

442
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:31,750
Come here.

443
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,291
What the hell?

444
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,041
What?

445
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:45,041
- I didn't say anything.
- No need. I know what you're thinking.

446
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,083
Oh?

447
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,041
Is that right?

448
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,333
- What?
- You're disgusting.

449
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,166
What's disgusting? Tell me.

450
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,416
Tell me.

451
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,833
Dirty.

452
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,875
So dirty.

453
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,916
Yes, I'm dirty, so what?

454
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,458
Don't read my mind.

455
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:06,583
- I didn't.
- But you're taking up space in my brain.

456
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,041
You must have a small brain then.

457
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,500
So what?

458
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:14,541
I have an ultra large folder in my brain
called "I-Ling Lin-the-idiot."

459
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:16,875
What a coincidence.

460
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:20,083
I have a folder in my brain
named "Paul Chang-eat-shit."

461
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,583
You eat shit.

462
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,125
Eat shit every day.

463
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,291
How far is it?

464
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,333
Turn right ahead.

465
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,541
Wait for me here.

466
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,333
Wait for me there.

467
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,291
Where are you going?

468
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,500
Wait for me there.

469
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,666
Paul Chang, eat shit.

470
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,708
Paul Chang, go eat shit!

471
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,833
I told you we should take a bus
to the hotel,

472
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:21,500
but you insisted on walking.

473
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,625
I needed to walk off my full stomach.

474
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:27,958
And it's not that far.

475
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,458
I can carry them.

476
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,333
Which way should we go?

477
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,375
There's a path up ahead to the left.

478
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,333
<i>Knowing someone for a long time</i>

479
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,916
<i>doesn't mean you truly understand them.</i>
