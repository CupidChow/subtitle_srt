1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,083
Here. Put this piece here.

2
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:11,666
And…

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,625
This…

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:13,541
Push.

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:14,458
Harder.

6
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,750
Great! It's done!

7
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:18,916
Nice work!

8
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,541
This is me.

9
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,791
This one is Mom.

10
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,500
This one is you.

11
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,708
So we're a family.

12
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,125
You are my father.

13
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,333
Shu, don't say silly things.

14
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,833
I didn't.

15
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,041
Don't say that, okay?

16
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,958
Don't say what?

17
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,666
It's okay.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,416
It's getting late. Let's go home now.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,708
Say thanks to Senpai.

20
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,291
But I'm not done yet.

21
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,375
It's all done, right? We're done playing.

22
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,333
I want to play for a little while longer.

23
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,291
No way.
It's too late. We might miss the bus home.

24
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,625
Where would you sleep if we miss it?

25
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,041
We'll sleep here.

26
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,541
We can't. This is Senpai's place.
Let's go home.

27
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,833
Hey,

28
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,750
can we sleep at your place?

29
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,708
Shu, you're being silly.

30
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,625
Let's go home.

31
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,541
Come on.

32
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,000
No.

33
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,083
Come on.

34
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,500
Just a little longer!

35
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,666
Let's go home.

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,666
Just a little longer!

37
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,583
It's alright.
Let him play a little longer.

38
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,458
If it's too late and you miss the bus,
I can give you a ride home.

39
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,208
Shu, do you want to keep playing?

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,166
Just a little longer.

41
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,625
Say thanks.

42
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,625
Thank you.

43
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:42,458
Alright.

44
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,125
Every time is like this.

45
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,041
Sit still.

46
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,000
Sit still.

47
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,000
Now, let's sort them by color.

48
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:51,916
Alright.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,833
And…

50
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,250
Shu, you get

51
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,125
all the white ones.

52
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,791
Lu, you get the yellow ones.

53
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,208
I'll take the blue ones.

54
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,125
A yellow one.

55
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,041
Senpai.

56
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,916
Let's see who can sort them fastest!
White's fast. White.

57
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,500
This…

58
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,750
You're messing them up.

59
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,458
- How about we build a house?
- Okay.

60
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,375
A house.

61
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,666
This is small.

62
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,208
Get a bigger one.

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,750
This is still farmland. I thought they
would have built a house here by now.

64
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,250
We found the bathtub there.

65
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,208
Yeah.

66
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,541
You were nuts!
Who rides a scooter with a tub?

67
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,750
You're the crazy one.
Who told me to do it?

68
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,041
Come on. You could have refused.

69
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:46,958
Refused?

70
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,125
How could I?

71
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,375
You were so excited,

72
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,875
saying, "Great, we can use it
as decoration. It's perfect."

73
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,416
You wouldn't listen.
It was like you had bricks in your ears.

74
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,208
You kept asking me to "hang in there."

75
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,125
"Hang in there."

76
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,041
Hang in there.

77
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,750
We're almost there.

78
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,458
No way! I'm dying here.

79
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,375
It's so heavy!

80
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,666
Hold the bathtub.

81
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,291
My neck is about to snap!

82
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,291
I'm going to die.

83
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll go to hell with you if you die,
so stop whining.

84
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,041
Hold on tight.

85
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,500
I am!

86
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,541
What was that?

87
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,541
Nothing.

88
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,041
- Yeah, I can feel it crawling.
- No, it's just dirt.

89
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,000
- No.
- Yeah, some soil fell into your shirt.

90
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,500
- It's a cockroach. I can feel it!
- No, it isn't.

91
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,666
- Yeah, I can feel it crawling.
- No, it's just dirt.

92
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,041
- Some dirt fell in there!
- No, it's crawling!

93
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,291
- No.
- Help me get rid of it.

94
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,041
- Come on.
- Focus on driving, okay?

95
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,208
- Get rid of it.
- It's just dirt.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,291
Paul Chang!

97
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,208
Screw that.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,125
You were heartless.

99
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,708
I was worried you'd be scared.
What if you fell?

100
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,333
So I owe my life to you now, huh?

101
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,708
Thanks a lot.

102
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,833
Anytime.

103
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,666
Remember that typhoon?

104
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,208
When the campus flooded and the water
went halfway up the first floor.

105
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,000
I couldn't leave the editing room.

106
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,708
How could I forget?
The sports field became an ocean.

107
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,041
A-Wan and I saved you in a rubber boat!

108
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,125
All the scooters were soaked.
It was terrifying.

109
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,916
The stuff in the toilet was floating out.

110
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,291
Do you remember when A-Wan kept yelling…

111
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,791
- "Poop's floating!"
- "Poop's floating!"

112
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,458
You were even dumber.

113
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,208
You watched the poop float

114
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,625
- and still asked me…
- "Want to be together?"

115
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,541
Yeah.

116
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,541
That was so lame.

117
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,958
- The timing was awful.
- How was that lame?

118
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,000
You still remember that, right?
That means it was unforgettable.

119
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,333
I thought you were joking back then.

120
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,666
Joking?

121
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,208
I was so serious.

122
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,125
I kept asking you, "Want to be together?"

123
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,416
I was being serious, but you just laughed.

124
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,125
What do you say?

125
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,125
To what?

126
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,958
Want to be together?

127
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,875
Should we go to my room or yours?

128
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,458
I'm fine with either.

129
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,125
Let's go to your room.

130
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,666
THEY SAY OUR BRAINS
PRODUCE MORE THAN 6,000 THOUGHTS A DAY

131
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,083
AND THAT IT'S MORE COMPLEX
THAN THE UNIVERSE.

132
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:31,291
SO, IT'LL TAKE
A LIFETIME TO UNDERSTAND IT.

133
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,041
<i>Your presence fills me with happiness.</i>

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,958
<i>I want to be with you every day,</i>

135
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,291
<i>past, present, and future.</i>

136
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:56,250
<i>Please let me form part of your happiness.</i>

137
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,125
What if…

138
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,083
We switch it up?

139
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:10,750
If…

140
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,875
Let me try again.

141
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,000
If I could do it over…

142
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,166
You want another version?

143
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,541
Stop cutting!

144
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,916
Let me finish.
Do you have bricks in your ears again?

145
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,416
Say it. What's on your mind?

146
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,625
"What if" what…?

147
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:34,916
Would we still

148
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,708
be together

149
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,208
if we could do it all over again?

150
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,458
Where do you want to start over?

151
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,583
After graduation or…

152
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,750
When you went to London
to get your master's degree

153
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,375
and disappeared into thin air?

154
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:02,000
Or when you got married, then divorced,
and vanished for ten years?

155
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,041
Okay, I deserved that.

156
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,500
I had no clue what I was doing.
I was just wandering around.

157
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,500
Until I returned and heard
you were going to get married.

158
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,458
That was when I realized what I'd lost.

159
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,833
Okay, what if…

160
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,208
What if, when I came back,

161
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,916
you were single?

162
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,458
Would we be together today?

163
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,625
<i>Don't come near me. You're so annoying.</i>

164
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,583
I don't know.

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,875
Maybe.

166
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,041
Maybe?

167
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,000
Does "maybe" mean yes or no?

168
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:56,916
It's…

169
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
fifty-fifty.

170
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,625
Really that low?

171
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,958
That's sky-high!
How much more do you want?

172
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,333
100%, of course!

173
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,125
I'm so talented.

174
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,125
Really?

175
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,125
Absolutely!

176
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,333
And…

177
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:14,000
We would've gotten hitched right away.
We would've had a wedding to remember!

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,625
Move!

179
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,583
Go on stage.

180
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,291
Come on!

181
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,333
Get on stage.

182
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,041
You… Get on all fours!

183
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,083
Do it! On your knees!

184
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,666
Do it!

185
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,666
Get down!

186
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,000
That'd be insane!

187
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,583
Awesome, right?

188
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,583
That's great!

189
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,625
Could we have gone to Paris
for our honeymoon?

190
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,500
Of course.

191
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,125
We could go every year.

192
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,458
Can we not live with your parents?

193
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,916
Of course!

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,916
My mom is not a fan of living with me.

195
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,416
Let's…

196
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,625
stay childfree

197
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,916
forever.

198
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,791
Perfect, right?

199
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,500
Ew!

200
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,416
What?

201
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,666
What's wrong?

202
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,125
You thought of all this?

203
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,916
Ew!

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,833
I just thought about it.
I didn't do anything.

205
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,791
Ew!

206
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,458
Stop saying "ew!"
You love eating poop, huh?

207
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,083
Okay, no more jokes.

208
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,750
- Is there anything else to change?
- I'm not joking.

209
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,833
I'm serious.

210
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,875
It's no use.

211
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,916
All your "what ifs" are hypothetical.

212
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,291
You can't replay your life in a click.

213
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,333
No matter how good it could've been…
There's no going back.

214
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,208
Any more thoughts to share?
If not, let's sign off on the cut.

215
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,333
That's it then.

216
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,250
Bye.

217
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,791
- Thanks for everything.
- Okay.

218
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,375
Bye.

219
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,500
Call us if you need anything.

220
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:14,791
Here.

221
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,833
I can take it.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,875
Got it?

223
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,625
Lu,

224
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,833
this is for Shu.

225
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,708
You're so kind, but it's okay.
I'll buy him one.

226
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,708
It okay.
He can have it. I bought a few more.

227
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,875
A few more?

228
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,583
I got four of them.

229
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,416
Thanks, Senpai.

230
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,500
- You're welcome. I'll put it here.
- Okay.

231
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,833
What do you usually like to eat?

232
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,666
Nothing special.

233
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,833
Any special dietary requirements?

234
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,166
I guess not.

235
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,708
Do you prefer rice or noodles?

236
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,500
Rice, I guess.

237
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,458
Okay.

238
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,500
<i>The summer</i>

239
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,291
<i>Breeze</i>

240
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,125
<i>Hugs us</i>

241
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,375
<i>Both</i>

242
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,750
<i>You're my</i>

243
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,250
<i>Baby</i>

244
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,375
<i>I love you</i>

245
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,708
<i>You love me</i>

246
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,666
Sorry.

247
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,458
- Were you hurt?
- No.

248
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,750
- Were you hurt, Shu?
- No.

249
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,541
Sorry.

250
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,166
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,041
I-LING: DID YOU EAT?

252
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,750
XUE-YOU: YUP.

253
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,208
I-LING: ARE YOU OKAY?

254
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,625
NO ANSWER.

255
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,833
I'M TAKING THE TRAIN HOME THIS AFTERNOON

256
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:14,916
Here you go.

257
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,791
Tie your robe properly, okay?

258
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,458
Why?

259
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,125
You think I'm too sexy?

260
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,208
Whatever you say.

261
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,125
Haven't you met anyone decent
on the dating apps?

262
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,916
Yeah, lots.

263
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,041
Just no one I like.

264
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,083
When I heard you were getting married,

265
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,791
I prayed.

266
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,708
I prayed that you'd marry a jerk

267
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,375
and get divorced fast.

268
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,250
Damn, you're so mean!

269
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,250
I can't help it.

270
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,291
I hate Zeng Xue-you so much.
How can someone be like that?

271
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,000
Like what?

272
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,291
- What's so bad about him?
- Everything.

273
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,541
Have you ever heard him swear?
Have you heard him badmouth someone else?

274
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,500
Nope, never.

275
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,500
He thinks everyone is nice.

276
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,875
He treated me like a friend
when we first met.

277
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,666
If I were a scammer…

278
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,250
I'd mess with him all the time.
I'd ruin him.

279
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,708
But no, he'd just be chill about it.

280
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,750
You're so harsh on him every day,
even I pity him.

281
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,625
Oh yeah? So what do you
actually hate about him?

282
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,625
I hate him because he's too nice.

283
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,833
I wish he were a jerk.

284
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,458
I think you actually like him.

285
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,041
Should I help you tell him?

286
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,916
No, thanks.
I'm a pro at telling people I like them.

287
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,541
I've been doing that since nursery school.

288
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,125
Stop acting so tough.

289
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,583
Men are simple.

290
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,583
Give him some encouragement sometimes,

291
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,375
and he's all yours,
fully at your disposal.

292
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,875
Encouragement?

293
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:18,833
What do you mean?

294
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,541
What you do and say means a lot.

295
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,041
Just smile and soften up.

296
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,291
He'll be fine.

297
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,916
Just look at Aragaki Yu.

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,833
When she smiles,

299
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,375
she's so cute and sweet.

300
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,916
Men kneel down before her.

301
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,750
Just smile?

302
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,166
Yeah, try it.

303
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,583
- Are your clients happy?
- Yeah, they are.

304
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,583
Thanks to her.

305
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,500
She grinned like Annabelle.

306
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,291
You want me to laugh again?

307
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,125
That's how you laugh
when you're possessed by a devil.

308
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,875
Any questions about this new cut?

309
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,666
No questions at all!

310
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,875
Take her for an exorcism now.
Don't bring the bad vibes home.

311
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,583
Didn't you need to poop?

312
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,000
Why the slow goodbye? Bye!

313
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,333
You don't want your laptop after work?

314
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,875
You've been doing well.

315
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,125
If you two divorce,

316
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,375
I'll be the first in line to marry you.

317
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,125
What are you talking about?

318
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,291
Why are you still here? Go away now.
Hurry back home. Goodbye.

319
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,375
- Bye.
- Bye.

320
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:18,875
This is for you.

321
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,583
I am sorry.

322
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,125
I…

323
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,083
I was being inconsiderate.

324
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,916
It's my fault.
I should've spoken to you first.

325
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,166
Thank you.

326
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,875
I'm sorry too.

327
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,500
So what should we do now?

328
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,041
Wing it like a bird.

329
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,625
That joke is old.
Even Dad wouldn't tell it.

330
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,625
I think it's funny.

331
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,625
Why's this shorter?
Did you lend it to someone?

332
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,208
A coworker borrowed it.

333
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,125
I'll talk to Mom later.

334
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,833
Let's go.

335
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:47,875
You're home.

336
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,333
Hello, Aunt.

337
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,291
Hi, Aunt.

338
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,458
- Hi, Aunt.
- You look great.

339
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,291
- Hi, Cousin.
- Hello.

340
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,583
Hi, Aunt.

341
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,666
So sweet of you.

342
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,958
- So sweet.
- Hello.

343
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:58,958
So sweet.

344
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,666
- Hi!
- You're the perfect match.

345
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,291
- So handsome.
- Dad.

346
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,208
Hello, Uncle!

347
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,125
Hello, Uncle!

348
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,041
Hi, Dad.

349
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,291
- Hello, Uncle!
- Hi.

350
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,208
We're heading upstairs. You all can talk.

351
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,041
I looked around.

352
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,416
The best spot for bearing a son…

353
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,250
is here.

354
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:25,041
So Master,
you mean we should put their bed here?

355
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,541
Sure.

356
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,250
You can try this,
the talisman for bearing a son.

357
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,541
This Kylin will bring blessings for a son.

358
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,833
These have been consecrated.

359
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,583
Place them by their bedside.

360
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,958
It will help them.

361
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,458
But for the best effect,

362
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,750
their bed should be here.

363
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:48,041
This is the best spot to bear a son.
The success rate is 90%.

364
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:49,958
Great!

365
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:50,875
Thank you.

366
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,125
Thank you, Master.

367
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,125
Thank you, Master.

368
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,541
