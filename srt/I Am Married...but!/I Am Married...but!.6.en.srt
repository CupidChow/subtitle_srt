1
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,291
I should get home.

2
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,166
<i>You are everywhere.</i>

3
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,916
<i>Even in my dreams.</i>

4
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,541
<i>You have great timing!</i>

5
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,625
<i>You did this the other day.</i>

6
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,791
The power is back.

7
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,708
Can I add you on LINE?

8
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,875
That way, if you have any questions
about the medication,

9
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,375
you can ask me.
and I will answer your questions.

10
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,000
I need to get this.

11
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,333
Hello?

12
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,875
<i>Are you all right?</i>

13
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:54,833
<i>Where are you?</i>

14
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,375
Close to home.

15
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,583
I had no signal until just now.

16
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,916
<i>I'm glad you're okay.</i>

17
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,291
Are you all right?

18
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,833
<i>I was fixing the computer</i>
<i>when the outage hit,</i>

19
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,708
<i>so all the data was lost.</i>

20
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,000
<i>I told my colleagues to go home,</i>
<i>so I might be working late.</i>

21
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,541
<i>I have something to show you. Hold on.</i>

22
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,291
LET'S GO OUT TO EAT.

23
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,666
Hi, do you have any painkillers?

24
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,166
How can I help you?

25
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,333
I'm on my period.

26
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,375
<i>Look at this sticker.</i>
<i>You can add words to it.</i>

27
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,750
Does it hurt bad?

28
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,750
MR. AND MRS. ZENG, LAUGHING

29
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,291
<i>Look.</i>

30
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,750
<i>I made another one.</i>

31
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,375
<i>We can talk via the sticker.</i>

32
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,208
"Go

33
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,583
eat

34
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,333
and sleep."

35
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,791
"Don't wait up for me"?

36
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,916
<i>Honey, I couldn't love you more.</i>

37
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,250
<i>Did you get it?</i>

38
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,791
<i>Get it?</i>

39
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,166
Yeah, I got it.

40
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,500
Bye.

41
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,125
<i>Bye.</i>

42
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,416
Are you okay?

43
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,416
I'm okay.

44
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,666
Are you feeling dizzy?

45
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,916
- A little.
- Rest up.

46
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,250
Hello?

47
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,541
She's going into labor?

48
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,625
Now?

49
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,250
A-Nan is still on Green Island?

50
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,291
Okay, hang on.

51
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,791
I am on my way.

52
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,291
IN A LIFETIME, YOU'LL LIKE MANY,

53
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,500
YET,

54
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,625
YOU'LL LOVE ONLY ONE.

55
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,833
Daddy is on his way.
Stay inside for a bit longer, okay?

56
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:50,958
Here comes your daddy.

57
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,083
You? Why are you here?

58
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,250
I didn't mean to,

59
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,333
You should've called me
after the baby was born.

60
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,250
I might pass out
if I see a baby covered in blood.

61
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,833
It's not like that.
It's not pig's blood cake.

62
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,250
<i>Don't… don't call me.</i>

63
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,333
<i>Don't…</i>

64
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,666
Hi, Mr. Liao.

65
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm not… I'm not going into labor yet.

66
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,208
Go ahead.

67
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,458
Put page C in front of page A

68
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,666
and after page B.

69
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,666
I got it.

70
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,583
Add a promotion page at the end.

71
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,500
Okay, bye.

72
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,208
How many revisions have they asked for?
They still want more?

73
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,541
Be quick. Come on.

74
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,125
Did you hear that?
Squeeze in a two-second promo at the end.

75
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,750
- Relax.
- I'm sending you the narration.

76
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,250
"Great deal for pretty moms!
Join us now to get gifts

77
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,333
delivered to you.
Take care of your baby now!"

78
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,208
Shit, better squeeze it in two seconds.

79
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,666
<i>Changing diapers</i>

80
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,166
<i>Brings happiness and laughter</i>

81
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,583
<i>We've all seen diaper commercials</i>

82
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,833
<i>where babies never cry,</i>

83
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:05,333
<i>they're always smiling like angels,</i>
<i>making everything look easy.</i>

84
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,666
<i>But reality</i>

85
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,666
<i>is the complete opposite.</i>

86
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,083
Damn.

87
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:20,791
Damn.

88
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,166
<i>Loving moms! Join us for a gift!</i>
<i>Give your baby the best care!</i>

89
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,250
Damn. She said it in two sentences.
You can't understand a word of it.

90
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,083
Is this a good idea?

91
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,000
It's okay.

92
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,708
Do what the client asks.
Just don't let people know we edited this.

93
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,333
Here comes your daddy!

94
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,416
Hey, guys. Food delivery.

95
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
Put it over there.

96
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,916
Why isn't A-Nan here yet?

97
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,666
He said he arrived an hour ago.

98
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,166
Is he going for a ring?

99
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,333
I think there's a good chance
he'll propose.

100
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,791
I told him I won't get married
for the kids.

101
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,333
Marriage is meant to be
for a lifetime together.

102
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,833
You can have children
without having a husband.

103
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,791
Marriage is complicated.
Divorce is even more so.

104
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,791
It's not that complicated.

105
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,583
I used to work at divorce court.

106
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,583
It takes ten minutes to divorce.
It's quick.

107
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,541
Relax.

108
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,833
Finally.

109
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,041
Honey.

110
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,333
Don't press on my belly.

111
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,833
Are you all right?

112
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,958
It hurts.

113
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,291
Don't worry.

114
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm here with you.

115
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,458
Are you okay?

116
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,833
Is the baby okay?

117
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,208
Daddy is here.

118
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,291
Daddy is here.

119
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,791
I need help.

120
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,208
First off, thank you.

121
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,458
I don't know what I'd do without you.

122
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,625
I'm so thankful for your wife.
I-ling did so much.

123
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:19,666
I appreciate that.

124
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,041
I-ling is his wife.

125
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,625
Are you Paul?

126
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,208
My name… is Xue-you.

127
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,250
I am Paul.

128
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,791
We had dinner earlier.

129
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,166
Yeah.

130
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,500
Are you divorced?

131
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,666
I…

132
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,541
Yes, I am divorced.

133
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,166
None of this matters. How can we help you?

134
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,333
Chill.

135
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,875
Take it easy.

136
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,625
- Chill.
- Sit down.

137
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,625
- Hold on. I can't breathe.
- It's okay.

138
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,750
- Sit down.
- I can't breathe.

139
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,541
It's all right…
Take a deep breath. Sit down.

140
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:25,166
Do you think I should propose now
or wait until after the baby's born?

141
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,375
Neither.

142
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,000
They seem to have guessed
you might propose.

143
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,666
Zero chance of success.

144
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,791
Why?

145
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,500
NaNa doesn't think having a baby
and having a husband are a package deal.

146
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,875
She only wants the baby, not you.

147
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,166
But don't worry. It's still your baby.

148
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,708
It's like… whether you choose one item
or the whole meal, it's still McDonald's.

149
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,125
It's different.

150
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,750
A guinea pig is not a pig.

151
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,875
Isn't it?

152
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,416
There's no moon in a moon pie.

153
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,916
How could moon pie have a moon?

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,458
- Pineapple cakes have no…
- Pineapple.

155
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,791
No.

156
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,166
I heard it's winter melon.

157
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,583
- Winter melon?
- Winter melon.

158
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,958
It doesn't matter.

159
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,833
You haven't talked about marriage?

160
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,208
I thought she was just joking.

161
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,041
If I propose sincerely,

162
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,000
she will accept, right?

163
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,875
If we don't get married,

164
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,166
father will be listed as "unknown"
on my son's ID card.

165
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,916
No, I know about this.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,833
- It's just left blank.
- Blank?

167
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,541
So anyone could write their name in.

168
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,625
A-Nan.

169
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,583
She's dilated four centimeters.

170
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,916
Four centimeters?

171
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,916
It can't have someone else's name
on it. Please.

172
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,250
Please.

173
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,875
Director.

174
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,250
Now what?

175
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,166
Exhale slowly.

176
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,208
Very good. Breathe now.

177
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,333
Inhale.

178
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,916
Exhale slowly.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,041
Come on.

180
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,208
Exhale slowly.

181
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,000
- One more time.
- Good.

182
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,166
The baby is born.

183
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,083
Go.

184
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,708
<i>Marry him… Marry him now</i>

185
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:35,125
<i>- Marry him… Happy every day</i>
- Good.

186
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,041
Now it's not zero chance,

187
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,208
it's negative 100.

188
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,125
Think again…

189
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,041
I got this one.

190
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,625
Add this…

191
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,041
MARRY HIM

192
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,375
<i>Marry him…marry him now</i>

193
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,625
<i>Marry him</i>

194
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,208
<i>Happy everyday</i>

195
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,541
- Super good.
- Super good, right?

196
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,375
Give me your phone. I'll make you one.

197
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,208
Can I say no?

198
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,041
Very good. I can see the baby's hair.

199
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:11,958
Inhale.

200
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,416
All right, exhale. Let him slide out.

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,333
Go.

202
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:16,875
Exhale.

203
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,000
Very good, here. Out he comes.

204
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,041
Is he okay?

205
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,875
He looks good.

206
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,125
Don't worry.

207
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:10,791
A-Nan.

208
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,708
Come here.

209
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,958
Now.

210
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,708
Come on.

211
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,583
Say "Marry me…"

212
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,083
"Marry me now."

213
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,458
YOU'RE AWESOME.

214
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,291
MARRY HIM.

215
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,166
Hold on…

216
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,166
This is a bear.

217
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,708
A-Nan is still crying.

218
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,458
Really?

219
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,500
Do you think he looks more like A-Nan
or NaNa?

220
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,250
NaNa.

221
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,500
He better not look like A-Nan.

222
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,208
If we have a baby, who do you think
it would resemble more?

223
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,125
Zeng Xue-you.

224
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,375
I'm not a good mom material.

225
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,125
I'm a bad influence.

226
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,625
I like to complain a lot.

227
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,375
I am rude and heartless.

228
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,208
You're not that bad.

229
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,291
I am.

230
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,416
Look at my brother.

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,875
He's already in his 20s.

232
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,458
He skips school and work.

233
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,333
He shuts himself in his room all day.

234
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,041
My mom even has to buy his food for him.

235
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,250
But that's not on you.

236
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,916
He doesn't like school.

237
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,083
He skipped so many classes
in middle school

238
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,666
and got expelled several times.

239
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,375
Every time, I had to send him back
because our parents were busy.

240
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,625
I helped him with schoolwork.

241
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,875
Every time, the teacher asked
if there was trouble at home,

242
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,291
or if something was going on.

243
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,166
But I didn't know how to answer.

244
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:40,916
Once,

245
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,583
I got so fed up

246
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,541
that I dragged him to school.

247
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,291
I literally dragged him

248
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,541
from our home to the street.

249
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,875
Many years later,

250
00:16:58,958 --> 00:16:59,958
I found out

251
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,916
he didn't like school

252
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,375
because he got bullied there.

253
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,583
His classmates poured

254
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,208
instant noodles on his head

255
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,833
and peed in his shoes.

256
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,250
He got bullied so badly at school,

257
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,791
and then by me at home.

258
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,333
I was such an idiot.

259
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,875
I had no idea what was going on.

260
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,833
I made him who he is,

261
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,875
shutting himself in his room every day.

262
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,583
If I become a mother,

263
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,416
I will definitely ruin
my child's life too.

264
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,125
Honey.

265
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,375
You were just a kid.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,750
Even the teacher had no idea.

267
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,000
How could you know?

268
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,375
Plus,

269
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,791
your brother wouldn't have

270
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,541
grown up at all without you.

271
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,916
You did nothing wrong.

272
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,125
You are the best.

273
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,708
Don't feel sad.

274
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,541
What's wrong?

275
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,875
Okay. Don't cry…

276
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,500
- It looks like he peed.
- Really?

277
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,416
- Don't cry.
- Change his diaper.

278
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,666
Don't cry.

279
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,208
Can I give it a try?

280
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,291
Are you sure?

281
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,291
Teach me.

282
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,291
Open this.

283
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,000
- Okay.
- Don't cry.

284
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:27,958
Here.

285
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,791
<i>It suddenly struck me that…</i>

286
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,875
<i>if you have a helpful partner,</i>

287
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,333
<i>maybe having a baby isn't such a bad idea.</i>

288
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,625
<i>A baby</i>

289
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,333
<i>Brings happiness and laughter</i>

290
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,333
Did you hear that?

291
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,750
What?

292
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,250
Someone singing.

293
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,416
No.

294
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,791
<i>A baby</i>

295
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,375
<i>Brings joy everyday</i>

296
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,625
<i>I-ling.</i>

297
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,291
<i>I-ling.</i>

298
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,000
<i>I-ling.</i>

299
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:39,958
<i>Hey.</i>

300
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,750
<i>I am down here.</i>

301
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,208
What the hell?

302
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,666
<i>I am not a ghost.</i>

303
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,083
<i>I am your womb.</i>

304
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,333
What the hell?

305
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,291
What?

306
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,333
What?

307
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,708
What? Don't scare me. What?
