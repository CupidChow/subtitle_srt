1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,910
Hello.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,580
It suddenly became really cold.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,750
It's the last cold snap.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,060
- Hello. - Hello.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,060
Hello.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,460
We are doing the shoot here today. We were here before.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,470
- Hello. - Hello.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,270
- Hello. - Hello.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,940
- Hey, Food Fighter. - Yes? No.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,170
- Hello. - Hello.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,210
Okay!

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,270
- Hello. - Hello.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,040
Hey, this looks just the same.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,110
Oh, this is nice.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,080
- Hey, Jong Kook. - What?

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,680
What's with you?

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
What's with you?

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,150
- People shouldn't change. - I was told to wear this.

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,390
- Look at him. - It's pretty.

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,760
- You look good. - This isn't what you do.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,390
You're trying to change your identity.

22
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,930
I'm not trying to change my identity.

23
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,930
You want to get rid of your identity as Bag Man.

24
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,160
- I was told to wear this. - Look at you.

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,560
- You... - That's why I'm wearing it.

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,930
- It's colorful. - Look at this.

27
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,070
He matched the colors.

28
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,470
- My goodness. - Hey.

29
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,670
- My goodness. What's that? - Look at his shoes.

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,770
- What? - It's amazing.

31
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,140
- You should wear this. It's nice. - It's pretty.

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,410
- I don't want to. - Why not? It's pretty.

33
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,280
- It's pretty. - You feel uncomfortable, right?

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,650
This is killing me.

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,150
- It's pretty though. - I want to get changed.

36
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,780
- You know what? - What?

37
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,080
Ye Eun got Ulthera treatment.

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,320
- Ulthera. - Why would you tell them?

39
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,890
But your charm comes from your double chin!

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,730
My skin needed to get tightened up.

41
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,160
- Why? - You don't have to.

42
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,660
- Why would you do that already? - It's tight already.

43
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,070
You should lose weight instead.

44
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,870
Why would you say that?

45
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,840
Why would you say that?

46
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,870
- Sorry. - She's upset.

47
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,840
She gets mad whenever she's told to lose weight.

48
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
- Right. - Let's not say that.

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,550
- Right. Let's not do that. - When I'm told to lose weight.

50
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,280
- I love your double chin. - Yes.

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,420
- And Ji Hyo... - By the way,

52
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,250
isn't Haha's back hair annoying?

53
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,290
- It's too... - Hey.

54
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,690
- I don't like it. - When did you...

55
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,690
- What is this? - It's not like that.

56
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,960
Isn't that Ahn Jung Hwan's hairstyle?

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,130
- It's not annoying. - Why are you being like this?

58
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,760
There's this hairstyle that I'm planning.

59
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,430
Are you trying to copy me after seeing my back hair?

60
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,940
- Why would I copy you? - He's trying to copy me.

61
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,370
- And you... - And the hat is too tight for you.

62
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,540
- The hat is too tight. - I agree.

63
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,040
I know it leaves a line on my forehead like this.

64
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,150
- Your blood is not circulating. - Hey.

65
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,280
- Gosh, it feels a lot better. - That's too bad.

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
- He copies him. - Whatever.

67
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,490
Do you think it will make you a nation's beloved MC?

68
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,150
- A beloved MC? - Is that it?

69
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,520
- By growing the back hair? - Hey, he's...

70
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,960
- By growing the back hair? - What are you talking about?

71
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,260
- Oh, dear. - That's funny.

72
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,960
It's already been a year...

73
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,870
since the last TV rating notice shoot.

74
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,170
Now that we have Ye Eun, we should do it again.

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,240
Running Man is...

76
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,740
- suitable for 15 or older. - suitable for 15 or older.

77
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,380
Now that we have Ye Eun, we should do it again.

78
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,110
Today, to celebrate the upcoming spring of 2025,

79
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,780
we will shoot the new TV rating notice...

80
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,220
with the Going Up the TV Rating Notice Race.

81
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,080
- Going Up the TV Rating Notice? - Yes.

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,720
- What's that? - The new TV rating notice will...

83
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,460
take place in the mountains to welcome spring.

84
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
- Mountains? - Mountains?

85
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,360
It will take place in the mountains.

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,390
- Mountains? - Mountains?

87
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,460
- Mountains? But... - It's cold now.

88
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,860
- It snowed yesterday. - There was a snowstorm.

89
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,470
The starting height of the shoot...

90
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,040
is 100m above sea level.

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,070
- Is it 100m? That's not bad. - It's 100m.

92
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,070
For your information, Mount Inwang is 338m.

93
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,580
Going up Mount Inwang is tough.

94
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,210
And Mount Bukhan is 835.6m.

95
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,780
Mount Bukhan will kill you.

96
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,650
However, every time you spend money...

97
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,650
on the TV rating notice shoot,

98
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,420
the height of the filming location will go up.

99
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,390
For every 50 dollars, it will increase by 10m.

100
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,090
- For every 50 dollars? - By 10m for every 50 dollars?

101
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,900
Yes. If you spend 1,000 dollars, it will increase by 200m.

102
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,260
We shouldn't spend much money.

103
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,570
I have nothing to spend money on.

104
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,140
Since the shoot takes place two weeks before the airdate,

105
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,970
- flowers have not yet bloomed. - It's the last cold snap.

106
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,670
- Right. - It suddenly became cold.

107
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,480
So we will go to a flower market and buy some flowers...

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,550
to use for the TV rating notice.

109
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,780
- I love flowers. - For the shoot?

110
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,410
- Real flowers? - We will decide the money...

111
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,850
to spend on flowers through a mission.

112
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,120
- Okay. - I'll tell you...

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,790
about the first mission.

114
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,160
This mission is Time Is Money Quiz.

115
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,360
Time is money!

116
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,200
Time is money!

117
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,470
- Time is money. - Right.

118
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,170
Those who answer the quiz correctly...

119
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,140
will escape to the Answer Zone.

120
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,770
You will succeed...

121
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,370
- once all seven of you escape. - Okay.

122
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,110
The difficulty of the quiz changes...

123
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,680
depending on the number of remaining members.

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
For example, since all seven of you need to answer now,

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,320
the most difficult quiz will be given.

126
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,580
As the number of remaining members decreases,

127
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,280
the quiz will be easier.

128
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,790
- That's nice. - If you want...

129
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,460
to change the question, you can say "Pass."

130
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,660
In that case, the amount of money to spend on flowers...

131
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,160
- will increase by 50 dollars. - No.

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
It keeps going up.

133
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
- It's 10m per 50 dollars. - It's 10m.

134
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,400
For your information, until all of you escape,

135
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,370
coffee will be served to you and the production crew.

136
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,810
- Coffee? - Yes. And the cost of coffee...

137
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,780
- will be reflected in the height... - No.

138
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,110
of the mountain you will climb.

139
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,740
- It's all about money. - How much is the coffee?

140
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,050
Why would the cost of coffee be reflected in the height?

141
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,880
- I'm not drinking coffee. - Why is that?

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,580
Why are you spending so much money these days?

143
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,520
- I don't want coffee. - Why are you being like this?

144
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
They're spending a lot of money...

145
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,390
- to stimulate the economy. - Seriously...

146
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,820
We have a lot of people in the production crew.

147
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,890
- Some people don't like caffeine. - This is too much.

148
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,860
You can't take it home.

149
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,760
By the way, how much is a cup of coffee?

150
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,960
It's 5.5 dollars.

151
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,730
- It's too expensive. - What?

152
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,840
- It's 5.5 dollars. - Why is it so expensive?

153
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,970
They will keep making coffee...

154
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,470
for you and the production crew.

155
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,510
They will stop making it...

156
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,180
- once all seven of you escape. - Okay.

157
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,720
We have seven members now, so I will give you...

158
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,750
- the most difficult question. - The difficult one.

159
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,290
- Let's begin. - Okay.

160
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,260
- Don't get it right too fast. - Okay. You should try first.

161
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,560
I'll give you a question.

162
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,960
This is a type of consumption where you customize items...

163
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,130
to suit your personal taste.

164
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,470
It reflects the desire to buy what others buy...

165
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,140
while wanting to differentiate yourself from others.

166
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,900
What is this this term?

167
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,170
- You know it, right? - Is it a subjective question?

168
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,370
Please say that again.

169
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,610
Please speak slowly.

170
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,410
You're speaking too fast.

171
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,810
Customize?

172
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,480
Isn't it called customizing?

173
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,380
You want to buy what others buy, but at the same time...

174
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,690
You want something special.

175
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,190
- Something unique that only I have. - Only me.

176
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,350
- Exactly. - Something that only I have.

177
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,490
Companies have been using a lot of personalization strategies,

178
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,760
- calling it customization. - Yes.

179
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,730
The trend has been named the topping economy.

180
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,430
- What is it? - I can't say anything.

181
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,970
This is difficult.

182
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,640
So what's Option One?

183
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,870
- Option One. - Is it a multiple-choice question?

184
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,680
I'll give you a hint. It's called the "blank" economy.

185
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,010
- I see. - It's a four-syllable word.

186
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,180
- "Blank" economy? - Yes.

187
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,680
If we get it wrong, will the height increase?

188
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,950
- No. - Is it okay to get it wrong?

189
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,120
- Really? - It doesn't increase the height?

190
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Then we should say something.

191
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,090
We're just supposed to save time.

192
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,890
Just hurry and say anything.

193
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,990
Just say anything.

194
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,390
Imitating competition.

195
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,490
- Come on. - I just...

196
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,160
- I'm just saying anything. - What was that?

197
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,230
- Imitating competition. - I'm competing too.

198
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,600
- Competing alone. - "Competing alone?"

199
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,330
- Daily economy. - "Daily economy?"

200
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,700
- Hey. - Daily?

201
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,440
- What did you say? - It's the name of a newspaper.

202
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,540
- Daily Economy. - Daily Economy.

203
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,970
"Blank" economy?

204
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,310
It must be an English word.

205
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,110
- It must be an English word. - I think...

206
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,580
- It must be English. - I'm sure there's something.

207
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,680
Gosh, this is...

208
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,220
- It's difficult. - I think...

209
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,280
it's something I know, but I can't think of anything.

210
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,320
It's too difficult.

211
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,550
Why don't we pass and add 50 dollars?

212
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,420
Let's do that. Here's the thing.

213
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,590
As time passes, they're making more coffee.

214
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,690
Mutual economy.

215
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,960
- Let's pass it up. - Just say anything.

216
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,490
- Just anything. - Pass.

217
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,830
- Is it English? - You passed.

218
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,100
It's an English word. The answer is...

219
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,130
topping economy.

220
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,330
- That was easy. - Topping?

221
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,700
- Topping. - Topping.

222
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,670
- Like pizza topping. - Exactly. You add what you like.

223
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,670
Topping.

224
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,410
- I didn't know. - Like how you add toppings?

225
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,710
- I heard that a lot. - I've never heard of it.

226
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,880
Topping economy.

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,750
It's like how you add your favorite pizza toppings.

228
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,320
- That's it. - So an extra 50 dollars is added.

229
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,280
Okay. Topping economy.

230
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,490
Buying 10 cups of coffee costs 50 dollars.

231
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,960
- Right. - Topping.

232
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,160
Is the coffee coming?

233
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,530
I don't think it's a lot. That's why...

234
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,760
Can I order something other than coffee?

235
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,730
Once you place an order, they will make it...

236
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,130
- while you answer the quiz. - Really?

237
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,700
- All right then. - I want some bread.

238
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,840
We should eat something.

239
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,940
- Let's eat. - One for each.

240
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,110
- Let's hurry. - Please show us the menu.

241
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,540
- We should hurry. - The money will be added...

242
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,510
- to our height anyway. - That's true.

243
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,550
The more you spend,

244
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,710
- the higher it gets. - Okay.

245
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,910
- Nice. - The menu...

246
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,880
Have some coffee.

247
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,120
Go ahead and take it.

248
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,890
I should give it to Chan Hee.

249
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,090
I want hot coffee.

250
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,730
Come on.

251
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,130
I can't drink something cold.

252
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,600
You can't drink something cold?

253
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,640
- What do you want? - I'll just have coffee.

254
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,900
I want a cafe latte. What about you?

255
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,210
I'll have peppermint tea.

256
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,910
We will have your drinks ready here.

257
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,940
Only those who gave the correct answer can drink it.

258
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,120
- There's more? - I'll have chocolate.

259
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,390
- We have to hurry. - Hey.

260
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,490
- Let's hurry. - This is like a coffee factory.

261
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,720
- Just order anything. - Hurry.

262
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,860
- Hurry. We got more coffee. - Hurry.

263
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,030
- Okay. - We got more coffee.

264
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,230
- Why does it keep coming? - We can't drink it...

265
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,760
- before we get it right. - I'll have a chocolate latte.

266
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,600
- Chocolate latte. - That's enough.

267
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
- I'll have an iced vanilla latte. - I'll have a cafe latte.

268
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,470
We keep getting more coffee.

269
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,400
- Do they have a corn scone? - Hurry and sit.

270
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,800
- Come on. - Coffee.

271
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,810
Why are they making coffee so quickly?

272
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,910
A lot of time has passed. Okay.

273
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,710
Please give us the question.

274
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,410
- I'll give you the question. - Okay.

275
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,320
What is the first encyclopedia of marine life in Korea...

276
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
that Silhak scholar Jeong Yak Jeon of the Joseon Dynasty wrote...

277
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,590
while he was exiled to Heuksan Island?

278
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,890
Let me answer!

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,020

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,510
He's so sexy.

- Nice. - He's smart.

293
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,420
- It's like the rise of status. - It's just "Jasaneobo."

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,020
- He nailed it. - My gosh.

295

That's not it.

303
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,670
We did this before.

304
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,770

305
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,210

- we would've been the top students. - My goodness.

344
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,220
The top students.

345
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,390
Pretend that you knew.

346
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,290

350
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,130
What are the four great ancient civilizations in the world?

351
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,460
- Let me answer. - Okay.

352
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,770
Pyramid.

353
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,570
Pyramid.

354
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,670
That's not it.

355
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,970
Isn't it a mystery?

356
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,810
- Civilizations. - Civilizations.

357
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,640
- Civilizations. - Ancient Egypt! Is that it?

358
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,110
- That's it. - Hang on.

359
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,710
Hang on a second.

360
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,120
- Civilizations. - Ancient Egypt! Is that it?

361
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,020
Hang on a second.

362
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,220
I think I know. Hang on.

363
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,690
- Let me answer. - Wait.

364
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,960
- Gosh. - Egypt.

365
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,530
The United Arab Emirates? That can't be it.

366
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,560
- Arabia. - Arabia?

367
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,970
- No. - This is crazy. How should we...

368
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Let me answer.

369
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,170
Well... Egypt.

370
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
Amazon.

371
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,940
Isn't that it?

372
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,170
Egypt. Ganges.

373
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,740
- The Ganges? - Ganges.

374
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,840
Ganges? Isn't that it?

375
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,550
- Just pass. - Pass.

376
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,710
Pass. What's the answer?

377
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,680
Mesopotamia, Indus Valley,

378
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,350
- Egypt, Yellow River of China. - Right.

379
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,620
I knew Egypt.

380
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,820
- Did you see how good I am? - Let's go.

381
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,490
Stop passing things up.

382
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,260
You have to buy flowers...

383
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,960
- worth 100 dollars. - Okay.

384
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,730
- Hurry and give us the question. - Flowers.

385
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,230
What was the first Korean novel in Classical Chinese...

386
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,400
- written by Kim Si Seup? - Who?

387
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
- Kim Si Seup? - Kim Si Seup.

388
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,870
- Written by Kim Si Seup. - Si Seup?

389
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,770
What was the first Korean novel in Classical Chinese?

390
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,940
- In Classical Chinese? - In Classical Chinese?

391
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,570
The first Korean novel written in Korean...

392
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,210
- Right. - is "The Tale of Hong Gil Dong."

393
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,910
- What is the answer then? - Let me answer.

394
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,510
- "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." - No.

395
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,980
- Seriously... - That's...

396
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,450
- Hey. - That's not a Korean novel.

397
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,550
- A novel? - That's not a Korean novel.

398
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,580
A Korean novel?

399
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,650
I have no idea.

400
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,620
Why does it keep coming?

401
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,390
Why is there so much coffee?

402
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,860
- Just say anything. - A novel?

403
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,260
- Come on! - Hey!

404
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,300
I'm sorry. This is hard.

405
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,240
- You should pay for it. - What do we do?

406
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,140
This is serious.

407
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,840
- The one you spilled... - It's five dollars.

408
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,910
My goodness.

409
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,310
Hey, time is ticking!

410
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,880
- We will clean it up. - Okay.

411
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,640
Seriously, you're a troublemaker.

412
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,810
I spilled it.

413
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,250
Is it something we know?

414
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,680
You will remember it once you hear it.

415
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,750
- Chinese? - Yes.

416
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,450
- It can't be "A Better Tomorrow." - It's a four-syllable word.

417
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,720
"A Better Tomorrow."

418
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,850
A four-syllable word.

419
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,420
Let me answer. "Myungeuibogam."

420
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,320
- That can't be it. - Then...

421
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,660
This is driving me crazy.

422
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,390
- Hey. - "Heungboo and Nolboo?"

423
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,660
"Heungboo and Nolboo?"

424
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,260
- My gosh. - "Heungboojeon!"

425
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,900
- "Kongjwi and Patjwi." - There's a lot.

426
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,200
"Simcheongjeon."

427
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,900
Let's pass.

428
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,170
- No. We should get it right. - Just say anything.

429
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,870
- That must be it! - Hey.

430
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,370
- I get it. - Yi Sun Sin?

431
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,510
No, that must be it.

432
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,780
He got it.

433
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,980
- The thing. - Annals?

434
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,250
What's that thing?

435
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,280
The one with Sun Wukong.

436
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,780
- What? - Yi Sun Sin?

437
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,220
- That's not it. - No?

438
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,450
- That's a Chinese novel. - Sun Wukong is...

439
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,790
Hey!

440
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,820
- Pass. - Pass.

441
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,120
- Pass. - What's the answer?

442
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,330
It's "Geumosinhwa."

443
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,090
- I've never heard of it. - I didn't know.

444
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,430
It's "Geumosinhwa."

445
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,960
- I've never heard of it. - I didn't know.

446
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,200
- I had no idea. - I don't know.

447
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,170
- I've never heard of it before. - Me neither.

448
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,600
It's 150 dollars in total.

449
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,400
- You could've got it right. - All right.

450
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,610
He is the Korean linguist and independence activist who wrote...

451
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,910
"The Grammar of the National Language..."

452
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,240
and "Sounds of the Language..."

453
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,980
- during the time of enlightenment. - All right.

454
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,480
In the popularization and modernization of Hangul...

455
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,180
Why are you laughing?

456
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,520
Don't laugh. Keep reading it.

457
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,180
- Why are you laughing? - Don't laugh. Keep reading it.

458
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,850
Who is this person who played a pioneering role...

459
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,150
in the popularization and modernization...

460
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,390
- of Hangul? - Let me answer.

461
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,960
- Kim Koo. - No.

00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,890

Ahn Eak Tai.

466
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,170
You know a lot of people.

467
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,870
There's a K-pop singer...

468
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,840
with a smiliar name.

469
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,870
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

470
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,610

- Let me answer. - Let me answer. Jeon Yeong Rok.

474
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,680
No.

475
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
Let me answer. Byun Jin Sub.

476
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,520
- All right. - Oh, no.

477
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,190
Jeon Yeong Rok?

478
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,820
- I'd be nice - Let me answer.

479
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,090
It's been one minute.

480
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,660
Let me answer. Sung Si Kyung.

481
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,490
Geum Si Kyung.

482
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,830
- Sung Si Kyung. - Geum Si Kyung.

483
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,970
What's with the hint?

484
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,170
I mean, that's...

485
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,480
- You know a lot of people. - Ju Si Gyeong.

486
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
You know a lot, though.

487
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,010
Ju Si Gyeong.

488
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,120
Jae Seok, for giving her the answer,

489
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,850
you'll participate in the game again.

490
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,320
I never did such a thing!

491
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,150
- Why would you look at her? - No one gave her the answer.

492
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,020
- I didn't do that. - He didn't.

493
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,060
I could see your lips moving from the side.

494
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,890
His mouth sticks out naturally.

495
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,560
- Jae Seok... - You saw my lips moving?

496
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,400
That's absurd!

497
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
That's absurd.

498
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,470
Anyway, this one's for you.

499
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,770
How can you not know Ju Si Gyeong?

500
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,970
- What a bummer. - I'm sorry.

501
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,010
We wouldn't have gotten it.

502
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,540
How can you not know Ju Si Gyeong?

503
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,280
- We'll repent. - Yes, we'll repent.

504
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,450
Jae Seok will soon be back, so don't worry.

505
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,480
Here's your question.

506
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,520
What ancient legal code is famous for the principle...

507
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,390
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth?"

508
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,750
- Ancient? - Let me answer.

509
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,960
The Code of Hammurabi.

510
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,390
- What? - How is he this smart?

511
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,190
- What... - The Code of Hammurabi.

512
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,830
- What was that? - Seriously?

513
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,970
- Jae Seok, come on. - Who else would've guessed that?

514
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,270
Ammurabi?

515
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,570
No, the Code of Hammurabi.

516
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,540
- Hammurabi. - Right, Hammurabi.

517
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,210
- How could we have gotten that? - But...

518
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,740
Will you keep making us look pathetic?

519
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,580
- Lower the level for us. - It's too difficult.

520
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,150
How about a Chinese idiom?

521
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,980
- Good. - What does "anbinnakdo" mean?

522
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,310
- What? - Anbinnakdo?

523
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,580
Why would you give us a Chinese idiom?

524
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,280
- What does "anbinnakdo" mean? - Yes.

525
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,320
- Do we have to tell you? - Yes.

526
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,390
- Anbinnakdo? - You should guess.

527
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,220
Sparkling eyes.

528
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,930
While dropping...

529
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,630
- A Chinese idiom. - A stone drops.

530
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,230
- Did you say a stone drops? - Something dropped?

531
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,270
- Ye Eun, you should guess this. - Anbinnakdo.

532
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,340
- Exactly. - So...

533
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,540
The poverty-stricken are happy.

534
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,180
Money isn't everything.

535
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,550
What we feel inside is more important.

536
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,020
Does it mean to be happy...

537
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,880
even without money?

538
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,550
- That was similar. - Nice.

539
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,320
- No way. - Good job.

540
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,960
"Bin" must mean to be poverty-stricken.

541
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Thank you.

542
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,300
- Nice. - Unbelievable.

543
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,630
I didn't think I'd rank fourth.

544
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,830
Right, here's your question.

545
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,170
The chemical formula of carbon dioxide is CO2...

546
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,770
while the one for oxygen is O2.

547
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,740
- What's the formula for water? - Let me answer!

548
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,840
It's H2O.

549
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,510
- Nice. - Good.

550
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,740
- I knew it. - We're left with those two.

551
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,480
We're left with those two.

552
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,410
- I knew that one. - Ji Hyo,

553
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,950
you and I are the same.

554
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,320
I can't believe this.

555
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,250
This is a printed text on a scroll found in...

556
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,160
the Three-Story Stone Pagoda at Bulguksa.

557
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,390
It is considered as the oldest woodblock print...

558
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,860
- We learned this. - in the world.

559
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,260
- Tripitaka Koreana. - You learned this.

560
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,060
You learned this.

561
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,400
Ji Hyo learned this.

562
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,730
You learned this. Ji Hyo learned this.

563
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,000
It is the best woodblock print.

564
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,070
The Great...

565
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,100
- Dharani Sutra. - Dharani Sutra.

566
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,770
- The Great Dharani Sutra. - The Great Dharani Sutra.

567
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,340
- The Great Dharani Sutra. - The Great Dharani Sutra.

568
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,650
The Great Dharani...

569
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,020
- No way. - The Great...

570
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,690
The Great Dharani.

571
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,050
That's not it.

572
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,290
That's not it.

573
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,360
- Say it slower. - Check how it ends.

574
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,590
The Great Stone Dharani.

575
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,230
The Great Complacent.

576
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,800
Complacent.

577
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,840
You two are amazing.

578
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,010
- I'm amazed. - I'm truly amazed.

579
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,420
It's the Great something Dharani.

580
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,820
- It's not. - You....

581
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,520
- Add something at the end. - Add something at the end.

582
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,990
- There's a syllable missing. - You're almost there.

583
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,020
Add something at the end.

584
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
- There's a syllable missing. - You're almost there.

585
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,960
The Great Dharani Board.

586
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,260
The Great Dharani Board.

587
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,600
- No. - Come on.

588
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
- The Great Dharani Sutra. - There!

589
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,570
Ye Eun, I can't believe it.

590
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,040
That was witty of you.

591
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,440
Hey! I gave you that answer!

592
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,540
- Ji Hyo, thanks. - Ji Hyo almost had it.

593
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,810
Thanks, Ji Hyo.

594
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,350
- I can't believe you remembered. - See? I remembered.

595
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,750
- The Great Dharani. - I'm proud.

596
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,490
I only remembered that and not "Sutra" at the end.

597
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,820
She's still young.

598
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,120
- Yes, she is. - The Great Dharani Sutra.

599
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,220
Here's your question.

600
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,890
In the novel "A Lucky Day,"

601
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,690
what does the protagonist Kim do for a living?

602
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,900
Let me answer. He's a taxi driver.

603
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,730
Let me answer. He's a taxi driver.

604
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,770
- A taxi driver? - Consider the period.

605
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,700
Oh, right. He worked in an office.

606
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,710
Ji Hyo, come on. "Cheomji" was a term used...

607
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,010
- very long ago. - I get it.

608
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,750
It's not the movie I recently saw?

609
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,080
She said he was a taxi driver without even hesitating.

610
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,880
She didn't even hesitate. Think, will you?

611
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,790
- Ji Hyo, come on. - Think, darn it!

612
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,050
- You're admirable. - Unbelievable.

613
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,690
- My gosh. - Pass, if you must.

614
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,420
- Pass. - Okay, pass.

615
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,890
- That's another 50 dollars. - That's another 50 dollars.

616
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,600
You need to buy 200 dollars' worth of flowers.

617
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,560
- We'll be going up 200m. - What was the answer?

618
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,470
He was a rickshaw-porter.

619
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,030
- That was a tough one. - That was tough.

620
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,700
I had no idea.

621
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,670
Here's your question.

622
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,410
What's the meaning of Hongik Ingan,

623
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,280
the founding principle of Gojoseon?

624
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,880
- She knows this. - She probably knows this.

625
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,480
What's the meaning of Hongik Ingan?

626
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,880
- She knows this. - She probably knows this.

627
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,080
Goodness.

628
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,550
Goodness.

629
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,190
- Don't kid us. - Hongik Ingan.

630
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,460
Red human.

631
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,700
- Red? - Just pass!

632
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,330
- Stop it. - Please.

633
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,930
- Stop! - Save Ji Hyo's reputation.

634
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,900
- "Hong" means "broadly." - Stop!

635
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,400
Guess what the first two syllables mean.

636
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,810
To benefit decent human beings.

637
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,940
Benefiting broader humans.

638
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,210
You're almost there.

639
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,080
Benefiting deeper humans?

640
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,280
Benefiting taller humans?

641
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,750
- Broad. - Benefiting broader humans!

642
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,120
Can you let me at least sit with her?

643
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,020
She looks too lonely.

644
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,260
- Yes, sit with her. - Ji Hyo...

645
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
A few should join me.

646
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,800
You should've gotten the Great Dharani Sutra right.

647
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,970
- Exactly. I got that one! - We'll sit here with her.

648
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,470
- We'll only sit here. - I almost had it.

649
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,370
- Say it all. - Right.

650
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,510
Ji Hyo!

651
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,840
To broadly benefit the human world.

652
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,980
- That's the one. - Yes!

653
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,480
We gave her strength by sitting with her.

654
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,520
- That's the one. - Yes!

655
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,720
We gave her strength by sitting with her.

656
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,450
That'll be the end.

657
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,790
Copy Economy. Let me answer.

658
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,860
Pyramid.

659
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,060
The Great Complacent.

660
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,200
Red human.

661
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,200
- Have some. - How much you owe...

662
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,340
- What are we at? - for the coffee is...

663
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,710
With the seven of you now on the sideline,

664
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,850
- How much is it? - you owe 350 dollars.

665
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,180
- Whatever. Pass. - You passed five times...

666
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,720
- What? - which is 250 dollars for flowers.

667
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,690
You went up 120m from 100m...

668
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,360
- which brought you to 220m. - What?

669
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,230
- That's where you'll be filming. - Did you say 220m?

670
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,100
- We're hiking. - What do we do?

671
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,400
How could a coffee order be 300 dollars?

672
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,170
- That's harsh. - Now,

673
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,270
you'll head out to buy 250 dollars' worth of flowers.

674
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,810
- Let's go. - Okay!

675
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,710
I should buy some flowers.

676
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,840
- That was hilarious. - What a blast.

677
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,280
We're at a flower shop.

678
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,750
- Flowers. - This could be better.

679
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,080
I smell flowers!

680
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,350
- Gosh, I smell flowers. - This is pretty.

681
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,850
This is pretty too. Right?

682
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,150
- I should buy something yellow. - This is pretty too.

683
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,420
A red rose.

684
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,620
Our budget of 250 dollars won't be enough.

685
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,560
A flower market. Gosh, the smell!

686
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,460
- The scent of flowers. - Check out the smell.

687
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,130
- I smell fresh flowers. - The aroma of flowers.

688
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,570
How pretty is the smell of flowers?

689
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,970
It's tasty.

690
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,540
We should buy some flowers.

691
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,140
- The flowers. - They smell incredible.

692
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,870
Maybe I should buy some flowers.

693
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,510
The scent of flowers has the baby car roaming around

694
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,750
This is where you'll buy flowers.

695
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,310
Welcome to the flower market.

696
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,080
The amount of flowers you must buy...

697
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,490
- is 250 dollars' worth. - Yes, 250 dollars.

698
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,690
What are the flowers for?

699
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,090
- Up on the mountain... - Will we plant them?

700
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,890
- No, it's for our photo. - We'll be holding them.

701
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,090
- It's spring. - They haven't bloomed yet.

702
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,530
This isn't Arbor Day.

703
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,100
- Won't we plant them? - We'll be holding them.

704
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,500
We can hold them and place them in trees.

705
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,170
This is for the rating notice.

706
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,970
You must have it embody...

707
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,840
- the energy of spring. - It must embody spring.

708
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,170
It doesn't feel like spring just yet.

709
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,140
Jong Kook and I love flowers.

710
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,610
That's right. I always take photos of flowers.

711
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,710
Why am I so into flowers these days?

712
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,310
- Flowers are amazing. So beautiful. - Right?

713
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,150
- They look incredible in photos. - Exactly.

714
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,250
- Let's go for now. - Yes, let's go.

715
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,590
- Buy 250 dollars' worth. - Okay!

716
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,720
Why I hate it is...

717
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,420
- I smell flowers. - They smell incredible.

718
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,520
This is great.

719
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,160
- Check this out. - Unbelievable.

720
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,630
Look at that rich color.

721
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,290
Imagine buying this.

722
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,830
These are incredible.

723
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,700
- This is pretty too. - They're so pretty.

724
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,430
They smell amazing.

725
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,970
- It's spring. - Hello.

726
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,870
I love these pink flowers.

727
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,340
- Pink? - Aren't they pretty? Look.

728
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,870
This is pretty too.

729
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,040
This is also pretty.

730
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,510
Hello. Gosh, everything is pretty.

731
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,250
These are the roses I love.

732
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,250
So?

733
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,480
So?

734
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,990
So? Who asked?

735
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,490
What? I won't get you anything.

736
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,360
- Hold on, guys. - Yes?

737
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,860
- We have to hold the flowers. - Right.

738
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,390
For it to be spring,

739
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,860
- we need flowers all around us. - Right.

740
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,730
Let's get a bundle of flowers that we each like.

741
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,030
- That we each like? - Yes.

742
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,770
How much can we spend per person?

743
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,270
It's about 35 dollars per person.

744
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,070
- Yes, 35 dollars per person. - Sure.

745
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,580
It'll cost more if you request a bouquet.

746
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,180
Rather than what's fully bloomed...

747
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,650
- Don't touch fresh flowers. - That's the rule.

748
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,150
- Exactly. One that hasn't bloomed. - This one's pretty.

749
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,220
- That's the rule. - When you place it in your vase,

750
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,680
- it'll bloom. That's right. - Right.

751
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,620
Will you be placing yours in a plastic bag?

752
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,920
Ma'am!

753
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,860
- No, a vase. - Is this for sale?

754
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,830
I'm sure there will be something pretty but unique.

755
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,900
- Unique but pretty. - This one's adorable.

756
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,200
It's round. What a surprise.

757
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,330
What on earth is that?

758
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,570
- What's that flower? - Hydrangea.

759
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,140
- Is that hydrangea? - Yes.

760
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,170
- Are there ones this small? - Yes.

761
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,110
To be honest, I'm clueless.

762
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,840
- Aren't these hydrangeas? - What?

763
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,280
Are these hydrangeas? You're right.

764
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,010
- Yes, they're hydrangeas. - How do you know that?

765
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,150
What do you mean how do I know? Gosh.

766
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,790
She said these were hydrangeas. Aren't these microphones?

767
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,260
What are these round flowers called?

768
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,820
- They're pompons. - What?

769
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,530
- Pongpong. - They're called pongpongs?

770
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,130
- They look like pongpongs. - They look like their name.

771
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,130
They're cute.

772
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,970
- How much are these per flower? - This is what I want the most.

773
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,630
One bunch of 10 flowers costs 7 dollars.

774
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,400
- Seven dollars? - They're lovely and perfect for me.

775
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,970
- Hold them like this. - Don't they suit my outfit?

776
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,670
- You look quite... - It's pretty, right?

777
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,010
- It suits you. - I want them so much.

778
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,910
- We're not here to... - What?

779
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,040
I can hold them like this.

780
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,650
It's not about you looking nice.

781
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,380
We're not shopping so you can stand out.

782
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,220
- That's pretty. - We want to look spring bright.

783
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,120
- We're filming the rating notice. - They're pretty.

784
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,590
- Let's think about... - My...

785
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,020
- We want lots of flowers. - Okay.

786
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,160
Jae Seok. It's prettiest when you have just this many.

787
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,900
It's not as pretty if there are too many.

788
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,360
It's not about how pretty you look.

789
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,970
It's not pretty.

790
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,170
How you look... You want to look like G-DRAGON.

791
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,770
- That's not my goal. - You want to...

792
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,070
- No. Just this much. - G-DRAGON...

793
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,540
Just a small pinch. They're so pretty.

794
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,850
- How will you carry that? - That's pretty.

795
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,750
- It's pretty. A simple look. - Simple and elegant.

796
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,480
- These are pretty. - We can all hold some.

797
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
Yes, these.

798
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,420
Don't eat them. Are you about to?

799
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,520
- Are you going to eat them? No? - No.

800
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,630
You brought them to your mouth.

801
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,660
They're shepherd's purse.

802
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,630
We have 250 dollars to spend.

803
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,270
We must buy flowers that look plentiful with that money.

804
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,930
These are pretty. Marguerite daisies.

805
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,470
- I'll buy marguerite daisies. - Marguerites.

806
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,670
These are roses.

807
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,710
You'll get these?

808
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,110
- Can you wrap a bunch of these? - These look too shabby.

809
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,380
Ma'am. These look shabby.

810
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,380
- Jae Seok. - They look shabby?

811
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,890
I'll take those. Could you mix them in a bundle?

812
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,890
How much?

813
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,120
Yes, nice. Ma'am, that looks great.

814
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,160
- How much is that? - This is great.

815
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,660
All that is... 50 dollars.

816
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,730
Why do you get to spend 50 and I get to spend 30?

817
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,260
- These are... - Hey.

818
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,570
- We came here together. - Mister.

819
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,470
- Why... - I'll pay 20 dollars.

820
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,100
- Why... - I'll put in 20 of my own money.

821
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,740
- That'll do, then. - You said we each get 30.

822
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,070
- Why did you buy 50 dollars' worth? - I'll take them home.

823
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,880
- Who spent 50 dollars? - Him.

824
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,580
- Wasn't it 30... - I'll take these, ma'am.

825
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,150
These are beautiful.

826
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,410
- They're pretty. - Right?

827
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,780
I want pink. What pink flowers would look nice?

828
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,390
- Subdued pink is pretty too. - Holding this much...

829
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,860
- Pink? - Like the Renaissance...

830
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,890
An old-school pink from Europe.

831
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,060
Those are pretty. They are nice. Nice and pink.

832
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,360
I think these would be nice.

833
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,470
- They're nice. - Yes.

834
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,200
I'll mix some of these with campanulas.

835
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
- I see. - Pink campanulas.

836
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,540
Campanula flowers are cute.

837
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,370
Campanulas are lovely.

838
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,510
They look pretty.

839
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,340
Are you preparing to propose to someone?

840
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,280
No. They're pretty.

841
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,150
- The colors and... - The flowers...

842
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,750
They're pretty. How nice.

843
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,380
The guys like flowers.

844
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,850
Campanulas and...

845
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,390
- They're pretty too. What are they? - You liked flowers.

846
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,860
- Hello. - Hello.

847
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,860
I'll shop here. It's crowded over there.

848
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,360
What are these called?

849
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,130
- These. - Pompon chrysanthemums.

850
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,530
- What? - Pompon chrysanthemums.

851
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,540
Chrysanthemums look like this? They're pretty. How much are they?

852
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,400
These go for two dollars per flower.

853
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,170
What is its flower language?

854
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,370
- Chrysanthemums' flower language? - Yes.

855
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,110
Wouldn't it be something about love?

856
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,280
Could you mix them with these to make a 30-dollar bouquet?

857
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,780
- Okay. - Thank you.

858
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,290
I'd never seen pompon chrysanthemums before.

859
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,590
- What? - Pompon chrysanthemums.

860
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,290
- You can't buy chrysanthemums. - Why not?

861
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,060
- You can't buy chrysanthemums. - Why not?

862
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,730
Are they chrysanthemums?

863
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,260
I'm sorry. I need to choose again.

864
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,730
I'm sorry. I need to choose again.

865
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,930
Right. Chrysanthemums are...

866
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,900
- Don't buy them. Right. - Their image...

867
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,370
- You can't. - Forget chrysanthemums.

868
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,440
- Get something else from here. - I should.

869
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,010
Seok Jin. We need them to be pretty colors.

870
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,950
- Baby's breath? - These are so pretty too.

871
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,110
- Roses? - Baby's breath is nice too.

872
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,580
- Camellias? - Baby's breath.

873
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,950
- Baby's breath? - Stay away from those too.

874
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,490
- I'll vanish like a baby's breath. - They're too small.

875
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,790
They're so pretty.

876
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,290
- It's like mist. - Roses...

877
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,130
- Are these baby roses? - Jana roses.

878
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,760
- They're lovely. - They suit your sweater.

879
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,960
- They're what roses? - Jana roses.

880
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,760
- "Jana roses?" - As in "Are you asleep?"

881
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,360
- Oh, jana. - Are you asleep?

882
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,470
- No sleeping or chrysanthemums. - No sleeping.

883
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,730
No baby's breath either.

884
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,940
I can't do jana roses. It sounds like I'm sleeping.

885
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,240
How come everything I pick... What flower can I buy?

886
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,540
- What are these? - They're pretty.

887
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,780
- Ranunculus. - Ranunculus.

888
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,920
- They're pretty. - They're pretty.

889
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,420
- I'll take these. - Okay.

890
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,750
- Ranunculus. - They're so pretty.

891
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,660
- Sit over here. Take a photo. - How pretty.

892
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,920
- What for? - I'll take a photo.

893
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,090
- You look lovely. - One, two, three.

894
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,960
- I want one too. - This is such a sad scene.

895
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,260
- Why? - I don't know. I felt sad.

896
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,460
Why did you feel sad?

897
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,970
- It's sad. - With the flowers...

898
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,670
- How pretty. - It's sad.

899
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,900
Look at that. She's wrapping it nicely.

900
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,770
It's lovely.

901
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,180
I feel sad.

902
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,310
I feel so... It's so pretty.

903
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,150
I feel sad.

904
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,220
Why are you crying?

905
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,420
Why are you crying? Don't.

906
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,120
It's sad.

907
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,390
Let's see how big yours is, Grasshopper.

908
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,160
How big is yours?

909
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,030
- My what? - Is it big?

910
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,770
- What's big? - The size of your bouquet.

911
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,200
What else would I ask about?

912
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,970
- The size of my nose? - No, the flower bouquet.

913
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,640
- He never gives an easy answer. - What other size would I ask for?

914
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
It's never easy.

915
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,180
- What size would I want to know? - I mean...

916
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,080
Your flower bouquet. We're at a flower store.

917
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,950
Gosh. What are these?

918
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,650
It's wearing a mortarboard for graduation season.

919
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,750
- They're flowers? - They're soap flowers.

920
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,160
- For graduation and admissions. - My gosh.

921
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Is that a flower? A chrysanthemum?

922
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,630
- It's so cute. - Isn't that a pompon?

923
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,260
- Isn't it cute? - We should get one.

924
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,230
Congratulations on graduating.

925
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,270
- That's so sweet. - How are they made?

926
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,570
- It's so cute. - The cap...

927
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,740
Look, guys. These are ranunculus.

928
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,410
- They're lovely. - They're pretty, right?

929
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,770
- It's sad. - Don't hold them in front of you.

930
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,840
- Come here, punk. - What? Why?

931
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,410
- Come here, punk. - What? Why?

932
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,110
Whenever I chose a flower, you kept saying...

933
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,580
"Seok Jin. Don't buy chrysanthemums."

934
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,420
When I noticed the baby's breath,

935
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,190
you went, "Seok Jin. You might vanish like a baby's breath."

936
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,820
- Thank you. - Thank you.

937
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,560
- How pretty. - Three bunches of roses.

938
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,530
- That's so pretty. - What are these? They're cute.

939
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,660
Oh, thank you.

940
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,770
These are beautiful.

941
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,770
- Thank you. Here. - That's so cute.

942
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,370
- It's adorable. - It is.

943
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,200
- How cute. - That's the best buy.

944
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,740
This is the best buy today.

945
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,410
- It's a graduation thing. - It's adorable.

946
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,010
We're hosting a Running Man graduation today too.

947
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,010
- Is this your last show? - I'm graduating?

948
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,450
- He's leaving? - It's my last show?

949
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,350
Everyone. I really had a great time.

950
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,320
- For his 60... - It's his last show?

951
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,390
- Because he turned 60. - I see.

952
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,660
- I did not. - You didn't?

953
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,060
- It's your graduation? - This is madness.

954
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,030
Why are we taking Seok Jin up a mountain?

955
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,100
Why are we taking Seok Jin up a mountain?

956
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,100
Hey. Ha Dong Hoon.

957
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,670
You really...

958
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,570
He doesn't know? You didn't tell him?

959
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,740
All day today, you've been saying...

960
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,540
You didn't tell him he's graduating?

961
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,680
I hadn't heard yet.

962
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,350
- Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you.

963
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,280
- Thank you. - Thank you.

964
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,580
Thank you, everyone.

965
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,180
Thank you, everyone.

966
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,150
- "Everyone?" - "Everyone."

967
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,890
- Bye. - I wish you happiness.

968
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,560
Take care, ma'am.

969
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,260
- For 70 dollars for a bouquet... - Yes.

970
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,960
- At 30 dollars, this is cheap. - Yes.

971
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,760
The flowers here are cheap.

972
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,130
- Because it's a market. - They're cheap.

973
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,630
I'll call out your names, and I need you...

974
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,400
- to stand in that order. - Okay.

975
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,070
Haha, and then Yang Se Chan.

976
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,140
- What's going on? - Song Ji Hyo.

977
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,380
- Is this the Empty Head order? - Jee Seok Jin.

978
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,010
- No, is it the price of flowers? - Kim Jong Kook.

979
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,380
- It's the price. - It's the price.

980
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,680
- Is it? - Ji Ye Eun.

981
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,380
It's the price. Mine cost 30 dollars.

982
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,420
And last is Yu Jae Seok.

983
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,160
We asked you to dress in bright colors...

984
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,120
- that suited spring. - Yes.

985
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,890
- Yes, I wore flowers on purpose. - I'm colorful.

986
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:20,200
You're standing in order of the cost of your outfits...

987
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,800
from highest to lowest.

988
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,770
- What? This is the order? - My outfit must be cheap.

989
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,870
Just so you know, Haha's outfit,

990
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,370
from head to toe, costs a total of 3,600 dollars.

991
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,940
That's 3,600 dollars?

992
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,140
- He's a rich man's son. - My gosh.

993
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,950
- Why did you spend so much? - This is Gucci.

994
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,310
- It's Gucci. - You...

995
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,580
His hat is from Gucci and costs about 900 dollars.

996
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,490
His jacket's also Gucci and is about 1,500 dollars.

997
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,160
The sweater is his own and costs about 150 dollars.

998
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,660
The pants cost 150 dollars and trainers about 800 dollars.

999
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,260
His outfit costs a total of around 3,500 dollars.

1000
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,370
Do you think you're G-DRAGON?

1001
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,130
- My gosh. - This cost over three grand?

1002
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,370
It can't be.

1003
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,270
From head to toe, Se Chan's outfit costs 970 dollars.

1004
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,110
- Me? - Your shoes are expensive.

1005
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,080
- Ji Hyo's outfit costs 700. - My gosh.

1006
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,750
- Seok Jin's look costs 680. - This look?

1007
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,650
- It's that expensive? - Jong Kook, 650 dollars.

1008
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,420
- Me? - His clothes are that expensive?

1009
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,490
You wear expensive stuff?

1010
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,690
They're sponsored.

1011
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,220
- Ye Eun's outfit is 600 dollars, - What?

1012
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,560
- This? - and Jae Seok's is 400 dollars.

1013
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,860
- Four hundred dollars. - Jae Seok's so frugal.

1014
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,960
Four hundred is good.

1015
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,460
The original plan was to calculate...

1016
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,560
the average cost of your outfits...

1017
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,900
- and add that to the total. - I see.

1018
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,270
But if we do that, you must climb Mount Bukhan...

1019
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,870
- to the top. - To the peak?

1020
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,180
- You must climb to the top. - To the peak?

1021
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,380
- Mount Bukhan's a hard climb. - All because of Haha.

1022
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,280
- No way. - Why wear over 3,000 dollars...

1023
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,950
- Why did you dress like that? - Why not?

1024
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,380
- Why wear a Gucci cap? - I got it long ago.

1025
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,390
- It's still expensive. - Come on.

1026
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,660
So we have a suggestion.

1027
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,820
Wearing those clothes and carrying those flowers,

1028
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,360
will you hike all the way to the top of Mount Bukhan?

1029
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,200
We found a clothing store that will allow us to shop and film.

1030
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,070
Will you buy new clothes there...

1031
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,630
Will you buy new clothes there...

1032
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,270
- Buy new clothes. - Buy new clothes.

1033
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,400
- Let's go. - That's perfect.

1034
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,670
- We must do that. - Get something cheap.

1035
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,910
The catch is, you can't choose your own outfit.

1036
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,610
You have to pick out an outfit for someone else.

1037
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,050
- And only two members... - Is that...

1038
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,250
who put together the most entertaining outfits...

1039
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,920
- will get a special benefit. - The most entertaining?

1040
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,250
- The most entertaining? - Yes.

1041
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,890
- The most entertaining? - So, they could be nude, right?

1042
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,330
I bet several of us will be nude.

1043
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,960
- Let's dress each other... - I know.

1044
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,300
- in great outfits. - Just see how I dress my person.

1045
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,730
- Let's not go overboard. - Let's not overdo it.

1046
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,600
- I'm definitely going to... - Let's not overdo it.

1047
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,970
make that person show lots of skin.

1048
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,640
Then, we will move to the clothing store.

1049
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,100
- Sounds good. - Nice.

1050
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,840
With the food fighter in the car,

1051
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,980
- it feels so crowded. - No.

1052
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,880
- Gosh, Food Fighter. - My goodness.

1053
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,050
- Goodness, seriously. - This feels nice and snug.

1054
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,480
- Right? Isn't it comfortable? - Yes, it's comfortable.

1055
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,850
- It's a good fit. - Yes, we're nicely wedged in here.

1056
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,090
Gosh, which clothing store are we going to?

1057
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,820
- Where are we going? - The other person...

1058
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,390
- We should remember it's cold out. - That's right.

1059
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,830
- This has to do with our health. - We have to go up in this outfit.

1060
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,100
We shouldn't damage our health.

1061
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,270
Oh, we have to go up the mountain in these clothes.

1062
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,070
- Indeed. - They should be functional clothes.

1063
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,470
Does the price not matter?

1064
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,640
- Or will it change the altitude? - Yes.

1065
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,770
Jae Seok, the price of the clothes will be included.

1066
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,070
- We should make things simple. - But the outfits...

1067
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,780
We'll tell you which person you will be dressing.

1068
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,780
- No, you can't. - Jae Seok, you'll dress Seok Jin.

1069
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,780
- Why are you doing this? - I'm the expert at this.

1070
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,580
Seok Sam, I will pick an outfit that suits you.

1071
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,250
- Don't go overboard. - I'm the expert.

1072
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,790
- Seok Jin will dress Ye Eun. - That sounds funny.

1073
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,490
Ye Eun will dress Jong Kook.

1074
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,160
- It's me. - I'll do a really good job.

1075
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,560
Jong Kook, you're so lucky.

1076
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,430
- Ye Eun won't be too harsh. - I will be very...

1077
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,260
- Right, she won't be harsh. - Ye Eun will be...

1078
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,730
- Totally. - Jong Kook will dress Haha.

1079
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,170
- I'll dress Haha. - And Haha,

1080
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,570
- you will dress Ji Hyo. - Okay.

1081
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,300
- Ji Hyo will dress Se Chan. - Ji Hyo.

1082
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,700
And Se Chan will dress...

1083
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,640
- Jae Seok. - Goodness, thank you.

1084
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,270
- Ssaebssaeb. - Yes, Jae Seok.

1085
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,840
- Please keep my vibe going. - I'll be dressing Ji Hyo.

1086
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,380
- Gosh, of course, I know. - Right.

1087
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,380
- Gosh, what prank will I pull now? - What will Jae Seok do...

1088
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,380
But really, Ssaebssaeb.

1089
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,850
- Please dress me warmly. It's cold. - Warmly.

1090
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,590
- I'll destress as I pick an outfit. - What?

1091
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,890
I'll destress as I pick an outfit.

1092
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,020
Se Chan has good taste, you know.

1093
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,690
- Gosh, that little punk. - To be entertaining...

1094
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,730
He'll make things pretty dynamic.

1095
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,560
- Only enough not to catch a cold. - That's right.

1096
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,900
- Yes. - I'll make you warm.

1097
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,030
- Please just give me long sleeves. - Of course.

1098
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,830
Long sleeves and long pants, please.

1099
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,340
- We can't catch colds. - I wonder...

1100
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,070
Hang on. Seok Sam...

1101
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,770
I'll think of the time he looked cool...

1102
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,910
- as I pick out his outfit. - Yes, make me look cool.

1103
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,840
But these days, Seok Sam is... How should I say it?

1104
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,650
- I'm hooked on this right now. - What?

1105
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,620
His stylist seems to be...

1106
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,920
- a little too ahead of the times. - Right.

1107
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,220
- It's too fixed on looking young. - Right, to look young.

1108
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,120
- So... Yes. - Dress him to look his own age?

1109
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,060
- I want to get him back to his age. - Hey!

1110
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,560
- You're right about that. - Aren't I right?

1111
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,400
- In search of his age. - I want to...

1112
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,230
- find Seok Jin's age. - Late 50s, early 60s.

1113
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,270
Yes, a look that will fit the late 50s, early 60s age range.

1114
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,970
- That's right. - Why am I in the early 60s?

1115
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,840
You know Seok Jin, I know...

1116
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,400
how you dressed back in the day.

1117
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,170
You know the "Chairman Shin" look?

1118
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,340
- I know. - The white pants. He liked that.

1119
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,780
- I know exactly what that is. - Hey, I don't like that look.

1120
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,280
- Tracksuits with words on them? - Yes.

1121
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,720
- The shoes should be gleaming too. - So, in one word...

1122
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,380
- Hightops. - Yes, white ones.

1123
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,620
- And studs in his cap. - Yes.

1124
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,520
In a word, I'll help you find the resolution you started with.

1125
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,730
I'll show you the style that'll help you find your initial resolution.

1126
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,530
So curious.

1127
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,460
I know what clothes Seok Jin usually wears and likes.

1128
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,560
We're here.

1129
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,130
- Let's go, Food Fighter. - Food Fighter.

1130
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,870
- Let's go. - Hey, they have great stuff here.

1131
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,970
- Hey, that looks nice. - This place is...

1132
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,700
- They sell clothes here? - My gosh.

1133
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,370
- How pretty. Is it a vintage shop? - Gosh, this is...

1134
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,240
- My gosh. - Hello. My goodness.

1135
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,210
- There's a lot of cool clothes. - These are so pretty.

1136
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,640
- This is insane. - What is this place?

1137
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,810
- Hey, this is... - There's so much stuff.

1138
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,250
- Was there a place like this? - Gosh, no way.

1139
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,220
- Was there a place like this? - This place is huge.

1140
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,650
- This place is amazing. - Hey, this is...

1141
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,150
- Hey, this... Ye Eun! - This is so pretty.

1142
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,850
- Gosh, no way. - Ye Eun, look at this.

1143
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,860
- Come on, Seok Jin. - Ssaebssaeb.

1144
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,890
Hey, this looks great.

1145
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:48,960
Hey, what about this?

1146
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,490
Gosh, this is totally...

1147
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,360
This looks nice.

1148
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,860
- I'm a flower child. This is good. - Right, you are...

1149
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,470
- a flower child. - So, you can go and pick out...

1150
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,470
- clothes for your assigned member. - Yes.

1151
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,470
And we will add the price of the clothes to the altitude.

1152
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,510
- Okay. - Got it.

1153
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,570
Seok Jin's style.

1154
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,380
- Yes, this is it. - That's perfect.

1155
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,380
- Give it a rest. - This is...

1156
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,980
- This is exactly right. - I don't like that.

1157
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,450
- Embroidery is for Seok Jin. - Seok Jin is all about embroidery.

1158
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,780
- I don't like that. - Back in the day, Seok Jin...

1159
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,920
- really liked this stuff. - Go with the embroidery.

1160
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,890
- I chose the hat already. - This one.

1161
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,720
Jae Seok, the outfit is already complete with that hat.

1162
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,050
- No, Seok Jin. - Can we choose the outfits now?

1163
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,560
- Yes, you can go ahead now. - That's pretty.

1164
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,320
- Like in the old movie, "Friend..." - Hey, that's so pretty.

1165
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,060
How should I bring Haha down?

1166
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,960
Jong Kook, I'll make you look so pretty.

1167
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,600
Hey, how about these pants?

1168
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,640
- Hey, these are amazing. - Come on, Seok Jin!

1169
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,270
Come on. Please don't.

1170
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,370
Aren't these pretty?

1171
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,310
- They're not pretty. - Gosh, how flashy.

1172
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,740
- Gosh, these are seriously... - Come on.

1173
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,410
- These are for women, right? - No, but...

1174
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,980
This is fashion from the 1980s.

1175
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,750
- I don't like these pants. - They're exactly from the 80s.

1176
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,120
- These are the best. - I don't like those pants.

1177
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,220
Won't these fit Jae Seok?

1178
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,420
- These are for Seok Jin. I am... - Hey, just one...

1179
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,520
- Don't do it. - I'm putting his outfit together...

1180
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,520
right away.

1181
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,630
- Jong Kook, I will... - Hey, this tracksuit...

1182
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,930
- You can show your navel, right? - Hang on a minute.

1183
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,170
- I'm sorry, but... - What?

1184
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,470
- Why did you choose a women's top? - The size is...

1185
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,840
- You can show your navel, right? - I mean...

1186
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,240
- I need an undershirt, though. - Okay.

1187
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,870
- But... - This will look good on you.

1188
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,440
But why are you shopping in the women's section?

1189
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,680
Your size is...

1190
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,050
What would be funny?

1191
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,880
Hey, they have so many clothes here.

1192
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,790
Jae Seok, does this size fit you?

1193
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,560
- Hey. - That would fit him.

1194
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,760
- This would fit, right? - Yes, that's perfect.

1195
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,230
- Jae Seok. - This would fit.

1196
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,300
- This is totally Jae Seok's style. - This size...

1197
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,200
- It's Jae Seok's style. - Jae Seok, something like this...

1198
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,700
- Se Chan. - Yes?

1199
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,570
- You could fit into this if you... - Hey, why are you...

1200
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,940
- Because it's cold... - This is a women's shirt...

1201
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,470
This would fit if you tried, right?

1202
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,970
- This size is enough, right? - Wait, but...

1203
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,940
Can you wear sizes between 38 and 42 or not?

1204
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,540
- You can, right? - I can.

1205
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,980
I'll make an effort.

1206
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,350
- You can't do this. - I mean,

1207
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,850
my eyes are drawn to items like these. I'm in trouble.

1208
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,660
- Jae Seok, can you wear a dress? - What did you say?

1209
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,460
Jae Seok.

1210
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,560
- Hey, Se Chan! - Let's go with a simple dress.

1211
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,360
- Hey, seriously? Why, you little... - Of course he can wear a dress.

1212
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,600
- The size is... - Why can't he?

1213
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,700
What are you doing?

1214
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,430
- This is perfect. - Hey.

1215
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,200
- That's nice. - It's winter right now.

1216
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,740
- Don't worry. - It's winter right now.

1217
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,270
Seok Jin, look at this one.

1218
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,510
That guy must be crazy.

1219
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,550
Jae Seok, what size shoes do you wear?

1220
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,220
I'm just asking.

1221
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,750
- What should I dress Jong Kook in? - Hey, what are you...

1222
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,050
Hey, this is nice.

1223
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,020
- Jae Seok should wear all green. - Seriously?

1224
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,590
- Look at this vibe. - It's awesome.

1225
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,060
- Oh, really? Then, no. - Yes, it's awesome.

1226
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,690
- Hey, it's so cute. - Then, I shouldn't choose this.

1227
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,300
- Thank you. It's so cute. - No.

1228
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,760
- If it's cute... No. - Let me wear this.

1229
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,070
- You said you'd let me wear it! - No.

1230
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,070
Something else.

1231
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,940
- Hey, you said you'd get me this. - No.

1232
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,770
- What about a crop top? - It's cute.

1233
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,110
Jong Kook, this one.

1234
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,010
- Please. - Hey. Seriously.

1235
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,410
- It would look great on you. - You must be insane.

1236
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,780
Crop tops are in these days.

1237
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,510
- Hey, I'll get a stomachache. - A crop top.

1238
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,450
- I'll get an upset stomach, kid. - I love this. Well, for now...

1239
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,290
Gosh, seriously. I need something... Hey.

1240
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,360
I might have to dress Seok Jin to look too normal.

1241
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,160
- With this hat, anything would... - Yes?

1242
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,060
This won't do.

1243
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,900
- Not this one. It's too flashy. - No.

1244
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,730
What would look normal but funny?

1245
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,780
This is perfect. This is it.

1246
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,950
Why?

1247
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,990
Pajama pants?

1248
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,160
The colors go so well together.

1249
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,830
Gosh, I chose some great clothes.

1250
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,240
What about this vibe, kind of like one-mile wear?

1251
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,150
Seok Jin likes this kind of thing.

1252
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,820
Seok Jin likes this kind of thing.

1253
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,290
Seok Jin loves stuff like this.

1254
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,420
I know his style all too well.

1255
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,190
It should have a spring vibe to it.

1256
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,060
Haha. Oh, this is for Haha.

1257
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,500
Oh, this is Haha's vibe.

1258
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,560
This looks perfect for Haha, right?

1259
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,670
What about this? This would look cute on Se Chan.

1260
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,940
Is this doable?

1261
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,510
Does this make sense?

1262
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,620
This is funny.

1263
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,220
This is so cute.

1264
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,250
Jae Seok, this outfit will definitely make you a star.

1265
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,590
- Hurry up. - What are you doing?

1266
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,620
Hurry up and put it on.

1267
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,760
Shall we go and change now?

1268
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,690
I'm supposed to just wear this?

1269
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,860
Keep your underwear on.

1270
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,030
I mean, of course, I should keep my underwear on!

1271
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,170
- For you, I... You know, don't you? - Yes?

1272
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,340
- It's not over the top. You know? - It is over the top.

1273
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,570
No, this pattern is really over the top.

1274
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,240
- Hey, you won't think that... - It's way too...

1275
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,740
- once you see Jae Seok. - Oh, really?

1276
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,810
Oh, my!

1277
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,780
That's just... It's perfect!

1278
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,720
Hey, that was made for you.

1279
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,720
- Hey, Jae Seok! - Yes?

1280
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,190
Are these pants for kids?

1281
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,220
- Everyone is so... - Just put everything on for now.

1282
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,160
- Everyone is complaining... - No one has the right size...

1283
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,730
- Hey, this is... - This is the best.

1284
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,960
Hey.

1285
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,400
I don't think she has any idea what she's doing.

1286
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,630
I'll come out for now.

1287
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,370
I mean, how am I supposed to...

1288
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,300
You should wear this for now.

1289
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,440
But this is just...

1290
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,210
Wear this too.

1291
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,240
I mean, it's not that you can't look.

1292
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,910
It should have some flow to it.

1293
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,080
It should have some flow instead of just being funny. How can she...

1294
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,080
- I can't even breathe. - This gets minus points for sure.

1295
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,520
- Because... - This won't get any points either.

1296
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,790
- Not at all. It's unrealistic. - What...

1297
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,820
- It's cute, but... - Right? It is?

1298
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,260
Honestly, it's cute,

1299
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,890
but how can you go hiking in this when it's cold?

1300
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,560
- I'll lose my arms. - I know.

1301
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,300
- Over there. - So, this is...

1302
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,200
- You can take this up as a fake. - No, this is unrealistic.

1303
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,040
Jong Kook, are you wearing pants or not?

1304
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,440
- Are you just in your underpants? - Hey, I'm seriously...

1305
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,670
Well, I...

1306
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,840
I don't know if this will be allowed on TV.

1307
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,540
If we don't think about our health...

1308
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,580
I remember seeing someone...

1309
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,980
- like her in Dongducheon. - You're right.

1310
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,850
- I know her. - When the play is over

1311
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,480
I know her.

1312
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,290
- Seok Jin. - What?

1313
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,020
- That coat's the issue. - You need to take it off.

1314
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,960
- That's not part of the outfit. - It's not.

1315
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,030
This is to hide everything.

1316
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,030
- Now, - Let's see it.

1317
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,230
- Yes? - you are done dressing yourselves.

1318
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,470
- One by one, - Hey, lady.

1319
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,230
- you'll explain... - Lady.

1320
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,100
the outfit you chose.

1321
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,270
Since Se Chan is wearing his, please explain his outfit.

1322
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,510
Hiking is our concept for the day,

1323
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,940
but Se Chan is also quite healthy.

1324
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,250
His overall concept is the lumberjack holding flowers.

1325
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,980
- What? - A lumberjack with flowers.

1326
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,120
- A lumberjack with flowers? - As you know,

1327
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,680
- we bought flowers. - Right.

1328
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,790
He's a lumberjack holding flowers,

1329
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,420
so I have him in a red scarf to make him look healthier.

1330
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,860
- That makes me look healthy? - Yes.

1331
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,960
- I wanted his skin to show. - He looks good.

1332
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,390
- Exactly. - His outfit's nice.

1333
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,400
- Ji Hyo. - It's nice.

1334
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,800
You dressed him in a way you want your man to dress.

1335
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,670
This is the look you want for a boyfriend.

1336
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,770
- Like this? - Someone energetic and driven.

1337
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,570
- Someone energetic. - Like a hunky manservant.

1338
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,940
He has soft skin that is like a baby's,

1339
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,740
so I wanted to show that off.

1340
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,980
It's high-fashion which I love.

1341
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,580
- I'll seduce you. - Really?

1342
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,610
Know that.

1343
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,550
Se Chan, please go ahead and explain...

1344
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,590
- your outfit for Jae Seok. - Sure.

1345
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,520
- Let me make some final touches. - Lady!

1346
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,360
This is no lady. Put your glasses on.

1347
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,690
- Hey, lady! - You need to take this off.

1348
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,360
- Jae Seok, come on. - He has something on underneath.

1349
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,690
You need to take this off.

1350
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,960
- Jae Seok, come on. - He has something on underneath.

1351
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,700
Jae Seok is not being a proper model.

1352
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,800
- Why do you have your pants on? - What's with the jeans?

1353
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,870
- Exactly. - Take off the pants.

1354
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,640
You should at least let me keep those on.

1355
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,970
- What... - "Snowpiercer."

1356
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,680
It's that lady from "Snowpiercer."

1357
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,940
- That? - Here.

1358
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,480
I would've kept mine on too.

1359
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,210
Guys, take a look.

1360
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,720
All right. Since it's spring...

1361
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,120
It looks good on you.

1362
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,820
You look good in that.

1363
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,220
How can you say I'm not wearing this properly?

1364
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,660
You still have your pants on.

1365
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,960
What about me, then?

1366
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,930
- This is how it's worn. - You're the best.

1367
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:14,630
This is exactly what we wanted as a spring outfit.

1368
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,070
- This is spring itself. - It's pretty.

1369
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,330
- No way. - All right.

1370
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,870
- He's not a blowfly. - He looks good.

1371
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,310
- In Paris... - It's so nice.

1372
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,870
- In Europe and Paris... - I'm jealous.

1373
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,110
That's what you'd see in Paris.

1374
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,980
It's the lady from "Snowpiercer."

1375
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,650
- You're killing it. - I...

1376
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,680
This is me challenging G-DRAGON.

1377
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,620
- G-DRAGON, are you seeing this? - You look like a model...

1378
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,690
- from Paris Fashion Week. - G-DRAGON.

1379
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,020
Attend Fashion Week wearing that.

1380
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,020
G-DRAGON, I'm coming for you.

1381
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,390
You never know.

1382
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,030
- This is for the rating notice. - He truly is an alien.

1383
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,060
No way.

1384
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,360
Now, Jae Seok will explain the outfit...

1385
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,400
- This is hilarious. - for Seok Jin.

1386
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,430
Before I show you Seok Sam's outfit...

1387
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,200
- He has to take that off. - Come on.

1388
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,400
- Let me explain. - I can't.

1389
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,310
- Hold on. - He...

1390
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,810
- It's not that. - This is meant to mock him.

1391
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,910
- He just looks like an old man. - It lacks sincerity.

1392
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,580
Seriously?

1393
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,310
His outfit's fine.

1394
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,620
- What am I supposed to be? - See?

1395
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,750
- Look. - No way.

1396
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,750
Check out his shoes.

1397
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,460
- I've seen... - This is so annoying...

1398
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,120
a lady dressed like that.

1399
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,490
- I've seen this lady before. - Even the shoes match.

1400
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,630
- Unbelievable. - Lucky him.

1401
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,300
- This... - Do these match?

1402
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,600
- Are they supposed to match? - Look.

1403
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,240
He looks like he tried to look good.

1404
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,300
Exactly.

1405
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,640
- Yes, it seems that way. - I hate it.

1406
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,610
This is crazy.

1407
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,040
I rank this in first place.

1408
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,010
- How... - Check this out.

1409
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,820
Wouldn't it be funny to clip this here?

1410
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,680
Don't. That would look like a diaper.

1411
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,150
- This is hilarious. - That'd look like a diaper.

1412
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,590
I remember there being clothes like that.

1413
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,660
It's like this from behind.

1414
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,590
This is insane.

1415
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,830
Yours is funny.

1416
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,530
- But his... - His is comedy.

1417
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,030
But he looks like he can't dress properly.

1418
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,870
I...

1419
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,600
- I... This looks funny. - You're trying to be funny.

1420
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,600
- But him? - This is a reality for him.

1421
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,510
I thought of a specific setting.

1422
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,380
This is an outfit for the supermarket.

1423
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,710
- This is so funny. - I'm going to a grocery store?

1424
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,410
I hate how I look like I tried to look good.

1425
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,810
Exactly. Right.

1426
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,380
- This is so funny. - Now, we'll see the outfit...

1427
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,420
that Seok Jin chose.

1428
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,320
As for her...

1429
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,750
- A look for "SNL?" - Hers is pretty.

1430
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,220
Do you know that girl from the movie "Friend?"

1431
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,320
She doesn't.

1432
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,490
Her name is Jin Sook.

1433
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,060
- She looks nice. - Yes, Jin Sook.

1434
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,330
- When the play is over - I dressed her like Jin Sook.

1435
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,960
She looks good.

1436
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,730
- It's adorable. - It's a pretty look.

1437
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,970
- It isn't random. - Smiling.

1438
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,900
It's nice. You look good, Ye Eun.

1439
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,900
Thank you.

1440
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,510
- Who's next? - Right.

1441
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,710
I dressed Jong Kook.

1442
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,140
- Jong Kook's upset. - Hold on.

1443
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,440
I tried my best to make this work.

1444
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,080
- Good. - He's Mr. Hot Girl.

1445
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,650
That's not the case.

1446
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,620
I can't possibly go hiking in this.

1447
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,550
- Show us. - It lacks sincerity.

1448
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,820
I put in a lot of thought.

1449
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,490
I put in a lot of thought.

1450
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,300
What on earth is this?

1451
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,200
How can I walk around in this?

1452
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,970
- How can I walk around in this? - Muscle man...

1453
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,470
- I... Seriously? - I get what you mean.

1454
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,870
- You're right. - What on earth is this?

1455
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,710
- What on earth is this? - Isn't it funny?

1456
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,310
- Come on. - It's hilarious.

1457
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,640
Are you kidding me?

1458
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,810
You know...

1459
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,820
- You should deduct points for this. - Why?

1460
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,050
How can I hike in this?

1461
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,490
- A hot girl. - But...

1462
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,550
You should've given him more clothes.

1463
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,760
- What is this? - At least give him tights.

1464
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,920
- This is crazy. - What is this?

1465
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,130
He can wear this while jogging along the Han River.

1466
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,200
Ye Eun isn't one...

1467
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,630
- who studied comedy. - Exactly.

1468
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,730
- There's nothing to it. - It's too straightforward.

1469
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,430
- There should be a concept. - But...

1470
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,900
You remind me of the fitness lady...

1471
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,670
- who went viral. - Exactly.

1472
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,510
He's Mike Tyson from the waist down.

1473
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,940
But up above is the fitness lady.

1474
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,440
- I love it. - What on earth is this?

1475
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,180
This would be funny on anyone.

1476
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,610
- This would be funny on anyone. - But...

1477
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,650
- These days, even men... - That's right.

1478
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,550
- Who dresses like this? - A lot actually.

1479
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,950
- Don't be ridiculous. - He's not joking.

1480
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,950
- Even KAI wears cropped shirts. - People wear them.

1481
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,390
This is a fashionable setup.

1482
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,290
- How so? - This is the New York vibe.

1483
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,590
- How is this New York? - A girl from New York.

1484
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,160
Who wears this in New York?

1485
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,460
- New York... - I'll die from the laughing.

1486
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,360
A jogger in New York.

1487
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,070
- What is this? - A jogger in New York.

1488
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,100
You look great.

1489
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:16,570
Okay, we're going uphill. Go!

1490
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,410
- This is hilarious. - You dressed me, right?

1491
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,840
Yes, and he looks adorable.

1492
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,940
- I look nice. - See?

1493
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,080
- You look adorable. - It looks pretty from the front.

1494
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,750
- You look like colored paper. - What is he?

1495
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,420
- It's cute. - Fold that colored paper.

1496
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,720
- How old are you? - I...

1497
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,190
Do you have a Children's Day event?

1498
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,990
- I actually booked an event. - Check out the outfit.

1499
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,620
- This is hard to walk in... - See?

1500
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,230
because what I have underneath is too tight.

1501
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,390
- Back in the day... - I see.

1502
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,930
- It's hanging off my hip. - It's nice.

1503
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,500
- It's not bad. - Take it off, then.

1504
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,800
- You can take it off. - Your behind is sagging now.

1505
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,540
- Where did it go? - It's sagging a lot now.

1506
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,870
Why is your butt sagging that much?

1507
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,770
I'll be showing my crack at this rate.

1508
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,010
- Hey. - Stop that.

1509
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,410
What are you showing the camera?

1510
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,750
- They saw that. - It's fine.

1511
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,980
I heard someone say a bad word.

1512
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,550
- I love it. - This is hilarious.

1513
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,080
- It's cute. - Fold that colored paper.

1514
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,250
Do you have a Children's Day event?

1515
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,590
I actually booked an event.

1516
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,690
As for me...

1517
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,520
I dressed her, and you know how Y2K is trending.

1518
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,960
- She's dressed like Lee Hyo Ri. - It's pretty.

1519
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,190
Doesn't her waist look longer?

1520
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,800
- I played to her strengths. - You're right.

1521
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,030
- She has a long torso. - It looks really long.

1522
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,470
- It's pretty. - You have a long waist.

1523
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:18,970
Look at her long waist.

1524
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,240
You're now at an age that looks good in this style.

1525
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,310
- How much... - The old woman style suits you.

1526
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,470
Y2K. I dressed like this back in the day.

1527
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,040
I used to dress like that too.

1528
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,080
She's dressed like Lee Hyo Ri. Doesn't her waist look longer?

1529
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,310
- I played to her strengths. - You'll vote for the top two.

1530
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,520
Eliminate the outfits that you think are too safe.

1531
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,650
- Se Chan's. - His is too safe.

1532
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,920
- Yes, Se Chan's. - Is his outfit safe?

1533
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,720
- How is this safe? - And Haha's.

1534
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,390
- Among them... - And Haha's.

1535
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:42,820
- His is safe too. - And Ji Hyo's.

1536
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,830
- Ji Hyo's is safe too. - Right.

1537
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,090
- Next... - You stand over there.

1538
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,230
- Why? - Stand over there.

1539
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,460
- It's us three. - You belong over there.

1540
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,800
- Among us 3... - Yes, us 3.

1541
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,970
Two of us have the best outfits.

1542
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,300
- This is too much. - Your belly button must show.

1543
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,040
- But this... - You're definitely the scariest.

1544
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,370
- I look like a weirdo. - You look terrifying.

1545
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,310
- Don't I look like a weirdo? - Show your belly button.

1546
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,710
I feel like I'll be in trouble...

1547
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,210
- for getting on your bad side. - This is weird.

1548
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,310
- If only we saw his chest too. - This is disgusting.

1549
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,750
- It's not. - You look cute.

1550
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,880
I should've looked cute.

1551
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,150
I don't like Seok Jin's because the outfit looks like his.

1552
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,550
- It's pretty. - Jong Kook's is overpowering,

1553
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,490
- but this outfit suits you. - It does.

1554
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,760
Should I take that as a compliment?

1555
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,030
- It's not bad. - Really?

1556
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,190
- Exactly. - But...

1557
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,530
It's funny how you two hate your outfits.

1558
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,970
- It's not that. - Have it be them, then.

1559
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,770
Why is he up here when his outfit looks fine?

1560
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,040
Yours looks like comedy while mine looks like my real outfit.

1561
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:29,970
Anyone can tell you're trying to be funny.

1562
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,740
This is obviously comedy.

1563
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,940
You'd think he's dressed this way for a comedy segment.

1564
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,910
- Yours looks like it has a story. - Mine's too weird.

1565
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,710
Meanwhile, it's like I dressed this way to impress.

1566
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,420
- Why do you hate yours? - I even have a matching satchel.

1567
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,920
Look.

1568
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,320
- Let's decide on 1st and 2nd. - Sure.

1569
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,890
- Got it. - His wins.

1570
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:47,160
- Right. - Yes!

1571
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,030
Ye Eun's outfit for Jong Kook is in first place.

1572
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,730
- In 2nd place... - Mine's in 2nd place.

1573
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,290
- is Jae Seok's outfit for Seok Jin. - What about third place?

1574
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,900
- There's no such thing. - Those with the top two outfits...

1575
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,870
- will be given a benefit later. - Sure thing.

1576
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:02,200
I told you that the price of your clothes...

1577
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,570
will be converted and added to the height...

1578
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,910
- you must hike up. - Where are we at?

1579
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,540
We received a discount,

1580
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,940
and a total of 250 dollars have been added.

1581
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,110
A total of 250 dollars have been added.

1582
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:15,080
- That's not that bad. - So, 50m have been added.

1583
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,820
- So, 50m have been added. - Okay.

1584
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,790
So, you will now hike up to an altitude of 270m.

1585
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,020
- Oh, 270m? - We have to climb up pretty high.

1586
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,660
- But you know, Jong Kook and I... - What is this?

1587
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,030
It's weird to say this, but when you look from here down,

1588
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,330
don't we look like a couple?

1589
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,570
- Seok Jin, your legs are pretty. - Aren't they?

1590
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,500
- Don't we look like a couple? - We do look like a couple.

1591
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,810
- This part looks similar... - His legs are so pretty.

1592
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,570
What is this?

1593
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,340
- Gosh, it's so funny. - We'll get going now.

1594
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,710
- Oh, it's cold. - Are we going to eat now?

1595
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,810
Hey, how can we go anywhere dressed like this?

1596
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,850
- Are you... - Jae Seok, you're so funny.

1597
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,250
- Are you a performance team? - Yes.

1598
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,850
Oh, right. I'm going there too.

1599
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,990
We're performing on a mountain today.

1600
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,760
- Look at your watch. - You guys are all dressed already.

1601
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,430
Hang on. Are you just wearing your own clothes?

1602
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,530
- He's going to the supermarket. - Where is he...

1603
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,830
- Gosh, this is infuriating. - Did you pack your outfit?

1604
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,600
- That's right. - You're just wearing plain clothes.

1605
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,100
You should've come dressed.

1606
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,130
We should travel as a group.

1607
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,840
I won't be able to go to the restroom on my own.

1608
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,840
But the thing is, we have to see this every week now, you know?

1609
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,940
This will be on TV. It will be recorded forever.

1610
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,040
- That's right. - You're so realistic.

1611
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,610
Until next year's TV rating notice...

1612
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,150
We won't go to the restaurant like this, right?

1613
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,410
Are we going to a restaurant right now?

1614
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,450
Yes, you'll have lunch first...

1615
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,480
We're eating in... Wait, you mean in these clothes?

1616
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,050
- My gosh. You're so mean. - But Seok Jin...

1617
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,360
- You don't look weird. It's okay. - Come on, Director.

1618
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,890
- That's why I don't like it. - That's what I mean.

1619
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,630
- I hate it because it's okay. - You look okay.

1620
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,600
- You look the most normal. - Right.

1621
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,930
You look like you're in the most normal clothes.

1622
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:36,130
- We're here. - Oh, the smell.

1623
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,670
Gosh, it smells amazing.

1624
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,140
Oh, I smell pork belly.

1625
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,600
- It smells like frozen pork belly. - Is it frozen pork belly?

1626
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,510
- It's a frozen pork belly place? - It's frozen pork belly.

1627
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,840
- Right? - All right.

1628
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,140
- Before we go to our show... - The Saemaeul Movement...

1629
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:52,080
- Yes. - We should eat before we go.

1630
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,480
- Let's have a hearty meal. - Yes, a hearty meal.

1631
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,150
- After the business association... - Right.

1632
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,520
- Our performance teams... - We're meeting quite often.

1633
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,160
- Yes, I know. - I know.

1634
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,220
Everyone must have second jobs.

1635
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,690
- Right. - I know.

1636
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,160
I didn't recognize you without your clown makeup.

1637
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,960
- I know, right? - Mr. Clown.

1638
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,430
- I forgot my nose. - Right.

1639
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:12,130
- You should eat up before hiking. - Yes.

1640
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,240
You can enjoy water parsley here, which is in season during spring.

1641
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,300
It's a restaurant that serves...

1642
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,640
- water parsley brisket combo. - Oh, water parsley is nice.

1643
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,440
- Oh, really? - It sounds good.

1644
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,380
Water parsley is so delicious.

1645
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,650
- We should still enjoy the food. - Yes, we should.

1646
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,180
- Let's eat. - Oh, nice.

1647
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,780
- Let's still enjoy the food. Sure. - And we can hike a bit more.

1648
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,720
- Just frozen pork belly? - Yes, frozen pork belly.

1649
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,850
- Frozen pork belly? - Frozen pork belly. That's simple.

1650
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:32,990
Three servings per table?

1651
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,460
- Three servings per table? - Yes.

1652
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:36,690
Let's have frozen pork belly...

1653
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,590
- and half-dried pollack makguksu. - Something like doenjang jjigae...

1654
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,800
- Right. Two orders of makguksu. - Okay!

1655
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,830
One half-dried pollack makguksu and one doenjang jjigae.

1656
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:46,330
- Are you having doenjang jjigae? - Yes.

1657
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,740
- We'll have one doenjang jjigae. - Two.

1658
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,070
- And makguksu. - Yes, and one makguksu here.

1659
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,510
- Two? Two. - Two?

1660
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,780
- Aren't you having steamed eggs? - I am.

1661
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,140
And one order of steamed eggs too.

1662
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,880
We'll have a water parsley bracken Shishi... I mean, Shishito pepper...

1663
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,910
"Shishi?"

1664
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,480
- Should we just have silken tofu? - That sounds good.

1665
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,750
How high are we going to go? Let's just climb up.

1666
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,390
- Just go up. Let's just eat up. - Let's go to the top.

1667
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,090
I'm not that hungry.

1668
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,960
- You're not hungry? - I'm really not.

1669
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,790
- You're not hungry? Why? - No.

1670
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,830
- I'm not sure. - But you're going to eat.

1671
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,100
This is what's great about frozen pork belly.

1672
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,230
It's easy to grill.

1673
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:20,940
- Gosh, this looks so appetizing. - I know.

1674
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,840
We can grill a lot at once. That's nice.

1675
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,780
- We grill the water parsley? - That's what you do.

1676
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,150
- Oh, the water parsley too? - Yes.

1677
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,420
- This is popular these days. - Water parsley pork belly.

1678
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,950
- This must be good for your health. - It is good for your health.

1679
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,650
Gosh, I can smell the water parsley.

1680
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,960
Water parsley has such a great smell.

1681
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,360
- Water parsley - In the grease...

1682
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,700
- When we get some grease, put it... - That's right.

1683
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,230
Give me the black pepper.

1684
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,330
It'll be good after I sprinkle this on.

1685
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:55,500
- What? Is this the thing? - Yes.

1686
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,340
Oh, why is the black pepper like this?

1687
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,070
- Haven't you seen that before? - It's not that.

1688
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,040
But isn't the grinder thing only for fancy black pepper?

1689
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,210
- Gosh, things have gotten nicer. - Is this the silken tofu?

1690
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,580
- Gosh, this is... - Oh, the black pepper.

1691
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,390
All right.

1692
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,420
It's all done.

1693
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,760
This looks incredible.

1694
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,360
All right. Let's start eating.

1695
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,070
Eat from this side. Here. You should eat this.

1696
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,070
Okay.

1697
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,140
Gosh, there's so much grease.

1698
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,980
- Gosh, this is... - Well, pork grease is okay.

1699
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,150
I haven't had frozen pork belly in a while. It's so good.

1700
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,610
- Thank you, Jong Kook. - Sure.

1701
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,450
It's fully cooked.

1702
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,220
Hey, you should eat the cooked ones.

1703
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,460
Does anyone want a bowl of rice?

1704
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,660
- Me. - I'll have a bowl of rice too.

1705
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,060
- Let's split it. - Okay.

1706
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,360
- Let's split a bowl too. - Let's share.

1707
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,330
- This is so delicious. - We'll have a bowl of rice too.

1708
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,700
- Another bowl of rice, please. - This is only three bites for me.

1709
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,770
Let's just eat our fill and walk a little more.

1710
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:03,540
- Yes, eat a lot and walk a lot. - That's right.

1711
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,610
- I should have some water parsley. - Wrap it in water parsley.

1712
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:06,710
Yes, try the water parsley.

1713
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,910
Wrap it up like this.

1714
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,080
I can smell the water parsley.

1715
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,010
Because it is water parsley.

1716
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,190
This is delicious.

1717
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,390
Frozen pork belly is good with rice.

1718
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:20,420
- Right. - You're right.

1719
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,860
I should eat lots of vegetables.

1720
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,660
We should eat lots of vegetables.

1721
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,130
- This is good. - Is this the ssamjang?

1722
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,730
Wrap it all up like this.

1723
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,830
Hey, this is it.

1724
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,330
- The makguksu is so sweet. - This is a masterpiece.

1725
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,340
- Also, - This is so good.

1726
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,940
don't tally up all the orders. Go by each table.

1727
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,970
Gosh, this is nice.

1728
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,380
Let's just make sure...

1729
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,950
Hey, don't pay so much attention to me, okay?

1730
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:46,250
We only say that amongst ourselves.

1731
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,020
This is so good.

1732
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,350
- Let's eat a lot and walk a lot. - That's right.

1733
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,090
I think that's done.

1734
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,240
Gosh, Ji Ye Eun keeps eating when the pork is still white.

1735
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,310
- She's eating when it's not cooked. - Ye Eun.

1736
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,150
Didn't you say you weren't hungry?

1737
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,150
She said she wasn't hungry.

1738
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,520
- I wasn't very hungry. - What?

1739
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,280
I wasn't that hungry because I had some bread earlier.

1740
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
This is tasty.

1741
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,160
- It's so tasty. - Gosh, Food Fighter.

1742
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,320
You're on a roll today.

1743
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,460
Food Fighter, I'm a huge fan of yours.

1744
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,470
Seok Jin, should we order some more meat ahead of time?

1745
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,700
- Should we? It should be a secret. - We should order in secret.

1746
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,670
- Okay. Let's order. - Excuse me.

1747
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,040
- Gosh, everything is so good. - What should we order?

1748
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,580
Just a bit. Two servings.

1749
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,580
- Two servings? - Gosh, we are...

1750
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,680
- Yes. - Two servings?

1751
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,220
- Can we have two servings of pork? - Yes, good job.

1752
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,950
Two servings. Just a bit. Quietly.

1753
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,150
You ordered two more servings of pork belly.

1754
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,150
Who?

1755
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,960
You ordered two more servings of pork belly.

1756
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,990
Who?

1757
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,290
- Hey, why did you... - Hey, mister.

1758
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,230
- Come on, Director. I mean... - We should also...

1759
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,800
Hey, don't eat so much.

1760
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,130
We told you very discreetly.

1761
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,070
- You know? What? - And mister.

1762
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:16,600
If you're going to hike up more, pay for it out of pocket. Stop...

1763
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,740
We'll share with you guys. You need more food too, don't you?

1764
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,780
- Jong Kook is a growing boy. - No, we're nearly finished.

1765
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,040
- No, I'm all good too. - I'm full. You can eat the rest.

1766
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,110
- Hey, Jong Kook. - Yes?

1767
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,050
You should eat more protein.

1768
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:28,350
No, this is more than enough.

1769
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,920
Any more food you order from now on should be a personal hike.

1770
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:35,360
That lady from "Snowpiercer" is micromanaging us so much.

1771
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,360
- The lady from "Snowpiercer." - That lady is seriously so...

1772
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,360
Let's just eat as much as we want.

1773
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,130
Will they give us cola?

1774
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,100
- Cola. - We have to order it, right?

1775
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,930
- Will you order cola? - Yes.

1776
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:46,970
- Yes. - Yes.

1777
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,340
Please add two more colas.

1778
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,070
Who's ordering cola? Who is it?

1779
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,480
- It's Food Fighter. - You know how she is.

1780
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,010
- Let's see how you hike up later. - Yes?

1781
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,080
- The big man and I'll be up front. - That's right.

1782
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,350
You'll go on about how hard it is...

1783
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:02,520
- and ask, "Are we there yet?" - That's true.

1784
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,720
Right. They'll complain again.

1785
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,650
Right. It'll be the professor and Food Fighter.

1786
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,790
Yes, that's true.

1787
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,960
Let's climb up slowly. What is this?

1788
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,460
- We should get it over with. - Is it seaweed stems?

1789
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,890
- Isn't it garlic scapes? - And you shouldn't eat so much...

1790
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:14,860
- before you go hiking. - Oh, it's kimchi.

1791
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,760
- Eat just enough... - No one is listening.

1792
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,330
You should eat a lot after you hike back down.

1793
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:21,040
Also, let's not tally up all the orders.

1794
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,540
Let's pay separately by table.

1795
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,670
Let's just make sure of things.

1796
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,310
We should make them carry more stuff or something.

1797
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,850
You have to give them a penalty.

1798
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,550
How can we all do the same after they just...

1799
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,850
- That's right. - You know?

1800
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,950
- No, but we didn't eat a lot... - They're just unable to...

1801
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:38,720
- hold back their instincts. - Right.

1802
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,790
It makes no sense for us to share that burden.

1803
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,560
- A person should know to hold back. - Of course.

1804
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,960
We didn't eat that much, though.

1805
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,430
Good grief.

1806
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,360
Hey, but now that I think about it, I'm getting angry.

1807
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,170
Mister. There's only two of you over there.

1808
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,870
There's three of us here.

1809
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,340
And we have Food Fighter on top of that!

1810
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,140
- Oh, I can see why he's angry. - Yes.

1811
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,240
We agree.

1812
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,840
- Please understand. - You have Food Fighter.

1813
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,210
We have Food Fighter over here.

1814
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,210
Agreed.

1815
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,210
It's like we have five people at our table.

1816
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,380
Okay? She eats three servings by herself.

1817
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,450
- Gosh, I'm so mad. - Agreed.

1818
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:09,520
- Right? - We agree.

1819
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,790
- You're eating so well. - So far, your total bill...

1820
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,590
- is 230.5 dollars. - Okay.

1821
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:18,730
So far, your total bill is 230.5 dollars.

1822
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,860
But this is...

1823
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,300
You should get ready to shoot on Jeju Island.

1824
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:24,230
- This is so good. - It's good, right?

1825
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,330
At this rate, we'll have to climb Mount Halla.

1826
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,800
We'll round down...

1827
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,970
and add 40m to the altitude.

1828
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:34,340
- Okay. - Then, you'll have to climb up...

1829
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,210
to 310m to take the photo.

1830
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:39,780
Then, you'll have to climb up to 310m to take the photo.

1831
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,450
- How will we do that? - We can't!

1832
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:44,990
- No! - We have a group mission.

1833
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:47,620
- Oh, nice. - If you succeed in that mission,

1834
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,720
we'll lower your target altitude by 100m.

1835
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,790
Nice.

1836
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,430
We'll give you that.

1837
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:54,430
That's great.

1838
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,060
- We can do that. - We can do it.

1839
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,930
But a 100m difference will be huge.

1840
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,400
- Totally. - It's huge, Ji Hyo.

1841
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,440
All right. Stop!

1842
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,800
All right. Stop eating!

1843
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,270
- Take the tables out. - Are we taking them out?

1844
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,840
What is this?

1845
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,310
Gosh, as soon as we're done eating...

1846
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,680
We won't be asked to roll around, right?

1847
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,210
What's this? I'm so full.

1848
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,720
Seok Jin, shouldn't you wear pants?

1849
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,150
That's right. I forgot about your outfit.

1850
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,890
- Is it okay for the show? - You know,

1851
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,520
I forgot about his outfit...

1852
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,360
because he was sitting down.

1853
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:24,960
I thought a crane was moving back and forth.

1854
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,460
If you keep talking about me, they'll ask you to stop. Be quiet.

1855
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,500
- I'm sorry. - Seriously.

1856
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,170
He looks so skinny.

1857
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:34,540
It's your last chance...

1858
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,240
- to reduce the altitude by 100m. - Okay.

1859
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,010
You'll get a total of three attempts.

1860
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,880
While everyone is standing on the blanket,

1861
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,150
turn the blanket upside down to succeed in the mission.

1862
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,480
- With our feet? - It's a failure...

1863
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,650
if even one member's feet touch the ground during the process.

1864
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,390
- How will we turn it over? - If you fail...

1865
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:56,660
Will we be able to do that?

1866
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,730
- How will we do that? - Will we be able to do that?

1867
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,360
But they're using their hands.

1868
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,200
- You can use your hands. - Can we use our hands?

1869
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:06,300
If you fail, you'll need to film the TV rating notice...

1870
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,540
- at an altitude of 310m. - The altitude will be 310m.

1871
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:10,400
- At an altitude of 310m. - The altitude will be 310m.

1872
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,340
It won't be easy.

1873
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:13,740
- This mission... - Let's take off our shoes.

1874
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:14,910
I can't think of anything.

1875
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,180
We need to take off our socks too, right?

1876
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,310
I can't think of a strategy.

1877
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,080
- You don't need to take them off. - Seriously.

1878
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,110
- Jae Seok. - Come on in.

1879
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,950
We'll begin once everyone is on the blanket.

1880
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,950
- If your feet touch... - Firstly...

1881
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,750
- the red mat... - I see that I was dressed this way.

1882
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,090
- I looked down and thought, - You look quite pretty.

1883
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,190
"Why is there a skirt?"

1884
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,560
- I looked down and thought, - You look quite pretty.

1885
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,360
- "Why is there a skirt?" - Hold on a second.

1886
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,870
- if you ate garlic. - Who is it?

1887
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,900
- I looked down and thought... - You look quite pretty.

1888
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,400
Hold on a second. Raise your hand if you ate garlic.

1889
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,070
- Who is it? - Be honest.

1890
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,510
You ate it, right? For goodness' sake.

1891
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:48,140
- Hey. - Your breath reeks...

1892
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,440
- of garlic. - Why did you eat garlic?

1893
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,210
- Why did you eat garlic? - The smell is too strong.

1894
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,680
I ate both garlic and green onion.

1895
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,080
- The smell is too strong. - How should we do this?

1896
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,780
Come on up.

1897
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,620
Let's do a cheer.

1898
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,590
- Come on up. - I want to take a dump.

1899
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:01,660
Let's do a cheer.

1900
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,490
Apparently, someone wants to take a dump.

1901
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,430
- Who? Who wants to take a dump? - Who is it?

1902
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:07,290
- I'm sorry. - Who is it?

1903
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,560
You reek of garlic.

1904
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,600
- From the top and bottom... - For goodness' sake.

1905
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,270
I didn't know that we had a team mission.

1906
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:13,530
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Why are we doing this?

1907
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,770
- Why are we doing this? - Why are we doing this?

1908
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:16,940
Why are we doing rock-paper-scissors?

1909
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,410
- You told us to do it. - When did I do that?

1910
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:21,280
- He told us to do a cheer. - A cheer.

1911
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,340
- He told us to do a cheer. - A cheer.

1912
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,680
- He's out of it. - What's wrong with you?

1913
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,880
- Se Chan. - Get a grip.

1914
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,080
- But... - What's wrong with you?

1915
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,280
- He's out of it. - What's wrong with you?

1916
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,480
- Se Chan. - Get a grip.

1917
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,790
- But... - What's wrong with you?

1918
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,990
- One, two, three. Let's go! - One, two, three. Let's go!

1919
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,020
- Come on up. - Who started rock-paper-scissors?

1920
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,430
- Shall I start from here? - That's right.

1921
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:39,460
- Jae Seok. - Come on.

1922
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,200
- Fold it and cross over. - Jae Seok.

1923
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,230
- Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

1924
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,500
Balance yourself.

1925
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,200
- Hold on. - Balance yourself.

1926
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,400
- A little at a time. - This is practice, right?

1927
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,900
- We're doing it for real. - Really?

1928
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,100
Little by little,

1929
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,640
- fold it and cross over. - This is your first attempt.

1930
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,840
There isn't a time limit, right?

1931
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,580
- Cross over. - Firstly...

1932
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,980
- Hold on. - Should we stand on tiptoes?

1933
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,150
- All right. - All right.

1934
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:00,110
Jae Seok, cross over.

1935
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:02,920
- And... - No.

1936
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,890
After crossing over, we need to start from there.

1937
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:06,420
Shouldn't we switch positions?

1938
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,460
- Come to this side. - Now, people in the back...

1939
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,720
- Which way is it? - Hold on.

1940
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,260
- Let me push it with my feet. - Shall I fold this corner?

1941
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,460
- Push it with your feet. - We'll succeed in it.

1942
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,560
- Hold on. - We'll succeed in it.

1943
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,760
- We'll succeed in it easily. - Hold on.

1944
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,030
- Now... - We'll succeed in it.

1945
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,030
- We'll succeed in it easily. - Hold on.

1946
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:18,100
People who can go on it...

1947
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,070
All of us need to stand on half of the blanket.

1948
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,770
People at the front should grab as much of it as they can.

1949
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,670
I'll pull it. Pull it with your feet.

1950
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,140
- That's right. - Grab it with your toes.

1951
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,970
- Grab the front. That's right. - Pull it.

1952
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,110
- Hold on. We need space. - Seok Jin.

1953
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,380
This is... Hold on. I'm sorry.

1954
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,510
This is... Hold on. I'm sorry.

1955
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,980
You need to hug him more.

1956
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,620
- You need to hug him more. - What?

1957
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:40,220
- I'm really nervous right now. - Hold on.

1958
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,260
Now...

1959
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,090
- Gosh, someone reeks of garlic. - I'm sorry.

1960
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,860
- It's Se Chan. - Se Chan.

1961
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,290
- Gosh, this way... Hold on. - I'm sorry.

1962
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,660
- This is driving me crazy. - Gosh,

1963
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,830
- this way... Hold on. - I'm sorry.

1964
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,570
- Gosh, this way... Hold on. - I'm sorry.

1965
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,870
Let's pull the blanket like this.

1966
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,270
Like this.

1967
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,070
- I can't look down. - Shouldn't it come like this?

1968
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,240
- I can't see. - You need to look down.

1969
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,670
- I can't see. - Like this.

1970
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,280
- Ye Eun, come closer. - Ji Hyo.

1971
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,210
- I can't look down. - Shouldn't it come like this?

1972
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,780
- I can't see. - You need to look down.

1973
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,150
- I can't see. - I can't see.

1974
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:08,350
Shall we jump on the count of three?

1975
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,120
- No. - No, we can't jump.

1976
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,390
Shall we jump on the count of three?

1977
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,050
- No. - No, we can't jump.

1978
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,420
Haha and Jae Seok.

1979
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,660
- Do you want us to jump? - But...

1980
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:16,820
- One... - This...

1981
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:17,890
Hold on. Let me grab it.

1982
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:19,360
One, two, three.

1983
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,760
- You did it. - I pulled it a bit.

1984
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,260
One, two, three.

1985
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,770
- You did it. - I pulled it a bit.

1986
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,330
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1987
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,040
- There you go. - I pulled it.

1988
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,670
- There you go. - I pulled it.

1989
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:31,840
- It hurts. - Let's go.

1990
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,370
Keep going forward that way.

1991
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,440
- Hold on. - One...

1992
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,610
- All right. - Hold on.

1993
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,380
One...

1994
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,150
- One... - What exactly do you want to do?

1995
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:41,150
- What exactly do you want to do? - What are you planning to do?

1996
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,180
Which part are you working on?

1997
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,180
- This side hasn't been turned over. - Are we going this way?

1998
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,050
- Why is Seok Jin leading? - I mean,

1999
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,020
- Seok Jin wants to push through. - We're crossing over.

2000
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,260
- We're crossing over. - Jong Kook.

2001
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,130
- Why is Seok Jin leading? - I mean, Seok Jin...

2002
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:53,290
- wants to push through. - We're crossing over. Hold on.

2003
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,630
- Not yet. - I think that's the way to go.

2004
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:56,730
Right?

2005
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,530
- We came a long way. - I get it.

2006
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,230
- All right. As much as you can... - Wait.

2007
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,540
- Seok Jin. - Go to the other side now.

2008
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:03,400
- Then we'll be done. - Use your hands.

2009
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,640
- Pull it out. - Pull it out.

2010
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,770
- Jump. One, two, three. - One, two, three.

2011
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,340
- Jump. One more time. - No. Do it again.

2012
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,040
- Jump. One, two, three. - One, two, three.

2013
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,550
- Jump. One more time. - No. Do it again.

2014
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,450
- One, two, three. - Okay.

2015
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,580
Seok Jin, you need to jump.

2016
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:15,820
- Whose feet are these? - Mine.

2017
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,080
- Seok Jin's. - We can't do it.

2018
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,020
- My back hurts too much to jump. - We can't do it.

2019
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:20,620
My back hurts too much to jump.

2020
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,620
- You need to jump. One foot. - Don't be ridiculous.

2021
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,730
- Jump. Okay. - One foot.

2022
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,330
One, two, three. Jump.

2023
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,460
- Jump. - Okay.

2024
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,460
One, two, three.
- Jump. - Jump.

2025
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,570
One, two, three.

2026
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:32,700
- Jump. - There you go.

2027
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,370
- We can't do it. - My back hurts too much to jump.

2028
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,670
We can't do it. There isn't enough space.

2029
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,640
- One... Whose feet are these? - Mine.

2030
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,370
- Whose feet are these? - We can't do it.

2031
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,910
- We can't do it. - My back hurts too much to jump.

2032
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,350
We can't do it. There isn't enough space.

2033
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,250
- Move just one foot then. - One, two, three.

2034
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,650
One, two, three. Jump.

2035
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:50,050
- Jump. - Move just one foot then.

2036
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,850
One, two, three. Jump. There you go.

2037
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:52,890
- Jump. - One foot.

2038
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,290
- Jump. - One foot.

2039
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,690
- Ji Hyo's foot went out. - Ji Hyo.

2040
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:00,060
I couldn't help it. I was on the edge.

2041
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,060
- It's too hard. - It's too narrow.

2042
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,060
It's too narrow.

2043
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,670
I think one person should hold someone up.

2044
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,270
- Someone should do that. - That way...

2045
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,270
- The bodies go over to the side. - One person's feet will be up.

2046
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:10,470
- A piggyback ride? - Excuse me.

2047
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,170
- Ye Eun, why are you laughing? - What?

2048
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,250
Hey, I took it off for the mission.

2049
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,120
- It's funny indeed. - I know. It's funny.

2050
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,480
I took it off for the mission.

2051
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,220
- That's right. - Well done.

2052
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,890
Why did you make me wear this outfit?

2053
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,290
People will see it for a year.

2054
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,820
Well done.

2055
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,390
- Stop it. - What should we do?

2056
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,300
From both sides,

2057
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,060
- we should pull the blanket. - That's right.

2058
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,170
On both sides, we should stand like this.

2059
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,630
- Then we just need to pull it. - Yes.

2060
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,700
- Let's do it. I understood. - It'll work.

2061
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,370
- Watch. - I'll grab it and give it to you.

2062
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:46,410
- Okay? - All right.

2063
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:48,280
I'll stand in the middle. Hold me for support.

2064
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,640
- You need to stand here. - Okay.

2065
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,680
- Someone heavy should be here. - Yes.

2066
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,850
- Grab me as if I'm a column. - Watch.

2067
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,880
- Grab me. - Let's go.

2068
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,280
- Let's begin. - Hey, Food Fighter.

2069
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,550
- Grab me. - Where?

2070
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:59,890
Grab my clothes.

2071
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,460
- Fold that side. - Yes.

2072
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,790
- Let's begin. - Hey, Food Fighter.

2073
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:03,790
- Fold that corner. - Grab me.

2074
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:04,830
- Grab my clothes. - Grab me.

2075
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:06,660
- You can do it. There's space. - Grab it.

2076
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,730
Grab the bottom.

2077
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:10,500
- Haha. - Put it between my toes.

2078
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,070
- I'm using my hands. - Is that so?

2079
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,570
- Jong Kook, come on up. - Done.

2080
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:15,140
- All right. - Your feet should come on up.

2081
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,340
- One... Come on up. - Good.

2082
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,670
- A bit more. - Come on up.

2083
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,680
Move your feet once more. Okay.

2084
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,080
- Cross over. - Should I take off my socks...

2085
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,480
- to use my toes? - Grab it.

2086
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,510
- I'll grab the other side. - Should I take off my socks?

2087
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:27,780
- Yes. - I have my pose. Watch.

2088
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,080
- Shall we fold it in half? - All right.

2089
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,120
- Watch. - Okay.

2090
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,990
- We got this. - Grab me tight.

2091
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:35,960

01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,830
- Grab me tight. - Grab his hair.

2093
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:39,090
Okay. I'll grab you like this.

01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:43,230
- Hey. - I got you. Don't worry.

2095
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,500
- I got you. - Grab his clothes.

2096
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,870

2097
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,900
- We won't let go. - Grab his clothes. That's it.

2098
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,510
We won't let go.

2099
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,770
- What's going on? - We're set.

2100
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:59,610
- Jump. One, two, three. Jump. - I'll grab you.

2101
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:01,280
- Who is this? Jong Kook? - Okay. It'll work.

2102
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,520
- It might work. - One, two, three.

2103
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,880
- Jump. - I'm not...

2104
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,220
- I... - Hey.

2105
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,390
Take this off.

2106
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,760
Grab me.

2107
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,660
- Grab me. - Jong Kook.

2108
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,060
Take this off.

01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,460
- Who is at that corner? - Me.

- It's me. - The other side.

2112
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:17,200
Ye Eun needs to grab the corner and pull it.

2113
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,200
- What do I need to grab? - The other side.

2114
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,470
Hold on. Jong Kook, wait.

2115
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,970
Come on.

2116
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,170

01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,040
Good. This part is folded.

2120
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,310
The left corner needs to be pulled.

2121
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,880
- Did you get it? - It's folded.

2122
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,080
- It's done. Now, fold the front. - Is it folded?

2123
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,080
- Is it done? - Yes.

2124
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,220
- As we turn this over, - Hey.

2125
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,950
Se Chan needs to step on it.

2126
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:38,990
- That's right. - Both feet.

2127
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:40,320
- I'll push my feet further inside. - Here.

2128
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,460
Come. It needs to come.

2129
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,660
Yes. Pull it.

2130
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,290
One, two, three.

2131
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,090
Pull it. Go on top of it.

2132
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,630
- Put your foot on it. - All right.

2133
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:48,730
- Pull it. - There you go.

2134
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:50,260
- No, Seok Jin. - I'll put my foot on it.

2135
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,330
- Pull it. - There you go.

2136
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,870
- No, Seok Jin. - I'll put my foot on it.

2137
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:54,130
Well done.

2138
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,140
- Did you put your foot on it? - Yes, I did it.

2139
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,700
- Did you do it? Good. - I put my foot on it.

2140
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,740
Well done.

2141
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,110
- Did you put your foot on it? - Yes,

2142
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,210
- I did it. - Did you do it? Good.

2143
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,240
- I put my foot on it. - I...

2144
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,310
- Let's move on. - Right now,

2145
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,810
Seok Jin's butt is the only thing I can grab.

2146
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:09,080
I'll grab you. Hold on.

2147
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,250
- We're nearly done. - I'll grab you.

2148
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,090
I'm about to get a cramp in my toes.

2149
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,390
Go up there.

2150
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,460
Who does this for fun?

2151
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:17,690
- Why are we doing this? - Who is it?

2152
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:18,890
Good. Now,

2153
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,390
- put yourself at ease. - Se Chan's and my feet are on it.

2154
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,760
- Se Chan, I got you. - We're nearly there.

2155
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,960
Hold on. I'll use my hands.

2156
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,770
- Come here. - Grab me.

2157
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,700
- I got you. Don't worry. - One,

2158
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,270
two... Hold on. Is my underwear going down?

2159
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:30,970
- You're fine. - It isn't going down, right?

2160
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:33,110
- We're dressed like this too. - One, two, three.

2161
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:34,910
- One, two, three. - Whose foot is this?

2162
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,840
- Go up on the white side. - Professor, you need to lift it up.

2163
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,680
- Go up on the white side. - Professor, you need to lift it up.

2164
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,850
- One... - You need to lift it up.

2165
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,380
You need to lift it up.

2166
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:42,850
It's okay.

2167
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,290
- It's okay. - Grab me.

2168
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,520
Grab me.

2169
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:50,020
One, two, three.

2170
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,360
One, two... Oh, no.

2171
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,960
I feel like I'm going to fart. This is bad.

2172
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,260
I feel like I'm going to fart. This is bad.

2173
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,500
It's this one.

2174
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,400
- I feel like I'm going to fart. - Hold on.

2175
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,570
- Don't fart. - Pull your hip out.

2176
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,570
If you fart, I'll just give up.

2177
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,740
- It's going to come out. - I'm sorry.

2178
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:06,570
- I need to use the restroom. - It's too funny.

2179
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:08,280
- All right. - I'm serious. Don't fart.

2180
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,410
- It's so funny. - Here. Pull it out.

2181
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,480
- All right. - What happened?

2182
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,910
- Se Chan, come on up. That's it. - Yes?

2183
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:14,150
- Come on up. One... - That's it.

2184
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:15,920
- I'm on it. - You're on it, right?

2185
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,750
- I'm on it. - You're on it, right?

2186
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,920
- Okay. - I did it.

2187
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,090
- Hold out. - All right.

2188
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,860
- Grab me. - Okay. I got you.

2189
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:22,960
- Hold tight. - Okay.

2190
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,890
- Don't fart. - Okay.

2191
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,760
- It's okay. - I did it.

2192
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:28,700
- Don't fart. - Okay.

2193
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,760
- It's okay. - I did it. Okay.

2194
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,800
- What's going on? - I did it.

2195
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,300
- Good. - I pulled it out.

2196
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,430
Now... Hold on.

2197
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,840
- We need to do well now. - We got this.

2198
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,070
- Calm down. - Jong Kook.

2199
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,040
- Move it. - Jong Kook.

2200
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,170
- Get ready. - I got this.

2201
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,480
- Hold on. - Come to your senses.

2202
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,110
If we fail this time, we won't succeed in it.

2203
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:45,780
- Get ready. - Let's get it done this time.

2204
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,350
- All right. - The other side.

2205
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,520
- Grab this. - Grab this.

2206
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,020
- Here we go. - Shall I grab it here?

2207
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,720
- I crossed over completely. - I'll pull it out.

2208
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,720
I crossed over to the other side.

2209
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,690
- I can't see. - Hold on.

2210
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,520
- Grab it. - Move your feet first.

2211
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,230
Move your feet. Put them on the white side.

2212
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:00,890
- Move your feet to the white side. - Move your feet.

2213
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,030
- I did it. - Come up on the white side.

2214
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,060
It's a small patch.

2215
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,570
Step on my feet.

2216
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:05,870
- Step on his feet. - It's a small patch.

2217
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:08,170
- Step on my feet. - Step on his feet.

2218
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:11,070
- Step on my feet. - Hold on. I'll move.

2219
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:13,210
- Jump. - Don't put it here.

2220
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,810
- Hey, Ye Eun. - All right.

2221
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,540
All right. Whose foot is this?

2222
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,280
- Jae Seok. - What should I do?

2223
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,950
- All done. - All done?

2224
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,580
- Don't put it here. - All right.

2225
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,550
Okay. Here, Jae Seok.

2226
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,820
- Ji Hyo. - Step here and spread it out.

2227
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,150
- Ji Hyo. - Step here and spread it out.

2228
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:29,220
- Let go. - Step on it.

2229
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,960
Hold on. Whose foot is this?

2230
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,590
Okay. Here, Jae Seok.

2231
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,360
- Step here and spread it out. - Let go.

2232
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,830
- Let go. - Step on it.

2233
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,530
- Where? - It's right here.

2234
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,100
- Where? - It's right here.

2235
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:40,800
- There you go. - We're nearly done.

2236
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,700
- Are you done? - We must succeed in it this time.

2237
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,370
- Are you done? - Hold on.

2238
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,870
- All done. - Make it rectangular.

2239
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,640
- All right. - Hold on.

2240
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,310
- Ye Eun. - Hold on.

2241
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,710
- Ji Hyo. - Ye Eun, your feet.

2242
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:52,810
- Ye Eun, move. - Ye Eun, your feet.

2243
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:54,280
- All done. - Ye Eun, move.

2244
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,280
I moved.

2245
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,750
- Ye Eun, move. - Ye Eun, your feet. All done.

2246
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:59,850
- You succeeded in the mission. - Okay!

2247
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,890
Okay!

2248
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:05,960
- We did it. - Okay.

2249
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,530
Okay!

2250
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,760
- We did it. - We did it.

2251
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,470
- We did it. - Okay.

2252
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,370
Hey, we did it.

2253
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:16,270
- My goodness. - We did it.

2254
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:17,970
Hey, we did it.

2255
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,840
We're Running Man.

2256
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,340
My eyes are stinging.

2257
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,010
- Hurrah. - It was a garlic attack.

2258
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:27,310
- Thus, - We did it.

2259
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,620
- you succeeded in it. - No way.

2260
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,550
You'll film a TV rating notice...

2261
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,190
- at an altitude of 210m. - We did it.

2262
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,290
Okay.

2263
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:35,620
- It was so hard. - We held out.

2264
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:36,860
- I can't believe we did it. - We did it.

2265
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,960
I'm exhausted.

2266
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,900
- Gosh! - What was that?

2267
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,130
- Gosh! - What was that?

2268
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,170
It burst open.

2269
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,370
- Your outfit is already funny. - Look.

2270
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,040
- What is it? - What happened?

2271
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,350
His underwear is visible.

2272
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,010
- It's so funny. - I'm full.

2273
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,250
I can't believe we did it.

2274
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,250
Now that the sun is up, it's warm.

2275
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,950
It's nice to go up the mountain

2276
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,390
The wind blows

2277
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:08,590
My goodness.

2278
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:10,320
We're going to Mount Yongma.

2279
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,630
- Mount Yongma. - Mount Yongma?

2280
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:13,630
Mount Yongma.

2281
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,300
It's my first time visiting Mount Yongma.

2282
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:18,430
You know, you guys ate a lot of food earlier.

2283
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,700
When you go up,

2284
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,400
don't say to Hyung In and the production crew,

2285
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,270
"Can't we just film it here?"

2286
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,470
- You shouldn't say that. - That's...

2287
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,940
- If you say that, - You shouldn't say that.

2288
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,840
I won't care if you're older or younger than me.

2289
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,740
- Who would do that? - I'll slap you.

2290
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:31,850
Same here.

2291
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,010
I'll slap you.

2292
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,310
Same here.

2293
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,680
Where will you slap this person?

2294
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,750
- The cheek. - The right cheek?

2295
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:37,850
Seriously.

2296
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,450
- Left or right? - Right.

2297
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,390
- Then I'll slap the left cheek. - Okay.

2298
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,920
Seriously, I won't stay still.

2299
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,660
- Like this? - I won't stay still.

2300
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,090
- Seriously, I won't stay still. - Me neither.

2301
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:47,430
I won't stay still. Tell me in advance.

2302
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:49,330
Seok Jin, you'll slap this person too.

2303
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:50,400
- Well, sure. - Right?

2304
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,800
Someone who says that needs a scolding.

2305
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:54,130
- I won't stay still. - Will there be such a person?

2306
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,440
- We're here. - We arrived at the place

2307
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,910
It's my first time visiting Mount Yongma.

2308
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:03,680
You'll film a TV rating notice at Mount Yongma.

2309
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,880
The summit of Mount Yongma is at an altitude of 348m.

2310
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,680
- Okay. - We'll only reach...

2311
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,350
- the altitude of 210m... - It'll still be hard.

2312
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:14,620
- to film the TV rating notice. - Okay. It's 210m.

2313
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,190
It'll still be hard.

2314
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,960
Carry the flowers you bought to the altitude...

2315
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:23,830
and film a TV rating notice with the spring vibe.

2316
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:25,330
- It's so cold. - Gosh.

2317
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:26,500
It's cold.

2318
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,900
- Why did it have to be today? - Seriously.

2319
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,100
All right.

2320
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,970
It has been a while since I went hiking.

2321
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,170
- Follow me. - Go.

2322
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,440
I want to take a dump.

2323
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,510
There's a hiking trail.

2324
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,080
It's nice to go up like this.

2325
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,120
- It's so nice. - It'll stop being nice.

2326
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,190
Really?

2327
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,320
It even smells nice.

2328
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:49,320
- It's the smell of the mountain. - Phytoncide.

2329
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:50,920
This is easy.

2330
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,130
This is totally easy.

2331
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,860
- Hurry up. - There are stairs.

2332
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:00,670
There are stairs. Stairs.

2333
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,570
- Stairs. - I hate stairs.

2334
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,370
- My goodness. - Stairs.

2335
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,910
Some of us will get sick tomorrow.

2336
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,040
Jae Seok, slow down.

2337
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,710
We'll need to hike for a while to reach the altitude of 200m.

2338
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:12,110
- Seriously. Why... - It might be good for the back.

2339
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:13,810
We need to go slowly.

2340
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,180
- That way, - Gosh, this is...

2341
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,350
- we'll last long. - That's right.

2342
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,080
- We should take our time. - Yes.

2343
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,890
- That's how you hike. - We shouldn't go too fast...

2344
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:21,020
in the beginning, right?

2345
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,120
Don't use your knees.

2346
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,620
- Use your hip joints. - Okay.

2347
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:25,890
Flex your lower abs.

2348
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:28,400
Hiking down will be a problem.

2349
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,700
Would you please say, "We're here?"

2350
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,200
I'll do it later. It's too early on.

2351
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,240
- I'll slap you. - I want to hear it.

2352
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,510
Gosh, this is...

2353
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:40,140
Slow down.

2354
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,550
Be careful.

2355
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,590
- Ji Ye Eun! - Yes?

2356
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:55,620
You're going up nicely.

2357
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,490
- You must've hiked before. - Thank you.

2358
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,430
How are you so good at it?

2359
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:01,030
He's very fast.

2360
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,970
The mountain is so high.

2361
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,040
There goes Ye Eun.

2362
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,370
The mountain is so high. Seriously.

2363
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:16,880
There goes Ye Eun.

2364
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,650
Hey, it's quite steep.

2365
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,880
Why is it so steep?

2366
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,880
This isn't an easy hike.

2367
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:25,220
This isn't half-hearted.

2368
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,120
Look at this.

2369
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,590
- It's so steep. - The stairs aren't even...

2370
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:32,030
like the ones at Mount Cheonggye.

2371
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,300
I'm using my legs only.

2372
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,760
How much further are we going up?

2373
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,870
Why is the slope so steep?

2374
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,210
Hold on. Didn't we agree to slap anyone who said that?

2375
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,710
- Already? - Cut us some slack.

2376
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:50,810
Already?

2377
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:52,780
Why are we walking up so much?

2378
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,510
Use your butt muscles.

2379
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:56,450
Sir,

2380
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:58,520
how many jackets are you wearing?

2381
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,850
- How much further are we going up? - Let's go up.

2382
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:01,960
Let's go.

2383
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,590
- It's so windy. - Let's go.

2384
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,160
Let's go. Ji Ye Eun, let's go.

2385
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:09,960
It's so...

2386
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:13,830
Hey, keep going.

2387
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,840
Ye Eun isn't going.

2388
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,840
- Why? - I mean...

2389
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:19,370
- It'll take forever to hike down. - Hurry up and keep going.

2390
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:21,610
Hey.

2391
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:24,710
You said you were good at hiking.

2392
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:26,750
I used to enjoy hiking.

2393
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,620
- You enjoy hiking. - I enjoy hiking.

2394
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:30,350
- Hurry up, Ye Eun. - It wasn't this type of hiking.

2395
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,190
What type of hiking was it then?

2396
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,750
This isn't my idea of hiking.

2397
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:34,890
Hurry up.

2398
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,320
Why is Ye Eun so funny?

2399
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,520
Ye Eun!

2400
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,630
Ye Eun isn't going.

2401
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:40,890
Hurry up.

2402
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,430
How much further are we going?

2403
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:43,430
Seok Jin.

2404
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,630
- Jong Kook. - Let's go.

2405
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:49,740
- My back will get ruined. - Let's go.

2406
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,770
- Running Man is so difficult. - All right.

2407
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,980
I have so much respect for the senior members.

2408
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:59,050
Ye Eun.

2409
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:01,750
- Jong Kook, let's... - Let's go.

2410
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,980
Let's take a short break!

2411
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,090
Ye Eun.

2412
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:06,320
- It'll be harder if you rest. - Water.

2413
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,590
I need to drink water.

2414
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,890
Ye Eun, what are you doing? Hey.

2415
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,390
Jae Seok!

2416
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,030
Ye Eun stopped. She sat down.

2417
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,260
Food Fighter!

2418
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,430
Food Fighter, get up.

2419
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:20,330
- Let me drink water. - Food Fighter.

2420
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:21,970
Food Fighter!

2421
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:24,440
I'm so exhausted.

2422
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:26,440
Food Fighter.

2423
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:30,240
- Ye Eun is so funny. - Food Fighter is drinking water.

2424
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,510
- That's enough. Get up. - Food Fighter.

2425
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,210
Get up!

2426
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:37,950
- Close the cap now. - I can't believe her.

2427
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,050
Stop.

2428
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:40,820
Food Fighter, stop.

2429
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,060
Food Fighter, stop.

2430
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,690
- Nice. - Is Food Fighter eating again?

2431
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:48,330
Food Fighter, I found some kudzu roots.

2432
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,730
- Did you say chicory? - Food Fighter.

2433
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:52,400
- Food Fighter is no joke. - I just drank water.

2434
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,970
- All done. - Let's go, Food Fighter.

2435
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,470
I waited for you, Seok Jin.

2436
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:56,770
- Hey. - What?

2437
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,940
- Food Fighter, - Food Fighter.

2438
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,040
you should've stayed longer.

2439
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,240
- I wanted to rest too. - Food Fighter, hurry up.

2440
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,440
- Take a break. - Keep going.

2441
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,710
Seok Jin, don't push yourself.

2442
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,280
What's the current percentage?

2443
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,350
How far did we come?

2444
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:07,650
- What? - We climbed about 40m.

2445
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:09,480
- Forty? - What?

2446
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,950
- Forty? - What?

2447
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,220
- We came 40m? - We came 40m?

2448
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,390
It's not an easy course.

2449
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:16,660
We came 40m?

2450
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,230
Why did you plan it like this?

2451
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,830
We came quite far.

2452
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,600
- We climbed 40m? - Yes.

2453
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,960
Why did you plan it like this?

2454
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,970
Keep going.

2455
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,100
What? Why are you zooming in on me?

2456
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,240
What? Why are you zooming in on me?

2457
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:36,040
Do you think you can do it, Food Fighter?

2458
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,680
How is this 40m?

2459
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:40,810
So quickly go up.

2460
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,150
When are we going to come back?

2461
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,550
These aren't the stairs that I had in mind.

2462
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,790
- I thought they were wood. - I didn't think it'd be so steep.

2463
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,490
If I fart or anything while going up, please understand.

2464
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:51,490
Okay.

2465
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,830
- Don't say anything even if I fart. - Me too.

2466
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:56,360
- Let's pretend we didn't hear. - Okay? I'll just fart.

2467
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:01,900
I think it's getting digested.

2468
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:02,970
I already drank three times.

2469
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:04,900
It wouldn't matter since I'm at the very end.

2470
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,010
You'd smell the fart if you stay behind me. Hurry up.

2471
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:08,610
If it smells here...

2472
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:10,810
I can't even fart.

2473
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:11,910
Don't lie.

2474
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,480
You can do it.

2475
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,120
What?

2476
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,160
I'm sorry.

2477
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,230
Don't stay behind me.

2478
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:27,260
- Don't fart. - I'm sorry.

2479
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,700
This is so nice.

2480
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,430
This is why people hike.

2481
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:36,600
The hiking trail is very good.

2482
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,770
- It's... - It's dynamic.

2483
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:39,770
That's right. It's more than I thought.

2484
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,640
People who hike like such places.

2485
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,180
This isn't an easy course.

2486
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:46,850
It goes up and down.

2487
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,820
What sound is that? The stairs.

2488
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,120
There are stairs.

2489
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:54,820
This is trouble.

2490
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,820
You can't go up if there are no stairs.

2491
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,560
If you go up the stairs, it's 200m.

2492
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,760
Going up is difficult.

2493
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,030
Why are there so many stairs?

2494
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:05,600
My legs are getting a workout.

2495
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,700
This isn't easy.

2496
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,740
It's quite high.

2497
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:14,440
Hyung In.

2498
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:16,180
Are you crying?

2499
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,610
Are you crying?

2500
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:20,550
You can't go, right? Get some rest.

2501
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,810
What are you doing?

2502
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:23,820
You shouldn't do this, Hyung In.

2503
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,960
This isn't right.

2504
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:33,530
- Shall we go? - Shall we?

2505
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:37,960
You can see the whole view of Seoul.

2506
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:42,170
It's so nice here. It's amazing.

2507
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:43,640
It's so amazing.

2508
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,710
Do you normally exercise?

2509
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,270
Me? I use the stairs.

2510
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,180
- I take walks because of Hotteok. - You seem like you walk a lot.

2511
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:51,980
It's because I take walks with Hotteok.

2512
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:55,620
- This is nice. - It's really amazing.

2513
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:56,880
This is the charm of hiking.

2514
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:10,960
I'm sorry.

2515
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,100
I'm sorry.

2516
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,040
I'm sorry.

2517
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:24,710
From now on

2518
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:28,850
- There will be no smiling - No smiling

2519
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,920
Look at the steep path

2520
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,290
There are wooden stairs.

2521
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,390
There are wooden stairs.

2522
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,930
It's hot.

2523
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:42,330
Is it steep?

2524
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:43,700
Slightly.

2525
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,630
Can I order something other than coffee?

2526
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:47,730
We need to eat one too.

2527
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,570
- Let's eat one. - Let's eat.

2528
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,870
- Let's eat. - Let's eat.

2529
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:54,870
This is delicious.

2530
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:01,010
Let me give you a tip on how to hike.

2531
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:04,520
Don't wear thick clothes. Wear several layers...

2532
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:08,350
of thin clothes. You can take them off one by one.

2533
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:12,790
Do we usually go to the extreme to film the TV rating notice?

2534
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:14,630
- Right? - I think so.

2535
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,400
This place is interesting.

2536
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,400
This place is interesting.

2537
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:21,730
It's an interesting hiking trail. Very good.

2538
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,140
Look at this. This is fun.

2539
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:27,870
It's easy to step on the rocks.

2540
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:31,480
Look at this, Jae Seok.

2541
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,250
- Goodness. - Goodness.

2542
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:35,620
The view is amazing.

2543
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,520
- We're here. - I guess this is here.

2544
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,650
It's so nice here.

2545
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:40,590
It's nice. It's amazing.

2546
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:42,720
We have the whole view of Seoul.

2547
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,530
It's really amazing.

2548
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,830
There's still snow there.

2549
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,900
- It's awesome. - You can see it here and there.

2550
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,730
It's really amazing.

2551
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,030
It is awesome.

2552
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,170
- Ye Eun. - Yes?

2553
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,940
Do you think life...

2554
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:02,340
is really tough...

2555
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,380
like walking up these stairs? What do you think?

2556
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,350
Life is tough.

2557
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:08,880
- But when you go past the hill, - Yes.

2558
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,520
- Shall we rest a bit? - it feels worthwhile.

2559
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:11,550
I want to rest a bit.

2560
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:14,820
Ye Eun.

2561
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,020
You shouldn't rest when you want to rest...

2562
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:19,890
if you want to go ahead of others.

2563
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:22,360
Ye Eun!

2564
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:24,460
Okay!

2565
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:27,330
Don't get tired, Ye Eun.

2566
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:29,970
Don't lose to the world, Ye Eun!

2567
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,740
Why is he so fast?

2568
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:36,610
This isn't about being young or old.

2569
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:39,210
This is amazing.

2570
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:41,010
This is nice.

2571
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,750
Jae Seok's clothes are...

2572
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:48,220
I look like an influencer, right?

2573
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,360
- Amazing. - Yes.

2574
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,520
I go around the peaks of the mountains all around the world.

2575
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,430
- You climb them in such clothes. - Yes.

2576
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:56,960
Are we filming it from here?

2577
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,600
What will be the background?

2578
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,700
I think it would be nice to have the ridge shown.

2579
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,440
You have to take it off.

2580
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,710
I should.

2581
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:08,980
This is amazing. We came up here.

2582
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:11,440
It's like we came to a tomb.

2583
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,780
- What? - Right.

2584
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:14,010
- Isn't it? - Yes.

2585
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:15,520
It feels like I have to bow.

2586
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,050
It's cold.

2587
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,420
Like this?

2588
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:24,560
It's so funny. I want to take pictures.

2589
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:27,230
- Pass by. - Come here.

2590
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:28,760
It's okay. I apologize. You can pass by.

2591
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,130
We're not weird people.

2592
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:31,330
Today, we're...

2593
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:33,700
- We're sorry. - I'm sorry.

2594
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,640
- Is it so important to film this? - I'm sorry.

2595
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,100
- I'm sorry. - We'll keep moving.

2596
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,670
Yes. We'll end it soon.

2597
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:40,410
We look ridiculous...

2598
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:42,070
- You know the line, right? - Yes.

2599
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:44,110
- Running Man... - Is suitable for 15 or older.

2600
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,910
This is suitable for 15 or older, right?

2601
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:49,050
- It is, right? - Won't the children cry?

2602
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,820
- Where is Running Man? - Try to make it look...

2603
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,450
- like it's for spring. - Okay.

2604
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:53,790
- For spring... - Okay!

2605
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:54,820
Try to make it look like that.

2606
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,960
Ready...

2607
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:58,460
- Where should I look? - Running Man...

2608
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:00,130
- Come closer. - Ready...

2609
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:01,130
Let's laugh at the end.
Cue!

2610
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,130
Running Man...

2611
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:05,700
- is suitable for 15 or older. - Is suitable for 15 or older.

2612
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:08,570
- is suitable for 15 or older. - Is suitable for 15 or older.

2613
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:13,340
Running Man...

2614
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,540
- is suitable for 15 or older. - Is suitable for 15 or older.

2615
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,880
Okay.

2616
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,180
So, we've filmed...

2617
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:27,890
the TV rating notice for 2025.

2618
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:30,220
- What is this? - What is this?

2619
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:32,020
- Are you out of your mind? - This is really...

2620
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:33,760
- The outfit... - Does it make sense...

2621
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,390
- to use this the whole year? - What will we do with this?

2622
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:36,800
It feels refreshing to take my clothes off...

2623
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,430
- up here. - It's nice.

2624
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,470
- You... - It's nice.

2625
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:42,270
- I could find someone like you. - Right.

2626
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,110
Well done filming the TV rating notice.

2627
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:48,340
- Yes. - We just have to climb down, right?

2628
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:49,980
- Yes. - I'll announce the final rule...

2629
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,110
for going down the mountain.

2630
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:52,350
- What is it? - What?

2631
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,480
I'll announce the final rule...

2632
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,750
- for going down the mountain. - What is it?

2633
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,720
- What? - What?

2634
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,320
You will each have a dice.

2635
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:03,060
You will roll the dice and only those who get "climb down..."

2636
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,090
can climb down.

2637
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:07,890
Only those who get "climb down" can climb down.

2638
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:10,830
Those who fail to get it will climb 20m more...

2639
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:12,930
- No! - and roll the dice again.

2640
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:13,970
No.

2641
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:17,100
Do we have to climb further up if we still don't get it?

2642
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,670
You have to climb 20m more if you get "climb up" again.

2643
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,380
How are we supposed to do this?

2644
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,980
It won't be easy to go down the mountain.

2645
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:26,710
No.

2646
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:30,520
Instead, Ye Eun who was in first place earlier...

2647
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,590
will have "climb down" on three faces.

2648
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,490
- The person in second place... - That's me.

2649
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:35,490
was Jae Seok.

2650
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:36,760
You will have "climb down" on two faces.

2651
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,060
The rest will have it on one face each.

2652
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,090
- Okay. - Okay.

2653
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,130
- Okay. Let's go. - Please.

2654
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:42,190
Instead, if you climb up 20m,

2655
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,730
one more "climb down" face will be stuck on it.

2656
01:32:43,730 --> 01:32:44,930
- Great. - Okay.

2657
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:47,430
Please let me get "climb down."

2658
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:49,100
- Let me get "climb down." - Haha.

2659
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,100
- Please. - Ye Eun can start.

2660
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,240
- Me first? - You have a 50 percent chance.

2661
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,640
- One, two, three. - Fifty percent.

2662
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,280
- Three. - Fifty percent.

2663
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,610
- Three. - Fifty percent.

2664
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,510
Fifty percent.

2665
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,720
- It's "climb up." - "Climb up."

2666
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:06,350
- Ye Eun will climb up. - Fifty percent.

2667
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:09,560
- It's "climb up." - Ye Eun will climb up.

2668
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:11,520
- Ye Eun will climb up. - Hurry and go.

2669
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,230
- I'll go. - You can roll it again.

2670
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,630
The VJ should go with her.

2671
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,530
- I'll go. - Why...

2672
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:21,100
- The VJ should go with her. - I'll go.

2673
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:24,970
It will be "climb up."

2674
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,570
It will be "climb up."

2675
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:30,340
- "Climb down." - "Climb down."

2676
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:32,510
It's not.

2677
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:34,010
- "Climb down." - "Climb down."

2678
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:37,020
- Jae Seok will go down. - Jae Seok is amazing.

2679
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,480
- Goodness. - He's really lucky.

2680
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,550
This is annoying.

2681
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:41,090
- Okay. - This is annoying.

2682
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,560
- Seriously. - Jae Seok...

2683
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,420
Okay. I'm going, Ye Eun.

2684
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:46,960
Bye. See you next week.

2685
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,330
- Bye. - Jae Seok.

2686
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:49,860
- This is annoying. - Jae Seok will go down.

2687
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,760
- Okay. - This is annoying.

2688
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:54,730
Okay!

2689
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,070
- Okay. - This is annoying.

2690
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,210
- Okay! - This is annoying.

2691
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:00,470
- All right. - Climb up!

2692
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:01,540
- Give me the dice. - You got "climb up."

2693
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:03,240
- Climb up! Give me the dice. - You got "climb up."

2694
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,710
You might get "climb down" if you're lucky.

2695
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:05,850
Let's go!

2696
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:19,430
You have to go slower than the camera.

2697
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,400
Where is the 20m point?

2698
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,400
Where is the 20m point?

2699
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:29,640
You might get "climb down" if you're lucky.

2700
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,640
Go.

2701
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,410
- "Climb up." Darn it. - Gosh, it's "climb up."

2702
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:33,510
Hey, only I got "climb down."

2703
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:34,710
Gosh, it's "climb up." Let's go.

2704
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:35,910
Hey, only I got "climb down."

2705
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,640
"Climb up."

2706
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:40,980
Everyone got "climb up."

2707
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:44,480
- "Climb up." I'm next. - Everyone will get "climb up."

2708
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:48,820
- "Climb up." - Hey, only I got "climb down."

2709
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:50,420
Only I got "climb down."

2710
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,230
You were the only one, but let's go up together.

2711
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:55,360
- Go on. I'll go down. - Come on, Jae Seok.

2712
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:57,860
Well, we should stick to the rules.

2713
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,400
Goodbye.

2714
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,600
- Goodness, we're not talking again. - Oh, dear.

2715
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,110
Gosh, back then...

2716
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,940
I could've thrown the dice better.

2717
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,150
This is it. Can you wait a second?

2718
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:15,310
The board.

2719
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,280
Jong Kook, are you climbing down?

2720
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,550
No, I'm sticking it on.

2721
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,390
Oh, this is how you stick it on.

2722
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,790
- The odd have gotten more... - Please.

2723
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,930
- The odds have gotten much better. - They have.

2724
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,490
If we still get "climb up" after that, it will be so...

2725
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,230
- What's this? Was it everyone? - Yes.

2726
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:31,530
- Me too. - Everyone but Jae Seok.

2727
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,970
- Gosh, that's terrible. - How many are there?

2728
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:35,100
- Ye Eun has 4. - I have 2 as well.

2729
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,600
- If you get "climb up" again, - Ye Eun should go first.

Gosh, it's so hard to go home.

Okay. Gosh, this is...

01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,800
This isn't easy. Let's get "climb down" this time.

01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:39,730
- I'll roll it now. - Three. Okay.

2758
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:40,930
- Gosh, it's 50 percent now. - Go!

2759
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:42,370
Let's do it.

2760
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:44,240

I can't believe this.

2774
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,670
- I mean, the probability... - Seok Jin, I'm leaving.

2775

Gosh, life isn't easy, people.

2779
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:26,980
Life is a constant climb, you know.

2780
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:29,280
This is nice. It's nice to go hiking.

2781
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,280
- Look for it! - There's no battery.

2782
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,520
- Hurry up and plug it in. - Hey.

2783
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,090
- Find an outlet that's not blocked. - Okay.

2784
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:35,120
Are they all blocked?

2785
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,090
They're blocked, Eun Chae. Look for one.

2786
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,260
- Hurry up and charge it. - How many minutes do we have left?

2787
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:40,090
Can't we use this? The one for staff?

2788
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:41,730
Why not?

2789
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:43,230
- I found it! - Did you find it?

2790
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:45,030
Gosh, the staff are ruthless.

2791
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:47,130
- It's too high. - How is it already dead?

2792
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:48,670
- They're all blocked off. - They blocked all of them.

2793
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:50,600
- Eun Chae is jumping really far. - Oh, gosh.

2794
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,100
- What are you doing? - Se Chan.

2795
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,370
- I totally got hit. - Nice!

2796
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:55,840
- When was that? - My gosh.

2797
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,640
"I'll cooperate with the interrogation."

2798
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,180
"Dream, this is how Daddy makes money."

2799
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,480
Mine won't work. Don't shut down. How is it already dead?

2800
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,380
Why is the battery dying so fast? What's wrong with this phone?

2801
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,250
- We have to hurry up and charge. - We have to hurry.

2802
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,420
Let's go. There's no time.

2803
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:09,720
This is driving me crazy!

2804
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,520
Hey, Sakura. You can't drop it.

2805
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,090
- We get to go home! - We get to go home!
