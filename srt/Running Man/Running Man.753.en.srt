1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,310
(The two major gangs
of the killer world)

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,850
The Locust Gang, famous killers
specializing in battles of wits,

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,850
(Locust Gang,
specializing in battles of wits)

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,220
and their long-time rival,

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,580
the Physical Tiger Gang,
specializing in physical battles.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,390
(Physical Tiger Gang,
specializing in physical battles)

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,320
A fierce battle for territory
that has lasted for 15 years.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,860
Today, all the killers
are gathering...

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,890
to see an end to the battle.

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,890
Let's go and attack them.

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,100
We're going to crush them.

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,960
The Tiger Gang
versus the Locust Gang.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,100
- You know...
- Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,100
Okay!

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,900
It's been a long time
since we've gathered.

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,410
- The killers...
- This is really...

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,740
- Hang on. Hey.
- This is like "Guns and Talks."

18
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,380
- While we were apart,
- I...

19
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,110
- you've become a petty thief.
- He's not a killer.

20
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,580
- You look like a petty offender.
- Hey.

21
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,020
- I'm Leon.
- Obviously, you will...

22
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,250
- get caught soon.
- Come on.

23
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,720
- Bang!
- For whatever reason,

24
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,050
- he will get caught soon.
- I know.

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,890
I was told my nipples were showing
through the shirt,

26
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,560
- so I keep hunching...
- The nipple show.

27
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,190
my shoulders like this.

28
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,430
- Boss.
- It's okay.

29
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,960
- Round shoulders.
- Boss, why are you...

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,660
- You're the boss.
- You would need this.

31
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,070
- You should attach this.
- Why...

32
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,370
- Isn't that too big?
- Hey.

33
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,040
- Will this work?
- What do we do then?

34
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
- Why...
- What?

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,540
Why have you changed, Boss?

36
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,240
- It's not like that.
- Seriously...

37
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,210
- My gosh.
- I put this on to try my best.

38
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,410
- I know.
- By the way,

39
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,580
- Seok Jin's outfit is just...
- I...

40
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,950
- What's that?
- Are you a sea urchin?

41
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,920
I'm a self-defensive killer.

42
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,320
- Sea urchin.
- Self-defense.

43
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,150
- No one can attack me.
- Sea urchin.

44
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,750
- This is crazy.
- Are you Jee Sea Urchin?

45
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,520
- I can fire this.
- How?

46
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,690
- Bang. Okay?
- So this will go off?

47
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,330
- I can shoot you with this.
- Shoot me?

48
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,930
- "I can shoot you."
- I can shoot you.

49
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,500
- Is it like a poisoned needle?
- I can... Yes.

50
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,700
- It's a poisoned needle.
- Sea urchin.

51
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,800
Ye Eun, today, you're...

52
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,130
- Jong Kook.
- You look good in that outfit.

53
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,230
Don't say that she looks pretty.

54
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,400
- Why not?
- Why?

55
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,300
She casts a spell on herself.

56
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,240
- When you say she lost weight,
- Really?

57
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,310
she thinks she's pretty.

58
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,410
- I'm pretty.
- I see.

59
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,610
- Don't say that she's pretty.
- I'm pretty.

60
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,880
- I'm pretty.
- What's with you?

61
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,950
Anyway, you look good
in that kind of outfit.

62
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,110
Do I look like a celebrity?

63
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,220
(Do I look like a celebrity?)

64
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,280
- Do I look like a celebrity?
- No.

65
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,590
Why do you try to look
like a celebrity in front of us?

66
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,120
A killer should look like a killer,

67
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,320
- not like a celebrity.
- He's right.

68
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
- I'm cute.
- Goodness me.

69
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,360
(Acting cute)

70
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,200
Don't try to act cute
or flirt with us.

71
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,360
What's with that face?

72
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,830
- Don't do that.
- You...

73
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,570
- It's about self-satisfaction.
- Right.

74
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,070
(The youngest of the Tiger Gang acts cute,
which no one asked for.)

75
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,110
(The Locust Gang is gathering
at another place.)

76
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,340
- Hey.
- Hello.

77
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,710
- We're the Locust Gang.
- Are you the Locust Gang?

78
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,450
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.

79
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,010
Aren't you a bully
in your neighborhood?

80
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,880
Actually, I wanted to look
like Lee Jung Jae...

81
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,820
"Deliver Us from Evil."

82
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,490
But this is more like "Failan."

83
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,420
(A good-for-nothing bully
from "Failan")

84
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,960
- Aren't you a mugger?
- That's how I look.

85
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,000
- A bully in a neighborhood.
- Yes.

86
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,730
What's with your outfits? You...

87
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,930
- Did you take a boat?
- No.

88
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,970
I'm Black Mamba.

89
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,140
- What?
- She's the captain of a boat.

90
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,570
- You look like Leon.
- I'm Leon.

91
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,270
That's what I intended.

92
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,770
(What he intended is Leon,
but he has the height of Matilda.)

93
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,210
The short Leon.

94
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,780
Hey, I'm wearing these.

95
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,710
- Look.
- You're wearing boats as shoes.

96
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,280
- I sprained my ankles many times.
- It's at ankle height.

97
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,650
- Why isn't our boss coming?
- Why isn't our boss coming?

98
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,090
- Hey.
- Oh, dear.

99
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,660
- Mr. Tae Jin Ah.
- My gosh.

100
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,190
- Are you a magician?
- Are you a magician?

101
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,890
- He might have a pigeon.
- Why are you...

102
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,360
- A pigeon.
- Are you a magician?

103
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,530
- Hey.
- Pigeon?

104
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,400
Your boss is here.

105
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,930
What are you doing
when your boss is here?

106
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,470
- You're here.
- You should greet me.

107
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,800
- You're here.
- All right.

108
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,540
You're the captain of the ferry boat
in Tongyeong.

109
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,410
- She's the captain.
- Right.

110
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,510
- Are you Leon?
- Yes. Nice to meet you.

111
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,680
- I'm Leon.
- Why...

112
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,080
Pigeon!

113
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,320
(In reality, he's Mr. Pigeon.)

114
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,890
Okay. Today...

115
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,320
The muscular ones of the gang.

116
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,660
- Yes.
- We will crush them.

117
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,060
Those punks.

118
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,430
- I'll show you how I crush them.
- Good.

119
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,300
- And we have a new member.
- Do we have a new member?

120
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,960
- A new member?
- A new member?

121
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,400
Who is it?

122
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,930
- There he is.
- Hey.

123
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,870
- Hey, you...
- Hey, you...

124
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,340
Yoo Seung Ho!

125
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,910
- Nice to meet you.
- There you go.

126
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,910
- You fraud.
- He is...

127
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,840
- He knows the basics.
- Hello.

128
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,010
(A good-looking physique)

129
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,250
(And flustering skills)

130
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,780
Not me.

131
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,490
Seung Ho, it was going out.

132
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,920
Give him 20 dollars.

133
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,890
Take 20 dollars each
and give us 10 dollars.

134
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,190
- Good, right?
- That works.

135
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,560
- But we have only 20 dollars.
- We should split the money.

136
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,630
(It was a lie.)

137
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,830
(He learned fraudulent skills
right away on his first appearance.)

138
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,000
(He came again with V,
showing off his good looks.)

139
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,370
Rock-paper-scissors.

140
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,870
Best out of three.

141
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,440
(Sly)

142
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,480
- He's somewhat annoying.
- He's strange.

143
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,240
He somehow gets on my nerves.

144
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,810
I hope I will come again.

145
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,110
(Despite his outstanding
performance, he lost both times.)

146
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,250
I'll come back next time and win
if I have a chance.

147
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,990
- All right.
- Good job today.

148
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,190
- He knows the basics.
- Hello.

149
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,320
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

150
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,490
It's been a while, Seung Ho.

151
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,730
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

152
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,230
You betrayed me.

153
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,860
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too!

154
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,460
(He speaks informally,
immersed in his role as a killer.)

155
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,600
It's been a while!

156
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,970
Come here, Seung Ho.

157
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,570
Seriously, Seung Ho...

158
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,970
How have you been?

159
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,040
- I've been well.
- What?

160
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,340
- "I've been well?"
- Hey.

161
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,540
- I've been well.
- He's...

162
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,050
- Didn't he get trained?
- Has he lost his mind?

163
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,880
Did he miss out on the training?

164
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,020
- Does he have his own theme?
- He's not disciplined?

165
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,320
I talked to him briefly
earlier today.

166
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,420
After doing a TV show
with Lee Bong Won...

167
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,420
- Hey, Seung Ho.
- He speaks...

168
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,790
casually to everyone now.

169
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,730
He's doing a TV show
with Paeng Hyun Sook and Lee Bong Won.

170
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,000
- It's no joke.
- So...

171
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,300
- It must not be easy.
- After working with those two,

172
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,170
- he must think we're easy.
- Exactly.

173
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,300
- So he speaks casually to us.
- Of course.

174
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,500
It's not like that.

175
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,140
That's it.

176
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,640
- But he...
- What...

177
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,840
Why does he keep
speaking casually to me?

178
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
- He's the boss.
- Why does he keep being like that?

179
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,880
- He's our boss.
- He's the boss.

180
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,240
How dare you!

181
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,850
You know what it is like
in a movie about killers.

182
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,320
Everything we're wearing
is a weapon.

183
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,350
What? What did you do?

184
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,920
Why did you kick it?

185
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,460
- I'm the boss, okay?
- I see. Then...

186
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,760
- You should be polite to me.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,330
All right. You can speak
casually to them, though.

188
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,990
- Why not?
- He can't do that.

189
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,700
You can speak casually to me.
It's okay.

190
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,000
- All right.
- Anyway,

191
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,330
we have Seung Ho in our gang now.

192
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,070
We should crush the Tiger Gang
with Jong Kook.

193
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,700
Apparently,
it's Jong Kook's birthday,

194
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,240
so they're having a birthday party.

195
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,840
- That's right.
- It's his birthday on Friday.

196
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,940
- Let's go then.
- Let's go and attack them.

197
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,580
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

198
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,080
- Anyway, we're the Tiger Gang.
- Yes.

199
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,280
We have a new member
of the Tiger Gang.

200
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,420
- Okay.
- Hey.

201
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,790
- Hello.
- Hey.

202
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,360
- Ho Jun.
- Hello.

203
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,390
- Hey, stand in the middle.
- Come here.

204
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,290
- You punk.
- You brat.

205
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,630
Hang on. Are you wearing perfume?

206
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,400
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

207
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,870
- You're dolled up.
- He...

208
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
- He looks better than before.
- I think so.

209
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,200
We're meeting
for the first time, right?

210
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,640
- It's not your first time.
- Is it the first time?

211
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,940
- Seok Jin.
- All right.

212
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,040
- Ho Jun, you were here before.
- Ho Jun.

213
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,110
Were you on this show before?

214
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,540
- Yes.
- When?

215
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,580
Hey, you don't remember?

216
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,180
- Neither of you remembers.
- I don't remember.

217
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,880
- Were you here back then?
- Hey.

218
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,620
- Hey, he was always here.
- Since Episode One.

219
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,020
- He's our original member.
- I've always been here.

220
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,220
- Seok Jin.
- Hey.

221
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,920
- You didn't see him?
- This is my first time.

222
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,690
- This is his 3rd time on our show.
- It's his 3rd time?

223
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,260
- He was here a lot.
- He was?

224
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,700
(It was 11 years ago.)

225
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,200
(Seok Sam from 11 years ago)

226
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,340
(They even had a 1-on-1 fight.)

227
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,940
My wife is a big fan of him.

228
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,440
- It's his 3rd time?
- He was here a lot.

229
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,770
- He was?
- Yes.

230
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,780
- Seok Jin,
- What?

231
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,840
don't try to get away with it.

232
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,980
Why can't you remember him?

233
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,850
- I don't remember you. I'm sorry.
- Actually,

234
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,110
- he was here many times.
- Right.

235
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,220
- He was?
- Yes.

236
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,920
- By the way, Boss,
- What is it?

237
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,720
we have a new member now.
We should see his dance.

238
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,460
- I want to see him act cute.
- Good.

239
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,160
- You should do that.
- Like a talent show?

240
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,730
A talent show?

241
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,430
(Intimidated)

242
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,630
- He just...
- Hey.

243
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,500
- Are you intimidated?
- A little.

244
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,200
- Isn't he older than me?
- Hang on.

245
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,900
- He just touched your shoulder.
- Right.

246
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,200
All right.

247
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,940
- Seok Jin.
- What?

248
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,810
It was Boss Jong Kook's birthday
a few days ago.

249
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,970
- Right.
- I don't celebrate it.

250
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,240
- Don't do that.
- It was his birthday.

251
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,710
- Get him his birthday meal.
- Don't do that.

252
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,180
- Stop it!
- Well...

253
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,480
How many times do I
have to tell you? Don't do that.

254
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,750
- Let's do what he hates.
- Is it your birthday?

255
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,080
- It was his birthday.
- Ho Jun.

256
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
Did you not know
it was his birthday?

257
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,390
- I really hate it.
- He hates it.

258
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,990
(A pink table with his birthday meal
is being set.)

259
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,090
This is amazing.

260
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,960
(Food Fighter is excited.)

261
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,060
This is great.

262
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,430
- This is it.
- Look at her.

263
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,200
- She's losing her mind.
- Hey, she's...

264
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
This is amazing.

265
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,700
They're setting things up
in the back.

266
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,070
(Happy Kook's Day)

267
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,700
- Ho Jun, what are you waiting for?
- He's handsome.

268
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,070
- Put this on his head.
- Right.

269
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,740
- You don't have to do that.
- Put it on him.

270
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
- You should wear it.
- All right. Let's go.

271
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,110
- Okay.
- Put it on. That's it.

272
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,410
You look pretty.

273
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,810
- This is nice.
- What took you so long?

274
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,780
- Hurry and come over here.
- Seriously...

275
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,450
Is he a magician or what?

276
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,620
Where's your pigeon?

277
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,990
- He let go of the pigeon earlier.
- Mr. Magician.

278
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,220
He let it go.

279
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,260
- He let go of it earlier.
- You punks.

280
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,590
It's a musical.

281
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,490
(He provokes Jong Kook
as soon as he gets here.)

282
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,030
Did you see that?
That's our boss's dance.

283
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,060
Is this "Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory" or what?

284
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,800
- Guys.
- Chocolate factory?

285
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,030
- I can tell you're really weak.
- Why?

286
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,840
The discipline of gangs
has been lax these days.

287
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,910
What do you mean?

288
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,140
(Boss Ttuk attacks
the Tiger Gang right away.)

289
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,410
- What?
- A boss of a gang...

290
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,150
is having a birthday party
like this?

291
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,320
- Don't you have work to do?
- The birthday party is like...

292
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,720
I'm sorry,

293
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,750
but this is part
of an advertisement.

294
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,990
Is that so?

295
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,720
Happy birthday.

296
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,230
- Congratulations
- Congratulations

297
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,730
(A congratulatory performance begins
right away at the good news.)

298
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,900
Are you a musical team?

299
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,200
They're actors.

300
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,640
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

301
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,940
Okay!

302
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,310
(Ending fairy)

303
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,540
- All right.
- I like the strawberry flavor.

304
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,580
- All right. It's done.
- Hey.

305
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,710
- What?
- He's Jun Ho.

306
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,250
- Hey.
- Ho Jun.

307
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,680
- Hey.
- You just saw him?

308
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,850
- Ho Jun.
- I didn't know.

309
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,990
It's been a long time, Ho Jun.

310
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,350
- Right.
- Ho Jun is really...

311
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,420
- Hasn't it been ten years?
- Because...

312
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,090
he was here
when we just started our show.

313
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,260
- All right, everyone.
- What?

314
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,960
Have something soft
that has a good texture.

315
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,000
- Good.
- Okay.

316
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,360
- Let's eat.
- I like the strawberry flavor.

317
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,470
Ice cream!

318
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,770
- Amazing. This is nice.
- Is it strawberry?

319
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,000
- Eat a lot.
- By the way...

320
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,040
Boss!

321
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,600
- Okay.
- Did you add this? Was it here?

322
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,910
Can you give me one?

323
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,070
- Here.
- All right.

324
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,380
It has jelly in it

325
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,110
- It's very chewy.
- It has?

326
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,580
It has gummy bears in it.

327
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,910
- It's so good.
- It's jelly.

328
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,180
- It's delicious.
- Yes. It's refreshing.

329
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,350
This is nice.

330
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,050
This is...

331
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,490
The jelly is so good.

332
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,060
(Jong Kook, who doesn't know much
about this, takes a bite.)

333
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,560
- It's good.
- Kids will love it.

334
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,360
- It has jelly in it.
- Strawberry and banana.

335
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,030
It tastes so refreshing
with strawberry and banana.

336
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,200
Right? It's strawberry and banana.

337
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,500
- It's so good.
- It's tasty.

338
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,300
- Is this ice cream too?
- Yes.

339
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,370
- Aren't they grapes?
- They're grapes.

340
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,900
- Really?
- It's ice cream.

341
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,670
Green grapes. It's Shine Muscat.

342
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,740
What?

343
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,710
- It's really good.
- It's so delicious.

344
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,480
It tastes so refreshing
with strawberry and banana.

345
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,550
- You're really handsome.
- Strawberry and banana.

346
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,580
Thank you.

347
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,750
He's my wife's favorite actor.

348
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,980
He's a great actor.

349
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,180
- You and I...
- The toppings...

350
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,490
- are polar opposites.
- are no joke these days.

351
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,490
You have a sharp nose...
- while mine is blunt.
- Is this ice cream?

352
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,130
You have deep-set eyes,
which I don't have.

353
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,560
- That's how different we are.
- What?

354
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,590
(Seok Sam only realizes
what everyone else already knew.)

355
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,400
Seung Ho, do you like ice cream?

356
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,070
I do. A while back...

357
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,330
- Oh, that.
- Yes, of course.

358
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,200
- Of course. He advertised it.
- When you were a kid.

359
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,670
- Yes, when I was about 20.
- You were a kid.

360
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,410
- That's right!
- I think I was in my mid-20s.

361
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,470
In your mid-20s?

362
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,910
The brand ambassador is here.

363
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,340
- Talk about nice timing.
- You're right.

364
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,780
My flavor was cherry blossom.

365
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,010
- Cherry blossom?
- I see.

366
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,750
I was the human cherry blossom.

367
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,380
- No way.
- Seung Ho.

368
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,480
- Yes? But now...
- You've become more shameless.

369
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,420
(The human cherry
is quite shameless.)

370
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,260
Hold on. You are
not the brand ambassador anymore.

371
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,290
- I'm not.
- Right.

372
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,730
- You've become more shameless.
- Maybe you shouldn't mention it.

373
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,730
- How old are you now?
- Wait a second.

374
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,230
Seung Ho, check out that geezer.

375
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,700
Wasn't his comment a bit harsh?

376
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,070
Why? How so?

377
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,440
What did you say to him...

378
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,840
when he talked about
his flavor being cherry blossom?

379
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,140
He's no longer the brand ambassador.

380
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,970
- So he shouldn't mention it.
- But still...

381
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
I'm sorry,
but aren't you his junior?

382
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,240
- Yes, I'm his junior.
- Right.

383
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,880
And you're my boss!

384
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,410
Still, there's a line
you shouldn't cross.

385
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,480
- Do you know what's funny?
- Unbelievable.

386
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,580
- We can't stand insubordination.
- Watch your words.

387
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,820
Do you know what's funny?

388
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,020
Against the Locust Gang,

389
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,920
it should've been Seok Jin Gang.

390
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,690
But Seok Jin serves
Jong Kook instead.

391
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,200
Haha, don't point it out.

392
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
- Get over here.
- Why would you say that?

393
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,630
- Haha, come on.
- Get over here.

394
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,470
I prefer not to be disturbed.

395
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,700
- You jerk.
- Don't point it out.

396
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,540
- Seok Jin is fine with it.
- The staff...

397
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,810
- Seok Jin, wait. Let me talk.
- Sure.

398
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,540
Why do you think
he wasn't chosen to lead the gang,

399
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,010
even though he's the oldest?

400
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,280
He isn't a man of such caliber!

401
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,510
I apologize!

402
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,680
You jerk!

403
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,150
(Seok Sam fights back against
the Locust Gang's strong attack.)

404
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,390
- How dare you?
- Hey!

405
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,820
- That's our boss.
- Get over here.

406
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,060
- How dare you?
- Hey!

407
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,390
(An explosive situation)

408
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,830
- You punk.
- Are you all right?

409
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,660
(Bang)

410
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,260
- How dare you?
- Why you...

411
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
- Hold on a second.
- Are you okay?

412
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,170
- Someone shot at me.
- He's our boss.

413
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,830
- How many is he going up against?
- He's one of us.

414
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,870
Who's this lady?

415
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,240
He's one of us,
but I'm embarrassed by him.

416
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,740
- That's our boss!
- How dare you?

417
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,710
- Who's this lady?
- Show some respect...

418
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,840
- to the lady.
- Come on.

419
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,940
- Show respect for our boss.
- Is this a circus?

420
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,080
- What do you think you're doing?
- Is this a circus?

421
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,550
- What do you think you're doing?
- Is this a circus?

422
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,250
Shouldn't we talk about
why they're on the show today?

423
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,220
All right. It's been a while
since we had Seung Ho...

424
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,160
- and Ho Jun on the show.
- Sure.

425
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,190
They're in the play,
"Killing Caesar."

426
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,230
(Ho Jun and Seung Ho are back,)

427
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,260
(starring in the play,
"Killing Caesar.")

428
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,760
A lot of actors
have been starring...

429
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,630
- in plays lately.
- Yes, a lot of them.

430
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,100
- Tell us about the play.
- What is it about?

431
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,840
It's based on "Julius Caesar,"

432
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,170
the play written
by William Shakespeare.

433
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,970
It was reinterpreted...

434
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,040
for modern times...

435
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,780
to deliver a more relatable message.

436
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,420
In the original play,
Caesar's death scene...

437
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
- only lasts about ten minutes.
- I see.

438
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,050
But we extended that scene
to a full 100 minutes.

439
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,490
- I see.
- I get what you mean.

440
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,160
- Will it only be like this?
- Then...

441
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,790
(Constantly groaning)

442
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,830
(But he won't die.)

443
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,090
No, it's not like that.

444
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,860
- Die!
- How many more minutes to go?

445
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,370
You have 48 minutes left.

446
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,730
It won't be easy
to extend the scene.

447
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,170
(Yang hasn't grasped the concept
of adaptation yet.)

448
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
How ignorant of you.

449
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,310
- You still have 48 minutes left.
- I apologize.

450
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,510
I apologize.

451
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,910
- Of course.
- This is nice.

452
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,180
- I can't believe it.
- This is delicious.

453
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,950
For today's race,

454
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,180
we're joined by Yoo Seung Ho
and Son Ho Jun from "Killing Caesar."

455
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,750
It's Territorial Expansion
of Killers.

456
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,490
Long-time rivals,
the Locust Gang and Tiger Gang,

457
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,620
- have come together...
- Okay.

458
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,260
to settle their turf war.

459
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,530
We'll go head to head.

460
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,660
The winning gang of this turf war
will receive a prize.

461
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,100
The losing gang
will receive a penalty.

462
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,230
- Got it.
- After battling for each turf,

463
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,770
the winning gang will enjoy...

464
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,870
- all the luxuries it has to offer.
- I see.

465
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,770
The losing team
will receive a penalty.

466
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,340
We'll now begin the mission
to see...

467
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,680
- who will claim the first turf.
- Right away?

468
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,880
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

469
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,980
- I like that lack of downtime.
- Okay.

470
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,580
We'll crush you!

471
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,720
Bring it on.

472
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
It's like "Guns and Talks."

473
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,190
The first battle...

474
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,390
is a take on the game
Why Are You at My House.

475
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,930
- It's Why Are You on My Turf.
- Why Are You on My Turf.

476
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,500
Unlike the original game,

477
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,830
you will play Cham, Cham, Cham
instead of rock-paper-scissors.

478
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,430
If the team playing offense
wins the Cham, Cham, Cham game,

479
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,900
the killer will be stolen.

480
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,570
If you lose, the opposing team
will get to play offense.

481
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,380
The team with the most people
at the end of the round will win.

482
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,280
Meanwhile, regardless of who wins,

483
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,180
the killers forced
onto the opposing team...

484
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,780
will become errand boys.

485
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,090
Really?

486
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,220
Can we give them any order?

487
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,350
- Yes.
- Our team...

488
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,020
- We can order them around.
- I know.

489
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
I'll teach them a lesson.

490
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,560
Those taken captive will serve
as both hostages and errand boys.

491
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,300
- They'll have to serve us.
- Nice.

492
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,100
It's best to be
with your original gang...

493
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,230
- when it wins.
- Exactly.

494
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm going to plead with my gang.

495
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,670
Please don't let them take me.

496
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,340
It'll be a long day for me.

497
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,240
- Who wants to relieve some stress?
- If you come here,

498
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,840
you'll be done for.

499
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,440
- I'll be in tatters.
- You'll be done for.

500
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,480
Won't we be able to get them back?

501
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,850
- Not until the next game.
- Of course.

502
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,350
It's fine.
You can spend some time there.

503
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,890
- Get a taste of it.
- I'll be in tatters.

504
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,250
Don't be chicken!

505
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,290
- We should be on the offense first.
- Sure thing.

506
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,960
- We'll go first.
- Play defense first.

507
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,360
- What should we do?
- Okay.

508
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,230
- We need to hold hands.
- In the middle.

509
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,430
After the first chant...

510
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,100
Why did you come over?

511
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,930
Why?

512
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,630
- Shouldn't you stand in the center?
- Right.

513
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,630
(Awkward)

514
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,270
(Laughing)

515
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,370
Ye Eun is being funny
about holding Ho Jun's hand.

516
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,970
- Why?
- Seriously?

517
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,840
- What's with you?
- How annoying can she be?

518
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,410
- What...
- What's the matter with you?

519
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,210
He's giving you his hand,
so take it.

520
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,510
- But...
- Take it.

521
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,580
- What are you doing?
- What's the matter with her?

522
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,120
What are you doing?

523
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,650
I'm chaste, you see.

524
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,390
- What?
- What do you mean you're chaste?

525
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,860
- As if holding hands is a big deal!
- What is this?

526
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,720
It's not like Ho Jun
is making a move on you.

527
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,160
- But I'm conservative.
- Unbelievable.

528
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,230
But you took Jong Kook's hand.

529
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,890
- Why...
- I don't want to hold her hand.

530
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,560
(I don't want
to hold her hand either.)

531
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,530
(Hunchback's game of push and pull
backfired.)

532
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,170
- You hurt his feelings.
- But...

533
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,430
What was that?

534
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,640
- Seriously?
- Just take his hand.

535
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,170
Se Chan, you come here instead.

536
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,640
- Are you kidding me?
- Someone has to go at the end.

537
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,740
- There.
- What was that?

538
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,280
- What's the matter with you?
- Unbelievable.

539
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,780
- You embarrassed Ho Jun.
- Tell me about it.

540
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,080
I've thought about it,

541
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,050
and Ho Jun and Seung Ho...

542
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,820
came on the show
to promote their serious play.

543
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,550
Is this the right game for them?

544
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,660
It's their fault
for choosing to be on this show.

545
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,020
- It's all right.
- Good.

546
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,590
- Let's chant with seriousness.
- It's fine.

547
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,030
We can just act
like serious killers.

548
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,660
- Let's chant with seriousness.
- Yes, the chant.

549
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,760
- Hold on.
- Okay.

550
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,000
Who will play
the Cham, Cham, Cham game?

551
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,400
- We're on the offense.
- Who's on the offense?

552
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,630
- We'll go first.
- Offense.

553
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,830
- Go ahead.
- What?

554
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,340
- Go ahead.
- What?

555
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,070
- Really?
- Why?

556
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,870
Why did you say
you understood just now?

557
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,910
Am I not even allowed
to make a decision like this?

558
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,710
- But...
- Aren't I allowed?

559
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,580
That's not what I meant.

560
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,620
- Given my age...
- You should consult the team.

561
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,350
- He's 60.
- Why make a decision unilaterally?

562
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,320
- Come on.
- Unbelievable.

563
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,520
- Why make a decision unilaterally?
- I can't believe you.

564
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,860
- I...
- Stop it.

565
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,220
I may not have the authority,

566
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,560
but let me at least decide this.

567
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,990
- He's acting strange today.
- Don't you agree, Ho Jun?

568
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,360
- Let's be honest.
- Okay.

569
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,560
- All right.
- Do they go first?

570
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,760
Chant it with deep voices.

571
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,900
- Sure.
- Here we go.

572
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,130
And go.

573
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,170
- Why did you come over?
- Why did you come over?

574
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,710
- We came to catch a killer.
- We came to catch a killer.

575
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,050
- What killer did you come for?
- What killer did you come for?

576
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,080
(Who is Locust Gang's first target?)

577
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,750
We came to catch Killer Seok Sam...

578
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,450
(Targeting Jee Seok Sam)

579
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,250
- Killer Seok Sam.
- Killer Seok Sam.

580
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,990
- Why would you do it?
- Seung Ho, go ahead.

581
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,090
- Seung Ho, go ahead.
- Right.

582
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,430
- Don't be chicken.
- Cham, cham, cham.

583
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,430
- Seok Sam, don't be chicken.
- It's Cham, Cham, Cham.

584
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,490
- Don't be chicken.
- How old are you?

585
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,530
You can do this, Seok Sam.

586
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,860
- How old are you?
- I'm 33.

587
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,900
You're 33?

588
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,970
- Stand strong.
- That's right.

589
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,970
Were you born in 1993?

590
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,300
Why do you look younger?

591
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,040
(Attacking him with a compliment)

592
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,410
- Seung Ho, don't be intimidated.
- Boss.

593
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,840
- Darn.
- Don't worry, and just do it.

594
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,080
- Don't worry.
- Smack him on the head.

595
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,680
- Wait for it.
- Why should I?

596
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,580
I've already decided
where I'm going to turn my head.

597
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,510
- I've made up my mind.
- Have you already decided?

598
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,980
- Don't move before he does.
- Okay.

599
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,650
- All right.
- Move after he does.

600
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,250
(Who will win the first match?)

601
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,460
Cham, cham, cham.

602
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,960
- Okay!
- Nice.

603
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,190
(Yoo Seung Ho wins.)

604
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,360
- Okay!
- He had his mind made up.

605
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,760
- Get over here.
- Nicely done.

606
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,300
- Seok Sam, get over here.
- Nice.

607
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,570
(He was brought down
by a game of Cham, Cham, Cham.)

608
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,840
- Seriously?
- Seok Sam!

609
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,740
The timing was on point.

610
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,410
- Seok Sam, please.
- The timing was on point.

611
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,040
- Join us, rookie.
- Come here.

612
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,080
- Seok Sam, come here.
- Come here.

613
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,710
- Can they get me back?
- It's fine.

614
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,480
- Go ahead.
- It's all right. Just head over.

615
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,550
- We'll get you back.
- Will he join you right away?

616
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,680
- Yes, he'll go over to them.
- Can't we get him back?

617
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,350
- Right away?
- We can get him back though.

618
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,950
Should it be this easy
to move from gang to gang?

619
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,490
- Get over here.
- Seok Sam, come on.

620
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,960
(They welcome the oldest rookie.)

621
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,190
- Get over here, rookie.
- Come on over.

622
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,700
- Nice!
- This way.

623
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,430
(Scuttling)

624
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,770
(Accept your rookie.)

625
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,000
- This is irritating.
- Come here.

626
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,670
- All right.
- Boss!

627
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,240
- Please.
- Hang tight.

628
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,810
- Please.
- We'll get you back right away.

629
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,380
- Can't we get him back?
- Of course, we can.

630
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,240
- Please.
- This hurts.

631
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,210
- Someone else...
- His jacket.

632
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,980
- His jacket is a problem.
- Hold on.

633
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,280
- You.
- We'll get him back right away.

634
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,780
Take that jacket off.

635
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,790
- I don't want to.
- We could be pricked.

636
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,490
- Go on.
- It could hurt them.

637
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,020
- Why do I need to take it off?
- Then...

638
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,560
Swap jackets with someone else.

639
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,860
Wear it inside out.

640
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,330
- Go on. Wear it inside out.
- Gosh.

641
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,960
- Hey.
- He's a lunatic!

642
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,400
- Put it on inside out.
- Come here.

643
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,170
- Put it on inside out.
- Get over here.

644
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,770
(Haha found a trash bag somewhere.)

645
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,640
- Seok Sam, it's your choice.
- Seok Sam.

646
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,770
Wear it inside out...

647
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,940
- or throw it away.
- Daniel is right.

648
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,480
How is this allowed?

649
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,980
Here you go.

650
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,810
Stop picking on Seok Sam!

651
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,480
You jerks!

652
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,150
- You have another thing coming.
- Hey.

653
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,450
Put your arm through here.

654
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,650
(It's hard to see your family
being humiliated.)

655
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,750
Yes, let him stick out his arm.

656
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,060
Seok Sam, hang in there!

657
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,720
- Please...
- We'll get you back.

658
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,360
- You look cool, though.
- Ho Jun.

659
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,030
Why should I be fashionable
when I'm their hostage?

660
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,370
- You look cool.
- This is a matter of pride.

661
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,100
- Nice.
- Bag Man loves it.

662
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,070
- I love plastic bags.
- Bag Man.

663
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,300
- You're good.
- Let's go.

664
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,640
- Take me back.
- Okay.

665
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,840
- Let's go.
- Let's take them all.

666
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,010
(The next match begins.)

667
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,080
(The Tiger Gang is on the offense
this time.)

668
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,220
- What killer did you come for?
- Let it be me.

669
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,420
- What killer did you come for?
- What killer did you come for?

670
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,890
- We came to catch Killer Haha!
- We came to catch Killer Haha!

671
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,090
Hey!

672
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,790
- You should ask for me!
- Wait, Seok Sam!

673
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,930
- We'll get you back!
- Darn it!

674
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,060
- You should claim me.
- Let's go.

675
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,870
- Wait, Seok Sam!
- Ask for me!

676
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,100
Wait, Seok Sam!

677
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
- Okay.
- Let's play.

678
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,170
- Go for it.
- Okay. Do it.

679
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,510
- We need to succeed.
- Do it for us.

680
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,940
- Don't end up over there.
- Hey.

681
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,410
- Go.
- You can do it.

682
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,410
Good luck.

683
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,540
(Ho Jun attacks!)

684
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,880
Cham, cham, cham.

685
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,410
- Okay.
- Yes!

686
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,550
- Well done.
- Good job.

687
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,580
- Good for you.
- You did really well.

688
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,590
(Feeling let down)

689
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,520
- Ho Jun...
- You should've put in more energy.

690
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,960
- There's no room.
- It's okay.

691
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,690
- It's okay.
- Come on.

692
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,190
- Hey.
- It's okay.

693
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,300
- What are you doing?
- Get back here.

694
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,460
- Who next? Ye Eun?
- It's okay.

695
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Definitely Ye Eun.

696
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,900
How many times do we play this?

697
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
- Come on.
- Okay.

698
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,240
- Why did you come over?
- Why did you come over?

699
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,940
- We came to catch Killer Ye Eun.
- We came to catch Killer Ye Eun.

700
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,170
- Hang in there.
- I will.

701
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,940
- You can do it.
- Good luck.

702
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,540
- Okay.
- Daniel's up this time.

703
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,150
- I'm up? Okay.
- You play this time.

704
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,150
(Daniel attempts to attack Ye Eun.)

705
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,320
- All right.
- This is childish but fun.

706
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,980
- That's it. Go for it.
- This is better for you.

707
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,890
If you join our gang,
you can eat all you want.

708
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,390
Ye Eun, if you join us,
you get five meals a day.

709
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,790
- Most definitely.
- I won't eat.

710
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,830
Ye Eun lost weight for you, Daniel.

711
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,360
- Yes.
- For me?

712
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,500
Because of your
"do you weigh more" comment.

713
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,900
You played a big part.

714
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,470
You scumbag!

715
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,070
- She's back.
- Nice!

716
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,800
- Summon that energy!
- Bring that up!

717
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,870
- It's okay.
- Bring her to our side.

718
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,980
First of all,
if that's true, I'm sorry.

719
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,710
- Okay. Here I go.
- Okay. I'll fight back.

720
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,610
(The giants,
long-time archenemies have met.)

721
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,980
Ye Eun, hang in there.

722
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,250
Watch carefully.

723
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,880
Daniel, bring her over.

724
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,050
Cham, cham, cham!

725
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,290
- Yes!
- Yes!

726
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,490
- Get the ice cream.
- Cham!

727
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,790
(The giant that lost
becomes a hostage.)

728
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,200
- Get over here.
- Yes!

729
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,470
- She looked and then turned.
- Well done.

730
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,800
Going on the offense first
is an advantage.

731
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,670
- It helps to attack first.
- That's a good thing.

732
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,170
- Yes.
- It's an advantage.

733
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,310
Why did you decide on your own?

734
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,670
You have a point.

735
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,440
- Right?
- You're right.

736
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,180
- You're actually right.
- Why did you hand it over?

737
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,980
My head won't fit.

738
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,050
It'll fit.

739
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,980
- It will fit just fine.
- The arms go here.

740
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,690
- Hey, now, you lot... Wait.
- Here.

741
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,090
- Your design skills improved.
- Is that so?

742
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,690
You got better at this.

743
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,190
- Your mic.
- It looks much cleaner.

744
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,190
You're good at making this now.

745
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,600
- This will be much warmer.
- It's fashionable.

746
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,800
- Ye Eun's is pretty.
- This looks much nicer.

747
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,430
- They gave you shoulders.
- They did.

748
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,200
- It looks nice.
- That's nice.

749
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,140
- It's nice.
- It looks like a dress.

750
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,670
- It's much better.
- It's actually pretty.

751
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,870
It's better than before.

752
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,340
Wear that from now on.

753
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,710
It actually looks nice.

754
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,340
- It looks like a dress.
- Ye Eun.

755
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,550
Okay, let's go!

756
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,080
- It's us now.
- Okay, come at us.

757
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,620
Let's play. It's our turn to attack.

758
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,950
Who do you want?

759
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,520
Take us back.

760
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,320
- Take us back.
- There's no time.

761
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,590
- Take us back.
- Ho Jun.

762
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,460
- You come to us.
- Let's go.

763
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,460
(Nodding)

764
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,190
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

765
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,330
- Why did you come over?
- Why did you come over?

766
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,060
- We came to catch a killer.
- We came to catch a killer.

767
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,600
(Getting dragged)

768
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,170
(Who will they choose this time?)

769
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,170
- What killer did you come for?
- What killer did you come for?

770
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,540
- We came to catch Killer Haha!
- Why does it have to be me?

771
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,480
- What about us?
- Why won't you save them?

772
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,850
- What about us?
- You won't save these two?

773
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,150
- This is really annoying.
- What about us?

774
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,420
You need someone like me.

775
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
Let's go!

776
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,680
You can play.

777
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,390
- I lack confidence.
- That's okay.

778
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,950
- It's okay. Go for it.
- I sacrificed for the gang.

779
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,360
- What about us?
- Go.

780
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,990
- Don't be intimidated.
- You can do it.

781
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,330
Why won't you save Seok Jin?

782
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,460
Good luck!

783
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
(He's up against Leon Ha again.)

784
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,200
- Let's do this.
- It must be done in one go.

785
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
- Okay.
- Be very sensitive.

786
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,270
(Ho Jun versus Haha, Round Two)

787
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,040
(What will the result be this time?)

788
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,870
Cham, cham, cham.

789
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,040
(Ho Jun lost 2 times in a row.)

790
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,970
- What was that?
- Well done.

791
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,680
- Great.
- Nice one.

792
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,710
- He's the problem.
- Yes.

793
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,050
- You're so shabby!
- Hey, Ho Jun!

794
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,410
- You're...
- Why are you so bad at it?

795
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,480
- Why are you so poor at this?
- Caesar!

796
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,950
- Why are you so weak?
- Why are you so poor at this?

797
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,550
Caesar!

798
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,060
(The simple game turned him pale.)

799
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,090
This is bad.

800
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,560
- Why is he so bad?
- I don't know.

801
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,190
It's okay, Ho Jun.

802
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,890
You can only play twice more.

803
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,400
- We can win once.
- You're so bad at this.

804
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,500
We should play both rounds.

805
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,730
It's our turn this time.

806
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,070
- It's not.
- But...

807
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,800
We must play once more,
and maybe you get the last round.

808
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,040
- Yes.
- That's right.

809
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,310
The audio team says you're rustling,
so don't move much.

810
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,510
What?

811
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,080
- Because of the plastic?
- Was this my idea?

812
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,250
- The movements...
- Audio director.

813
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,880
Was this my idea?

814
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,920
Stand still, old man!

815
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,450
The rustling gets into his mic.

816
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,390
They can't use his audio.

817
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,890
- Don't move.
- Try not to move much.

818
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,360
- Please don't.
- My gosh.

819
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,420
- Put this...
- This is a variety show.

820
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,690
- The plastic...
- How can I stay still on TV?

821
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,790
Don't move.

822
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,330
- That should do it.
- Okay.

823
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,800
It's really hot. I'm not joking.

824
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,170
I'm losing my mind now.

825
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,630
- We'll go first.
- We go first?

826
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,770
- Hey.
- Let's take one round.

827
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,240
Locust Gang, we'll attack once more.

828
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,070
- Okay.
- We'll go once more.

829
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,270
Play one last time. It's okay.

830
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,770
- I really can't.
- No, do it.

831
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,780
- You can do it.
- Ho Jun, you can do it!

832
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,680
You must break through.
You must get a win!

833
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,180
- Okay.
- It's the spirit.

834
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,080
- It's the spirit.
- One, two, three, four.

835
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,290
- Why did you come over?
- Why did you come over?

836
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,620
- We came to catch Killer Haha.
- We came to catch Killer Haha.

837
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,960
You're so obsessive.

838
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,090
- Come on.
- Hey.

839
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,790
- What are you doing?
- What about him?

840
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,330
- Why are they so fixated on you?
- The ace...

841
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,560
- What is this about?
- Taunt them. It's okay, Ho Jun.

842
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,000
- Okay.
- Taunt them a bit.

843
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
- It's him again?
- Not again?

844
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,370
- Oh, my gosh.
- Will you stop it?

845
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,600
- Make them nervous.
- Good luck.

846
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,510
- Okay.
- Okay? Be a bit...

847
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,510
Goodness.

848
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,480
- Be a bit...
- Stick to your pace.

849
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,180
- Good luck.
- Good luck!

850
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,580
(An enemy he had to let go twice)

851
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,080
Cham, cham, cham!

852
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,320
(Can he beat them this time
after they served him two defeats?)

853
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,790
- Yes!
- You did it!

854
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,050
(Ho Jun won!)

855
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,090
- Well done.
- It happened.

856
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,420
Well done. This is it!

857
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,930
You got the first win. Good.

858
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,230
- I'd decided which way to turn.
- This is it!

859
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,900
- You fell for it.
- Well done. This is it!

860
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,400
- My gosh.
- Come here.

861
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,700
Come here.

862
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,770
- Set things up.
- Come here.

863
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,300
- You need a mustache first.
- Why?

864
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,740
- Yes, a mustache.
- Why?

865
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,940
- Come here!
- What for?

866
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,610
Stand still,
or I'll kick you in the shin.

867
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,510
- Why are you suddenly...
- Keep still.

868
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,310
Why do you draw only on my face?

869
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,310
Stay still.

870
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,680
He doodles only on my face!

871
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,880
You need this.

872
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,020
(He shows respect out of fear.)

873
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,050
Make that into a crop top.

874
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,220
- A crop top? Okay.
- Yes.

875
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,560
- Don't go too far.
- We're not harassing him!

876
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,620
Why are you so against our gang?

877
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,860
This is a welcoming ceremony!

878
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,930
- Excuse me?
- I'm making a pretty top.

879
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,130
How much flesh will you show?

880
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,030
(How will
the Tiger Gang's design come out?)

881
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,770
The mic has to go in from down here.

882
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,340
Hey, it's looking good.

883
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,400
- Keep still!
- Keep still!

884
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,410
Stop this right now.

885
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,540
- We're all about showing skin!
- I have three kids.

886
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,610
I'm a dad of three.

887
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,610
- Keep still!
- Keep still!

888
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,180
(The cruel gang doesn't care
for the poor dad's pleas.)

889
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,110
- Don't do this!
- What?

890
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,150
(He's paying
for his past misdemeanors.)

891
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,820
- Don't do it.
- Don't do what?

892
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,890
- Jong Kook, come on!
- Goodness.

893
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,090
You're enjoying this.

894
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,990
- A dad of three...
- We're done.

895
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,620
- Stay still.
- Shouldn't we draw something?

896
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,360
No, don't.

897
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,330
Why would you draw on my belly?
This is bullying.

898
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,930
- What will you draw down there?
- I mean...

899
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,800
- Come here.
- They're drawing on his stomach?

900
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,030
The sun, like KCM's sun.

901
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,940
- What...
- KCM's sun.

902
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,740
- What is this?
- Draw KCM's sun.

903
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,340
What is this?

904
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,640
- There.
- Gosh.

905
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,010
Just wait until you join our gang!

906
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,410
- You!
- Hey!

907
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,150
- Is this a yoga symbol?
- It's a sun.

908
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,180
- Hey.
- Oh, dear.

909
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,750
You humiliated our member.

910
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,950
No. We're showing you
how fierce we are.

911
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,260
- I love it. This is great.
- Haha, here.

912
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,060
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

913
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,630
We'll let you cover your stomach.

914
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,930
Okay. That looks great.

915
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,430
- Let's play.
- I look disgraceful.

916
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,930
- No, you don't.
- You look nice.

917
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,600
- It's cute.
- Let's play.

918
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,430
- How do you look so cute?
- What is this?

919
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,600
- You look adorable.
- They'll come like this.

920
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,070
- One, two...
- One, two, three, four.

921
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,040
- Why did you come over?
- Why did you come over?

922
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,910
- We came to catch Killer Se Chan.
- We came to catch Killer Se Chan.

923
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,340
- Okay, fine.
- Hey.

924
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,350
- Make it back.
- If you join us...

925
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,280
- You can strip me if you want!
- Okay.

926
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,050
I'll avenge Haha.

927
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,250
Let's go, Seung Ho!

928
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,750
- Good luck!
- Let's go.

929
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,990
(The Locust Gang's ace Seung Ho
steps up to get revenge.)

930
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,960
- Let's go, Seung Ho.
- Don't worry.

931
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,030
(Will this attack
also be successful?)

932
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,530
Cham, cham, cham!

933
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,170
(Yoo Seung Ho won.)

934
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,240
(Seung Ho did it again!)

935
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,910
- Yes!
- Hang in there, Haha.

936
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,310
- Come here!
- Hang in there.

937
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,640
- Come here.
- Well done. You did great.

938
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,440
- Well done.
- He's in trouble now.

939
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,450
This is so funny.

940
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,850
- You're in trouble.
- Be gentle.

941
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,350
- You're dead meat.
- What do we do now?

942
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,950
This is bad. We're down to three.

943
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,190
Wait. This guy...

944
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,420
I'm like this, to start with.

945
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,960
Boss. This is my starting point.

946
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,160
- What do you want done?
- Kill him.

947
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,230
What do you want? Tell me.

948
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,230
- Make him topless.
- Topless?

949
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,660
- Okay.
- This is bad.

950
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,870
Why do you need that, Boss?

951
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,100
These are his pants.

952
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,070
(These are his pants.)

953
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,170
Come here.

954
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,540
(The locusts are worse
than the tigers.)

955
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,980
(If you expose my family's belly,
we will expose your bottom.)

956
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,310
- His pants... Nice.
- We won.

957
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,880
These are pants.

958
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,410
- Nice.
- Hey, come here.

959
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,480
You punk. How dare you treat
my gang member...

960
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,850
You want me to take my pants off
and wear this?

961
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,490
- This is bad.
- Seriously?

962
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,220
- Take his pants off!
- After taking these off? For real?

963
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,960
- Are they really taking them off?
- My goodness.

964
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,390
After that...

965
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,960
- What? His underpants are red.
- You belittled our gang.

966
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,000
- Hey, just pull those down.
- And a belt.

967
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,160
- Wear a belt.
- There you go.

968
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,660
- His belt.
- What is this?

969
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,130
Oh, no.

970
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,270
Go, you punk.

971
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,240
Get a taste of our gang's power.

972
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,440
This is the absolute worst
among everything I've worn.

973
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,770
It feels so bad.

974
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,340
(Dongducheon Leon barely got to
cover his private parts.)

975
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,780
Hey, that looks pretty.

976
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,550
(Totally satisfied)

977
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,410
Hey, please... Make me look cute.

978
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,720
This just looks unlikable.

979
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,490
- You keep making me unlikable.
- You punk.

980
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,320
- Hey, hang in there for a bit.
- All done.

981
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,350
- Hey, hang in there.
- Just rip it off.

982
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,060
Do I have to dress like this
all day long?

983
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,260
- No, just until...
- Not all day.

984
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,130
- we get to the next location.
- The next location? Darn it.

985
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,630
I have to dress like this
until the next location?

986
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,260
- Of course you should.
- I'll pull this back up there.

987
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,400
- No!
- Hey!

988
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,570
- What are you doing?
- Please.

989
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,400
- No, you can't!
- You look cute, you punk.

990
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,470
- No!
- All right. Let's go for now.

991
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,970
I have to walk around like this.
Then, you...

992
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,300
- I'm going to rip that off.
- No.

993
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,470
- Okay, fine.
- Darn it.

994
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,840
Here are the results of the mission.

995
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,910
The Locust Gang won.

996
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,610
- Okay!
- You've won the turf.

997
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,710
The benefit of owning this turf...

998
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,910
- will be revealed after we move.
- Okay, let's go!

999
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,680
(The first turf goes to
the Locust Gang.)

1000
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,080
- Hit the slate. Daniel, the slate.
- I'll give you this one.

1001
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,220
- The slate?
- Hit the slate.

1002
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,490
Haha, you have to do it today.

1003
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,490
- You have to hit the slate.
- Why should I?

1004
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,520
You have to slap your own belly.

1005
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,820
- Why should I?
- Slap your own belly.

1006
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,060
- Slap your belly to hit the slate.
- Why would I do that?

1007
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,230
- Slap your belly after 1, 2, 3.
- Yes, do it.

1008
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,200
- Lift your belly fat like this.
- That's right.

1009
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,300
- Please focus on his belly.
- I'll hit the slate.

1010
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,070
I'll hit the slate.

1011
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,840
One, two, three.

1012
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

1013
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,710
- Okay.
- Let's go!

1014
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,870
I'm going to rip your underwear off.

1015
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,110
Seung Ho, come to the back.

1016
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,880
- Me?
- Yes, come here.

1017
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,280
- Come here.
- Seung Ho, come here.

1018
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,850
- Seok Sam, move your arm.
- Watch out.

1019
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
Hey. I mean...

1020
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,520
If you're a staff member
of a gang... You know?

1021
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,360
Isn't it not right
to talk down to someone?

1022
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,660
I'm not talking down to you.
I'm just talking to you.

1023
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,760
Why would you talk like that?

1024
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,130
- Then, as the boss of the gang...
- What, talking down to you?

1025
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,100
- Look at Haha and say that again.
- Do you think this is a joke, then?

1026
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,370
- Everyone, we're kind of cold here.
- Look at Haha.

1027
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,070
We'll turn off the air conditioning
over here.

1028
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,870
- Come on. You can't turn it off.
- By the way,

1029
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,370
who are those two thieves?

1030
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,070
(Bursting into laughter)

1031
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,540
- You guys must be petty thieves.
- These two.

1032
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,680
- These two are petty thieves.
- These guys.

1033
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,010
Don't lump me and him together.

1034
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,980
- I'll rip his underpants off today.
- This guy...

1035
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,680
We're about to go to war.
We'll rip everything off.

1036
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,180
Seriously. I'm not lying.

1037
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,850
Gosh, I know so many kids
who watch Running Man. This is bad.

1038
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,460
By the way, Seung Ho
and Ho Jun's faces both look...

1039
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,620
They're both shining.

1040
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,920
- I know, right?
- They're just different.

1041
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,360
Ho Jun, how old are you?

1042
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,690
I was born in 1984.

1043
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,730
- What?
- What?

1044
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,100
- You're not that young.
- You were born in 1984?

1045
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,800
- He's a year older than Daniel.
- Yes, he is.

1046
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,870
Is that right?

1047
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,300
- Is Ho Jun older than you?
- Yes.

1048
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,500
- Oh, my.
- Hey, Daniel,

1049
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,670
why did you live like that?

1050
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,140
- Hey, he is...
- I mean...

1051
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,740
He's pretty far gone.

1052
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,640
- He is.
- I mean, he doesn't really have...

1053
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,510
- a baby face, does he?
- No.

1054
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,110
I praised Daniel earlier.

1055
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,150
- Why?
- "You're so funny..."

1056
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,180
"ever since you gained weight."

1057
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,020
"For the sake of a variety show,
you are..."

1058
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,850
- Gosh, he's getting a potbelly too.
- But...

1059
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,950
- Daniel is developing...
- Seriously.

1060
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,090
a proper physique for variety shows.

1061
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,530
- He's developing it now.
- I mean...

1062
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,860
- But do you know what's funny?
- So...

1063
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,900
- What?
- Actually,

1064
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,130
- all three of us are actors, but...
- Yes.

1065
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,670
I feel like there's a difference,

1066
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,530
- so I've lost my confidence.
- You can't think that way.

1067
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,500
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- Here, you shine the brightest.

1068
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,710
- Here, you shine the brightest.
- You shine the most.

1069
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,710
You.

1070
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,470
I'll pass on
my KCM belly button today.

1071
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,740
(I'll pass on
my KCM belly button today.)

1072
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,010
- For real.
- You'll become a star.

1073
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,810
- A star in the variety show world.
- You have to do it.

1074
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,980
- By the way, Seung Ho.
- Yes?

1075
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,280
Don't you have any older siblings?

1076
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,680
- I have an older sister.
- Oh, you do.

1077
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,780
I have a sister who's a year older.

1078
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,890
- A year older?
- A sister who's a year older?

1079
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,450
How is your relationship
with your sister?

1080
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,390
You're not saying anything.

1081
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,260
- Got it.
- You must feel awkward.

1082
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,990
- It's the same for everyone.
- True siblings.

1083
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,730
- She's just... Yes.
- How much older is she?

1084
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,760
- A year.
- One year.

1085
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,470
- They must be true siblings.
- You must be true siblings.

1086
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,900
Wait. Excuse me.

1087
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,170
Do I have three legs?

1088
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,600
My gosh.

1089
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,370
- Gosh, what is this now?
- You're right.

1090
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,410
- Where are your manners?
- What are you doing?

1091
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,310
- What are you doing to our boss?
- I mean...

1092
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,040
- Why are there so many rules here?
- I know, right?

1093
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,080
But he's our boss.

1094
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,680
- You're being too rude.
- What's too rude?

1095
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,980
It's not his seat.

1096
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,350
You're supposed to be able to...

1097
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,520
Don't cover this up.

1098
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,880
(Laughing)

1099
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,150
- Fine!
- It's too unlikable.

1100
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,890
It's only funny
if you can see glimpses of it.

1101
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,490
It's not funny
if you keep seeing it.

1102
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,590
- Come on.
- No, don't cover it.

1103
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,330
(Doggedly managing his bare belly)

1104
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,160
- What?
- He's so annoying.

1105
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,200
- Hey, he keeps covering his belly.
- Hey, man.

1106
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,360
- Don't cover it up!
- It's not that.

1107
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,500
- My belly looks so unlikable.
- Just let it show.

1108
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,630
- It's only funny if it's round...
- But you know...

1109
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,770
- like Jae Jun's.
- So...

1110
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,300
- His belly is kind of awkward.
- Right.

1111
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,370
It should be protruding like this.

1112
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,370
It's not protruding a lot.

1113
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,510
If it's sticking out a whole lot,
we just laugh and move on.

1114
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,610
But how should I put it?
Is it like the Uncanny Valley?

1115
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,580
Is it like the Uncanny Valley?

1116
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,410
(His diagnosis: Uncanny Valley)

1117
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,720
I know that too.

1118
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,420
- I keep losing confidence.
- So, his belly...

1119
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,990
- You know how middle-aged women...
- Yes?

1120
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,850
keep their purses here?
I get it now.

1121
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,060
(I get why middle-aged women put
their purses here.)

1122
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,890
- It's Hongdae? Are we in Hongdae?
- Is this Hongdae?

1123
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,890
- Hongdae.
- Why did we come to Hongdae?

1124
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,430
I see an R sticker there.

1125
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,900
- Gosh, what is this?
- This place looks nice.

1126
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,530
- Gosh, the weather is so nice.
- The weather is insane.

1127
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,230
- Oh, it must not be time yet.
- This must be a cafe.

1128
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,070
This place is beautiful.

1129
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,870
This used to be a house,
but they changed it up.

1130
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,170
- It's so pretty.
- Gosh, the weather is so nice.

1131
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,810
It would be nice
to sit outside here.

1132
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,580
- You know what I mean?
- This is so nice.

1133
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,680
Should we go inside?

1134
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,120
You have to knock
three times with the knocker.

1135
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,380
- That's how you can enter.
- Is that so? Got it.

1136
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,120
- There must be a quiz.
- Three times.

1137
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,450
Is that so?

1138
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,420
(Knocking 3 times)

1139
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Gosh, what is this?

1140
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,030
- What is this?
- Why? What?

1141
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,830
- Gosh, what is this?
- Why? What?

1142
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,930
- What?
- They're idols!

1143
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,630
- What...
- What's going on?

1144
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,100
- You're back, Miss and Master.
- What?

1145
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,270
(You're back, Miss and Master.)

1146
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,570
- You're back, Miss and Master.
- What?

1147
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,010
(The first turf: A butler cafe)

1148
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,140
- What is it?
- This is...

1149
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,280
- What?
- They're idols!

1150
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,710
- But...
- What?

1151
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,710
- Please follow us, your butlers,
- What?

1152
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,250
- to go to your seats.
- What is this?

1153
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,920
Oh, it's a butler cafe.

1154
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,590
- Is that so?
- Isn't this a butler cafe?

1155
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,390
Whoever comes,
they call you Miss or...

1156
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,960
What was that again?

1157
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,920
- They look more like stars than us.
- I know.

1158
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,430
I thought they were celebrities.

1159
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,630
They really look more like stars...

1160
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,660
- than us.
- Really?

1161
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,900
Oh, hello.

1162
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,430
- You're handsome.
- Hello.

1163
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,760
- Hello.
- Gosh, what's this?

1164
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,870
My outfit is so not proper...

1165
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,030
- Hang on a minute.
- Yes?

1166
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,940
Isn't there a dress code here?

1167
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,940
These are our pet dog and pet cat.

1168
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,910
Should we wait outside?

1169
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,310
Come here. Come on in.

1170
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,180
- Please take your seats.
- Gosh, this is so fascinating.

1171
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,980
Ye Eun, you keep...

1172
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,820
sitting next to Ho Jun.

1173
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,080
Oh, you're right.

1174
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,820
Nice to meet you,
Misses and Masters.

1175
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,920
I'm Butler Kuro.

1176
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,090
- So cute.
- It is a butler cafe.

1177
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,060
- Hello.
- So, this is a butler cafe?

1178
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,590
- I saw this place on social media.
- A butler cafe.

1179
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,690
- I didn't see it.
- There are lots of places like it.

1180
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,600
Do you normally work here?

1181
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,630
I always reside in this mansion.

1182
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,370
(Staying true to his character)

1183
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,040
- Please open the menu before you.
- Shall we?

1184
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,840
(Rules for Using the Mansion)

1185
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,810
- First, to call the butler,
- There are rules.

1186
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,610
you may never say, "Excuse me,"
or "Hey, there."

1187
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,480
You may ring the butler bell
in front of you...

1188
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,050
and ask for what you need in person.

1189
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,950
You rang, Miss?

1190
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,950
Next, personal contact
with the butlers is prohibited.

1191
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,920
Of course,
all of our Misses and Masters...

1192
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,890
are overflowing with dignity
and class as members of nobility.

1193
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,490
So,
I'm sure that would never happen,

1194
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,190
but please refrain
from talking down to...

1195
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,700
or using informal speech to us.

1196
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,830
There is one person...

1197
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,430
- who will have to watch himself.
- He might talk down to you.

1198
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,300
- Don't talk down to them.
- No informal speech.

1199
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,740
He's the first generation of
the Ugly Korean.

1200
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,010
- All right.
- Seriously.

1201
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,770
- The Ugly Korean.
- For real.

1202
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,840
- By the way, I...
- I'm serious.

1203
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,580
He really is the first generation
of the Ugly Korean.

1204
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,910
But informal speech is...

1205
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,180
- my way of showing affection.
- No.

1206
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,180
- You can't do that.
- Don't do it.

1207
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,250
- I'll refuse with much gratitude.
- Yes.

1208
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,520
- With gratitude.
- Yes.

1209
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,490
This place is a hot spot of Mapo,

1210
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,060
- the first butler cafe in Korea.
- Can we have assigned butlers?

1211
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,890
Earlier, during the mission,
the Locust Gang's killers...

1212
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,900
successfully won over this turf.

1213
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,460
You will become
the masters and mistress...

1214
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,730
and enjoy this place
as much as you want.

1215
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,230
The gang that lost...

1216
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,670
can only sit outside...

1217
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,100
- and have coffee.
- That sounds amazing!

1218
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,110
I like that.

1219
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,070
- He seems so happy.
- Why are you happy?

1220
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,080
- The weather is so nice.
- The weather is...

1221
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,510
- nice outside.
- However, regardless of who won,

1222
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,510
the killers who have been taken
to the other team...

1223
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,210
will become butlers themselves...

1224
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,150
and provide services to the members.

1225
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:33,660
(The Tiger Gang won the final chance
at offense during the mission.)

1226
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,860
- We came to catch Killer Se Chan.
- Me? Will you save me?

1227
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,060
- Hey, you jerk!
- But why?

1228
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,500
- We need an active guy.
- Hey, but...

1229
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,700
Cham, cham, cham!

1230
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,830
- Okay.
- Nice.

1231
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,840
(They successfully saved
Killer Se Chan...)

1232
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
(who was taken hostage
as he's performing well.)

1233
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,570
The butlers are Seok Jin,

1234
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,770
- Ye Eun, and Haha.
- Looking like this?

1235
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,940
- The three of you are butlers.
- Me too?

1236
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,910
- But our team won.
- You lost.

1237
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,850
- You couldn't go back to your team.
- Hang on, Director.

1238
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,680
Does the butler not get to eat?

1239
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,850
- They can, right?
- No, they can't.

1240
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,620
- They can't?
- No.

1241
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,760
- No, the butler...
- But the winning team...

1242
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,320
may choose one extra person
from the losing team...

1243
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,130
to become an additional butler.

1244
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,300
- Yes, so now,
- Anyone?

1245
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,600
among Jong Kook, Ho Jun,
and Se Chan,

1246
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,230
you may choose one person
to become a butler.

1247
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,400
- A butler?
- Yes.

1248
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,300
- Hey, but you know,
- Him.

1249
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,000
- Ho Jun suits this place visually.
- He looks awful.

1250
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,910
Come on.

1251
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,480
(Come on.)

1252
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,180
(Making his case
with beads of sweat rolling down)

1253
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,380
He's sweating.

1254
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,380
- Go outside. I'll think about it.
- Are you ready?

1255
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,950
- You must look that good to be...
- I'll think about it.

1256
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,890
Those of you who are butlers...

1257
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,490
- Oh, there's a training part too.
- must receive training.

1258
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,020
They have to receive training too?

1259
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,960
(Ringing)

1260
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,030
- Oh, Poro.
- Poro.

1261
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,630
- Pororo?
- Pororo.

1262
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,200
- You rang, Master?
- You rang, Master?

1263
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,330
What...

1264
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,470
(Butler Poro,
has a belly button tattoo)

1265
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,800
Poro, as in Pororo.

1266
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,070
I look so unlikable.

1267
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,670
Do you deliver things
with your nose?

1268
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,070
Yes. You rang?

1269
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,270
You rang, Master?

1270
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,710
Well, we've received training.

1271
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,410
With one eye covered,
it's kind of...

1272
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,480
Watch out.

1273
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,050
- Kusa?
- Kusa.

1274
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,650
(Ho Jun is chosen as a butler.)

1275
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,720
- You rang, Miss?
- Don't laugh. Be cultured.

1276
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,090
My goodness.

1277
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,190
- Koro.
- Around his neck...

1278
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,460
Do they change into the outfits too?

1279
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,990
(Surviving thanks to Ho Jun, Se Chan
and Jong Kook have coffee outside.)

1280
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,990
They wear the outfits too?

1281
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,530
Let's order for now.

1282
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,600
- Yes.
- I'll have...

1283
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,000
the Afternoon Tea Set
with peppermint tea.

1284
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,870
I'll also have
the Afternoon Tea Set...

1285
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,700
- with English Breakfast tea.
- Yes.

1286
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,270
I'll have the strawberry latte.

1287
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,940
I'll have the afternoon tea set.

1288
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,240
Can I also have a strawberry latte,
with less sugar?

1289
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,010
- Sure.
- Beauty...

1290
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,080
(Just then)

1291
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,780
Beauty...

1292
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,520
was only added to the dictionary
after the birth...

1293
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,790
of the young ladies
and gentlemen here.

1294
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,390
- Nice.
- That was sweet.

1295
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,030
Are they going around
saying nice things to us?

1296
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,200
He sounds well-educated, doesn't he?

1297
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,600
After serving them,

1298
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,270
you must always praise
the young ladies and gentlemen.

1299
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,070
"Beauty..."

1300
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,810
"was only added to the dictionary
after the birth..."

1301
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,540
"of the young ladies
and gentlemen here."

1302
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,180
- Beauty...
- Beauty...

1303
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,310
(He memorized it.)

1304
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,480
- I took my training seriously.
- Anchovy...

1305
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,720
- Well...
- Please don't...

1306
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,890
stick your hand out like that.

1307
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,350
Master,

1308
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,520
your face has bloated immensely,

1309
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,060
and now you're even more beautiful
than the steamed bun I'm eating.

1310
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,860
(Clapping)

1311
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,130
- What was that?
- You've gained a lot of weight.

1312
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,130
- You look stunning.
- What was that?

1313
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,600
- What?
- I only say kind words.

1314
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,200
How was that kind?

1315
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Meanwhile,

1316
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,310
- Master,
- Yes?

1317
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,310
you're like an anchovy.

1318
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,980
You look like
you have strong bones...

1319
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,180
like an anchovy.

1320
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,680
What is this?

1321
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,250
We received our training
for the day.

1322
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,450
- We received our training.
- We can't say bad things.

1323
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,550
- Miss...
- We can't say negative things.

1324
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,420
- Miss,
- Yes?

1325
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,420
you seem to be quite the charmer.

1326
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,460
Is this a bell?

1327
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,660
(Is this a bell?)

1328
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,060
(Ringing the sun-bellybutton clock)

1329
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,960
(Whimpering)

1330
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,170
How rude of you!

1331
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,130
(Leaving his post)

1332
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,900
You shouldn't touch them.

1333
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,240
- Of course. Sorry about that.
- No physical contact.

1334
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,240
- I'm sorry I touched you.
- Hands off, please.

1335
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,440
Okay.

1336
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,510
(Jong Kook calls over Haha
after he sprinted out of the room.)

1337
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,540
Butler Poro.

1338
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,910
(These masters seem more difficult.)

1339
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,550
Can you lift up your top a bit more?

1340
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,480
- All right.
- Lift up your top a bit more.

1341
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,450
- Lift up your top a bit more.
- Hello, Masters.

1342
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,450
Okay.

1343
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,490
- Did you need something?
- We'll go with this.

1344
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,220
- We'll have decaffeinated...
- Decaffeinated...

1345
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,260
- iced Americano.
- iced Americano.

1346
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,260
- Two of that.
- Yes, two.

1347
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,830
Can we order something to eat?

1348
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,730
Something to eat?

1349
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,800
I'm afraid that won't be possible
since you're seated outside.

1350
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,270
Goodness, foreigners.

1351
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,070
- What...
- Don't cover your belly.

1352
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,910
- Don't cover it up.
- Cover your face instead.

1353
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,910
Sir.

1354
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,880
You have a muffin top.

1355
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,910
- Even with the belt...
- How rude of you!

1356
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,950
(Slap)

1357
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,690
- I'm quitting.
- Hold on.

1358
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,120
- Where are you going?
- Come on.

1359
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
Get back here!

1360
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,460
How can they be this rude?

1361
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,630
They're so rude.

1362
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,700
(The butler, immersed
in his character, sheds tears.)

1363
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,300
I can't continue to do this.

1364
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,970
Why are you filming my belly?

1365
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,900
Butler Poro ran away.
Shouldn't someone grab him?

1366
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,640
- Haha ran away.
- Someone should chase after him.

1367
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,970
(They're about to chase after Haha.)

1368
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,010
- I can't be humiliated like this.
- He's back.

1369
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,410
- I can't be humiliated like this.
- He's back.

1370
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,380
(Running around the Hongdae area
with his stomach exposed.)

1371
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,420
(He was told
he'd be a formidable killer.)

1372
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:34,320
(But Candy was tricked
into taking a different job.)

1373
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,890
It's Butler Kusa.

1374
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,560
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1375
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,330
Hey, Butler Kusa.

1376
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,830
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1377
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,900
Can you stay and explain
the coffee we're drinking?

1378
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,070
- Really?
- Yes.

1379
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,410
- Since it's hot outside,
- Yes?

1380
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,680
the coffee has been cooled down
with an adequate amount of ice,

1381
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,650
and the right amount of water
has been added to the espresso.

1382
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,020
Nicely put. Good job.

1383
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,020
- Okay.
- We're in the same gang.

1384
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,090
May I get a sip?

1385
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,560
- He's a member of our gang.
- You're right.

1386
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,220
Butler Kusa wants some,

1387
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,160
- so he'll get a sip.
- Sure.

1388
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,490
Why don't we play
the Cham, Cham, Cham game...

1389
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,330
and let the winner take a sip?

1390
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,360
- Between the two of them?
- The Cham, Cham, Cham game?

1391
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,830
- Sure.
- With this?

1392
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,030
- How about the crane camera?
- Which one?

1393
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,770
Cham, cham, cham. Like this.

1394
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,400
- Go ahead, then.
- Sure.

1395
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,010
- I'll go first.
- Sure.

1396
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,440
- The winner gets a sip.
- Right.

1397
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
(The Cham, Cham, Cham rivals
go head to head.)

1398
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,740
Cham, cham, cham.

1399
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,710
- Nice!
- Okay.

1400
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,710
(Haha succeeds.)

1401
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,050
(How will Ho Jun do
when he's bad at this game?)

1402
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,720
- All right.
- Ho Jun, you're up.

1403
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,450
Cham, cham, cham.

1404
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,320
- I won.
- Goodness.

1405
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,690
- Why is he so bad at this?
- He's terrible at this game.

1406
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,520
Why are you so bad at this game?

1407
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,560
Beats me.

1408
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,330
Thank you.

1409
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,500
Enough!
You only get one sip, you punk.

1410
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,630
(Slap)

1411
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,830
Seriously.

1412
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,700
You were begging for it.

1413
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,300
(Butler Poro was begging
to be slapped on the belly.)

1414
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,210
Mr. Kuro.

1415
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,480
Butler Kuro,
they've been teasing me.

1416
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,750
(He brings over his mentor.)

1417
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,680
- Butler Kuro.
- I tried to serve them gracefully,

1418
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,220
but they keep making fun
of my belly.

1419
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,090
- Well...
- I want to quit.

1420
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,920
Everything the masters say is true.

1421
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,690
- What we say is true?
- That's right.

1422
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,360
- Our word is his command.
- That's right.

1423
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,460
- Lift it up.
- Lift up your top, Butler Poro.

1424
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,070
- More.
- We were only commenting...

1425
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,630
about how the outfit should be.

1426
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,670
We weren't trying...

1427
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,200
- to make him show more skin.
- Exactly.

1428
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,810
Why do you keep hiding your belly?

1429
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,810
Don't suck in your belly either.

1430
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,380
- Leave it as is.
- What now?

1431
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,310
Butler Kusa.

1432
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,610
- Here.
- How long will it take?

1433
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,280
- They're here.
- Here's your order.

1434
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,020
- Butler Kororok.
- Yes?

1435
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,420
- Thank you.
- This looks delicious.

1436
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,060
Here's the strawberry latte
you ordered.

1437
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,320
- But...
- This is less sweet.

1438
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,720
- The English breakfast.
- Right. Thank you.

1439
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,130
- It's good.
- It looks delicious.

1440
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,060
Turn these so that
they don't block our faces.

1441
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,700
I'm sorry but...
Don't touch them yourselves!

1442
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,170
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

1443
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,970
What...

1444
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,740
- I'm sorry.
- Butler Koro.

1445
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,100
Why can't you speak properly?

1446
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,610
I'm sorry.
I'm out of my comfort zone.

1447
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,770
Were you scolding us?

1448
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,680
- It's not that. I apologize.
- Right.

1449
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,610
- Allow me.
- Sure.

1450
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,010
- Can I have some wet wipes?
- Wet wipes?

1451
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,150
Wet wipes, please.

1452
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,950
Can I get a wet wipe?

1453
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,720
- Just a second.
- I felt like I was at a diner.

1454
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,320
Should a butler talk like that?

1455
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,720
- But...
- This is frustrating.

1456
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,760
- Can they yell like that?
- Wet wipes, please!

1457
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,060
Here are the wet wipes.

1458
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,260
- Could you...
- What would you like to have?

1459
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,830
First of all...

1460
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,030
Gosh, that looks tasty.

1461
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,670
(The masters now enjoy the food.)

1462
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,770
It's good.

1463
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,610
Goodness.

1464
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:38,470
(Even elegantly having
a crème brûlée)

1465
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,640
This is good.

1466
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,040
- It's so good.
- The strawberry latte is delicious.

1467
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,450
(Stomping his feet)

1468
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,250
- Jae Seok, this.
- Is it that good?

1469
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,020
- Hurry.
- Is it good?

1470
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,020
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1471
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,020
(The sweet dessert
brings out his cuteness.)

1472
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,760
(Gulping)

1473
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,430
- It's so good.
- The strawberry latte is delicious.

1474
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,530
(Every time the masters
eat something)

1475
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,860
- This should be cut.
- I see.

1476
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,630
- That looks delicious.
- Unbelievable.

1477
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,470
- And now...
- Yes?

1478
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,340
- Yes?
- You can leave us.

1479
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:10,970
Hold on.

1480
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,040
(The butlers will now leave
since they've done their jobs.)

1481
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,710
- That's not it.
- We're supposed to stay.

1482
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,080
Don't stick around
and dismiss yourselves.

1483
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,050
(Master Seung Ho uses that opportunity
to grant a favor.)

1484
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:25,990
(Munching)

1485
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,030
- I could peel the wrapper off.
- It's too dry.

1486
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,600
(Laughing)

1487
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,200
(Glancing)

1488
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,600
(He is granted another favor.)

1489
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,940
- Should I feed you?
- Seung Ho.

1490
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,570
- Butler Kusa.
- It's all right.

1491
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,040
The cake was too dry.

1492
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,910
- Seriously.
- I'm sorry.

1493
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,650
You must personally know
Master Seung Ho,

1494
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,710
but that doesn't give you
the right to eat the food.

1495
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,520
Shouldn't we be allowed to eat...

1496
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,390
what the masters give us?

1497
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,420
- What?
- Your word is our command.

1498
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,020
Thank you.

1499
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,060
I see.

1500
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,160
- Have the butlers seen this?
- Excuse me?

1501
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,530
- See what?
- You'll be performing live.

1502
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,700
- A live show.
- We didn't catch that.

1503
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,900
(A live show is listed on the menu.)

1504
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,400
Perform live for us later on.

1505
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,570
- We should see the show.
- Are you hoping to see it?

1506
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,740
- We'll order the half show.
- The live show.

1507
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,440
Is a live show on the menu?

1508
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,640
(From flawless group dancing...)

1509
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:28,050
(to being charming enough
to entertain the ladies)

1510
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,820
Do I call them the butlers?
All butlers,

1511
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,490
- let's prepare for our show.
- Let's go.

1512
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,490
- Sure.
- You shouldn't...

1513
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,260
- It's in English.
- dance the moves with force.

1514
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,990
- It goes like this.
- Keep it light?

1515
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,030
This is the concept of this dance.

1516
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,200
- Can you show me?
- It goes like this.

1517
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,700
- Here.
- The signature move is this.

1518
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,530
Should we start off with this?

1519
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,670
- Right.
- Left foot, then right. And left.

1520
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,140
- Too bad?
- Like this.

1521
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,400
- "Touch My Body?"
- That's English.

1522
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,410
- Please do your best.
- Sure.

1523
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,410
- Please do your best.
- Sure.

1524
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,610
(Gently)

1525
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,420
Butler Kusa, aren't you
sweating too much?

1526
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,980
Your sideburns are soaked.

1527
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,320
"Touch My Body" is a good option.

1528
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,020
I feel bad for Ho Jun.

1529
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,190
- I feel terrible.
- Please do your best.

1530
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,560
- Sure.
- Butler Kusa,

1531
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,090
- you'll have our attention.
- Sure.

1532
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,160
Please give it your best.

1533
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,160
Got it.

1534
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,930
(What's the performance
that has Ho Jun trembling?)

1535
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,930
What about Can's song?

1536
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,230
- Whose song? "Barefooted Youth?"
- "Barefooted Youth."

1537
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,340
Masters, Miss.

1538
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,370
- Okay.
- Go for it.

1539
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,210
Thank you!

1540
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,380
(Sounding like a show host)

1541
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,140
- That's how you do it.
- Thank you...

1542
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,180
for being at our cafe today.

1543
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,120
We're joined by a new butler.

1544
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,080
Ho Jun, Son Ho Jun.

1545
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,690
I don't know if he knows this song,

1546
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,420
but he'll do his best.

1547
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,820
- Go around in a circle.
- Let's party.

1548
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,690
(The camera follows them
involuntarily.)

1549
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,690
Okay!

1550
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,460
Bring the beat.

1551
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,460
(The cameras can't help
but film the star-studded lineup.)

1552
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,700
- Let's go.
- Move.

1553
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,300
Ho Jun, let's go!

1554
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,500
(No connections and no vision)

1555
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,930
No...

1556
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
No...

1557
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,170
- No connections
- Let's go!

1558
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:59,040
(He chokes right off the bat.)

1559
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:03,080
How many times were you going
to kick off the song?

1560
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,810
That was due to a lack of practice.

1561
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,580
How many times were you going
to kick off the song?

1562
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,120
What more do you want from us?

1563
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,220
Is this a team gathering
for the butlers?

1564
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,520
- What?
- What on earth is this?

1565
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,490
(They were having fun,
regardless of the audience.)

1566
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,830
We wanted to watch a performance.

1567
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,760
Who was that performance for?

1568
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,560
- Who was that for?
- Hold on.

1569
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,900
I'll sing a better song.

1570
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,370
- We'll sing something better.
- Something better.

1571
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,440
- We should make a request.
- Of course.

1572
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,940
- Butler Kusa.
- Yes?

1573
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,600
Is there a song
you can confidently sing?

1574
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,210
Oh, "Unpredictable Life..."

1575
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,710
- Oh, "Unpredictable Life?"
- Oh, the song?

1576
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,040
- The song by Lee Moon Sae?
- Yes.

1577
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,210
Is that the song that goes
like "Bravo?"

1578
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,810
- No, it's not.
- That's weird.

1579
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,720
- By Lee Moon Sae.
- Okay, Lee Moon Sae.

1580
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,420
- Let's go.
- It's so eye-catching.

1581
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,020
Yes, thank you to everyone...

1582
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,220
- who has come today.
- What is this?

1583
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,820
(The cheap MC barges in again.)

1584
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,230
Seriously, what is that?

1585
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,860
- What are you doing?
- What is this, a dinner show?

1586
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,330
- What is this?
- This time...

1587
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,170
Our club is always open to you.

1588
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,530
- Swa.
- This time,

1589
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,940
we have a newbie butler.

1590
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,110
It is...

1591
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,110
Son Kusa!

1592
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,540
When will I Know all about love?

1593
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,650
About love

1594
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,220
When will I know
all about the world?

1595
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,220
About the world

1596
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,820
(Why am I here
and why am I doing this?)

1597
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,790
(Life really is so unpredictable.)

1598
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,590
(Singing his heart out)

1599
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,590
- Can't I?
- Can't I?

1600
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,630
Can't you delay it

1601
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,360
(Holding back his laughter)

1602
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,460
Is this a 70th birthday party
or something?

1603
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,370
- Seung Ho seems so uncomfortable.
- It's like...

1604
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,100
I'm at a team dinner.

1605
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,270
- What do you think you're doing?
- Turn off the music!

1606
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,910
It is too

1607
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,240
Is this a team dinner?

1608
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,340
- Gosh, we're sorry.
- I mean...

1609
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,850
- Is this a team dinner?
- Well, then... Something else.

1610
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,550
Why are you playing the tambourine?

1611
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,320
- I wanted to make you happy.
- Then,

1612
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,380
- if you give us one more chance...
- Try the performance once more.

1613
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,550
- Give us one last chance.
- All right.

1614
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,290
- Do what we asked you for.
- Okay.

1615
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,660
- Do something exciting.
- I know.

1616
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,490
Can't you make things
a little more exciting?

1617
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,990
- Can't you do it?
- We're here to have fun.

1618
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,800
- All right.
- Sorry. We have a special talent.

1619
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,360
What is it?
This is seriously your last chance.

1620
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,930
So, our Butler Ye Eun...
I mean, Butler Kororok...

1621
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,200
"Be My Baby."

1622
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,040
- "Be My Baby?" Yes, I know this.
- "Be My Baby."

1623
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,810
- All right. "Be My Baby."
- "Be My Baby."

1624
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:11,910
- "Be My Baby."
- Hey, you have to pull this off.

1625
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,310
- I have to pull it off.
- If not, we'll get fired.

1626
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,710
For real, I'll dance in front.

1627
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,310
- I mean, this is their last chance.
- Seriously.

1628
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,410
Please give us one last chance,
Master.

1629
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,950
Also, stop talking.

1630
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,680
Please stop talking
during the performance.

1631
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,850
That's such an outdated thing to do.

1632
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,590
- In that case, I will...
- Outdated thing to do.

1633
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,390
Ye Eun, focus on the dance.

1634
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,730
Hello, everyone!

1635
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,660
Yes, thanks...

1636
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,800
Thank you so much
for coming to our cafe!

1637
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,470
- So,
- Gosh, I'm sweating.

1638
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,270
the highlight of this show.

1639
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,300
The performance by our butlers.

1640
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,010
Please welcome them
with a round of applause!

1641
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,170
(Good luck?)

1642
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,040
As I keep watching, waiting

1643
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,180
I hope you approach me

1644
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,180
(Getting the lyrics wrong)

1645
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,880
- Nice!
- You're doing well!

1646
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,850
- Dreaming, I hope you feel the same
- Yes!

1647
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,520
- This is the song I know, right?
- Yes, it is rather...

1648
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:04,630
(A performance where the lyrics
and pitch are all unclear.)

1649
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,200
(Why is this the pride
of Seok Sam Nightclub?)

1650
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,630
(Her insane spirit)

1651
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,170
- Here she goes.
- Say that

1652
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,300
- You've got this!
- I love you

1653
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,700
Two, three, four!

1654
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,300
Please be my baby

1655
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,270
(Please be my baby)

1656
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,640
(Sprinkling cute acts
with every breath)

1657
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,940
I feel like I might go crazy

1658
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,010
- Because I want you so badly
- My goodness.

1659
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,250
To the left. Go.

1660
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,750
- Nice.
- Go.

1661
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,920
(The MC, choreography, and spirit
were all perfect.)

1662
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,420
- Nice.
- Thank you so much.

1663
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,790
- Great.
- We did our best. Yes.

1664
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:40,100
Did you vomit at the end?
I think I heard wretching.

1665
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,560
Nice.

1666
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,800
- I think you vomited at the end.
- Awesome!

1667
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,600
- That was nice.
- It was.

1668
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,670
- That was great.
- It really was.

1669
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,800
- Gosh, that was awesome.
- It was great.

1670
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,540
- This one was nice.
- Good job.

1671
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,840
If not for this,
we wouldn't have paid.

1672
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,640
- Right.
- Who are they kidding?

1673
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,180
- Goodness. Thank you.
- That's right.

1674
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,580
Give us lots of love. Thank you!

1675
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,680
Thank you.

1676
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,650
- We'll pay our bill now.
- Thank you.

1677
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,480
- We'll pay the bill now.
- Pardon? Pay your bill?

1678
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,790
- Oh, we should get the bill.
- The bill?

1679
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,220
- How much...
- You were so good.

1680
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,960
- Should we ask for 2,700 dollars?
- Yes.

1681
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,520
Let's give it to them for
1,750 dollars since they're family.

1682
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,990
- Okay, 1,750 dollars.
- Yes, 1,750 dollars.

1683
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,830
- It's 1,750 dollars.
- Go and tell them.

1684
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,900
- It's 1,750 dollars.
- Shall we go outside now?

1685
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,900
Tell them.

1686
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,170
- Gosh, that was hilarious.
- Oh, that was a nice snack.

1687
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,900
- You have to pay.
- So, which master will be paying?

1688
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,900
Pardon?

1689
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,570
Your total bill is 1,750 dollars.

1690
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,210
- What did you say?
- What did he say?

1691
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,710
- Your total is 1,750 dollars...
- Be confident.

1692
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,510
Your total bill is 1,750 dollars.

1693
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,280
Bring me the bill.

1694
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:34,050
While I'm being nice...

1695
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,250
(While I'm being nice...)

1696
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,020
- You should pay...
- Wait.

1697
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,920
- What are you doing?
- I mean...

1698
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,190
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

1699
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,960
- Why are you sweating so much?
- I mean...

1700
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,090
What are you doing?

1701
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,360
- Okay!
- Gosh, I'm thirsty.

1702
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,100
Drink water if you're thirsty.

1703
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,300
I'm thirsty.

1704
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,540
Ye Eun,
can you grab me one on your way?

1705
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,700
- Thanks. A bottle of water.
- What?

1706
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,310
- Thanks, Ye Eun.
- Sure. Who wants some water?

1707
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:01,410
Ye Eun, you're so annoying
ever since you lost weight.

1708
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,740
- Because I've gotten prettier?
- What?

1709
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,750
(Suddenly being mean)

1710
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,180
- "Because I've gotten prettier?"
- No.

1711
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,050
By the way,
you're very pretty in person.

1712
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:10,650
- Is that so?
- You're very pretty in person.

1713
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,190
- Really?
- Hey, don't say that.

1714
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,960
- Don't say that stuff.
- It'll spoil her.

1715
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,220
- Gosh, seriously.
- Ye Eun might not...

1716
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,530
- be able to sleep.
- I used to really like Seung Ho.

1717
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,790
- Really?
- Yes.

1718
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,500
- Why?
- She's flirting again,

1719
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,660
- Jae Seok.
- Flirting with who?

1720
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,130
- With Seung Ho.
- No, but he said I was pretty.

1721
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,200
- Because he said she was pretty.
- He said she was pretty in person.

1722
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,170
He said she looks better in person,
and she said she used to like him.

1723
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,810
- Really? But...
- Yes.

1724
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,210
- You just look better than on TV.
- Right.

1725
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,310
- I'm sure Seung Ho wouldn't lie,
- Yes.

1726
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,980
but as soon as the shoot is over,

1727
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,110
he'll get in his van
and leave right away.

1728
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,980
- That's right.
- I'm sure he will.

1729
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,020
I'm on board if it's Seung Ho.

1730
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,020
- Ye Eun.
- What?

1731
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,720
- Hey, what is this place?
- Gosh, what is this?

1732
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:52,090
The second turf
you must take over is...

1733
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,300
the pink-hued instant tteokbokki
restaurant that killers love.

1734
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,100
- It's tteokbokki.
- Instant tteokbokki.

1735
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,100
(The second turf:
An instant tteokbokki restaurant)

1736
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,130
How nice.

1737
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,300
The gang that wins the turf war...

1738
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,610
- can eat as much as they'd like.
- Okay!

1739
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,210
But the losing gang
must go back to the car,

1740
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,710
and they can only enter
the restaurant...

1741
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,210
when the winning team
calls them for an errand.

1742
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,210
- That's the most annoying.
- Today's mission is hard.

1743
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,050
The mission with lunch on the line
is Ball Security Area.

1744
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,020
You must steal the ball
from one another.

1745
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,860
When stealing the ball,
you can only use your feet.

1746
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,860
- Feet only.
- Nice.

1747
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,020
Can there be no physical contact?

1748
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,690
- That doesn't matter.
- Okay, contact doesn't matter.

1749
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,030
Oh, okay.

1750
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,030
(This is
the Tiger Gang's specialty.)

1751
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,370
(Round 1: Se Chan and Ho Jun
versus Daniel and Seung Ho)
All right.

1752
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,840
Good job. That's it.

1753
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,740
- Go.
- Daniel.

1754
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,640
- This is...
- It's okay.

1755
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,410
- Okay!
- Okay, we won.

1756
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,810
We'll be able to eat.

1757
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:43,610
(Next, Round 2: Jong Kook and Se Chan
versus Jae Seok and Daniel)

1758
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,850
- Jong Kook.
- No.

1759
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,750
- Hey, Jong Kook! This one!
- Hey, stop him.

1760
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,620
Jong Kook, three of them. Yes, nice.

1761
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,220
Take that.

1762
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,690
- Stop it.
- Okay.

1763
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,060
- Okay!
- What was that?

1764
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,790
- What just happened?
- Yes!

1765
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,760
The Tiger Gang won.

1766
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,260
- Yes!
- Yes!

1767
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,100
Hey, how can he...

1768
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,800
Then, the Locust Gang can go...

1769
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,500
- to the car now.
- Wait there.

1770
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,470
Okay, go and wait. Hey!

1771
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,310
- My goodness.
- My gosh.

1772
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,580
- But it sounds so delicious.
- Gosh, I'm tired.

1773
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,140
- My goodness.
- Gosh, I wanted to win...

1774
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,380
- the lunch mission.
- I know, right?

1775
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,810
- Oh, right.
- If we press this...

1776
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,010
- Okay.
- Oh, will they come?

1777
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,850
- Okay.
- I'll leave it with you, Seok Jin.

1778
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,320
Hey, if you have anything you want,
feel free to call those guys.

1779
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,090
- What should we ask them for?
- In that case...

1780
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,560
- Let's see if this works or not.
- Yes, check it.

1781
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,360
Yu Jae Seok.

1782
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,800
He went to the restroom.

1783
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,530
- Have him hurry up.
- Hey, wait.

1784
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,030
What's with her tone of voice?
Have her come in here.

1785
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,700
Oh, do you have to hold it?

1786
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,000
Hey, Song Ji Hyo.
Get in here for a second.

1787
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:45,740
Ji Hyo just went to the restroom.

1788
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,640
Gosh, they can't do this.

1789
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,150
- Say that I went to the restroom.
- Okay.

1790
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,820
If they ask where you are,
we'll say you're in the restroom.

1791
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,820
(The butlers have
no intention of being obedient.)

1792
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,320
We should make Seok Jin angry.

1793
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,320
Hey, Seung Ho. Tell me.

1794
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,790
Tell me which ones went
to the restroom.

1795
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,500
Seung Ho just went to the restroom.

1796
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,800
- Was that Ji Hyo?
- It was.

1797
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,540
- Tell Ji Hyo...
- Ask if they all went as a group.

1798
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,600
- They went together.
- Did he go with Ji Hyo?

1799
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,070
- How does that make sense?
- It was Ji Hyo?

1800
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,840
Then, Song Ji Hyo,
get in here right now.

1801
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,910
Get in here!

1802
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:24,910
(Suddenly being stern)

1803
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:28,050
Seok Jin, this is Seung Ho.
Everyone went to the restroom.

1804
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,320
- Seok Jin, you should go out there.
- He learned something bad.

1805
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,520
(He learned something bad.)

1806
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,220
- You should go. Go to the bus.
- Yes, you should go.

1807
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,490
(The oldest killer in the industry
can't take it and gets up.)

1808
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,790
- Go and sort them all out.
- Gosh, I'm so mad.

1809
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:39,290
- Seok Jin, yell at them.
- I am...

1810
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,360
Gosh, I'm so mad.

1811
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,630
I'm so angry.

1812
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:46,800
(He sets off to tighten
their lax discipline.)

1813
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,840
Hey!

1814
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,510
Take turns to go to the restroom,
all right?

1815
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:52,740
- Okay.
- Got it?

1816
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,580
- Okay.
- All right.

1817
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,780
- Don't go all at the same time.
- Okay.

1818
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,810
The concept is that you guys
have to come to us.

1819
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,050
- Got it.
- Okay.

1820
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,620
- I shouldn't come to you, okay?
- All right.

1821
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,120
- We understand.
- Before I get mad!

1822
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,520
- All right.
- Okay, take turns...

1823
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,320
- as you go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1824
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:08,320
I'm watching you.

1825
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,690
Gosh, these punks.
They're making me mad.

1826
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,330
- I showed them who's boss.
- Good.

1827
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,000
- Did you teach them a lesson?
- Were they all there?

1828
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,500
- They were.
- Seok Jin, try calling them again.

1829
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,800
I told them to take turns
when going to the restroom.

1830
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Oh, good job.

1831
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,500
Then call someone now.
Call whoever is last to go.

1832
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,870
Yu Jae Seok,
come in here for a second.

1833
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,810
Seok Jin,
I'm in the restroom right now.

1834
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,050
He said he was in the restroom.

1835
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,510
(His lesson didn't make
any difference.)

1836
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,690
Hey! Yoo Seung Ho.
You should get in here.

1837
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,290
Please, I'm asking you a favor.

1838
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,590
Seok Jin, I'll be right there
after I pee. One second.

1839
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,390
They can't do this!

1840
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,730
- Seok Jin, just... One person...
- Jong Kook, you should call them.

1841
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,830
Say that we'll feed one of them.
Have someone come.

1842
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,670
- Let's try that.
- Whoever comes can eat.

1843
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,840
We'll feed
whoever gets in here first.

1844
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,940
We'll feed you something good,
so get in here quickly!

1845
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,470
- They'll come if we do this.
- Will they come?

1846
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,210
And when they come,
we'll have them work.

1847
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,750
We'll feed
whoever gets in here first.

1848
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,850
We'll feed you something good,
so get in here quickly!

1849
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,780
(Suddenly getting up)

1850
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,190
(Their gang falls apart right away.)

1851
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,750
- No, Haha.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1852
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,020
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay, rock-paper-scissors.

1853
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,490
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1854
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,720
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

1855
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,090
Rock-paper-scissors.

1856
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,530
Rock-paper-scissors.

1857
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,330
- My goodness. Seriously?
- My gosh.

1858
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:22,660
- Darn it.
- Hang on.

1859
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,100
- Why is it that...
- This is a trap.

1860
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,800
- It's a trap. They won't feed you.
- This is a trap.

1861
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,600
- Let's see.
- Here he comes. It's Haha.

1862
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,240
- Seok Jin, I used the restroom.
- Okay.

1863
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,210
Why did you guys use the restroom
as a group?

1864
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,810
- Thank you, Seok Jin.
- Put that down, Haha.

1865
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,650
- To eat...
- Thank you for your hard work.

1866
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:40,580
- Show your stomach.
- Yes.

1867
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,680
Show your stomach.

1868
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,450
- That's over.
- Come on.

1869
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,790
- Show your stomach...
- Do it.

1870
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:45,950
- and bring that.
- Do it.

1871
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,090
- Come on.
- Will you really give me food?

1872
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,790
- Yes, of course.
- Of course.

1873
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,160
- Go and bring the food.
- Let me get ready first.

1874
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,590
Okay. Show your stomach.

1875
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,190
I called Seung Ho, but you came.

1876
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,400
Did you erase it?

1877
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,160
The food will be tasty.

1878
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,870
- His belly is cute.
- Haha, your belly is so cute.

1879
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,400
(He begins to serve food
with his belly hanging out.)

1880
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,410
- There you go.
- His belly is cute.

1881
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,810
(The customers
are highly satisfied.)

1882
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,980
- This is fun.
- His belly is cute.

1883
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,780
It's cute.

1884
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,550
- It's cute.
- It's cute.

1885
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,080
- Let's give it to Haha.
- Haha should eat...

1886
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,920
- since he works hard.
- That's right.

1887
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,820
- He's good.
- Come here. They must be watching.

1888
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,420
Well done.

1889
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,560
(He puts on a show
in order to eat tteokbokki.)

1890
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,960
Well done.

1891
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,490
- Haha.
- Here.

1892
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:25,560
Well done.

1893
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,130
(He gets a flat dumpling.)

1894
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,930
(Are you jealous?)

1895
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,300
Gosh, he's so vulgar.

1896
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,470
Seriously.

1897
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,870
I can't believe him.

1898
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:36,900
(Gulping)

1899
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,540
- We'll give you more.
- We'll give you more.

1900
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,010
(Seung Ho is jealous
of the vulgar traitor.)

1901
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,280
Come here, Haha.
We need to tempt them.

1902
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,540
- It's cute.
- It looks delicious.

1903
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,580
- French fries. It looks tasty.
- It looks tasty.

1904
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,180
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

1905
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,380
- It looks so tasty.
- It's no joke.

1906
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,390
- It looks tasty.
- Take a seat.

1907
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,350
- Gosh, it looks so tasty.
- It looks tasty.

1908
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:54,460
(The chewy flour cake
has absorbed the soup.)

1909
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:57,030
(Se Chan eats the noodles first.)

1910
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,790
This place has tasty food.

1911
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,860
(Food Fighter wraps the noodles
with fishcake and takes a bite.)

1912
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,200
- It's really tasty.
- I know.

1913
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,360
(Food Fighter wraps the noodles
with fishcake and takes a bite.)

1914
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,430
- It's perfect now.
- Ramyeon is really tasty.

1915
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:05,770
(Butler Son had to eat bread
with caution earlier.)

1916
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,940
- Haha.
- That's right. Enjoy the food.

1917
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,270
Daniel can show his stomach.

1918
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,510
It's cute.

1919
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,310
(He eats without reservation.)

1920
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,240
(My goodness)

1921
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,580
(My goodness)

1922
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,920
(The Locust Gang is suffering
due to hunger.)

1923
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,920
- It must be tasty.
- I'm hungry.

1924
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,490
- Seriously.
- I want to eat tteokbokki.

1925
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,050
- I really want to eat it.
- I haven't had it for so long.

1926
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,220
We aren't how we used to be.

1927
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,890
By any chance...

1928
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:34,630
(Why did he suddenly pick up
the walkie-talkie?)

1929
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,900
- Do you need one more person?
- Yoo Seung Ho.

1930
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,530
- For goodness' sake.
- Seung Ho.

1931
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,670
(Smiling)

1932
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,740
- Come on.
- Whoever comes first...

1933
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,910
will switch places with Haha.

1934
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,310
This applies
to whoever comes first. Go.

1935
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:46,340
Who will it be?

1936
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,610
- We're set.
- Don't give him more food.

1937
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,610
(Big Nose makes
a generous proposal.)

1938
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,180
What? Are you going to go?
Is that why you're giving it to me?

1939
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,680
Seung Ho is coming.

1940
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,590
- Should I go now?
- Yes, you should go now.

1941
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,390
- Hey.
- Seung Ho.

1942
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,060
- I want to drink some water.
- What?

1943
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,390
- Water.
- Water.

1944
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,490
(Seung Ho becomes the new server.)

1945
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,360
- Haha, go.
- Go.

1946
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,360
Coca-Cola.

1947
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,070
(He stuffs his face
until the very end.)

1948
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,300
- Coca-Cola.
- Haha, go.

1949
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:15,840
(Meanwhile, Seung Ho
delivers Coca-Cola.)

1950
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,140
- The server is quite nice.
- Thank you.

1951
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,370
- All right.
- My goodness.

1952
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:20,910
- Okay.
- This is so nice.

1953
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,080
(What's so nice?)

1954
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,080
- Haha.
- It's so tasty.

1955
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,310
- Haha, what's wrong with you?
- What?

1956
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,520
Hey, they let you eat anything
if you show your belly.

1957
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,120
(Hey, they let you eat anything
if you show your belly.)

1958
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:30,690
Really?

1959
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,120
Don't let your pride get in the way.
It's so tasty.

1960
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,690
Why did you come back?

1961
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,890
They told me to go.

1962
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,560
If you dance
with your belly showing,

1963
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,400
they'll ask you to come in. I swear.

1964
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,870
Daniel.

1965
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,270
(Haha tempts him to sell his soul
for tteokbokki.)

1966
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,570
Seung Ho is ready
to show his belly too.

1967
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,040
What is Seung Ho doing?
He keeps serving instead of eating.

1968
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,870
- Seung Ho, you should open it.
- That's right.

1969
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,780
- Seung Ho, you should open it.
- You should open it.

1970
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,940
Thank you.

1971
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,680
Why...

1972
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,520
Can't he eat with us?

1973
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,850
Hey, Ji Ye Eun.

1974
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,650
- Focus, okay?
- Ye Eun.

1975
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,950
"Can't he eat with us?"
Don't speak nonsense.

1976
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,020
- There are rules.
- This isn't the right time.

1977
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,160
- Hey.
- Don't speak nonsense.

1978
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,490
- Do you think we're at that cafe?
- Right now...

1979
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,860
This is a different place.

1980
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,360
I want to eat with him.

1981
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:17,030
Hey.

1982
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,700
Take one.

1983
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,170
- You should eat one. Right?
- Dip it in the soup.

1984
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,570
Take one.

1985
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,910
- One.
- One?

1986
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,110
One. That's right.

1987
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,040
No. Take one. Don't do that.

1988
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,910
Don't do that.

1989
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,280
- That's... Hey!
- One.

1990
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,410
- Oh, my.
- That's...

1991
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,750
(He runs off with the cup!)

1992
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,980
Look at that. He's a spy.

1993
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,220
- That's cute.
- He...

1994
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,520
(That's cute.)

1995
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:38,590
Hey.

1996
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:39,890
How is that cute?

1997
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,660
- What's wrong with you?
- How is that cute?

1998
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,220
What's wrong with you?

1999
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,830
- He's incredible.
- My goodness.

2000
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,830
- Eat it.
- What?

2001
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,460
- My goodness.
- What's this?

2002
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,300
- Seung Ho.
- Seung Ho doesn't disappoint.

2003
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,130
He's different from you.

2004
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:54,340
- He's really different from me.
- He's different from Haha.

2005
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,570
- You're...
- You're seriously hopeless.

2006
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,840
He's something else.

2007
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,370
- I can do the same.
- It'll be really tasty...

2008
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,580
with tteokbokki soup.

2009
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,980
It should be dipped
in tteokbokki soup.

2010
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,410
(The taste makes them
crave tteokbokki.)

2011
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:06,510
It's tasty.

2012
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,480
(My goodness)

2013
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,750
It's so tasty.

2014
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,420
- Gosh, it's so tasty.
- It's tasty.

2015
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,860
- What was that?
- Seung Ho, what was that?

2016
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,290
What was that?

2017
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,690
He's an enemy.

2018
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,290
Did Seung Ho come back? What's this?

2019
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,830
- Did you come back?
- What's this?

2020
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,160
- I...
- I mean...

2021
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,200
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey.

2022
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,570
- I'll get you some water.
- You should've left...

2023
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,200
- after that.
- How could you face us...

2024
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,840
after pulling that stunt?

2025
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,240
- I'll pour you water.
- He kneeled.

2026
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,970
- My goodness.
- After hearing...

2027
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,470
- that she's prettier in person...
- Hey, Yoo Seung Ho.

2028
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:34,640
- What is the butler doing here?
- What?

2029
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,010
(Haha entered the place to see
if there was something to eat.)

2030
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:37,310
Why did you come back?

2031
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,880
We didn't call you.

2032
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,980
(Whistling)

2033
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,420
You should show your stomach.

2034
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,820
- You need to show your stomach.
- Look at this guy.

2035
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:48,690
(Meanwhile,
Daniel becomes thoughtful.)

2036
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,960
Gosh, why would I bet my life
on tteokbokki?

2037
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,230
- That's right.
- Gosh.

2038
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,030
I can eat tteokbokki when I go home.

2039
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,970
Seriously.

2040
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,200
(What?)

2041
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,370
Gosh.

2042
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,970
Gosh.

2043
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,770
(Daniel shows his belly
as soon as he gets out of the car.)

2044
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,710
Hey.

2045
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:11,480
(Here comes a belly dancer.)

2046
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,750
(The 2nd dance is twerking.)

2047
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,080
- Hey.
- Daniel.

2048
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,720
- Yes?
- Your belly isn't cute.

2049
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,890
- Yes?
- Your belly isn't cute.

2050
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,790
You should stick it out a bit.

2051
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,290
He just showed it.

2052
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,830
- He plucked up his courage.
- Show it.

2053
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,460
Haha.

2054
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,430
Show him how one's belly should be.

2055
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,800
- Show him how cute it should be.
- His belly...

2056
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:35,000
(Ta-da!)

2057
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:39,040
(Prince Pot Belly gives
a nice demonstration.)

2058
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,210
- Seriously.
- You don't have a belly.

2059
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:42,440
I can't do it.

2060
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:45,810
I'm hungry.

2061
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,220
(Even as the others show skin,
Seung Ho remains composed.)

2062
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,480
It's so tasty.

2063
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,550
(Even as the others show skin,
Seung Ho remains composed.)

2064
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,920
If you show your belly...

2065
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,720
(Staring)

2066
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,930
(He's filling his stomach
with water.)

2067
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:05,270
(Glancing over)

2068
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,200
Why isn't Jae Seok coming?

2069
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,800
(Eat this.)

2070
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,940
Ji Ye Eun, you're ridiculous.

2071
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,040
You're feeding him.

2072
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,380
- What a mess.
- You're ridiculous.

2073
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:16,880
- What a mess.
- What are you doing?

2074
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,010
What are you doing?

2075
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,580
What are you doing?

2076
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,020
He's a guest.

2077
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,650
He's in the opposing gang.

2078
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,090
- Come here.
- What?

2079
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,090
- What?
- Come here.

2080
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,160
(She invites him to the seat
next to hers.)

2081
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,160
Sit here.

2082
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,030
Are you inviting him to your house?

2083
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,460
(Are you inviting him
to your house?)

2084
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,200
My goodness.

2085
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:35,600
(He goes as he's called.)

2086
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,670
- The food is tasty.
- Seriously.

2087
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:38,930
It's really tasty.

2088
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:41,100
- Would you get me chopsticks?
- Of course.

2089
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,200
Would you get me chopsticks
and a plate?

2090
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,740
Will you share food with him?

2091
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,410
It's so nice.

2092
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:50,240
(Eat comfortably.)

2093
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,610
Jong Kook.

2094
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:52,980
- Ye Eun gave a plate...
- Ye Eun, what are you doing?

2095
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,180
to Seung Ho.

2096
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,180
- Hey.
- Did you give it to Seung Ho?

2097
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,250
What are you doing?

2098
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,650
- Eat.
- The two of them...

2099
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,650
- If you eat this,
- Ye Eun...

2100
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,960
you have to go out with me.

2101
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,420
(If you eat this,
you have to go out with me.)

2102
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,730
- If you eat this,
- Ye Eun...

2103
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:05,930
you have to go out with me.

2104
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,200
(It turns out that the meal came
with a hefty price.)

2105
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,500
Seung Ho, run out.

2106
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,070
(Halting)

2107
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,140
Hey, date her briefly and break up.

2108
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,370
Hey, date her briefly and break up.

2109
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,170
(A clean piece of advice
from a total thinker)

2110
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:20,370
Hey, date her briefly and break up.

2111
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,840
- Seriously.
- Break up after the shoot.

2112
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,880
Hey, date her briefly and break up.

2113
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,180
(He eats it.)

2114
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,050
This is our first day as a couple.

2115
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,450
That's right.

2116
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:32,590
This is our first day as a couple.

2117
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,990
(They're Romeo and Juliet
of the killer scene.)

2118
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:36,860
- Jae Seok...
- All right.

2119
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:40,160
(Daniel begins eating.)

2120
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,330
It's so tasty.

2121
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,800
- It's tasty, right?
- Yes.

2122
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,870
- They seem very amicable.
- Really?

2123
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,600
- Is Seung Ho sitting down?
- Seung Ho...

2124
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,170
Yes, Seung Ho is sitting down
as well.

2125
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,240
Jae Seok won't come until the end.

2126
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,370
Is Jae Seok a director?

2127
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,610
What's up with Jae Seok?

2128
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,550
What's up with him?

2129
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,380
(Seok Jin is frustrated
that he can't make Jae Seok come.)

2130
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,650
(Is Ji Hyo surrendering?)

2131
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,250
- That's right.
- Ji Hyo.

2132
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,220
Welcome.

2133
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,120
It isn't like that.
Jae Seok is waiting for you.

2134
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,320
He's waiting for you.

2135
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,160
He has so much to say to you.

2136
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,360
Leave him be.

2137
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,160
- Really?
- He really has something to say.

2138
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,300
- Seok Jin.
- Really?

2139
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,700
Seok Jin, I'm curious.
Would you please go just once?

2140
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:18,900
I'm so curious.

2141
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,270
Seok Jin, please go just once.

2142
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:23,440
(Others want it, he's curious,
and he likes feeling important.)

2143
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:24,810
For goodness' sake.
Hold on a second.

2144
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,680
It's annoying, but I can't hold back
since I'm so curious.

2145
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,740
(Due to the three reasons,
Seok Jin goes to the car.)

2146
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,740
He's coming.

2147
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,180
Hey.

2148
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,020
- The rule... Why aren't you coming?
- Why are you doing this?

2149
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,820
The rule...
To make you do something.

2150
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,420
What do you want me to do?

2151
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,620
An errand.

2152
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,920
- I'm the boss of a gang.
- What about it?

2153
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,660
I won't move easily
like my underlings.

2154
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,130
What do I need to do then?

2155
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:46,960
- In that case...
- What do you want?

2156
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,460
Give me a plate of tteokbokki
and fritters.

2157
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,200
I'm too annoyed
to bring them readily.

2158
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,330
(What will be the result
of this negotiation?)

2159
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,400
Hey, open the door.

2160
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,140
Hurry up and open the door.

2161
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,200
(He delivers tteokbokki.)

2162
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,410
Here he comes.

2163
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:00,910
It's time to go.

2164
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,310
(The prankster escapes.)

2165
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,880
(He visits the empty car.)

2166
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,320
I can't believe him.

2167
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,790
- There's a lot.
- I lost.

2168
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:13,890
- What?
- What?

2169
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:15,720
- How about Seok Jin?
- What?

2170
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,860
Seok Jin went to see you.

2171
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,530
How annoying.

2172
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,590
(Seok Jin got fooled today as well.)

2173
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,760
- How annoying.
- Seok Jin.

2174
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,260
- Didn't you see him?
- You brought it.

2175
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,270
Forget it.

2176
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:29,040
- Seok Jin went out for a walk.
- My goodness.

2177
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,500
- They missed each other.
- Oh, no.

2178
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,740
- No.
- You brought it.

2179
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,610
- I didn't bring it.
- Boss Kook.

2180
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,540
- Go ahead and eat.
- Okay.

2181
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,550
Don't sit down. You can't sit down.

2182
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,350
- You can't sit down.
- Ji Hyo.

2183
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,150
- What?
- This is my boyfriend's seat.

2184
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,080
- Your boyfriend?
- This is driving me crazy.

2185
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,390
This is my boyfriend's seat.

2186
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,320
- Sit down.
- My boyfriend, sit down.

2187
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,720
- Hey.
- You guys use a polite tone.

2188
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,490
- You...
- Thank you, my girlfriend.

2189
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:54,760
How could you abandon your family
just because you got a boyfriend?

2190
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,230
How are you a member
of the Chungju Ji Clan?

2191
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:58,970
Dad, that's how it is.

2192
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:00,830
I can't believe you.

2193
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,000
Are you going to eat like this?

2194
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,510
Are you eating?

2195
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,770
Are you eating
without my permission?

2196
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,640
I'm sorry,
but aren't you an underling?

2197
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,210
I can't believe these punks.
Hey, did you give him permission?

2198
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,280
Sit down.

2199
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,950
(Jong Kook orders him to sit down.)

2200
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:21,120
You haven't done anything right.

2201
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,860
- Don't ruin the atmosphere.
- It isn't like that.

2202
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,790
Before we move to the next location,

2203
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,500
- the two gangs should choose...
- Okay.

2204
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,360
between inside and outside.

2205
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,670
- What's that?
- The choices must be different.

2206
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,700
(They must choose
between inside and outside.)

2207
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,540
- Outside is better.
- As for us...

2208
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,870
We should choose outside as well.

2209
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,840
Then we'll need to compete for it.

2210
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,010
Is that so?

2211
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,240
(Laughing)

2212
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,110
What's wrong with Ye Eun today?

2213
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,980
Isn't she particularly strange today?
Seriously.

2214
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,550
- She keeps twisting her body.
- She's particularly strange today.

2215
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:50,380
- It's worse than usual. Hey.
- You know,

2216
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,690
- Ho Jun...
- What does that make Ho Jun?

2217
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,990
(Ddochi doesn't care
about Ho Jun at all.)

2218
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,260
- Ho Jun looks so pitiful.
- For goodness' sake.

2219
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,400
- What does that make Ho Jun?
- He's spacing out.

2220
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,330
- Hey.
- Ho Jun looks unhealthy today.

2221
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,270
- Seung Ho.
- Ho Jun is angry.

2222
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,030
(She's excited by herself.)

2223
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,840
What should we do?
Should we talk it out?

2224
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,970
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2225
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,270
Ho Jun and Seung Ho should play
rock-paper-scissors.

2226
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:12,610
- Ho Jun and Seung Ho.
- Yes.

2227
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,340
- Ye Eun.
- The winner gets to choose.

2228
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,740
You should root for him.

2229
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,480
- Go ahead.
- I can't do it.

2230
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,980
Isn't she on our team?

2231
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,350
- Isn't she on our team?
- She's on our team.

2232
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:24,180
- She's on our team.
- She's on our team.

2233
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,990
Ji Ye Eun, you should root
for Ho Jun.

2234
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,490
- I told her to root for Ho Jun.
- Why would you root for Seung Ho?

2235
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:28,660
(For goodness' sake!)

2236
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,990
Why is she rooting for her boyfriend
instead of her teammate?

2237
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,030
What is it?

2238
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,590
I don't want to play
rock-paper-scissors.

2239
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,630
- Shall we just choose inside?
- No.

2240
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:38,900
All right.

2241
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,370
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2242
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,640
Rock-paper-scissors.

2243
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,000
(Seung Ho wins.)

2244
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,210
Nothing is working out
for Ho Jun today.

2245
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,170
- Ho Jun just can't win.
- Let's choose inside.

2246
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,010
- Let's choose inside.
- Shall we do that?

2247
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,480
- Yes.
- Okay.

2248
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,550
We'll choose inside.

2249
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:53,510
- We'll choose inside.
- Really?

2250
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,650
The Locust Gang will take
the inside.

2251
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,320
The Tiger Gang will take
the outside.

2252
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,820
I'll explain the meaning
once we reach the new location.

2253
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,120
- Okay.
- Okay.

2254
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:03,420
- Okay.
- What's that?

2255
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,430
Will we be in different areas?

2256
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,630
We'll be outside for real.

2257
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,030
- Okay.
- Are we on this side?

2258
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,530
- They must've made it.
- We're outside.

2259
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:14,570
They made this structure.

2260
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,640
- My goodness.
- There's something.

2261
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,270
- They must've made it.
- There's something.

2262
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:19,840
- Jong Kook, there's something.
- That's right.

2263
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,310
This place is nice.

2264
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:23,110
- Sit down, Ho Jun.
- We're outside.

2265
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:24,410
- We can feel it.
- Being outside is nice.

2266
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:26,480
- I like being outside.
- The weather is so good.

2267
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,050
- They must've made it.
- Seok Jin.

2268
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,880
- It isn't a real building.
- It's so nice.

2269
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,020
It's nice.

2270
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,290
I like it today.

2271
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,490
- I like being outside.
- It's nice.

2272
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:36,520
(Meanwhile,
the Locust Gang chose inside.)

2273
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,620
What's up with the atmosphere?

2274
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,090
- Why is it...
- Why is it suddenly so scary?

2275
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,730
- Why do you look so serious?
- What's this?

2276
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:43,830
What's going on?

2277
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,670
- What's this?
- Why is it so solemn?

2278
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:49,000
- We suddenly became quiet.
- It's the killers' hideout.

2279
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,140
What?

2280
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,940
We can't call ourselves killers now.

2281
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,540
We lost our charisma.

2282
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,110
It feels more like a butler cafe.

2283
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,180
It ended after I showed my stomach.

2284
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:01,150
I'm the only one who maintained
the vibe of a killer.

2285
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,380
It ended the moment you showed
your stomach.

2286
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,850
The last turf war
that'll determine...

2287
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,690
the final winner is...

2288
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,420
the Killing X.

2289
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,160
In the set amount of time,

2290
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,460
find the other gang's flag
that's hidden in their turf...

2291
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,460
- in order to win.
- It's a war of flags.

2292
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,470
A flag.

2293
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:20,770
If neither gang fails
to retrieve the flag,

2294
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:23,770
the gang that has
more surviving members will win.

2295
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,040
The Tiger Gang chose outside.

2296
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,280
They can hide the flag outside,
including the headquarters.

2297
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,840
(Tiger Gang's turf: Front yard
of the outdoor headquarters)

2298
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,810
The Locust Gang chose inside.

2299
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:35,420
They can hide the flag
anywhere inside the building.

2300
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,920
(They can hide it anywhere indoors.)

2301
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,420
Can we hide it anywhere?

2302
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,620
The race will consist
of three rounds.

2303
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:46,160
In each round,
one target who can be eliminated...

2304
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,060
will be chosen
by the spinning wheel.

2305
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:51,730
After checking the target,
choose the method of elimination...

2306
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:54,600
and use the chosen method
to eliminate the target.

2307
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,240
- We need to choose the method.
- Yes.

2308
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,670
If you succeed in eliminating
the target in a round,

2309
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,080
you'll get a hint on the location
of the other gang's flag.

2310
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,680
(A hint on the location of the flag)

2311
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,050
In any case, we need to eliminate
the target in each round.

2312
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:09,220
If we do it, we'll receive a hint.

2313
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,150
- If we get eliminated,
- If we get eliminated...

2314
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,450
- they'll receive a hint.
- And...

2315
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,160
On the spinning wheel
that decides on the target,

2316
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,690
there are two names per member.

2317
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:22,130
You acquired a turf previously,

2318
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:25,830
so you'll receive a chance
to change two names.

2319
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:27,170
Please make both of them Seok Jin.

2320
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,470
- Yes.
- Then we'll have a better chance.

2321
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:32,410
You spun the wheel
with the changed names...

2322
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,010
- and got your target.
- Who is it?

2323
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:37,480
The Locust Gang's first target is...

2324
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,850
(The Locust Gang's first target)

2325
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,350
Who is it? I'm so curious.

2326
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,350
Who is it?

2327
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,480
It's Jee Seok Jin.

2328
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,190
(Seok Jin's name was
on 4 out of 10 blocks.)

2329
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,020
- I feel bad.
- All right.

2330
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,060
- How do we eliminate him?
- You can eliminate him...

2331
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,630
by using...

2332
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,090
- one of these two methods.
- Is that so?

2333
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,760
If we win, it's final.

2334
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,260
(What's the elimination method
Locust Gang chose?)

2335
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,300
- Does the target know?
- What is it?

2336
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,900
(Elimination Method)

2337
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,000
Piggyback Ride.

2338
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,940
If someone gets on the target's back
for 15 seconds,

2339
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,270
he or she's eliminated.

2340
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,040
We need to get on Seok Jin's back.

2341
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,680
Here Comes the Ball.

2342
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:10,640
If you give a ball to the target...

2343
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,680
and he or she kicks it or heads it,
he or she's eliminated.

2344
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,820
James Bond.

2345
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,790
If you hit the target's name tag
with a water gun,

2346
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:19,820
he or she's eliminated.

2347
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,720
Once you choose
an elimination method...

2348
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,490
for Seok Jin from the three of them,

2349
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,960
you won't be able to use it
for the following rounds.

2350
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,700
The thing is, we should begin
by taking a win.

2351
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,070
- That's right.
- We should win no matter what.

2352
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,540
You're Yu-mes Bond,

2353
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,840
- so pick the water gun.
- Shall we pick the water gun?

2354
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:40,410
I also think
that we should take control...

2355
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,680
- with a win.
- Seung Ho, you're here to win.

2356
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,110
That's right.
I lost in my past two visits.

2357
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,510
- I lost both times on the show.
- Again,

2358
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:47,510
- I lost.
- Seung Ho.

2359
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,320
- I really want to win.
- He hasn't won before.

2360
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,820
Jae Seok, then we should pick
the water gun.

2361
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,290
Then we can do it secretly.

2362
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:54,960
We can only use them once?

2363
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,090
(There are only 2 water guns.
You can only use them once.)

2364
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:58,160
- Two water guns?
- All right.

2365
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,790
- Seung Ho.
- You need to do well.

2366
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,130
Seung Ho, you need to hide it well.

2367
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,130
(The snipers are
Jae Seok and Seung Ho.)

2368
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,000
They might choose the same method.

2369
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,130
- Of course.
- Yes.

2370
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:07,330
My goodness.

2371
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,000
The Tiger Gang's first target is...

2372
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,040
Who is it?

2373
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,670
Song Ji Hyo.

2374
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:14,210
Ji Hyo isn't an easy target.

2375
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,640
"Elimination methods."

2376
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:18,710
- "Are You Annoyed?"
- "Are You Annoyed?"

2377
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:20,580
- "If you get hit..."
- You need to get hit.

2378
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:22,120
"by the target,
he or she's eliminated."

2379
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,880
It's easy. Ji Hyo hits people often.

2380
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,850
"If all members sign
the target's name tag,"

2381
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:27,960
"he or she's eliminated."

2382
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,520
- What's Recharge the Sugar Level?
- "If you feed a certain snack..."

2383
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,090
"to the target,
he or she's eliminated."

2384
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,430
- I should watch out.
- Seriously.

2385
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,860
- This is perfect for Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

2386
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,400
- It's the best.
- Yes.

2387
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:38,300
I think we should use it first.

2388
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,500
- Make an annoying comment.
- Make an annoying comment.

2389
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,100
- She hits you often.
- She hits me often.

2390
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,700
- I'll annoy her.
- My goodness.

2391
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,810
- Okay.
- "She hits me often."

2392
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:45,910
- Do they get the same one?
- Yes.

2393
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,070
- Tiger Gang. It's ours.
- But...

2394
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:49,340
- Ours...
- Is it the same size?

2395
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,510
Where are we supposed to hide it?

2396
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:51,710
Where will we hide it?

2397
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:53,150
Isn't the flag too big?

2398
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,780
Jong Kook, can you lift the set
for a second?

2399
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,680
- That's a good idea.
- Once you lift the set,

2400
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,850
- we can put the flag underneath.
- On the top...

2401
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:00,990
It'll be hard.

2402
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,360
They'll find it if it's on the top.

2403
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,760
They'll go up and look.

2404
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,060
They'll see it from the top.

2405
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:07,330
The location should make them go,
"This is too much."

2406
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,830
- They'll do the same.
- Exactly.

2407
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:11,830
If we break the set...

2408
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,670
It'll be nice to put it
between the columns.

2409
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,340
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

2410
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,740
Chan Hee.

2411
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,170
- Get up.
- Stick it in the back?

2412
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,480
Yes. We can stick it in the back.

2413
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,040
- I'm for the idea.
- From the pants to the top.

2414
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,250
- Kang Chan Hee.
- Kang Chan Hee.

2415
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,880
- Let's stick it in.
- Let's push it in there.

2416
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,980
But it's too long.
Wouldn't it come out?

2417
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,820
- No. If it's inside the pants...
- He's standing up.

2418
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,190
- I see.
- When he walks,

2419
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,620
his one leg can look like this.

2420
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,920
Hey.

2421
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,020
(Laughing)

2422
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,190
We can put it there...

2423
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:40,630
or use the light like this one.

2424
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,460
- We can put it inside.
- The inside.

2425
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,130
- Haven't we done that once?
- We can put it inside.

2426
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:48,000
Haven't we done that once?

2427
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I feel like I've done it once.
A chalk.

2428
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:54,310
(In Episode 566, they had
a mission of hiding a giant chalk.)

2429
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:57,040
(Haha hid it inside the light
and took 1st place.)

2430
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,280
- We can put it inside.
- Jae Seok, they'll find it.

2431
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,580
- I think they'll think of it.
- Do you know why?

2432
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,950
I used that method once.

2433
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:05,090
When we had to hide a long chalk,

2434
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,490
I hid it inside the light.

2435
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,790
- It's dangerous.
- But they won't check each one.

2436
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:10,060
Jae Seok.

2437
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,860
Wouldn't you look inside this light?

2438
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,330
I'd look inside.

2439
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:14,430
(Let's see.)

2440
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:15,900
Jae Seok.

2441
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:19,330
- We can take this out.
- Let's see.

2442
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,840
We just need to borrow
a hexagon ratchet...

2443
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,900
from the props team.

2444
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,640
- We can get it out?
- If we unscrew this and do it,

2445
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,610
they won't be able to get it out
even if they find it.

2446
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,780
- This...
- I think this is a good place.

2447
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,550
- We might struggle too.
- This...

2448
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:35,580
I think we could find a hex key.

2449
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,380
He's determined.

2450
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,850
- I want to win.
- If we do that, they won't get it.

2451
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:42,320
- They'd never get it.
- If this is there,

2452
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
they won't be able to get it.
- Right.
- They'd never find it.

2453
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,490
- Let's keep this as an option.
- Let's keep this as an option.

2454
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:47,530
They won't be able to get it
even if they find it...

2455
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,300
- Yes.
- without the tool.

2456
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:52,170
There's the Jimmy Jib.
Let's put it in the support.

2457
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:53,870
- The support...
- The support.

2458
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:55,300
- Good.
- There are several of them.

2459
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,140
- We can put it in like this.
- That's good.

2460
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,010
Inside here.

2461
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,170
- Inside here?
- Inside here?

2462
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:01,240
Hey.

2463
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,310
- We can put it inside.
- Right.

2464
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:05,280
- This is the best.
- We'll put it in here.

2465
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,780
- Look.
- That's amazing.

2466
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,420
- That's amazing. Look.
- It's the best.

2467
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,780
- They would never guess.
- If we put it here like this...

2468
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,780
- The color.
- Put it the other way around.

2469
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,790
The other way around...

2470
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,790
- At the end...
- It will come out.

2471
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:16,220
- Let's stick tape here...
- Let's tape it.

2472
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,590
- We can stick it here.
- Where? Will that work?

2473
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:18,760
Here.

2474
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,160
It's perfect.

2475
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,730
Is it done?

2476
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:22,760
I'll look at it from afar.

2477
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,160
- This is crazy.
- It's crazy.

2478
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,630
- Hey.
- You wouldn't know.

2479
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,570
- You wouldn't know.
- You really can't see it.

2480
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:29,270
- They wouldn't know.
- We won!

2481
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,570
We won.

2482
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:32,270
It's perfect.
They wouldn't be able to find it.

2483
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,570
- It's perfect.
- How will they find it?

2484
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:34,570
The flag...

2485
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,140
- Let's go.
- It started.

2486
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:38,180
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2487
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,910
It's an emergency!

2488
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,950
I hope we can find it.

2489
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:44,080
- This would be hard.
- I think we won.

2490
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,090
- It's an emergency!
- It's an emergency!

2491
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,220
We can go indoors, right?

2492
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,450
It's an emergency!

2493
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:50,090
- We need to go indoors.
- What are you doing?

2494
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,660
What is it?

2495
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:52,990
(The air is tense.)

2496
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:53,990
What?

2497
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,330
- Se Chan. Come here.
- What?

2498
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:56,860
- Don't shake hands. He's weird.
- Come here.

2499
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,030
- We have to find it.
- Let's go.

2500
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:00,470
Go and search.

2501
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:03,770
- Where did they put the flag?
- There's nowhere to hide it here.

2502
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:04,770
(They search
the outdoor headquarters first.)

2503
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:07,170
There's nowhere to hide it here.

2504
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:10,810
Hold me.

2505
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,150
(They search thoroughly
by even climbing up a ladder.)

2506
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:15,320
Shouldn't we be moving this?

2507
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:18,550
But there's...

2508
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,590
- What?
- nowhere to hide anything here.

2509
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:21,990
- There's nowhere to hide.
- There isn't.

2510
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:24,660
Wasn't it the entire area
of the first floor? The fence...

2511
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,760
We can search everywhere
within the fence.

2512
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,530
They might have dug the ground.

2513
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,930
Somewhere here.

2514
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:35,570
Is this... Hold on.
Can you make such notices too?

2515
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:37,500
- You can't do that.
- You can't, right?

2516
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,540
- We can't do that.
- They wouldn't have done that.

2517
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,110
(He's suspicious of everything.)

2518
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:42,280
Would it be in a container?

2519
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,910
(Staring)

2520
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:48,480
Hold on. Excuse me.

2521
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:51,150
You don't have it, right?

2522
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,190
Okay.

2523
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,120
An insect!

2524
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,830
(While the newbie
barks up the wrong tree...)

2525
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:03,300
It wouldn't be up here, right?

2526
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,430
They won't have put it
where we can see it.

2527
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,970
But they could have also
hidden it somewhere obvious.

2528
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,000
- That's right.
- Right.

2529
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,000
- Check under the chairs.
- You think?

2530
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,370
Darn it. It's not here.

2531
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:14,740
(Flipping)

2532
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,080
We have to flip over everything.

2533
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,210
- What?
- Things that are this big.

2534
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:20,950
(The experienced members
are searching thoroughly.)

2535
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,720
The camera's stand...

2536
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,450
is hollow.

2537
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:28,150
It's empty.

2538
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:29,420
(The stand of the light
was caught by Jong Kook's radar.)

2539
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:32,930
(The Tiger Gang is searching
the light stands with the boss.)

2540
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,430
There won't be many places
to hide it here.

2541
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,760
- Here...
- Did they put it in these stands?

2542
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,730
They would have thought of it.
Haha definitely would have.

2543
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,140
Seok Jin.

2544
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,910
They would have opened up something.

2545
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:47,170
(That moment)

2546
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:49,480
- They surely opened up something.
- Right.

2547
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,880
(Seok Jin heads toward the light
that Jae Seok chose.)

2548
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,750
Where did they hide it?

2549
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,680
(Would the flag be in there?)

2550
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,790
There has to be something
that opens up.

2551
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:00,820
I think...

2552
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:02,620
it's here.

2553
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,090
Is there somewhere
to hide something here?

2554
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:06,190
(He checks the next light.)

2555
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:08,960
It doesn't go in there.

2556
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,560
It's not here.

2557
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,300
(The flag isn't in the lights.)

2558
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,770
I know. There are no places.

2559
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:17,770
(It's already been 5 minutes
since the race started.)

2560
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:22,410
This won't work. It's not there.

2561
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,480
- Where is it?
- It's not there.

2562
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,980
- Tell me.
- It's not there.

2563
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,520
(He finds Seok Jin alone.)

2564
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,280
(He can get the location hint
if he eliminates Seok Jin.)

2565
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,580
- Tell me.
- Check somewhere else.

2566
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,590
- Tell me where it is.
- What?

2567
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:35,420
But why does Seok Sam
keep coming out?

2568
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,290
- Why?
- Isn't it...

2569
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:40,230
Why do you keep...
Is there something here?

2570
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,330
I was trying to go there
through this way.

2571
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,760
- Why do you keep...
- I was trying to go this way.

2572
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,500
(Seok Sam shows his back.)

2573
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,370
(It's a perfect chance
to eliminate the target!)

2574
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:51,600
Is there something here?

2575
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,070
Is there something here?

2576
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,540
Why does Seok Sam keep coming out?

2577
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:58,010
(He turns away
after seeing Se Chan.)

2578
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,050
- Why does Seok Sam keep coming out?
- That was close.

2579
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,280
That was close!

2580
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:06,150
I missed my chance!

2581
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:07,590
(Coward Yoo is disappointed
for losing his chance to shoot him.)

2582
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,560
(He keeps touching it now.)

2583
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,530
They wouldn't have put it here.
It makes sounds.

2584
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:13,690
You never know.

2585
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,300
Se Chan.

2586
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,270
(They're right next
to the Jimmy Jib!)

2587
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:22,200
(Glancing)

2588
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:28,540
(Jae Seok
roams around the Jimmy Jib.)

2589
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:30,480
(Se Chan also notices Jae Seok.)

2590
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,210
Why are you scratching?

2591
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,280
(He's searching
the production crew.)

2592
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,050
Jae Seok.

2593
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,990
(He gets closer to the Jimmy Jib.)

2594
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:45,390
(There's not much time left!)

2595
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:48,360
(Even Haha goes near the Jimmy Jib!)

2596
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,660
Is there something here?

2597
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:52,170
- I think we need to start.
- Why does Seok Sam...

2598
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:54,970
(They need to eliminate the target
before they find the flag.)

2599
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,370
(Ji Hyo will be eliminated
if she hits someone.)

2600
01:23:57,370 --> 01:24:00,470
(The target is approaching him.)

2601
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,640
They became suspicious of me
because I went outside.

2602
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,940
- But why are you outside?
- Seok Sam...

2603
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,980
- What?
- Hurry up!

2604
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,880
(Se Chan starts a fight
to be hit by Ji Hyo.)

2605
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,450
- What is it?
- Wait.

2606
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,120
(Ji Hyo doesn't hit them
even if they keep annoying her.)

2607
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,790
- What is it?
- Wait.

2608
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:20,760
Is it me?

2609
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,360
(That moment)

2610
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,770
(Seok Sam, the target,
was caught by the Locust Gang.)

2611
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:28,270
(Seok Jin will be eliminated
if his name tag gets shot by a water gun.)

2612
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:30,270
(He took out the water gun!)

2613
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,070
- Is it me?
- Hold on.

2614
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:36,740
- Okay!
- We did it!

2615
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,310
(Jee Seok Jin was eliminated.)

2616
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,080
- Okay!
- We did it!

2617
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,580
(Yu-mes Bond eliminated him
in a flash.)

2618
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:43,880
What is it?

2619
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,750
We did it.

2620
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,390
(He eliminated the target.)

2621
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:50,820
- Seok Jin.
- We got attacked.

2622
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:52,090
Why?

2623
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,190
Jae Seok.

2624
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:55,960
- Why?
- Good.

2625
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,660
- Right.
- Good.

2626
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,270
- That was good acting.
- Good.

2627
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:00,430
How did you do it?

2628
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:03,840
Am I eliminated? I'm seriously out?

2629
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,970
(Round 1 ends.)

2630
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:07,210
- Goodness.
- You have to win!

2631
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:09,140
Goodness.

2632
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:11,340
What a shame.

2633
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,880
Ji Hyo doesn't hit you
in these situations.

2634
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,980
- She could have hit us.
- She doesn't.

2635
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,050
You failed to eliminate the target,

2636
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:19,750
so a hint will be given
to the other team.

2637
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,990
- Look at that.
- They get a hint.

2638
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:24,290
We have to use this...

2639
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,490
- Let's get them.
- to win this time.

2640
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:27,190
We should end it.

2641
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:28,190
Column.

2642
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,730
(Location hint: Column)

2643
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,760
- Column? What column?
- It's something outside.

2644
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,100
There are columns on the wall too.

2645
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,770
There are columns outside too.

2646
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:39,840
The second target has been decided.

2647
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,540
The second target is Kim Jong Kook.

2648
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:43,940
(The Locust Gang's second target
is Jong Kook.)

2649
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:46,280
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Goodness.

2650
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,880
(There are
two elimination methods left.)

2651
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,380
The only thing we can do
with Jong Kook...

2652
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,950
- Is getting on his back.
- is getting on his back.

2653
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,220
- He wouldn't kick the ball.
- He wouldn't kick the ball.

2654
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:54,490
Or would he get mad and kick
the ball since he likes balls?

2655
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,320
We could tease him,
saying he's bad at soccer.

2656
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,490
"Kick it."

2657
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:00,030
- He would get angry.
- Do you want to try that?

2658
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,600
- Let's get on his back.
- Yes.

2659
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,600
That will be our target.
We'll go with getting on his back.

2660
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:08,100
Let's not split up in this round.
Let's move together.

2661
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,540
- Right?
- Yes.

2662
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,000
- Let's stay together.
- Okay.

2663
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,110
- It could be me.
- Stay within a meter of each other.

2664
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:14,110
Always.

2665
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:16,280
The next target has been decided.

2666
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,040
The target is Choi Daniel.

2667
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:20,210
- That won't be easy.
- That won't be easy.

2668
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,050
Should we hold him and sign on him?

2669
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:23,850
- Signing would be better.
- As soon as it begins.

2670
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:24,850
- Signing.
- That's not bad.

2671
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:26,390
Signing as soon as it begins.

2672
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,120
Honestly, it's not a bad idea.

2673
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,190
- Right.
- Let's hold him and sign on him.

2674
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:32,060
- I'll hold Daniel.
- Okay.

2675
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,190
Let's all get him and sign.

2676
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,900
We don't need
to use our real signatures, right?

2677
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,630
- Is yours a long one?
- Are you going to write his name?

2678
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,570
- "Thank you, I love you."
- Don't do that.

2679
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:42,340
- No.
- Just scribble anything.

2680
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,040
But Jong Kook.

2681
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,010
I saw Jae Seok...

2682
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:48,980
touching the backs of the cameramen.

2683
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:51,640
- I guess he hid it on them.
- Right.

2684
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,780
(Jae Seok was searching
the production crew's bodies.)

2685
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:56,780
- Right.
- Really?

2686
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,480
- If they put it here...
- On their legs.

2687
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,150
- and stand like this...
- That's right.

2688
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:01,590
- We should search them.
- Right.

2689
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:03,160
Jae Seok was touching them.

2690
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,690
Chan Hee. Chan Hee's leg.

2691
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:07,660
- That's right.
- Was Chan Hee inside?

2692
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,560
- The cameramen are there.
- They're there.

2693
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,860
The experienced cameramen are there.

2694
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,530
- Let's quickly check that first...
- Yes.

2695
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:16,040
And when it's not there...

2696
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,540
Right.

2697
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,640
Do we search the legs first?

2698
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,770
Do we hide it?

2699
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:21,470
- Let's go first.
- Okay.

2700
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,880
- One meter.
- Okay.

2701
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,910
Wait.

2702
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,050
- Let's go!
- Okay.

2703
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:29,020
- Let's find it.
- Let's go!

2704
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,550
- Where do you think you're coming?
- You startled me.

2705
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,220
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

2706
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,950
- You'll start with the mission?
- What's going on?

2707
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,760
- They're behind us.
- They came from behind.

2708
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,660
- They came from behind.
- Go out.

2709
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:42,200
(Jong Kook and Ye Eun
entered from the back door.)

2710
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,830
(Cameraman Kang Chan Hee)

2711
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:46,200
(He checks him first.)

2712
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:50,170
(Would the flag really be with him?)

2713
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:52,870
(Cameraman Kang Chan Hee)

2714
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:55,210
(He doesn't have it!)

2715
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:56,540
It's not here.

2716
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:58,810
Where is it?

2717
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,680
- The cameraman up there.
- I'll check.

2718
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,780
(He checks the next cameraman.)

2719
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:03,920
Do you not have it?

2720
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,420
- He doesn't have it?
- You don't have it?

2721
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:08,050
We should sign, then.

2722
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:09,090
Let's go.

2723
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,860
It's not here.

2724
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,860
I checked him.

2725
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,190
(The Tiger Gang is searching
all the cameramen in the building.)

2726
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:15,930
- Let's just...
- Sign.

2727
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:17,700
- Sign?
- Let's sign.

2728
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:20,470
They're coming.

2729
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:22,440
- Jong Kook is coming.
- Jong Kook is coming.

2730
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,900
- They're coming.
- They're coming.

2731
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,670
- Jong Kook is coming.
- Jong Kook is coming.

2732
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,240
He wants to catch us and end it.

2733
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,180
- Should I get on his back?
- He wants to catch us.

2734
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:31,640
Run.

2735
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,710
(As the tiger shows up,
they all run away.)

2736
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:34,250
Se Chan, I found them.

2737
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,780
(Checking the cameraman)

2738
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:39,750
Why are you running?

2739
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:42,390
Why are you running?
Why are you behaving like this?

2740
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,490
What do we do, Se Chan?

2741
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:44,660
Jong Kook, now?

2742
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,360
- Jong Kook, now?
- Yes.

2743
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,630
- Hey!
- Daniel!

2744
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,260
- What?
- What? Hang on.

2745
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:53,570
- What?
- What? It must be me.

2746
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,270
He's holding something.

2747
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:56,500
(Jong Kook caught Daniel.)

2748
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,970
(Ye Eun runs toward him with a pen.)

2749
01:28:57,970 --> 01:28:59,410
What? It must be me.

2750
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,740
- He's holding something.
- Hang on.

2751
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,910
- Ye Eun is coloring it.
- Wait.

2752
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:05,550
- Ye Eun is...
- It's done.

2753
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:08,010
- It's a marker.
- Come here.

2754
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:09,650
- It's a marker.
- Wait.

2755
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:11,080
(Attacking from behind)

2756
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,450
Is it done?

2757
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:13,820
- Next.
- I did it.

2758
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:15,560
- Hey.
- Hurry, Ye Eun.

2759
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,920
Is it done? Next.

2760
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,320
(Se Chan did it too.)

2761
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,360
Hurry, Ye Eun.

2762
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,090
- Hey, I did it.
- Hurry, Ye Eun.

2763
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:23,460
- Go, Ye Eun.
- Help me.

2764
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,670
(Ye Eun is confronting
her boyfriend.)

2765
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:27,830
- Jong Kook.
- Go.

2766
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,340
Jong Kook.

2767
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,040
Hurry, Ye Eun!

2768
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,970
- Hey, I did it.
- Hurry, Ye Eun.

2769
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:35,040
Help me. Block my back.

2770
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:36,940
- I did it.
- Give it to me, Ye Eun.

2771
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:38,080
I'll give it to you.

2772
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,380
- Ye Eun.
- Hurry.

2773
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,180
Again. One more.

2774
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:42,620
- I got him.
- I...

2775
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,480
- I got him.
- I'm hanging.

2776
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,190
- What's going on?
- Get him off.

2777
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:47,650
I'm hanging on his back.

2778
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:49,960
- I stole it from Ye Eun.
- I'm hanging.

2779
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,290
- I took this away from Ye Eun.
- Good.

2780
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:53,160
I took this away from Ye Eun.

2781
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,160
(Her boyfriend suddenly
hugs her from behind.)

2782
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,560
(Happy)

2783
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,730
Don't give it to her.

2784
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:02,340
Ye Eun didn't do it.

2785
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:03,770
(He lies back down
to protect his name tag.)

2786
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,200
My knee!

2787
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,010
- His knee.
- My knee. My privates.

2788
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:08,240
Let me do it once.

2789
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,480
(Struggling)

2790
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,510
Get him away.

2791
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:12,210
- My privates.
- No.

2792
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,250
Get him.

2793
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:14,350
Pen!

2794
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,880
It hurts.

2795
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,120
- My gosh.
- I did it.

2796
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,180
Come here, Ye Eun.

2797
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:19,550
- What?
- Come here, Ye Eun.

2798
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:20,590
(In the midst of chaos,
Jong Kook managed to sign on him.)

2799
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,020
(Now Ye Eun needs to sign!)

2800
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,520
- What?
- Hurry, Ye Eun.

2801
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:27,390
(Ye Eun's pen
penetrates into the crowd.)

2802
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,560
- What?
- Come here, Ye Eun.

2803
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,760
- What?
- Kim Jong Kook is out.

2804
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,430
Kim Jong Kook, you're out.

2805
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:34,900
- Jong Kook is out?
- Kim Jong Kook is out.

2806
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,600
(Jong Kook is out,
instead of Daniel?)

2807
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,770
(While everyone was busy
trying to sign on Daniel...)

2808
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,770
(If someone gets on Jong Kook's back
for 15 seconds, he's eliminated.)

2809
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,510
(Haha got on Jong Kook's back.)

2810
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:46,980
(15-second countdown)

2811
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:52,650
(He's sticking to him
like a cicada.)

2812
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:55,720
(Jong Kook was busy fighting Daniel,
so he didn't notice it.)

2813
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,660
My knee. My privates.

2814
01:30:58,790 --> 01:30:59,990
Go!

2815
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,560
- Hurry.
- I did it.

2816
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,130
(Thanks to Haha's tenacity,
Jong Kook is out.)

2817
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,970
- We did it.
- My gosh.

2818
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,300
Am I out?

2819
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,500
(He can't believe it.)

2820
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,070
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

2821
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:12,510
- What happened? I'm okay.
- Are you all right?

2822
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:13,510
- Are you okay?
- Are you not hurt?

2823
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,010
- I'm fine.
- He's okay.

2824
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:16,110
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

2825
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:17,740
- What happened?
- What happened?

2826
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,010
- Is this a signature?
- It is.

2827
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:21,750
I did it here.

2828
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,980
(Daniel survived
because Ye Eun failed to sign.)

2829
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,120
- You should do it on the name tag.
- Ye Eun failed.

2830
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:27,090
Okay.

2831
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:28,920
- We can do this.
- Okay. Let's do this.

2832
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,020
We are winning.

2833
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:34,890
It's okay. Let's do this.

2834
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:35,960
There's no way.

2835
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:38,160
Jong Kook is eliminated.

2836
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:39,500
We're in trouble.

2837
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,240
We should've done it
after ripping off the name tag.

2838
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,240
We could've done that.

2839
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,770
- We could've ripped it off.
- Right.

2840
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:46,210
(It's new to see these two
in prison.)

2841
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,710
We should've done that.

2842
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:48,840
We have no choice.

2843
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,710
How are we going to find it now?

2844
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,110
There's nothing we can do.

2845
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:53,150
We're at a huge disadvantage.

2846
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:54,510
- No, that's not true.
- Why not?

2847
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,050
This is a real fight now. Listen.

2848
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:58,920
They will try to find the flag now,
instead of getting the name tags.

2849
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,390
All we need to do
is find the flag first.

2850
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:01,820
But I can't find it.

2851
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:03,490
Where would it be?
Where did they hide it?

2852
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:04,920
Where on earth is it?

2853
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,560
- It's nowhere to be seen.
- No.

2854
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,590
(They couldn't find
Locust Gang's flag anywhere.)

2855
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:08,930
Is Jong Kook eliminated?

2856
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,030
Ji Hyo, they will check this
for sure, right?

2857
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:13,500
They'll definitely check this place.

2858
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,770
- Is it a bad idea to hide it here?
- Where?

2859
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,370
At the end over there.

2860
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:19,910
- At the end over there?
- Yes.

2861
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:21,010
(The place Daniel found is...)

2862
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:22,240
At the end of here.

2863
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,140
I think it'll be okay.

2864
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,340
(The end of the hallway
behind the bars)

2865
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:26,410
Look.

2866
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:28,380
It's open.

2867
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:30,780
Hang on. They are outside,

2868
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:32,750
- so they don't know the structure.
- They don't.

2869
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:35,120
- That there's an empty space.
- They don't know.

2870
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,660
(Locust Gang hid their flag well
using Long Legs.)

2871
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,120
Can we hide it in the restroom?

2872
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:40,290
(Se Chan and Ho Jun passed by
this place while searching.)

2873
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:42,630
There's no place to hide it here.

2874
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,130
- That there's an empty space.
- They don't know.

2875
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:47,270
There is no other place where
we can hide something that big.

2876
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,500
The last target has been decided.

2877
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,940
The last target is...

2878
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:53,110
Yoo Seung Ho.

2879
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:54,840
No.

2880
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:57,780
We should find the flag
while running away.

2881
01:32:57,810 --> 01:32:59,110
We can't complete the mission.

2882
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:00,480
How would we let him eat the snack?

2883
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,420
I know. It's impossible.

2884
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:05,050
But Seung Ho is not good
at saying no.

2885
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:07,250
- I should feed him then.
- How will you do that? Show me.

2886
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,790
(Here?)

2887
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,920
- He wouldn't take it.
- Eat this.

2888
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,260
Hey!

2889
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,630
Eat this.

2890
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,400
(Her strategy to use her good looks
doesn't work.)

2891
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,930
Don't you have your tongue?

2892
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:19,170
Eat this for me.

2893
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:21,400
Would you eat it if you were him?
You wouldn't, right?

2894
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,570
Can you eat this for me?

2895
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,670
I might eat.

2896
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:26,710
(Almost crying)

2897
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,770
The red gummy bear
is Ye Eun's favorite.

2898
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:29,940
What about you?

2899
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:32,380
You sound like Zhu Bajie.

2900
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:34,810
- I, Ji Fox, am coming.
- Ji Fox?

2901
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:36,120
- I, Ji Fox, am coming.
- Good luck.

2902
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,020
- Let's see how good you are.
- I'm Ji Fox.

2903
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,720
I'll see how Ji Fox does.

2904
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,490
The last target has been decided.

2905
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,220
The last target...

2906
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,690
is Son Ho Jun.

2907
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:47,030
(The Locust Gang's last target
is Ho Jun.)

2908
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:48,960
And the last mission
to eliminate the target...

2909
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,130
- is to let him kick the ball.
- The ball.

2910
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,370
Can we just throw the ball...

2911
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:53,570
- at his feet?
- No.

2912
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:55,500
- He should kick it himself.
- He should kick or head it.

2913
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:57,970
You got another location hint.

2914
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,770
There's no place to hide it.

2915
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:00,910
- It's strange.
- It wasn't there.

2916
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:03,680
Is it different
from the columns I'm thinking of?

2917
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,840
- Is it different?
- Did they take it apart...

2918
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,050
- to put it inside?
- The front yard?

2919
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,780
There's a column in the front yard.

2920
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,220
The place here is the front yard.

2921
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,520
Outside...

2922
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,720
Column? I bet they hid it
in the column.

2923
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,990
It's outside. The hint is "column"
and "front yard."

2924
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:20,690
Go and find it.

2925
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,400
(Which gang will
find the flag first?)

2926
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,830
- Make sure to run away.
- Okay.

2927
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,830
(Round 3 begins.)

2928
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:28,200
- Front yard and column.
- Make sure to run away.

2929
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,340
Okay.

2930
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,140
- Oh, dear.
- My goodness.

2931
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:33,840
Hang on. The front yard...

2932
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,570
This is the front yard.

2933
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:37,080
- Check the front yard.
- Is this a column?

2934
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,680
There's one. There's another.

2935
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,980
There's another one.

2936
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,180
(They focus on looking for the flag
instead of eliminating the target.)

2937
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:42,550
- And a column.
- And this...

2938
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:44,020
Did they drop it in here?

2939
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:46,050
This is blocked.

2940
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:47,890
It's blocked.

2941
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:50,860
(Using the hint,
they are getting closer to the flag.)

2942
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,020
It's blocked.

2943
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:53,460
- Yard?
- What?

2944
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,960
We didn't go in there.

2945
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:57,430
We didn't.

2946
01:34:57,430 --> 01:35:00,630
(The Tiger Gang heads to the hallway
where the flag is hidden.)

2947
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:02,470
Can we check the room here?

2948
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,740
I guess we can.

2949
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:05,370
(The flag is
at the end of the hallway.)

2950
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:06,570
I guess we can go in.

2951
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:08,540
There are cameras.

2952
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:10,140
You're right.

2953
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:12,280
But there's no place to hide it.

2954
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:16,650
(If they find the flag first,
they can turn things around.)

2955
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:19,350
- Is it on the rooftop?
- It's not here.

2956
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:20,390
- Does the room have this?
- Did they drop it?

2957
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:21,420
What?

2958
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:24,260
If it's a column,
it must be supporting something.

2959
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,960
It's supporting something.

2960
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,760
- They can't put it in here.
- Yard.

2961
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,800
Is it that my brain isn't working?

2962
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,060
Seung Ho.

2963
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:33,300
What?

2964
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,330
- Seung Ho.
- Run away, Seung Ho.

2965
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,100
We have only three members.

2966
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,010
- Seung Ho.
- Seung Ho, don't answer her.

2967
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:42,010
Don't answer. Ignore her.

2968
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:43,140
Seung Ho.

2969
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:44,310
(Seung Ho senses something strange
and runs away.)

2970
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:45,380
Seung Ho, run away.

2971
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:46,910
Go away.

2972
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,010
- Seung Ho.
- Go away.

2973
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:50,980
Please don't come here.

2974
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,490
- Go away.
- Don't come to me.

2975
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:53,650
Seung Ho.

2976
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,190
Run.

2977
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:56,520
Seung Ho.

2978
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,630
- What are you doing?
- Seung Ho.

2979
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:01,490
The red gummy bear is my favorite.

2980
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:02,660
(She sticks to her strategy.)

2981
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,160
- What?
- Do you like the green one?

2982
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,830
(He receives the jelly from her.)

2983
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,140
I like everything.

2984
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,900
(He puts it in his pocket.)

2985
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,540
Why...

2986
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,870
- Seung Ho.
- What?

2987
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,940
The red one is my favorite.

2988
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,680
I like the blue one.

2989
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,710
I don't have a blue one.

2990
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:20,850
Too bad.

2991
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:21,980
Eat the red one instead.

2992
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,180
Thank you.

2993
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,220
(He puts it in his pocket again.)

2994
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:25,320
Seung Ho.

2995
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:26,590
- Ye Eun.
- Seung Ho.

2996
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:28,520
- What are you doing, Ye Eun?
- What?

2997
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:29,720
Eat this.

2998
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:33,290
- I'll eat one.
- Okay.

2999
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,930
- And you eat one.
- Thank you.

3000
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:37,100
Why aren't you eating it?

3001
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:39,500
- I, Ji Fox, am coming.
- What?

3002
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,600
I gave it to you,
but why aren't you eating it?

3003
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,870
I don't usually eat
during the shoot.

3004
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,610
It's probably in here.

3005
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:48,010
(Se Chan is
right in front of the flag.)

3006
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,710
It's "column" and "front yard,"
so it must be here.

3007
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:50,980
(The Locust Gang is also
right in front of the flag.)

3008
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:52,650
(He's checking the wrong place.)

3009
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:54,780
I don't think they hid it here.

3010
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:56,920
Gosh, I was surprised.

3011
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,190
No, Seung Ho. What are you doing?

3012
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:02,720
- Hey, she's an evil spirit.
- Don't eat it.

3013
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,020
It's here.

3014
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:05,390
I gave it to you.

3015
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:07,560
- Don't eat it.
- It's too precious to eat.

3016
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,790
Throw it away.

3017
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:10,500
Throw it at her face.

3018
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:13,800
- Should we check the Jimmy Jib?
- I gave it to you.

3019
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,230
(Column, front yard)

3020
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:17,240
(The Jimmy Jib?)

3021
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,770
Column, front yard?

3022
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:20,470
Hang on. Is it in here?

3023
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:23,780
(They start checking the Jimmy Jib
where the flag is hidden.)

3024
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:25,210
Can I check this?

3025
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,050
We have to flip over everything.

3026
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:29,180
Things that are this big.

3027
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:30,220
I'm sorry.

3028
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,850
I think it's here.

3029
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:33,320
(I think it's here.)

3030
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,550
Can I check it in the front?

3031
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:36,590
If I find it, I'll be a hero.

3032
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:38,190
But there's no place to hide it.

3033
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:39,890
Sir, please bring it down.

3034
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,490
- Right here.
- Please.

3035
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:42,560
Right there.

3036
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:47,570
Hey.

3037
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:48,570
Did you find it?

3038
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:51,000
(They found it!)

3039
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:57,940
(The Locust Gang successfully finds
their flag.)

3040
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,080
Is it over?

3041
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,080
(What a shame.)

3042
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,150
Who found it?

3043
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:04,650
My gosh.

3044
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:06,090
(What a shame.)

3045
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,860
(Locust Gang, Tiger Gang)

3046
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:18,230
The Locust Gang is the final winner
in the turf war.

3047
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:20,900
- Okay!
- It's over.

3048
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,530
- My gosh.
- But this was really...

3049
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:24,570
The winning gang can save...

3050
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,970
- one killer from the losing gang.
- Okay.

3051
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:28,340
(The winning gang's benefit)

3052
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:30,280
(They can save one killer
from the losing gang.)

3053
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,010
Who will you save?

3054
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:34,210
- Let's think about what to do.
- Okay.

3055
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,410
- So...
- Seung Ho.

3056
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,080
(Acting cute
as if it's as easy as breathing)

3057
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:40,750
Stop it! Seriously, I can't...

3058
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,450
- I can't stand it anymore.
- Stop it.

3059
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:43,990
- My goodness.
- Hey, Seung Ho.

3060
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:46,690
- Seung Ho, you should choose.
- Don't do it.

3061
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,500
- Not my girlfriend.
- It's not like that.

3062
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,930
- Seung Ho sure is impressive too.
- Then, in that case...

3063
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:55,700
I thought
he'd definitely choose Ye Eun.

3064
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:58,400
- But he excluded her right away.
- The penalty?

3065
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:00,710
- No, it's not like that.
- Ye Eun can hold a grudge.

3066
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:02,540
- No, it's not that.
- You won't be able to break up now.

3067
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:03,710
- She'll curse you now.
- No, it's not that.

3068
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:05,440
- A curse.
- He says you can't break up.

3069
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,550
- You can't break up now.
- My goodness.

3070
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:08,810
It was
Jong Kook's birthday today too.

3071
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:11,080
- Oh, it was his birthday.
- It could be his birthday present.

3072
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,350
- Gosh, you don't have to.
- Oh, you're right.

3073
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:15,120
It's his birthday today.

3074
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,120
- Who doesn't have a birthday here?
- Jong Kook doesn't care about that.

3075
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,290
- Oh, my birthday?
- Everyone has a birthday.

3076
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:19,330
- It's his birthday today.
- The birthday boy.

3077
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:20,890
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

3078
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:22,160
- Jong Kook!
- Jong Kook!

3079
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,360
(Saving Jong Kook
as his birthday present)

3080
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:25,600
- Then, Jong Kook,
- Happy birthday!

3081
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,670
- you're exempt from the penalty.
- Happy birthday!

3082
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:29,440
- Gosh, thank you.
- Happy birthday.

3083
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,270
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

3084
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,370
- Don't you have any pride?
- For real.

3085
01:39:33,370 --> 01:39:35,010
- But this is nice.
- It's nice.

3086
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:37,440
- He has changed so much.
- Here is the winning prize first.

3087
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:40,750
It's an abalone set to guarantee
the killers' nutrition.

3088
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,150
(The winning team's prize is
abalones to invigorate the killers.)

3089
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:45,380
This is my third time
on Running Man.

3090
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:47,220
- Was it the 3rd time already?
- And I won for the 1st time.

3091
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:49,390
I feel great.

3092
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,960
- Gosh, great job.
- Nice!

3093
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,930
- They're still alive.
- Except for Jong Kook,

3094
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:56,700
the four of you
will get the penalty.

3095
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:58,260
- Save at least 1 or 2 of us.
- This penalty is...

3096
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,000
along the same line
as the killer concept.

3097
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,530
Among the two water guns,

3098
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:03,900
- one has ink and the other water.
- Oh, nice.

3099
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:04,970
- Ink?
- My goodness.

3100
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:06,340
- Only two will survive.
- Water and ink?

3101
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:07,370
- In that case...
- Two will survive.

3102
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:09,580
We'll be so happy if it's like this.

3103
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,840
- Ho Jun, where are you?
- Here.

3104
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,040
Pick one for me.

3105
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,180
- Then, this one...
- No, Ho Jun was...

3106
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:14,510
- Okay, then.
- really bad at picking things.

3107
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:15,550
- Seok Jin.
- I always get...

3108
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:18,380
Wait! I'm going to go with
the one Ho Jun didn't choose.

3109
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:19,620
He seems unlucky today.

3110
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,790
- Okay.
- Let's go with this.

3111
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:22,590
- Face each other.
- Ho Jun, I didn't choose...

3112
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:23,620
- Okay. Ready.
- Shoot directly in the face.

3113
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:24,920
- Then, he got the one Ho Jun chose.
- Ready.

3114
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,130
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

3115
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:32,330
(Yang Se Chan
gets blasted with ink.)

3116
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:33,430
- My goodness.
- Ho Jun's choice...

3117
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:35,230
- That's enough.
- This guy is super unlucky.

3118
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:36,300
- My goodness.
- My gosh.

3119
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:39,100
(Unlucky Ho Jun works hard
until the very end.)

3120
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:40,740
- Gosh, that's so fascinating.
- This guy...

3121
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:42,470
Among all the unlucky people...

3122
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:45,180
Hey, but why did you get ink on you?

3123
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:46,280
Why did he get ink on him?

3124
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,450
- Why did you get ink on you?
- What's up with me?

3125
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,680
They crossed paths.
Seok Jin, as the ink...

3126
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,050
- and water crossed paths,
- Show me.

3127
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:51,480
it must've splashed on you too.

3128
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,950
Did I get splashed
as they crossed paths?

3129
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,350
Why did I get ink on me?

3130
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:55,620
- My gosh.
- This guy is amazing.

3131
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,120
- Seriously.
- Hey, Ho Jun.

3132
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:00,290
Then, the two of you can choose
the water guns...

3133
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:01,390
- and shoot right away.
- This seems serious.

3134
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:03,360
- Gosh, this is really serious.
- Is that what happened?

3135
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:05,430
Will you choose that one?

3136
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:06,770
- Hold it up.
- Yes, hold it up.

3137
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:08,230
- You can just do it once.
- This is no joke.

3138
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:09,670
- Look at them.
- Oh, really?

3139
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:10,740
- Get closer.
- No.

3140
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:11,870
- Come closer.
- It's okay. You can shoot me.

3141
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:13,170
(Which of the two killers
has worse luck?)

3142
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:15,540
- A bit closer.
- In 1, 2, 3.

3143
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,540
(Ho Jun gets shot with water.)

3144
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,680
(Ji Ye Eun gets blasted
with ink again.)

3145
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:22,450
(But...)

3146
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,680
(I'm sure she's shooting
with her eyes closed.)

3147
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:27,750
Hey, this one is darker.

3148
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:30,260
- Hey, how can that happen?
- It's so weird.

3149
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:31,720
- This happens every time.
- For real.

3150
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,660
- Don't smile.
- It's so weird.

3151
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:37,230
(Moving quickly)

3152
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,470
(The boyfriend takes care
of his girlfriend right away.)

3153
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:41,900
Ji Ye Eun.

3154
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,600
- Just wipe her eyes.
- No!

3155
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,740
- Don't smile.
- It's so weird.

3156
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,940
- This happens every time.
- "Don't smile."

3157
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,510
It's so weird.

3158
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:50,810
(Meanwhile, she's happy.)

3159
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:53,410
- Call his name right now. Please.
- Call his name.

3160
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:54,780
- Call Seung Ho.
- Seung Ho!

3161
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,380
Hey, your teeth! Look at her teeth!

3162
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:59,180
- Hey! Don't smile.
- Don't smile, Ye Eun.

3163
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:00,490
Don't smile.

3164
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:03,420
- Oh, no.
- That's hilarious.

3165
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,360
- Okay!
- Oh, boyfriend and girlfriend.

3166
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,430
- I know.
- Right?

3167
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:08,460
- That's what happens in the end.
- In the end.

3168
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:09,960
- After all that...
- In the end.

3169
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,260
- Good job.
- Gosh, Ho Jun.

3170
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:12,260
- Okay!
- Great job!

3171
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:13,370
- Ho Jun, that was so awesome.
- Good job, Seung Ho.
