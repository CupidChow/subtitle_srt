7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,900
I am a 1,000-year-old 9-tailed fox!

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,070
At some point, the foxes disappeared one by one.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
(As times changed,)

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,070

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,970

It's been really hard for me to maintain my position...

(The paradox of modern technology, AI-handsome Jae Seok)

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,370

38
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,590
I'm the fox chosen by AI.

39
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,630
And the tail doesn't even suit you. Okay?

40
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,730
This is the tail that suits me best,

41
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,500
and I've protected it for 1,000 years!

42
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,600

(Cries echo out in other places as well.)

53
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,530
The stock market is good these days, but only mine is falling.

54
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,130
This is infuriating! What's with my tails?

55
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,960
I was so stressed out that my tails came off.

56
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,270
This is driving me crazy. Why is it falling?

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,900
(His tails fell out due to stress-induced hair loss.)

58

(At that moment)

63
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,110

Which one is better? The blue one or the green one?

68
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,320
Stop talking about blue. Everything is in blue for my stocks.

69

70
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,660
- Get lost! - Hang on.

71
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,460
Go away! Don't stress me out.

72
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,400
Is he serious? Did it fall for real?

73
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,700
(His acting makes it seem like he means it.)

74
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,300
I'm serious.

75
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,600
It fell for real. Look.

76
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,700
You're right.

77

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,960
- Did you see that? - I did.

181
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,700
Did you see her get up?

182
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,670
- I did. - That's what you should do.

183
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,870
- Show us. - Why are you comparing us?

184
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,310
- Try it. - I'm not comparing you.

185
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,210
- I can do it well. - Move quickly.

186
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,280
To become a nine-tailed fox... All right.

187
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,380
(Next is Lomon's fitness test.)

188
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,310
Captain Nine-tailed Fox.

189
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,680
- His shoulders are really... - Look at him.

190
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,120
- He's got broad shoulders. - He's tall and handsome.

191
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,580
(Trainer Kook likes his broad shoulders.)

192
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,220
- Thank you. - What should I make him do?

193
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,320
- Let's do this, the bench press. - Bench press.

194
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,290
(He chooses the bench press.)

195
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,120
All right. He looks strong.

196
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,060
- Okay. - I'm honored.

197
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,290
(Polite)

198
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,790
All right.

199
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,730
- Okay. - I learned from your YouTube.

200
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,860
(A fan of Gym Jong Kook)

201
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,730
Let me see how you're doing. Watch your head.

202
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,470
(Sweet)

203
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,100
- Okay. - Put your head down here.

204
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,900
- Watch your head. - This is old style.

205
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,570
- Okay. - He's handsome even lying down.

206
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,110
He's handsome even lying down.

207
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,470
Yes, he's good-looking.

208
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,310
(Same angle, different looks)

209
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,910
- Ready. Slowly. - Go.

210
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,780
One. Push.

211
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,210
- Go. - One. Push.

212
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,920
- Nice. - There you go.

213
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,380
- Go. - Two.

214
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,520
- Push. Nice. - There you go.

215
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,520
(He easily lifts 50kg.)

216
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,060
- Push. Nice. - There you go.

217
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,090
That's good. He's doing well.

218
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,830
(His visuals are still flawless.)

219
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,960
Good pace. All right.

220
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,600
- Is this heavy? - It feels good.

221
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
- It feels good. - All right.

222
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,770
(Loving it)

223
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
- Continue. - Let's go.

224
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,030
You should do it ten times.

225
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,570
One, two, three.

226
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,770
- Push. Okay. - Okay.

227
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,270
(Lomon also completes his fitness test.)

228
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,200
- Thank you. - My goodness.

229
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,370
What kind of nine-tailed fox is he?

230
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,370
- Okay. - Is he a nine-tailed fox?

231
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,910
Stop talking and just do it.

232
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,210
No.

233
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,810
- Give me a break. - Excuse me.

234
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,380
Your tail looks lovely.

235
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
Could I have one of your tails?

236
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,150
Your tail looks lovely.

237
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,090
(Hye Yoon suddenly asks Jong Kook for his tails?)

238
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,320
Could I have one of your tails?

239
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,460
All right. Well...

240
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,890
Her line is really...

241
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,760
(Very smooth)

242
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,690
- Her line... - That was smooth.

243
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Actually, I think I should give her one.

244
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,630
- You know, she tried hard... - Right.

245
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,270
doing squats. You saw that, right?

246
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,430
(As if in a trance,)

247
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,270
- She was good. - All right then.

248
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,500
- Here. - All right.

249
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,010
(Kook Fox gives up his tail.)

250
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,400
- Okay. - Thank you.

251
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,640
- Thank you. - Well done.

252
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,810
- I'll use it for a good purpose. - You did a great job.

253
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,970
- Thank you. - What about me?

254
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,710
You couldn't even stand back up!

255
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,610
- I'll give you one when you can. - Okay.

256
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,710
(Obedient)

257
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,710
Once you succeed in getting up.

258
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,010
- Nice. - By the way,

259
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,280
I'm a big fan, Se Chan. Can I have one of your tails?

260
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,150
I'm a big fan, Se Chan.

261
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,090
(Hye Yoon is after Se Chan's tail?)

262
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,320
Can I have one of your tails?

263
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,960
- Please? - What's with your face?

264
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,260
(Twitching)

265
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,620
- What's with that face? - Tell me what you like about me.

266
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,390
Hey, be specific.

267
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,130
(Monkfish is shaken by the fox's seduction.)

268
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,630
- Be specific. - Tell us three things.

269
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,960
- Say three good things about me. - Be specific.

270
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,630
(Three things?)

271
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,870
- Well... You're cute, funny, - He's cute.

272
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,670
- Funny. - and very lovely.

273
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,670
Nice!

274
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,510
I'll give you mine. Come here.

275
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,410
(He gives up his tail instantly.)

276
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,470
- I have to give her this. - You have to.

277
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,810
(Hye Yoon got 2 more tails in a row.)

278
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,040
- It's not say things like that. - Oh, dear.

279
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,310
(What will these tails be used for?)

280
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,110
- Thank you. - Thank you.

281
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,210
Thank you.

282
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,280
Ye Eun, you look cute today.

283
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,480
(Ye Eun, born in 1994, 5 years older than him)

284
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,920
- What was that? - He's flirting.

285
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,960
- What was that? - Look at her.

286
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,960
(What's up with her face?)

287
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,920
Obviously, she knows...

288
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,930
(Smiling wide despite the obvious intent behind his comment)

289
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,730
he's doing this on purpose,

290
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,600
- but she can't control her face. - She can't.

291
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,730
- This is unbelievable. - Just a little more.

292
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,500
- You look cute and lovely today. - You think?

293
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,600
(Intense flirting)

294
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,200
- You think? - But I don't have a tail.

295
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,300
- I'll give you mine. - I mean, if we have...

296
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,400
(Right away)

297
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,470
- one each, - You can have mine.

298
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,470
(A real fox)

299
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,940
- we will look like a couple. - Couple?

300
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,610
Couple... Help me take this off.

301
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,010
You're just giving it away? There's no test?

302
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,280
(Ji Fox loses her head over Fox Guy's flirting.)

303
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,380
You don't even need a test? You're just giving it to him?

304
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,910
- You should test him. - Here.

305
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,680
(You can have it.)

306
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,680
- Just giving it away? - Giving it away?

307
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,220
- Yes. - She doesn't usually do that.

308
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,650
(It's my choice.)

309
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,220
Right.

310
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,620
- Like an acrostic poem... - Because he's younger.

311
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,120
You could've let him make an acrostic poem or something.

312
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,060
(He got a tail thanks to Ye Eun.)

313
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
- An acrostic poem with my name. - Right. You should do it.

314
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,760
- With Ji Ye Eun. - My goodness.

315
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,130
Just say whatever comes to mind.

316
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,930
(Overwhelmed)

317
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,900
- It's a variety show. - Whatever comes to mind.

318
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,960
- Spontaneously. - Spontaneously.

319
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,730
- Ji. - Ji.

320
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,200
(Anticipating quietly)

321
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,100
Even for Ji Ye Eun.

322
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,100
- "Even for Ji Ye Eun." - "Even for Ji Ye Eun."

323
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,300
- Ye. - Ye.

324
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,210
There is no exception.

325
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,010
- "There is no exception." - "There is no exception."

326
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,840
Even for Ji Ye Eun, there's no exception.

327
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,610
She doesn't seem pleased.

328
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,950
(Unsure...)

329
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,880
- All right. Eun. - Eun.

330
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,920
Can I ask you out for dinner sometime?

331
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,890
- "Can I ask you out..." - "Can I ask you out..."

332
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,920
"for dinner sometime?"

333
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,890
(He asked me out for dinner!)

334
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,660
"Can I ask you out for dinner sometime?"

335
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
(Flirting customed for the food fighter)

336
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,490
"Can I ask you out for dinner sometime?"

337
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,530
I don't think he will eat with her.

338
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,960
- This is funny. - It will cost a lot, though.

339
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,460
- It will cost quite a lot. - I eat a lot.

340
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,500
- That's great. - She eats seven pasta dishes.

341
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,300
He asked her out for dinner right away.

342
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,270
(They make plans for dinner, which Ye Eun might be paying for.)

343
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,770
Variety shows are too hard.

344
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,340
(The place they chose for the fathering of the foxes...)

345
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,270
The foxes from all over the neighborhood...

346
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,110
(It's a place where children are taught proper manners.)

347
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,040
gathered in the Fox Valley for a meeting.

348
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,610
Even with his coat on, I can still see his back muscles.

349
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,310
- Really? - That's impressive.

350
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,580
- Thank you. - That's true.

351
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,280
(They are all interested in Lomon's broad shoulders.)

352
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,850
- It's amazing. - He's so cool.

353
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,880
I was really surprised.

354
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,980
- Right. - He's got the back muscles.

355
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,750
- Hye Yoon, is this your 2nd time? - Her 2nd time here.

356
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,790
- It's her second time. - That's right.

357
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,120
(It is Hye Yoon's 2nd time on Running Man.)

358
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,260
- She was here before. - She was with Kwang Soo.

359
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,490
- She danced. - Right.

360
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,630
(She showed off her dancing skills 6 years ago.)

361
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,490
Didn't she dance?

362
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,130
- Yes. I did this. - Actually,

363
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,690
Hye Yoon used to be a member...

364
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,230
- of a dance club. - I see.

365
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,530
- That's true. - A dance club.

366
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,570
So we have two guests here today.

367
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,170
- They're doing a drama. - Their drama is coming out.

368
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,270
(These two are doing a new drama.)

369
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,040
- I see. - Right.

370
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,140
I'm so proud of myself.

371
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,010
(The new SBS Friday-Saturday drama of the two actors)

372
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,210
(Kang Si Yeol, a world-class soccer player with narcissism)

373
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,740
And not once have we been beaten!

374
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,940
I'm a gumiho.

375
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,310
(Gen Z Nine-tailed Fox Eun Ho, who doesn't want to be human)

376
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,410
Can't you tell just by looking?

377
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,450
This beauty and mysterious charm.

378
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,750
I see. Gumiho?

379
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,890
(A twisted fantasy romance, "No Tail to Tell")

380
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,020
The nine-tailed fox?

381
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,960
The first episode goes on air on January 16.

382
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,300
(It airs every Friday and Saturday on SBS at 9:50pm.)

383
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,030
The drama is called "No Tail to Tell,"

384
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,460
which we are promoting today.

385
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,700
Hye Yoon is a Gen Z nine-tailed fox in the drama.

386
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,200
- That's right. - You're a Gen Z nine-tailed fox.

387
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,270
A Gen Z nine-tailed fox?

388
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,530
A nine-tailed fox is supposed to become a human.

389
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,570
That's right.

390
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,670
- But she wants to stay as a fox. - Right.

391
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,840
(The Gen Z Nine-tailed Fox)

392
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,040
- She enjoys her life as a fox. - Yes.

393
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,710
- Exactly. - She doesn't want to be a human.

394
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,270
- Right. - What about you, Lomon?

395
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,680
- Lomon. - Lomon is...

396
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,080
I bet he's a man who's in love with a nine-tailed fox.

397
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
A man with excessive narcissism...

398
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,580
- Hey. - Mister.

399
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,550
(What's wrong with you?)

400
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,980
- Why would you say that? - What's wrong with you?

401
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,220
- What are you doing? - Come on.

402
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,190
- It's not like you're watching TV. - He's being ridiculous.

403
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,250
- Seriously. - Seriously.

404
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,220
(Laughing)

405
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,520
- Isn't that it? - I thought...

406
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,560
he was talking in his bedroom.

407
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,690
- Unbelievable. - Don't cut him off.

408
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,930
- Don't ruin it. - Seriously, what was that?

409
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,560
Don't speak as if you're in your bedroom watching TV.

410
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,530
I'm a world-famous soccer player...

411
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,800
- with excessive narcissism. - I see.

412
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,670
I play Kang Si Yeol.

413
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,540
(He plays Si Yeol, a world-class soccer player.)

414
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,900
- I see. - Si Yeol.

415
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,500
- Excessive narcissism. - Yes.

416
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,770
Lomon was a trainee...

417
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,170
- at SM Entertainment. - Really?

418
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,570
- No? - No.

419
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,840
Wasn't it SM Entertainment?

420
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,810
- No. I wasn't an idol. - What was it then?

421
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,280
(Not at all.)

422
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,410
Weren't you an idol trainee before?

423
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,880
(It was a mix-up, since he surely looks like an idol.)

424
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,480
No, I wasn't.

425
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
- I think you were. - No.

426
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,650
- He looks like an idol. - His face...

427
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,520
Then, where are you from?

428
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,720
- I'm from Bogwang-dong. - Really?

429
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,720
(He's from Osan High School in Bogwang-dong.)

430
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
Really?

431
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
- We went to the same school. - What?

432
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,130
- I went to Osan Middle School. - Hey!

433
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,630
Your eyes are bright

434
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,260
- Like the color of X - Don't do that.

435
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,630
Your eyes are bright

436
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,970
- Like the color of X - Like the color of X

437
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,540
Pierce the sky and crush the earth

438
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,770
(Suddenly, they begin to sing the school song.)

439
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,840
He sounds just like a middle-aged man now.

440
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,570
- He remembers all that. - What an old man.

441
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,140
(Hajeossi is excited to meet the younger one from his hometown.)

442
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,810
This is what you must do.

443
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,040
- Let's exchange phone numbers. - Okay.

444
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,910
- Osan High School? - Let's follow each other.

445
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,110
I'd love to.

446
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,750
(My ex-brother.)

447
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,050
- You know what? - Look at them.

448
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,020
(And he goes along with it.)

449
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,050
His nickname during his school days was Blowfly.

450
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,490
When Lomon was younger,

451
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,320
- he was into b-boying. - What?

452
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,890
- Really? - In my neighborhood...

453
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,260
- Really? - In my neighborhood,

454
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,490
there were a lot of dancers.

455
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,260
- I said he was an idol. - B-boying?

456
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,100
(Lomon, from Bogwang-dong, used to be a b-boy)

457
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,200
Show us some moves.

458
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,300
Like how?

459
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,570
I did it only until I was a sixth grader.

460
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,870
Your body would remember it.

461
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,740
- I see. - Your body remembers the steps.

462
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,970
- B-boying. - I bet he's good.

463
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,470
You have to show us, Lomon.

464
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,910
Let's go!

465
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,740
(My younger brother)

466
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,910
Bogwang!

467
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,850
Dong!

468
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,720
What was that?

469
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,690
(The Bogwang Kid reacted to it oddly.)

470
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,350
- I don't know what it is. - What was that?

471
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,820
- What was that? - What did he do?

472
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,990
- What? - Bogwang!

473
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,190
(At that moment)

474
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,290
- What? - I don't know what he's doing.

475
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,490
(The music is on.)

476
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,920
- What? - Go!

477
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,730
Take it off. You can do this.

478
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,860
Let me help you.

479
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,060
You think so?

480
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,630
(The neighborhood friend even takes his bag off and sets things up.)

481
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,460
Let's go!

482
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,400
(Hesitant)

483
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,100
We know when we see it.

484
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,170
There you go.

485
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,600
We know when we see it.

486
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,940
(After hesitating a while, he makes people cheer right away.)

487
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,540
- There you go. - Okay.

488
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,770
He's good.

489
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,680
(With his coat fluttering, he shows some flashy steps.)

490
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,980
(A mischievous expression)

491
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,550
(My younger brother)

492
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,380
He's good.

493
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,420
(Windmill)

494
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,950
(This is crazy!)

495
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,960
(An ending expression)

496
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,660
- That was amazing. - You've still got it.

497
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,700
(His skills are still good.)

498
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,030
- You're so good. - My goodness.

499
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,200
What was that?

500
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,660
- You're good. - You did well.

501
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,300
- His body remembers it. - He's still good.

502
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,630
- You were brilliant. - Thank you.

503
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,600
(Shy again)

504
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,970
That was great.

505
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,400
This place was once called...

506
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,310
Fox Valley since there were a lot of foxes living here.

507
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,280
- It's Gwangjin-gu. - Fox Valley?

508
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,380
Today's race, which begins in Fox Valley,

509
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,180
(Today's race will begin here.)

510
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,750
is Starting From Today, I'm a Nine-Tailed Fox.

511
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,780
You guys are foxes who want to become...

512
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,280
- nine-tailed foxes. - I see.

513
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,720
So, you must each complete nine tails.

514
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,820
(They each need to finish 9 tails.)

515
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
Nine tails?

516
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,660
If you become a nine-tailed fox, you receive a prize,

517
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,560
and if you don't, you receive a penalty.

518
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,690
- All of us? - My goodness.

519
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,700
You'll be given different tails first.

520
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,160
- We all get it? - Everyone?

521
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,070
- Hye Yoon. - Yes.

522
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,400
This is...

523
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,070
I have two.

524
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,100
Which one?

525
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,870
You got two.

526
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,610
(Lomon has 2 tails.)

527
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,240
And you have three.

528
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,710
(Hye Yoon has 3 tails, and Lomon has 2 tails.)

529
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,510
What is this belt with no tails?

530
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,310
- Why don't I have one? - Why not?

531
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,510
You each received...

532
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,510
- a different number of tails. - Right.

533
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,050
(They each have a different number of tails.)

534
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,920
Seok Jin and Se Chan get no tails.

535
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,150
(Balding Jee Fox has 0, and Se Chan has 0 after giving his to Hye Yoon.)

536
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,150
Why only you and me?

537
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,520
Having more tails isn't necessarily an advantage,

538
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,590
- and having fewer... - That's not the case?

539
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,690
isn't a disadvantage.

540
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,660
- I see. - I guess there's a reason.

541
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,960
If you collect more than nine tails,

542
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
- it blows up. - What?

543
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,970
You have to start over and collect them again.

544
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,530
(They all disappear when it becomes more than 9 tails.)

545
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,970
- It blows up? - Oh, no.

546
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,140
- So it becomes 0 instead of 10. - Right.

547
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
- It's reset. - Yes.

548
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,210
It's just like how she wants to remain a nine-tailed fox.

549
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,070
(They need to start over from 0 when it blows up.)

550
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,670
- Right? - That's a good one.

551
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,440
- That's very interesting. - So, if you are done collecting...

552
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,810
- nine tails during a mission, - That's not good.

553
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,080
you will have to keep them as they are until the end.

554
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,680
(It is important to keep it at 9 tails until the end.)

555
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,620
- I see. - Okay?

556
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,050
Let's meet again after getting changed.

557
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,350
(Number of tails)

558
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,050
- Okay. - All right.

559
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,320
Let's go.

560
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,990
- Let's go. - Let's go.

561
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,490
(They move locations to start collecting tails.)

562
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,060
I'm relaxed now.

563
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,390
What?

564
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,130
- What is this? - What is this?

565
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,230
We're doing makeup.

566
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,360
- What's all this? - What?

567
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,400
What's this?

568
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,460
We're doing a makeover?

569
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,230
(There is a corner full of decorative accessories.)

570
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,500
I think so.

571
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,870
I'm excited already.

572
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,370
- Where should we sit? - We're doing a makeover?

573
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,900
(Awkward)

574
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,700
What's all this?

575
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,870
This is...

576
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,370
Is this your first time here?

577
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,040
- Yes, it's my first time. - Is it interesting?

578
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,910
Yes. This is like my first variety show.

579
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,610
When you see me, do you feel like you're meeting a celebrity?

580
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,680
Yes, I do.

581
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,350
I feel the same way.

582
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,510
(Satisfied)

583
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,950
(He starts to make it difficult for the rookie entertainer.)

584
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,220
- Lomon is handsome. - He's really good-looking.

585
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,620
- Lomon, have a seat. - Lomon.

586
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,690
How old are you?

587
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,420
I was born in 1999.

588
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,590
- In 1999? - Really?

589
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,390
- What about you, Hye Yoon? - In 1999?

590
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,660
- I was born in 1996. Yes. - You're older than him.

591
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,130
Were you born in 1996? We're 10 years apart.

592
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,730
- He's young among us. - Right.

593
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:34,000
(Feeling the generation gap)

594
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,770
- By the way... - He was the youngest one here.

595
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,140
- Really? - Yes.

596
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,510
Ye Eun is the youngest one now.

597
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
(Oh, right. Ye Eun is the youngest one now.)

598
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,670
What's this?

599
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,940
- Right. - What's this?

600
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,980
Ye Eun, why do you keep tucking your hair behind your ears?

601
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,050
What's with you?

602
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,110
(Laughing)

603
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,610
- Have you lost your mind? - It's obvious.

604
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,350
No. That's because Ye Eun had too much gimbap.

605
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,420
I see.

606
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,920
(The food fighter is high on carbs.)

607
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,290
- She had too much gimbap. - Yes. Ye Eun did.

608
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,590
I asked, "Ye Eun, why are you eating so much in the morning?"

609
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,490
And she said, "I need to eat a lot now."

610
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,160
(She diligently recharged her carbs in the morning.)

611
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,200
All right. Today,

612
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,900
we have both Gen Z nine-tailed foxes and old nine-tailed foxes here.

613
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,200
(Both Gen Z nine-tailed foxes and old nine-tailed foxes are here.)

614
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,900
For a nine-tailed fox, good looks are essential.

615
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,670
(Good looks are essential for a nine-tailed fox.)

616
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,710
So, we are having a face consulting session,

617
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,670
a popular experience for Gen Z these days.

618
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,840
(No Tail to Tell, Mission 1, Face Consulting)

619
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,710
- A face consulting session? - Who will do it?

620
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,980
You will be split into two teams.

621
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,750
- An expert will come... - Really?

622
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,780
and analyze the faces of the three members from each team.

623
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,920
- That's amazing. - And we will rank them...

624
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,590
- in order of good facial balance. - Rank?

625
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,590
Really?

626
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,930
- What kind of balance do you mean? - Listen.

627
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,830
- Some of us are poorly balanced. - But...

628
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,400
What are the ones with poor balance...

629
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,700
- supposed to do? - We'll be sad.

630
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,630
We have members with a poorly balanced face here.

631
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,770
The balance has already collapsed.

632
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,340
(The Protruded Brothers are especially pouty today.)

633
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,900
- Leave him out. - We don't need consulting.

634
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,940
So,

635
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,440
I think it would be hurtful...

636
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,740
if we ranked you by facial balance...

637
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,540
- and decided on the winner. - Right.

638
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,150
- We're already hurt. - So, we will...

639
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,150
award the victory to the team...

640
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,520
with the lowest-ranked member who needs support...

641
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,020
because their face lacks balance.

642
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,890
- I see. - A face that lacks balance?

643
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,160
- What? - Jae Seok's team will win for sure.

644
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
- Is this supposed to be comfort? - These two...

645
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,230
Protruded Brothers will definitely win.

646
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,590
We should team up.

647
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,260
How bad are their faces to need support?

648
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,560
If they need support...

649
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,330
- It's just a little lacking. - It's just a little lacking.

650
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,570
(They are not bad.)

651
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,470
Don't say that.

652
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,470
So, the winning team, who needs support,

653
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,870
(Along with the support, the winning team will get...)

654
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,970
will receive a tail,

655
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,910
a benefit that helps them acquire tails,

656
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,940
and even Dubai chewy cookies,

657
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,150
a popular Gen Z item that's often sold out these days.

658
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,980
(The hard-to-buy Gen Z dessert, Dubai chewy cookies)

659
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,420
- Really? - Yes.

660
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,750
You'll get them as a prize.

661
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,690
- You like Dubai chewy cookies. - Yes.

662
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,790
- Really? - Dubai chewy cookies!

663
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,320
- They are so good. - I love them. I really do.

664
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,120
(Excited)

665
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,760
- I love them. - Ye Eun likes...

666
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,330
- the cookies more than the tails. - Right.

667
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,030
- Hey. - She sounds so excited.

668
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,930
You ate a lot of gimbap in the morning.

669
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,670
It's expensive. One cookie costs about seven dollars.

670
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,540
(She already digested the gimbap.)

671
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,830
- Sometimes it's eight dollars. - Right.

672
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,170
- One cookie? - Yes.

673
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,610
(Which nine-tailed fox will get the Dubai chewy cookies?)

674
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,140
- And it's sold out. - You just can't buy it.

675
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,240
We divided the teams in advance,

676
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,340
(The teams were already divided, with the facial balance in mind.)

677
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,110
- considering the facial balance. - Okay.

678
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,180
Hye Yoon, Jae Seok, Jong Kook,

679
00:17:52,440 --> 00:18:00,050
(Team Hye Yoon, Hye Yoon, Jae Seok, Jong Kook, Haha, Ji Hyo)

680
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,850
Haha, and Ji Hyo are on the same team.

681
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,050
- We are at an advantage. - They will win.

682
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,190
They don't have many members with poor balance.

683
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,450
- Jae Seok is the only one. - To stand against him...

684
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,290
"Jae Seok is the only one?"

685
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,620
(Team Hye Yoon's key asset, Jae Seok)

686
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,360
He's the worst.

687
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,090
- What are you talking about? - He's the ugly one.

688
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,530
Lomon, Seok Jin,

689
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:15,400
(Team Lomon, Lomon, Seok Jin, Se Chan, Ye Eun)

690
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,430
Se Chan, and Ye Eun are on the same team.

691
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,600
- We are so... - We have Se Chan.

692
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,270
- We all are... - You know what?

693
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,500
Everyone except for Lomon is ugly on this team.

694
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,970
Right. All of us are messy.

695
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,140
(Captain Lomon is the team's sole pillar of support.)

696
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,200
Right.

697
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,510
Lomon and Hye Yoon must participate.

698
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,740
(They need to choose 3 members, including the team leader.)

699
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,710
- Right. - Please select three members...

700
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,940
- on each team. - Okay!

701
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,310
(The showdown between the two Pouty Mouths will be crucial.)

702
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,880
I think you and I are most likely to win.

703
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,080
Both of us.

704
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,420
Anyway, it's better to be ranked lower.

705
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,750
(Team Hye Yoon, Team Lomon)

706
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,690
Now, we will bring in Beauty Data Consultant Choi Yeo Won,

707
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,090
(The one who will check their facial balance,)

708
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,220
who will check...

709
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,190
(the Beauty Data Consultant will come in.)

710
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,590
- your facial balance. - All right.

711
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,390
- Hello. - Hello.

712
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,660
Nice to meet you.

713
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,130
- Hello. - Hello.

714
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,800
(Beauty Data Consultant Choi Yeo Won)

715
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,030
- Hello. - Hello.

716
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,500
She's a real expert.

717
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,630
(Nervous)

718
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,140
Ms. Choi.

719
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,170
- Hello. - Should we start...

720
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,170
with the messy one?

721
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,210
He's the worst one here.

722
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,110
- Who do you want first? - We'll do as you say.

723
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,040
(She can choose her pick.)

724
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,810
- I'd like to start with Jae Seok. - I knew it.

725
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,950
- I'd like to start with Jae Seok. - I knew it.

726
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,620
(Her first choice is Yu Jae Seok.)

727
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,050
- The worst-balanced one. - The worst one.

728
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,720
- The thing is... - You know what?

729
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,050
(Anxious)

730
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,850
- In this case... - She must have hidden intentions.

731
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,920
His facial balance has collapsed.

732
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,820
Should he take off his glasses?

733
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,320
It'd be nice if he took them off.

734
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,960
- Okay. - He should take them off.

735
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,230
He's barely holding up with his glasses.

736
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,660
- Shall I sit here? - Yes, please.

737
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,830
(He sits in front of the mirror.)

738
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,830
Look at his tails.

739
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,930
He'll be very disappointed when he looks in the mirror.

740
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,300
- He's just popular. - Exactly.

741
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,800
It is true that he's ugly.

742
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,040
Right. When he looks in the mirror...

743
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,910
- Okay. - Please take them off.

744
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,740
(It's already so funny.)

745
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,410
- Don't you think he'll get mugged? - I bet I look okay.

746
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,450
Jae Seok's face is not...

747
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,350
- what you imagined... - What we imagined?

748
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,580
The asymmetry is more noticeable.

749
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,920
The asymmetry is more noticeable.

750
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,250
(The asymmetry is worse than expected.)

751
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,660
(It's harsh from the beginning.)

752
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,520
Put your glasses back on!

753
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,660
Than expected?

754
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,120
(Holding back laughter)

755
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,020
- Unbelievable. - Got it.

756
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,460
His face is asymmetrical.

757
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,790
I thought she'd say something positive.

758
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,730
Why would you add "than expected?"

759
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,230
However...

760
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,670
I believe having an asymmetrical face...

761
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,700
is part of what made you a top celebrity.

762
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,100
- I see. - Really? Why?

763
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,110
(The asymmetry is what made him the Nation's Beloved Host.)

764
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
That's what I think.

765
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,370
- Because there's a lack of balance? - How so?

766
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,170
Those with balanced features...

767
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,680
and symmetrical faces...

768
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,840
look better in person.

769
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,680
They seem elegant and graceful.

770
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,950
However...

771
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,050
She's saying Jae Seok doesn't look elegant or graceful.

772
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,250
(The hidden meaning)

773
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,890
- Exactly. - Look at...

774
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,320
(He gave up elegance for social success.)

775
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,390
- No way. - her elegant backhanded insults.

776
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,330
- He's not elegant. - We've won.

777
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,490
- Hye Yoon, we've won this game. - Seriously?

778
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,130
(The team that has Jae Seok is full of confidence.)

779
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,360
- The asymmetry is more noticeable. - Elegant...

780
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,830
- I see. - No one comes close to him.

781
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,830
As you know,

782
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,770
celebrities make a living by being memorable.

783
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,830
- Of course. - I see.

784
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,640
- A balanced face isn't memorable. - I agree.

785
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,300
(A balanced face)

786
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
- His face is hard to forget. - Meanwhile,

787
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,710
a lot of Jae Seok's charms come from his imbalanced face.

788
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,740
That's why he's been so memorable.

789
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
(Jae Seok's diagnosis: Leaves a strong impression...)

790
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,180
- I agree. - Jae Seok doesn't know...

791
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,650
(with his asymmetric face.)

792
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,610
whether to laugh or cry at her remark.

793
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,610
He has an unforgettable face.

794
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,980
(You're right.)

795
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,820
To put it simply, you're saying he's ugly.

796
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,120
Gosh, no.

797
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,350
- I'm saying he's charming. - Yes, he's charming.

798
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,020
He has a unique face.

799
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,090
Yes, he has a unique and memorable face.

800
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,390
(Layering up with vague expressions)

801
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,160
A unique face.

802
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,160
- Unique means "one of a kind." - Right.

803
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,330
You rarely say that to good-looking people.

804
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,200
(Particularly clever)

805
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,460
He's unique.

806
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,060
- Yes, he's unique. - Right, unique.

807
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,300
- I'll take a closer look now. - Sure.

808
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
(Time to take a closer look at his unique face.)

809
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,600
- Go ahead. - What's his worst feature?

810
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,470
- Let's look at his lower face. - My lower face?

811
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,800
- Sure. - That's the worst.

812
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,910
- Right there. - His teeth.

813
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,480
(The most deteriorated part of his deteriorated face.)

814
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,570
- Here... - What's more unique than that?

815
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,540
- That's a hazardous area. - It's like a sinkhole.

816
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,240
This is his unique feature.

817
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,350
- First... - My unique feature?

818
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,480
- The word "unique..." - It's unique?

819
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,320
(As expected, his lower face was the most unique part.)

820
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,120
- She... - It's like a backhanded insult.

821
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,690
First of all, you have a long philtrum.

822
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,120
- Really? - Also,

823
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,160
(Long)

824
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,190
your mouth sticks out,

825
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,790
(Sticks out)

826
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,920
and your chin is set back.

827
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,230
(Set back)

828
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,390
Your chin is set back.

829
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,500
- Ms. Choi. - It recedes?

830
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,370
(Set back: Destroyed due to a catastrophic event)

831
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,370
- Rather than that, - Hold on.

832
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,530
you could say he barely has a chin.

833
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,970
Could you please use less harsh words?

834
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,740
- Your chin... - It looks recessed?

835
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,640
(Putting it nicely)

836
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,540
- It's set back. - My chin looks recessed?

837
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,470
- It's flat. - You're saying it's collapsed.

838
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,510
- It's flat. - She's saying it's flat.

839
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,710
Saying it looks recessed is the same as saying he has a collapsed chin.

840
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,710
It's like...

841
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,080
- a badly dented car bumper. - Exactly.

842
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,510
- Right. - It's completely flat.

843
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,420
That said, it's in your best interest...

844
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,290
to focus on your upper facial features.

845
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,090
- In other people's eyes... - Really?

846
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,620
(Jae Seok's diagnosis: Needs focus on the upper face,)

847
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,260
- No wonder glasses suit him. - Of course.

848
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,860
(rather than the setback lower face)

849
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,820
He'll look better with a face mask.

850
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,330
Let's take a look.

851
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,890
(Using visual aids to support her claims)

852
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,030
I believe Jae Seok has worked hard...

853
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,730
on his looks for over 30 years.

854
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,470
I mean that.

855
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,870
- Why are you laughing so hard? - He tried hard.

856
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,840
(The result of an incredible 30 years of hard effort)

857
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,540
- I mean... - Why are you laughing?

858
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,670
It's just that...

859
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,510
- You look terrible. - You didn't look so bad.

860
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,610
You look like a long-headed grasshopper...

861
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,740
in that first photo.

862
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
You look like...
- a long-headed grasshopper. - That's not human.

863
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,750
(Jae Seok at 22 years old, 33 years ago)

864
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,210
- A long-headed grasshopper. - His eyebrows...

865
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,580
- used to be droopy. - Hold on.

866
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,880
A long-headed grasshopper?

867
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,980
(Grasshopper used to be a long-headed grasshopper.)

868
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,020
That's what you look like.

869
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,120
A long-headed grasshopper?

870
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,320
Please take a look.

871
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,390
(Tracing the 30 years of evolution for the start)

872
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,790
In the first photo,

873
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,420
your glasses are not doing their job.

874
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,620
- Exactly. - She's right.

875
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,390
- You need black rims. - Rimless glasses were trendy.

876
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,760
(The rimless glasses are not doing their job.)

877
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,430
- That was the trend back then. - Right.

878
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,790
Everyone wore those.

879
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,130
(The next stage)

880
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,860
In the next photo,

881
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,930
the rims are darker,

882
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,070
(They are still too thin to draw attention.)

883
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,930
but they're still not pulling their weight.

884
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,430
- That's right. - The rims are too thin.

885
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,070
You look like a sponge.

886
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,110
- Right. - One that's long.

887
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,840
(Going through the sponge stage,)

888
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,340
- Anyway... - Now, look at the third photo.

889
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,440
(and into the next stage)

890
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,580
(The rims of his glasses became much thicker.)

891
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,840
I think you actively looked for plastic rims.

892
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,180
- I did. - You realized...

893
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,480
they suited you.

894
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,150
(Finally succeeded in distracting attention with the thick rims.)

895
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,750
- Yes, they suited me. - You found what worked.

896
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,120
Wearing dark plastic rims...

897
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
- helped draw focus to the eyes. - Right.

898
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,280
(Rapidly evolving after discovering the thick-rimmed glasses)

899
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,620
- Now look at the most recent photo. - He's gotten better-looking.

900
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,390
(Lastly, the most recent picture.)

901
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,060
You're wearing rims that are wider horizontally.

902
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,960
(They became wider vertically.)

903
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
- That's right. - It's true.

904
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,920
That helps hide your cheekbones.

905
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,530
- I see. - Right!

906
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,960
- No way. - Do I need to hide them?

907
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,360
(They covered up the flaws of his upper face, the cheekbones.)

908
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,160
There's a reason he looks better. I've been wondering why.

909
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,770
You've never looked better than you do now.

910
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,600
What a glow-up.

911
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Totally.

912
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,200
- No way. - Your words have given me hope.

913
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,040
(Jae Seok's final stage of evolution)

914
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,840
- She's right. - You've never looked better.

915
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,080
- Thank you so much. - You've been finding your look.

916
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,110
- That's right. - Of course.

917
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,380
(It took the long-headed grasshopper 30 years to become human.)

918
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,110
I've been finding my look.

919
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,610
From having a recessed chin to perfecting his look.

920
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,480
- It's true. - I agree.

921
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,520
(Jae Seok can't get any more handsome than this.)

922
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,120
- He's pleased. - I look better covered.

923
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,650
- You look better covered. - Right.

924
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,320
- Cover your face. - It might not be so bad...

925
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,650
to cover everything.

926
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,160
Cover the bottom half of your face.

927
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,320
- All of it? - All of it.

928
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,090
(He tries to break the upper limit.)

929
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,090
- Cover the bottom half? - That might be good.

930
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,490
Could you try on that spiky wig...

931
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,900
- in the back? - This?

932
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,960
- Yes, that. - That spiky wig.

933
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,930
(Another item to cover him up)

934
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,300
- This... - That?

935
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,470
I doubt that'll suit me.

936
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,770
- I don't think that'll suit him. - I doubt that'll work.

937
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,230
Put it on backward...

938
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,970
- so it covers your bangs. - Good idea.

939
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,240
(Well?)

940
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,040
That's it.

941
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,870
- Jae Seok! - This is it.

942
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,440
- No way. - Check it out.

943
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,240
- Jae Seok, nice. - It works.

944
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,380
(This is it!)

945
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,380
- You're right. - You look great!

946
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,280
Gather around

947
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,250
(A performance celebrating his best look yet)

948
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,350
Oh, no.

949
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,850
(Appalled)

950
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,960
Go for it.

951
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,590
(Fully immersed)

952
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,660
- I love it. - Does it work?

953
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,960
You should cover the lower half of your face,

954
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,890
- not the upper. - Exactly.

955
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,660
- You're absolutely right. - The lower half stands out.

956
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,460
(Completely agreeing)

957
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,730
It doesn't work.

958
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,130
- It stands out. - Should I cover up my mouth too?

959
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,300
- There you go. - That's it.

960
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,270
(Pretty boy)

961
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,840
- There you go. - That's it.

962
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,040
- That's the look. - Nice.

963
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,410
- That's the best. - I love it.

964
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,340
(Eyes shut tight)

965
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,280
- Then... - You should go around like that.

966
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,410
(After leaving only room to breathe, he hit a second peak.)

967
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,180
- That and glasses. - If this is how it should be,

968
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,250
- I like it. - wouldn't I...

969
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,950
be better off not leaving the house?

970
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,980
- It's true. - You look amazing.

971
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,220
(About to cry)

972
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,050
- You're so handsome. - Hye Yoon.

973
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,320
Hye Yoon.

974
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,690
- You're laughing a lot. - She's loving it.

975
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,320
(Hye Yoon gave up on trying not to laugh.)

976
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,960
- It's not that. - Come on.

977
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
- The wig is the best. - You look way better.

978
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,230
He's still ugly, even with his face covered.

979
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,360
Even with his face covered, he's still ugly.

980
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,360
(A concise conclusion)

981
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,960
- Even with his face covered, - I'm not kidding.

982
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,500
- he's still ugly. - It's shocking.

983
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,400
(Jae Seok: He needs to draw focus to his upper face.)

984
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,440
His ugliness still comes through.

985
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,770
Who's next?

986
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,200
(Next up is...)

987
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,770
- Se Chan, you're up. - Gosh, our human-faced fish.

988
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,870
(Se Chan)

989
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,110
Okay, it's on.

990
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,280
(A strong contender who can match Jae Seok.)

991
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,440
Here comes the human-faced fish.

992
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,240
I get the order in which she's calling us out.

993
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,880
(Reliable)

994
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,740
I hope she says your face looks wrecked.

995
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,450
- It's the grilled Atka mackerel. - Atka mackerel?

996
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,420
- Gosh, he's... - I look better these days.

997
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,580
(Dongducheon Catfish dominates the fish-face category.)

998
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,550
He looks like a fish too.

999
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,550
His mouth is actually crooked.

1000
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,360
- Look at his lips. - He looks like a fish too.

1001
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,020
His face is asymmetrical too.

1002
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,230
You look like you've already been snagged...

1003
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,830
by a fish hook.

1004
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,030
- Your mouth is pulled up. - Check that side.

1005
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,430
- He's been caught on a hook. - On this side.

1006
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,730
(Ready to get snagged)

1007
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,470
Is it because I only chew on this side?

1008
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,570
Hold on. Your face alone...

1009
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,110
(He just twitched his lips, and the crowd is already buzzing.)

1010
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,070
- Your face is flat as well. - Your face alone...

1011
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,070
I see Hong Hyun Hee in you.

1012
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,210
- I mean... - You're right!

1013
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,140
(Will he be able to beat Jae Seok and take last place in looks?)

1014
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,910
- Please go ahead. - It's better not to smile.

1015
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,810
- Don't smile. There you go. - Don't smile.

1016
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,950
I think he's pretty good-looking.

1017
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,510
- What? - Come on, Ms. Choi!

1018
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,510
He's pretty good-looking.

1019
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,950
(What?)

1020
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,680
- What? - Come on, Ms. Choi!

1021
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,080
- Come on, Ms. Choi. - No way.

1022
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,250
He's pretty good-looking.

1023
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,190
- What? - Come on, Ms. Choi!

1024
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,220
(Even Se Chan's surprised.)

1025
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,660
- If you cover his mouth. - Give us a big smile.

1026
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,120
- What? - Come on.

1027
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,930
- Smile. - Give us a big smile.

1028
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,430
Smile big, gums and all.

1029
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,000
(Grinning)

1030
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
(Playing the fail-proof catfish card)

1031
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,030
(Please don't do that...)

1032
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,900
He's attractive...

1033
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,970
- I agree. - with his mouth covered.

1034
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,040
- That's right. - He looks great with a mask.

1035
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,110
(Agreed)

1036
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,070
He could pass as a K-pop idol with a face mask on.

1037
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,070
- That's right. - He looks great with a mask.

1038
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,580
He could pass as a K-pop idol with a face mask on.

1039
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,610
(Good-looking)

1040
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,340
But with sunglasses, he looks like an old man.

1041
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,580
That's true.

1042
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,980
Exactly. Sunglasses make him look weird.

1043
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,250
Put on sunglasses and give us a big smile.

1044
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,780
- Where are the sunglasses? - Sunglasses?

1045
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,920
- Try some on. - Here you go.

1046
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,490
- Give us a big smile with those. - Check this out.

1047
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,950
(He lends him the bug-eyed sunglasses.)

1048
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,960
- This is my favorite look of his. - Give us a big smile.

1049
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,190
Oh, no!

1050
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,120
(Did you call for me?)

1051
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,330
(He's fascinated.)

1052
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,360
Doesn't he look completely different?

1053
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,600
(A K-pop idol, a father of two)

1054
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,460
Oh, no!

1055
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,760
Let's go!

1056
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,640
(He can look both young and old.)

1057
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,670
- That's hilarious. - Unbelievable.

1058
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,640
Your face is a disaster.

1059
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,710
All he needs is a balaclava.

1060
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,210
A balaclava? Are you telling me to cover everything?

1061
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,180
The top half of his face looks good.

1062
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,410
(She starts the analysis.)

1063
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,240
- What? - But watch him closely...

1064
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,280
from the tip of his nose.

1065
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,780
From the front,

1066
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,320
his nostrils are more visible...

1067
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,120
- than most people's. - You're right.

1068
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
- His nose... - Why's that?

1069
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,290
- That's not good. - Your nose is turned up.

1070
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,150
- Do I have an upturned nose? - It's turned up a little.

1071
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,060
- It's turned up. I didn't know. - So...

1072
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,160
- I had no idea. - Those people lose money.

1073
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,790
Money slips away from those with visible nostrils.

1074
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,030
(Goodness)

1075
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,630
I should look down then.

1076
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,830
That's right. But Se Chan...

1077
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,430
tilts his head up a lot.

1078
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,000
(Ssaebssaeb tends to lift his chin up.)

1079
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,300
- Then... - That's to avoid...

1080
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,670
- getting a double chin. - I see.

1081
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,940
That's why I tilt my head up.

1082
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,770
(Cautiously)

1083
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,240
- But by doing that, - That really shows.

1084
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,010
- your protruding mouth... - His face looks wrecked.

1085
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,350
(Protuding, receding)

1086
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,650
and receding chin become more noticeable.

1087
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,580
- Really? - His protruding mouth.

1088
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,380
(Receding brothers)

1089
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,280
Protruding mouth and receding chin?

1090
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,280
- His face looks wrecked. - Wrecked.

1091
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,350
Your upturned nose can make...

1092
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,920
(Se Chan's diagnosis: Needs to keep his head down,)

1093
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,820
your nostrils look bigger than most people's.

1094
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,490
(since he has an upturned nose)

1095
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,960
Right.

1096
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,930
- By tilting your head down... - Now you have a double chin.

1097
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,490
- I have a double chin. - He has a double chin now.

1098
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,060
(Professional)

1099
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,600
Yours is really noticeable.

1100
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,530
That gives me a double chin. How about now?

1101
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,030
(Pulling his chin in)

1102
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,770
Lower your shoulders a bit.

1103
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,900
- But... - Hey, that's nice!

1104
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,000
(Hold on a second...)

1105
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,870
- You look great. - Hold on.

1106
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,310
- You look different. - You look all right.

1107
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,540
- This is a different look. - He looks handsome.

1108
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
Remember that actor...
- who was on the show? - What was his name again?

1109
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,640
He looks like him.

1110
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,180
- Jong Hyuk? - Yes, him.

1111
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,710
- He looks handsome. - I see it.

1112
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,780
(Actor Joo Jong Hyuk, who appeared on the show...)

1113
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,910
- We're not kidding. - He's handsome.

1114
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,950
(as Se Chan's doppelganger)

1115
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,220
- Jong Hyuk? - Yes, him.

1116
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,950
(They look alike!)

1117
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,520
- You're right. - It's true.

1118
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,550
- We're not kidding. - Hold on.

1119
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,320
(Trying to look cool)

1120
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,650
You look like him.

1121
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,820
- It's true. - We're not kidding.

1122
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,090
- I mean it. - Now, give us a big smile.

1123
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,620
Now, give us a big smile.

1124
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,460
(Laughing)

1125
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,530
Look how different he seems.

1126
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,730
(Giggling)

1127
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,430
Ye Eun's loving it.

1128
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,300
Ye Eun, isn't this funny?

1129
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,270
(What do you think of him?)

1130
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,270
- It's not. - I get it now.

1131
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,930
That's why Se Chan...

1132
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,540
(To conclude, everything is a problem, except his eyes.)

1133
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,440
looks good with anything...

1134
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,640
that draws attention to the top part of his face.

1135
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,740
(Needs to draw attention to his upper face, like Jae Seok)

1136
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,710
- For instance... - Yes?

1137
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,040
These half-rim glasses.

1138
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,140
(She recommends half-rim glasses.)

1139
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,650
- Half-rim glasses. - These will look good on you.

1140
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,650
(Half-rim glasses that only have thick rims on the top)

1141
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,650
- Se Chan... - Half-rim glasses.

1142
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,380
(How does Se Chan look with half-rim glasses?)

1143
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,950
has always looked good with glasses.

1144
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,750
- They suit you! - She's right.

1145
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,790
- That's the one. - They look good on you.

1146
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,320
- They suit you! - She's right.

1147
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,990
(He cleans up nicely.)

1148
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,890
- And I should look down. - Right.

1149
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,460
(Keeping his chin down as well)

1150
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,160
- They suit you. - Yes, that's it.

1151
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,530
- They suit you! - She's right.

1152
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,400
- Ye Eun's loving it. - They look good on you.

1153
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,930
(Shameless)

1154
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,630
- Seriously. - Jong Kook, don't.

1155
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,400
(Serious)

1156
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,370
We're focused on the top part of his face,

1157
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,830
- He's giving KAIST vibes. - and he looks intelligent.

1158
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,900
- Do these glasses work? - Yes.

1159
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,940
You should wear glasses.

1160
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,910
(The vibe completely changed with just one item.)

1161
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,170
- Glasses... - I should wear glasses.

1162
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,110
You'll look intelligent with glasses.

1163
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,170
- I see. - They look great on you.

1164
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,210
- You look intelligent. - You look smart.

1165
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,240
Half-rim glasses.

1166
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,180
Hasn't she only complimented me so far?

1167
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,910
No, she didn't. She said the lower part of your face was wrecked.

1168
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,580
- You look way better. - Half-rim glasses are for you.

1169
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,580
(Se Chan: Glasses are recommended to emphasize his beautiful eyes,)

1170
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,220
- Half-rim glasses. - Okay!

1171
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,850
(instead of his deteriorated jawline.)

1172
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,950
- That was great. - Okay, scoot over.

1173
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,820
Poop Face is up next.

1174
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,490
(Next up is Haha, from Team Hye Yoon.)

1175
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,820
I'm not wearing any makeup today.

1176
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,020
- On purpose. - I see.

1177
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,290
Like this.

1178
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,460
One of us won't get a breakdown.

1179
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,290
- Should I take my cap off? - That'd be ideal.

1180
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,330
- Got it. - He's known as Poop Face.

1181
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,500
(He gets assessed with his ashy bare face.)

1182
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,300
- Haha... - Poop Face.

1183
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,600
There's a unique quality to Haha.

1184
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,340
It's this. I have to analyze your facial features,

1185
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,910
so I thought of your faces one by one.

1186
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:36,180
The person whose face was hardest to remember...

1187
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,480
(Zero impact)

1188
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,480
You may look at him...

1189
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,720
- and not remember him. - He lacks presence.

1190
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,280
- That's why all the time... - He lacks presence?

1191
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,090
I wonder what it would be like...

1192
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,220
if I were actually born ugly instead of born with this face.

1193
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,320
- Yes, of course. That's better. - It's too low.

1194
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,660
(This time, the problem is that he's too ordinary.)

1195
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,490
Let me show you something.

1196
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,000
(More reference photos)

1197
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,790
What's that?

1198
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,800
Gosh, he's really...

1199
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,730
- He covers up with his clothes. - With his outfits.

1200
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,500
- That's right. - That's right?

1201
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
(Dianosis of Haha: He tries to make up for his lack of presence...)

1202
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,170
- His lack of looks... - Actually, Haha...

1203
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,600
(through his clothes.)

1204
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,970
If you think about it, he always wore something extra.

1205
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,910
- Yes. I tried hard. - He relied on...

1206
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,840
- flashy caps or hairstyles... - He wears fancy hats.

1207
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,310
- or sunglasses or outfits. - Yes, I wore dreads too.

1208
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,450
(There was a reason he went all out.)

1209
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,810
- Yes, that's right. - Like that.

1210
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,710
That's his survival strategy.

1211
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,580
- That's it. - He has an amazing plan.

1212
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,650
- I think... - She saw through me.

1213
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,090
(Spot on)

1214
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,020
- Did I? - Yes.

1215
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,420
If you take all that away, he's just ugly.

1216
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,790
- No, he's handsome. - Really?

1217
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,090
He's handsome?

1218
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,360
His face is amazingly proportionate and well-balanced.

1219
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,100
- This is madness. - That doesn't mean you're handsome.

1220
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,600
(Annoyed)

1221
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,060
- You're not handsome. - Your looks are balanced.

1222
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,900
I can't stand this sight. How dirty.

1223
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,770
Your nose and mouth are in the perfect spot.

1224
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,140
(He has surprisingly well-balanced features.)

1225
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,500
Yes. My lips drive people crazy.

1226
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,570
Once you fall for them, there's no way out.

1227
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,910
(What would most effectively highlight his facial features?)

1228
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,910
So, if you were to change your makeup...

1229
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,280
They say my face is poop-colored.

1230
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,610
- It's poop-colored. - His face is poop-colored.

1231
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,250
(Diagnosis of Haha: He has well-balanced features,)

1232
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,680
He didn't wear makeup today.

1233
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,950
- Not today. - Ms. Choi.

1234
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,180
Fix his face for him.

1235
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,880
(but he wears poop-colored foundation.)

1236
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,520
The color of his face...

1237
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,550
Let's see how he looks with makeup.

1238
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,090
- Yes. - That would be nice.

1239
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,660
- I won't be doing it. - Perfect.

1240
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,090
(Here comes the makeup artist.)

1241
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,790
- Gosh. - There's another expert?

1242
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,790
Someone else is here.

1243
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,090
- Isn't that Ji Seon? - Ji Seon.

1244
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,030
(Jong Kook's stylist)

1245
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,290
- Ji Seon. - Ji Seon's here?

1246
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,900
You don't know how to do makeup.

1247
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,930
- Makeup... - I do know how.

1248
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,730
You get to work at last!

1249
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,330
(Ji Seon came to do someone's makeup other than Jong Kook.)

1250
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,970
- Ji Seon... - If you're that good at it...

1251
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,400
- Why not do Jong Kook's makeup? - Why...

1252
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,670
Why not me?

1253
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,610
(The celebrity she's working with is sitting without any makeup on.)

1254
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,510
I don't wear makeup.

1255
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,670
Ji Seon's doing it.

1256
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,640
You're a good makeup artist, but Jong Kook doesn't need it.

1257
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,540
- You don't wear makeup. - I don't.

1258
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,210
He's not wearing foundation, so let's start with number one.

1259
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,280
(She starts putting makeup on another celebrity.)

1260
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,780
- A lighter shade? - This is like...

1261
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,420
We'll start now.

1262
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,090
(She starts with base makeup using a lighter foundation.)

1263
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,920
He's getting his makeup done here.

1264
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,790
Yes, you're getting a new look here.

1265
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,420
- I think this tone works. - Four or five...

1266
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,790
Yes. You used too dark a color until now.

1267
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,260
You look nicer now.

1268
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,530
- That tone works better. - You look healthier.

1269
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,930
- This is better. - Change the foundation.

1270
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,830
(After a few strokes, his face isn't poop-colored anymore.)

1271
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,960
- This is better? - This is better.

1272
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,330
You look great.

1273
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,640
- Ji Seon's really good. - Ji Seon...

1274
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,800
You just never had the chance to shine.

1275
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,610
Were you this good at doing makeup?

1276
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,710
She can finish a face in a minute. That's how fast she is with me.

1277
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,980
(A highly skilled professional met Jong Kook, of all people.)

1278
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,810
Why doesn't Jong Kook wear makeup?

1279
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,280
- He does. Yes. - He does?

1280
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,950
Just not on Running Man.

1281
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,950
Just not here?

1282
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,750
(He wears heavy makeup on other shows.)

1283
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,550
I put on makeup for studio shoots.

1284
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,120
Why do you come here, then?

1285
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,590
He doesn't wear anything special either.

1286
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,860
This is her job.

1287
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,890
- Why... - Be nice.

1288
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,790
She's my companion.

1289
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,830
- They move together. - We ride together.

1290
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,930
- I plan to work now. - His van can fit seven people.

1291
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,930
- Yes. - He must fill it up.

1292
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,630
- They're companions. - Should I come in an empty van?

1293
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,630
Should he?

1294
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,970
"Companions..."

1295
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,570
Are you talking buddies?

1296
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,410
The aegyosal under the eyes.

1297
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,240
(After the base makeup, she begins applying color.)

1298
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,110
- The aegyosal. - The aegyosal.

1299
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,580
Do you add something shimmery for that?

1300
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,880
(After brightening the left under-eye area,)

1301
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,610
I'm looking forward to this.

1302
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,210
Accentuate his nose too.

1303
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,220
(she contours the left side of the nose bridge.)

1304
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,220
Some shading.

1305
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,420
- They're contouring. - Cut the sides.

1306
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,290
I'm turning sexy.

1307
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,950
(She contours his jaw,)

1308
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,220
(then she makes his lips look fuller.)

1309
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,720
Just the inside of the lips.

1310
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,820
Yes. The lower lip should be lighter.

1311
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,560
- That's it. - Let's see, Haha.

1312
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,660
(What's the result of the half-face makeup?)

1313
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,160
Hey, Haha, gosh.

1314
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,530
- The shading... - You look more alive.

1315
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,400
(Comparing before and after)

1316
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,700
- Yes, you do look lively. - One side looks slimmer.

1317
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,300
- He looks really different. - Gosh.

1318
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,500
(The brighter look)

1319
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,600
Hey, Haha, gosh.

1320
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,770
(The turd look)

1321
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,040
(The poop-colored side looks scary.)

1322
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,940
- That side looks scary. - That side...

1323
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,270
- It's dark. - It's a mess.

1324
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,080
- It's dark. - It really is.

1325
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,080
(Amazed)

1326
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,680
This side really looks dark and glum.

1327
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,880
(The side without makeup)

1328
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,550
(Only half of his face looks bright.)

1329
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,450
That's a total turd.

1330
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,820
Thanks, Ji Seon.

1331
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,950
(Jong Kook's stylist showed what she was truly capable of.)

1332
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,850
- Ji Seon. - Good job, Ji Seon.

1333
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,720
Go back to the van and rest now.

1334
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,690
(She's finished her work.)

1335
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,850
She's that good at makeup.

1336
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,690
- Let's film your right side today. - Yes.

1337
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,890
He looks more alive.

1338
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,160
(Half a transformation complete)

1339
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,260
You look like Kwon Sang Woo.

1340
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,760
(Haha: Makeup that brings out his surprisingly good facial balance)

1341
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,590
You look more alive.

1342
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,400
This is madness.

1343
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,470
- It's Lomon's turn now. - Yes.

1344
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,000
(Lomon comes out after some unattractive people.)

1345
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,670
Well, Lomon's face is just...

1346
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,970
- I don't know about him. - Lomon...

1347
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,000
Lomon's just... You know.

1348
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,010
That's the Gen Z look.

1349
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,810
His face has zero flaws.

1350
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,640
(How will the face consultation go for someone who is handsome?)

1351
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,380
His ears are so cute too.

1352
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,380
- I like it. - Right.

1353
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,880
Lomon has the face...

1354
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,210
(Lomon's face consultation)

1355
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,550
of a chiseled sculpture.

1356
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,120
- He has big eyes... Yes. - He has nice eyes.

1357
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,250
- SHINee's MINHO. - He looks like SHINee's MINHO.

1358
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,550
Yes, right.

1359
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,160
Ms. Choi's face...

1360
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,790
Ms. Choi's smiling now.

1361
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,390
- Ms. Choi. Come on. - You didn't smile for us.

1362
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,290
(She can't hide her smile.)

1363
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,800
- With him... - Your reaction is too different.

1364
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,400
You didn't smile for us.

1365
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,300
(Looking stiff)

1366
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,570
(Guard down)

1367
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,830
Your reaction is too different.

1368
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,500
You're smiling brightly.

1369
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,340
- His face is very proportionate. - That's true.

1370
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,110
(She keeps going.)

1371
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,040
- He's good-looking. - Everything's in the right place.

1372
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,940
Everything's in the right place.

1373
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,950
- Ms. Choi. - What about us, then?

1374
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,080
(What about us then?)

1375
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,750
My features are in the right place too.

1376
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,420
(His features are all over the place.)

1377
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,620
- "The right place?" - They all work.

1378
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,450
Are you saying my nose is where an ear should be?

1379
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,590
Right. Everything still works.

1380
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,290
(They have facial features that are totally functional!)

1381
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,790
Our eyes aren't where the nose should be.

1382
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,260
My gosh...

1383
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,130
Lomon, wear these. If he were to wear them...

1384
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,300
- It's more like surgery. - It would drive you crazy.

1385
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,600
(Haha handed him...)

1386
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,000
(the notorious sunglasses that look like a blowfly's eyes.)

1387
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,930
He looks like a foreigner.

1388
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,570
(This is the look we were used to.)

1389
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,830
What a mess.

1390
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,340
- If he were to wear them, - It's more like surgery.

1391
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,300
(If Lomon were to wear them?)

1392
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,370
it would drive you crazy.

1393
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,040
He looks like a foreigner.

1394
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,940
Hey, you...

1395
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,710
(This is what the sunglasses are like!)

1396
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,680
He can handle it.

1397
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,450
(Now they see the true value of the blowfly shades.)

1398
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,850
It must cover the eyebrows.

1399
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,110
- Like foreigners... - He looks good.

1400
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,120
Like Brad Pitt.

1401
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,920
Those are the blowfly sunglasses.

1402
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,890
(While everyone fell in love with Lomon,)

1403
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,050
That's madness.

1404
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,590
It must cover the eyebrows.

1405
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,760
(she's like a proud mom.)

1406
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,490
- Like foreigners... - He looks good.

1407
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,490
- Like Brad Pitt. - Yes.

1408
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,530
Those are the blowfly sunglasses.

1409
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,960
What about this wig?

1410
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
- Don't! - Can you handle this?

1411
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,730
- Don't! - Why not?

1412
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,470
(What if he wore a curly wig that's difficult to pull off?)

1413
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,100
Why give that to him?

1414
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,930
I want to see if he can pull it off.

1415
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,230
He looks like a foreigner.

1416
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,840
- You look good! - Lomon!

1417
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,870
(Feel good vibes)

1418
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,870
It's so annoying.

1419
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,740
(Jealous)

1420
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,370
- You look good! - Lomon!

1421
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,610
It's so annoying.

1422
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,840
A guy on a California beach.

1423
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,010
- He looks like a foreigner. - On a beach.

1424
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,410
- Hello. - Hello.

1425
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,420
(His face tells a story.)

1426
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,320
- You look great. - He's just...

1427
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,150
You can wear whatever you want.

1428
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,120
You'd even look good with a shaved head.

1429
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,220
(He just proved that it's the face that completes fashion.)

1430
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,550
What completes fashion is...

1431
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,790
- a handsome face. - A handsome face.

1432
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,390
(Lomon: His face can pull off anything.)

1433
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,460
- That's the unchanging rule. - What a win.

1434
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,360
Hye Yoon for Team Hye Yoon is next.

1435
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,430
(Hye Yoon continues with the team leader battle.)

1436
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,160
Oh, it's me next? Okay.

1437
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,600
- She's pretty. - Okay.

1438
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,360
- You have a tiny face. - Hye Yoon...

1439
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,970
(They shower her with praise from the start.)

1440
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,600
No, I don't.

1441
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,970
I could say you make people feel good.

1442
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,970
(People would feel good when they look at her face.)

1443
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,140
- Oh, really? - That's true.

1444
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,440
You have dimples as well,

1445
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,110
- so you look cute and lovable. - Yes.

1446
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,370
(She looks cute and loveable with her dimples.)

1447
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,640
- "Lovely." - "Lovely."

1448
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,840
All praise for Hye Yoon.

1449
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,750
(She received nothing but compliments.)

1450
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,550
Even I think there's nothing to criticize.

1451
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,120
"Surprise!"

1452
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,190
(Up next is the surprising Seok Sam.)

1453
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,480
I look weird.

1454
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,050
"Surprise."

1455
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,120
What's that?

1456
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,290
This doesn't look right.

1457
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
"Surprise!"

1458
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,420
(Passing out)

1459
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,790
Seok Jin! You look like Douner.

1460
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,890
Douner in diapers.

1461
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,800
- That's Douner. - You look like Douner.

1462
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,000
(Acting cute)

1463
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,870
- You definitely look younger. - I like this look.

1464
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,740
(Just a wig makes others pass out with laughter.)

1465
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,500
You look like Douner.

1466
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,710
Ms. Choi, please rank the members based on how well proportioned...

1467
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,370
(The face consultation is over.)

1468
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,310
(They'll be announced in order of facial balance.)

1469
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,040
their facial features are.

1470
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,240
- Based on what I saw, - Yes.

1471
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,380
(The team with the member ranked last in facial balance will win.)

1472
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,910
the order of how well-proportioned your faces are, number one is...

1473
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,150
Lomon.

1474
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,250
(Lomon comes 1st.)

1475
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,850
- We agree. - We agree.

1476
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,790
- In second place is Haha. - Second place?

1477
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,850
My gosh.

1478
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,390
(Haha is in 2nd place?)

1479
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,520
- You beat the grasshopper. - Lomon...

1480
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,120
- Bogwang-dong! - Bogwang-dong!

1481
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,490
- After Jae Seok... - That's a huge drop after Lomon.

1482
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,430
In third place is Hye Yoon.

1483
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,660
(Hye Yoon comes 3rd, which is questionable.)

1484
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,100
What... Hye Yoon ranking below Haha...

1485
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,430
- Everything's crumbling. - That makes no sense.

1486
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,100
(This ranking is bizarre.)

1487
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,940
It's okay, Hye Yoon. Cheer up.

1488
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,040
- Thanks. - In fourth place is Seok Jin.

1489
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,240
Okay!

1490
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,740
- It's not good. - Seok Jin...

1491
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,840
- Even so. - Jae Seok...

1492
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,680
(It's time to reveal who takes last place.)

1493
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,780
- You must come last. - Which one of you is worse?

1494
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,950
(And the Protruded Brothers are left.)

1495
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,250
I can beat Jae Seok.

1496
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,010
- You can't beat Jae Seok. - Jae Seok...

1497
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,620
Gather around

1498
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,020
(Is it Jae Seok whose features are ugly in general...)

1499
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,420
(or Se Chan with terribly mismatched eyes and mouth?)

1500
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,590
(Celebrities from Antenna face off based on their faces.)

1501
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,890
- The one below Jae Seok... - This ranking...

1502
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,630
- His features sunk. - You never know.

1503
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,530
- In fifth place... - Fifth place.

1504
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,930
(The uglier one will win!)

1505
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,470
- is Jae Seok. - No!

1506
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,070
(5th-place Jae Seok is less ugly.)

1507
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,700
You're in first place?

1508
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,840
- No! - You're in first place.

1509
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:16,240
(Disproportionate Se Chan came last and also first.)

1510
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,040
You're in first place?

1511
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,500
- He... - You're first from behind.

1512
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,480
- We won, then. - We won.

1513
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
- Yes, but I must wear a mask now. - Losing to Jae Seok...

1514
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,610
- You must wear a mask? - That's the worst.

1515
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,610
(Deep sigh)

1516
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,020
We won, but it doesn't feel great.

1517
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,720
- Despite winning. - Should we be pleased?

1518
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,990
(The glory of 1st place comes with nothing but scars.)

1519
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,950
- I'm done for the year. - Well,

1520
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,620
I lost for being handsome.

1521
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,890
- Team Lomon won. - Yes.

1522
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,860
You each get a tail and a Dubai chewy cookie.

1523
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,630
- A Dubai chewy cookie. - Darn it.

1524
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,130
- We won for being ugly. - We shouldn't have lost.

1525
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,430
(These will comfort those with less balanced faces.)

1526
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,930
Just so you know, these Dubai chewy cookies...

1527
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,740
were provided by Kwon Eun Bi who runs a cafe nearby.

1528
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,410
(Eun Bi sent the Dubai chewy cookies.)

1529
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,010
It's from her place?

1530
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,740
- They're Eun Bi's cookies? - They're Eun Bi's?

1531
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,510
- Eun Bi? - Do you want a bite?

1532
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,040
(Kind)

1533
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,640
No, it's fine. You have it.

1534
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,780
- Have a bite. - No.

1535
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,980
- You're sure? - Yes.

1536
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,450
I love these!

1537
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,420
(He takes a bite out of the rare dessert.)

1538
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,480
You love them a lot?

1539
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,920
It's like a mochi.

1540
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,150
We should've gotten one too.

1541
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,220
It's tasty.

1542
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,960
Those on Team Lomon get a tail too.

1543
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,460
(They're given 1 tail each.)

1544
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,690
Wait, these tails...

1545
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,360
I only have one so far.

1546
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,530
Me too.

1547
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,530
We'll give you...

1548
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,470
- a chance to win more tails. - Okay.

1549
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,440
You'll throw a dice and win whatever number of tails you get.

1550
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,210
- No way. - That could go bad.

1551
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,840
(It explodes once the tail count goes over 9.)

1552
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,540
- We don't want too many. - It could blow up.

1553
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,480
The winning team's dice...

1554
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,910
will only have 1, 2, and 3 written on it.

1555
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,120
(Winning team's dice: Has 1, 2, and 3 only)

1556
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,120
So, the winning team has dice that has fewer chances of blowing up.

1557
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,450
(They can gain tails safely.)

1558
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,420
The losing team has to roll two dice...

1559
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,560
that has numbers 1 through 6 written on them.

1560
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:46,660
(Losing team's dice: 2 regular dice, could easily blow up)

1561
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,960
- It could easily blow up. - That's a reset.

1562
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,060
This will blow up, 100 percent.

1563
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,460
- Okay! - Oh, my gosh.

1564
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,800
However, you'll get to decide whether or not...

1565
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,030
to roll the dice.

1566
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,070
(Each of them can decide whether to roll the dice.)

1567
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,640
- Of course, I have to go for it. - I have to do it.

1568
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,070
Who wants to go first from the winning team?

1569
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,840
(The winning team will go first.)

1570
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,240
- Yes, I'll go. - We have to go even if it blows up.

1571
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,440
(Regardless of the number, their tails won't explode.)

1572
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,810
- Yes, we have to. - This isn't our first rodeo.

1573
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,340
- Can't you roll the regular dice? - Isn't it obvious?

1574
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,110
- Se Chan and I... - Of course. You have to roll it.

1575
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:08,820
(Se Chan: 1 tail)

1576
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,710
- Of course. - It's best if I get two. Here I go.

1577
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,480
Three.

1578
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,150
- Three is good too. - Three is good.

1579
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,420
- One. - Not bad.

1580
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,390
(Se Chan: 2 tails)

1581
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,190
- No, it's not "Not bad." It's bad. - The next person...

1582
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,620
(Considering the upcoming mission,)

1583
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,020
- It's a good thing. - Yes, it's good.

1584
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,860
(it's better to increase the number slowly.)

1585
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,790
- You can feel things out. - I have to feel things out.

1586
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,860
(Seok Jin tries as well.)

1587
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,660
- Three! - One.

1588
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,530
- Three! - One.

1589
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,800
(Seok Jin: 1 tail)

1590
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,400
- Oh, my. - Three!

1591
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,230
- Oh, my. - Three!

1592
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,200
(Seok Jin: 4 tails)

1593
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,200
- It's not good. - Three tails!

1594
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,240
(Up next is the one with Dubai chewy cookie on her lips.)

1595
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,270
I'll go. In 1, 2, 3.

1596
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,540
- Okay. - Two.

1597
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,410
(Ye Eun: 2 tails)

1598
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,210
Three. Two.

1599
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,070
(Ye Eun: 4 tails)

1600
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,140
- My gosh. - This will blow right up.

1601
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,340
(The one with the best face tries.)

1602
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,270
All right, Lomon.

1603
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,310
- One? - Okay, go!

1604
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,910
Does he want to get one?

1605
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,350
(Lomon: 3 tails)

1606
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,480
- He wants to get one. - Two.

1607
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,780
(Lomon: 5 tails)

1608
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,220
- Two is all right. - That's appropriate.

1609
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,520
- Well, but... - Yes, that's just right.

1610
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,980
(The winning team could play safely.)

1611
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,820
- Not bad. - Thank you.

1612
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,350
(They still have a long way to go before reaching 9 tails.)

1613
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,450
- Is that it? - I have four now.

1614
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,390
- We throw them at once, right? - We need to get nine.

1615
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,190
- And the losing team... - You need to use those.

1616
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,430
(Since it's the first time, everyone on the losing team will try.)

1617
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,590
- Of course, I should go. - Of course, I should go.

1618
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,530
- Just go, whether or not it works. - I have four now.

1619
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:54,030
(If they have more than 9 tails, it'll be reset immediately.)

1620
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,290
- We throw them at once, right? - Yes.

1621
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,930
- You can't be petty about it. - Gosh, this might...

1622
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,060
- It might blow up. - You have to throw them.

1623
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,500
- It might blow up. - You have to throw them.

1624
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,900
I have...

1625
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,970
(The losing team rolls 2 dice numbered from 1 to 6.)

1626
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,400
- It might blow up. - There you go.

1627
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,640
- It might blow up. - It blew up.

1628
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,370
Hey, this...

1629
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,070
(Haha: 1 tail)

1630
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,110
- Two! - Hey, it might blow up.

1631
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,670
(Haha: 3 tails)

1632
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,510
Oh, but... It blew up.

1633
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,380
(How about the other die?)

1634
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,680
No. Seven!

1635
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,110
- Hey, do you already have eight? - Eight!

1636
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,180
(Haha: 8 tails)

1637
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,750
(The man with the 2nd most handsome face held up well.)

1638
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,410
- Seven! Haha has seven. - Eight!

1639
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,850
Gosh, you're so close.

1640
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,320
- He had 1, so that makes 8. - Yes, 8.

1641
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:18,120
(If he gets 2 next time, his tails will explode.)

1642
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,890
- It's not bad. - Hey, that's dangerous.

1643
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,920
- It's dangerous. - It's not bad.

1644
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,420
- I'll go. - Okay.

1645
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,820
(Golden Hand tries as well.)

1646
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,790
- Gosh, you have to be lucky. - Go.

1647
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,790
All right.

1648
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,760
(Ji Hyo: 3 tails)

1649
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,590
- Four? - Four.

1650
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,660
- That's all right. - It's good.

1651
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
(Ji Hyo: 7 tails)

1652
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,330
- It didn't blow up. - She's lucky.

1653
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,600
(Ji Hyo also miraculously survived!)

1654
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,430
Gosh, she didn't blow up.

1655
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,870
- She's seriously lucky. - She's lucky.

1656
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,200
- All right, Hye Yoon. - Yes, here I go.

1657
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,440
(Next is Hye Yoon.)

1658
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
Hye Yoon, you have three tails now, right?

1659
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,700
- Yes, I have three. - I told you.

1660
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,410
(Hye Yoon: 3 tails)

1661
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,110
Hye Yoon needs a small number.

1662
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:41,480
- It might be better to blow up. - You can't be timid.

1663
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,840
(It could easily blow up.)

1664
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,480
(She throws the dice carefully.)

1665
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,580
I don't know.

1666
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,710
- Two. - Two.

1667
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,150
- Oh, nice. - But...

1668
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,250
(Hye Yoon: 5 tails)

1669
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,580
(If she gets more than 4, it'll be reset.)

1670
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,680
- I don't know. - Two.

1671
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,650
(What will it be?)

1672
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,790
You only need good luck when it matters.

1673
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,160
(Hye Yoon: 5 tails)

1674
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,460
- Five. - So, seven combined.

1675
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,320
(Hye Yoon: 10 tails)

1676
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,690
- Seven. - You blew up.

1677
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,460
(Hye Yoon is the 1st to blow up as she went over 9.)

1678
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,930
She blew up!

1679
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,160
Okay.

1680
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,860
- You blew up! - Oh, my.

1681
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,630
You blew up!

1682
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,570
(They have to return all their tails if it goes over 9.)

1683
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,100
- Return them, please. - Okay.

1684
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,200
Okay!

1685
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,770
Let's go!

1686
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,100
(Next, Jae Seok with 3 tails and Jong Kook with 1 tail)

1687
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,600
- Oh, no. - Four. Nine.

1688
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,340
(Since they rolled 9, it was reset.)

1689
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,840
- You blew up. - There you go.

1690
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,510
You blew up.

1691
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:16,550
(Number of tails)

1692
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,310
I mean, when I wanted a high number, it just wouldn't happen.

1693
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,510
My body feels so light now.

1694
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,510
You only need good luck...
- when it matters. - Of course.

1695
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,880
Goodness, these tails.

1696
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,350
(They're going to move to find tails.)

1697
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,380
Handsome people, get in the back.

1698
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,120
Then, come here.

1699
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,120
Ye Eun and Hye Yoon, go to the back seat.

1700
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,150
(Ye Eun and Hye Yoon, go to the back seat.)

1701
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,350
Where should I sit? What should I do?

1702
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,120
(Sitting behind the good-looking person)

1703
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,890
Handsome people, go to the back.

1704
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,420
- Hye Yoon and Lomon, sit back here. - Okay!

1705
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,790
(This is a Snowpiercer where ranks are determined by faces.)

1706
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,460
- Do I sit here? - Yes.

1707
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,230
I should tilt my chin down.

1708
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,670
(While Se Chan sits in the tail end by himself)

1709
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,930
- Okay. - All right.

1710
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,270
As we move to the next mission location...

1711
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,370
- Yes? - Yes.

1712
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,470
We'll proceed with the mission.

1713
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,140
(They will carry out the next mission on the bus.)

1714
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,700
- Sounds good! - Okay!

1715
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,970
It's been a while.

1716
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,640
Yes, this next mission is called...

1717
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,340
Music is Timing.

1718
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:48,340
(Mission 2: Music is Timing)

1719
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,010
- What is it? - It is about timing.

1720
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,480
You will listen to a song,

1721
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,880
and there will be the exact time a certain part begins.

1722
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:58,150
(Raise your sign right when a certain part of a song starts.)

1723
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,050
I'm so good at this.

1724
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,420
- Who is? - If you raise your sign...

1725
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,050
precisely at that moment, you win a point.

1726
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,220
Gosh, that's so hard.

1727
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,090
The 5 of you in the front will go 1st.

1728
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,530
(The 5 people in the front row will go 1st.)

1729
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,060
- Oh, okay. - You'll play one round.

1730
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,130
Then, the four of you in the back. Like so.

1731
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,000
(Then the 4 people in the back will try.)

1732
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,230
Back, front, back, front. We'll divide you up like this.

1733
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,670
You know,

1734
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,130
I'm seriously the King of Rhythm.

1735
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,770
At first, we'll let you listen to the song first.

1736
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,700
(They'll let them listen to the song before they try.)

1737
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,770
Then, you'll officially start raising your signs.

1738
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,510
- Will you let us listen to it? - We'll give you one chance.

1739
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,740
- Yes. - You have to just do it.

1740
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,080
- Just do it. - Just go for it.

1741
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,310
(The singers are confident.)

1742
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,940
- Just do it. - Then, as you said,

1743
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,450
- we won't let you listen to it. - Okay.

1744
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,480
(Because of their protest, they'll go without a preview.)

1745
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,980
- Just go for it. - Raise your signs right away.

1746
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,380
- We should just play right away. - Yes, we should.

1747
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,950
- Just go for it! - Right!

1748
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,220
- I'm going to check. - Hye Yoon, that's okay, isn't it?

1749
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,020
- Yes! Sounds good. - Just go for it.

1750
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,890
Then, the five of you in the front row.

1751
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,690
(The 5 people in the front row will try for the 1st time.)

1752
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,660
- Okay! Let's go! - Let's do this.

1753
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,330
Here is the song.

1754
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,960
(What's the first song?)

1755
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,100
- I'll show you the King of Rhythm. - Raise it when you hear the drum.

1756
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,400
- The King of Rhythm! - Okay. Play.

1757
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,470
- Gosh, this is hard. - All right!

1758
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,500
See?

1759
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,000
(It only takes a little for them to recognize this masterpiece!)

1760
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,040
"And I?"

1761
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,180
("I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston)

1762
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:03,420
(Boom! You have to raise your sign on the drum sound!)

1763
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,930
(Will they be able to get right on the beat at once?)

1764
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,420
Raise it when you hear the drum.

1765
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,660
But there's a tricky rhythm.

1766
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,010
(Haha and Se Chan raised their sign on the beat.)

1767
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,070
- I got it! - I got it!

1768
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,810
- I got it, didn't I? - I got it.

1769
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,240
- I got it right. - I was right!

1770
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,840
I mean, I was going to raise mine, but Jee Seok Jin...

1771
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,850
I didn't mean to.

1772
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,210
- I had my eyes closed. - Well, I got it.

1773
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,320
(But Jae Seok claims that it's unfair.)

1774
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,480
- But he knocked my sign with his! - I had my eyes closed.

1775
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,550
- I made a mistake. - You have to let me go again.

1776
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,120
(Focusing with his eyes closed)

1777
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,120
(Smack)

1778
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,390
Gosh, wait! Wait, my sign...

1779
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:48,530
(Jae Seok was next to Seok Sam and got into trouble.)

1780
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,590
- Jee Seok Jin knocked my sign down! - This is hard.

1781
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,100
- He hit me! - I got it!

1782
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,630
No, wait.

1783
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,170
- Did I hit him? - I got it.

1784
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,770
- I got it right this time, but... - I got it, didn't I?

1785
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,340
- Jee Seok Jin knocked this down. - I'm sorry.

1786
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,740
(Jae Seok failed due to a natural disaster.)

1787
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,810
I'm sorry. It happened while I had my eyes closed.

1788
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,640
Haha and Se Chan, you get one point each.

1789
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,450
(In the end, only Haha and Se Chan get 1 point each.)

1790
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,640
- That's right. - You have to be quick.

1791
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,380
It goes "Boom, and."

1792
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,150
- Gosh, the timing... - This was...

1793
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,680
(Poking)

1794
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,880
Hey, that hurts!

1795
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,950
That hurts!

1796
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,820
Why are you hitting me? It hurts.

1797
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,290
(Jae Seok's childish revenge)

1798
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,490
That hurts!

1799
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,560
It really does hurt.

1800
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,060
(Everything is fascinating for these two.)

1801
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,790
Why are you hitting me?

1802
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,760
- Oh, it really does. - Now, the four in the back row.

1803
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,790
Here's your song.

1804
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,060
(The first song for those in the back)

1805
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,900
Ready, go.

1806
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,500
What is this?

1807
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,270
(What's this song?)

1808
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,970
- What is it? - What is this?

1809
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,240
When they sing, "Open your eyes," raise your sign...

1810
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,300
- on "Open." - It's "Super Star."

1811
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,880
("Super Star" by Jewelry)

1812
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,720
(Correct if you raise your sign on "Open")

1813
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,580
It's "Super Star."

1814
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,320
(Totally focused)

1815
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,490
Is this Jewelry's song?

1816
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,530
- Open your eyes - Oh, I got it.

1817
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,360
- Open your eyes - Oh, I got it.

1818
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,400
Only Ye Eun got it right.

1819
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,200
(Only Ye Eun had perfect timing.)

1820
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:57,870
What is this song?

1821
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,430
(Meanwhile)

1822
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,770
- It's hard. - We have to listen to this...

1823
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,340
(We should listen to the preview.)

1824
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,270
- We should listen to it before. - We should listen to this.

1825
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,710
(After all that big talk)

1826
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,810
You have to just do it. Just go for it.

1827
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,080
- We should listen to it once. - It's hard.

1828
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,280
(They decided to listen to the preview in the end.)

1829
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,010
- Okay, the bottom row. - Okay, it's us.

1830
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,110
- We'll let you hear it once. - Listen to it.

1831
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,420
(The people in the front row will listen to the preview first.)

1832
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,420
- We should listen to it. - Play.

1833
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,950
Gosh, what is this?

1834
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,090
- "Billie Jean." - "Billie Jean."

1835
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,920
("Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson)

1836
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,620
- Are we just listening or playing? - You can just listen.

1837
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,960
(Such a familiar intro)

1838
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,960
I love this song so much that I can do it right away.

1839
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,960
Signs up on "bam?"

1840
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,530
Raise your signs on "She."

1841
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,530
- Oh, is that not it? - No, it's not.

1842
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,800
You have to raise it on Billie Jean.

1843
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,840
- Isn't it on "bam?" - One, two, three.

1844
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,540
(They're all wrong.)

1845
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,370
No, you raise it on Billie Jean.

1846
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,880
- Isn't it on "bam?" - Signs up on "She."

1847
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,210
(Expecting difficulties even from the preview)

1848
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,340
Oh, on "She."

1849
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,950
- Oh, that wasn't it. - Oh, man.

1850
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,050
Okay.

1851
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,120
(One and, She)

1852
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,950
- Oh, that wasn't it. - Oh, man.

1853
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,150
- Okay. It's "And she." - Okay, I got it.

1854
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,590
(The key is to raise the sign exactly on "She.")

1855
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,190
- It's "And she." - Yes, it's "And she."

1856
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,390
- "And she." - All right.

1857
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,060
- This one is easy. - "And she."

1858
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,190
(He's talking big again.)

1859
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,660
- "And she." - This time, raise your signs.

1860
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,090
- "And she." - Again. Music, play.

1861
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,500
(Attacking in the meantime)

1862
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,330
Hey, that hurts!

1863
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,030
Why do you keep hitting me?

1864
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:07,200
(Who will get the confusing timing right?)

1865
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,800
Let's go.

1866
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,900
- Raise your signs this time. - Enjoy yourself now. Later on...

1867
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,300
Gosh, this is such a great song.

1868
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,080
Seok Jin, now.

1869
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,480
- One. - What?

1870
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,210
Isn't that it? What a relief.

1871
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,310
(Embarrassed)

1872
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,190
All right, here comes the melody.

1873
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,160
Once more.

1874
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:27,860
One more time.

1875
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,790
(The first lyrics are coming up.)

1876
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,430
Here it comes.

1877
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,290
(Will they be able to get it right?)

1878
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,060
- Okay! - I got it, didn't I?

1879
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,130
- Okay! - This is it!

1880
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,940
- Okay! - This is it!

1881
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,940
- I got it, didn't I? - I didn't...

1882
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,010
- Jae Seok got it right. - Okay!

1883
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,740
(Jae Seok raised his sign exactly on "She.")

1884
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,810
- Hey, why did you grab mine? - Okay.

1885
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,210
- Excuse me! - Jae Seok got it right.

1886
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,210
- Grasshopper raised my sign! - Okay!

1887
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,880
(Telling tales)

1888
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,510
(The whole story of his revenge)

1889
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,580
"And she."

1890
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,020
(Raising it for him)

1891
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,080
(Got it right by himself)

1892
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,080
- Okay! - I got it, didn't I?

1893
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,490
Hey, is cheating allowed or not?

1894
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,790
- It is. - We should've played this round.

1895
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,890
- We should've played this round. - I know.

1896
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,460
(Only Jae Seok earns 1 point.)

1897
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,060
Now, it's the back row.

1898
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,660
(The second question for those in the back.)

1899
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,960
- We'll play the song once. - Let us hear it. Okay.

1900
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,800
(First, the preview)

1901
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,800
Gosh, they're doomed.

1902
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,970
Gosh, this isn't easy.

1903
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,370
- Signs up on "3, 4?" - On "3, 4."

1904
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,770
(What's the song that perplexed them?)

1905
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,440
- You have to raise it on "3." - On "3?"

1906
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,180
("3! 4!" by Roo'Ra)

1907
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,120
(They have to guess the exact timing of the 3!)

1908
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,420
- Back row. It's on "3, 4." - All right.

1909
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,650
(Now, they're going to try for real.)

1910
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,220
Let's go! Okay! Let's do it!

1911
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,650
(He's talking big again.)

1912
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,320
- Music, play. - Show them...

1913
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,120
that it's hard for the old guys.

1914
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,690
Oh, what's this?

1915
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:41,530
(The youngsters don't know this song from 1996.)

1916
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,530
They played it earlier.

1917
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,730
- I don't remember. - Is this the original song?

1918
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,370
That hurts!

1919
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:52,870
(Will Jong Kook finally live up to his big talk?)

1920
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,940
Watch.

1921
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,450
From here...

1922
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,780
Three, four...

1923
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,690
No!

1924
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,120
- That's way too hard. - All of you were incorrect.

1925
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,530
- Gosh, that was hard. - Oh, how could this happen?

1926
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,790
Since I see others raising their signs,

1927
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:13,960
- I also... - You also...

1928
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,330
Kim Jong Kook.

1929
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,700
(Singer Kim was only humiliated.)

1930
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,500
- That was way too hard. - Oh, how could this happen?

1931
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,010
The five of you in the front row.

1932
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,970
(Next question is for the front row.)

1933
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,540
- Let's do this. - Here we go.

1934
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,740
Music, play.

1935
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,710
("We Will Rock You" by Queen)

1936
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,110
This is an easy one.

1937
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:31,880
(Front row scores, Seok Jin: 0, Jae Seok: 1, Ji Hyo: 0)

1938
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,980
(Haha: 1, Se Chan: 1)

1939
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,850
- Oh, no. - Got it!

1940
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,450
(Haha: 2)

1941
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,550
- Okay. - Only Haha got it.

1942
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,690
(In the front row, Haha takes the lead.)

1943
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,850
It's repeated twice.

1944
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,850
One, two, three, four, one...

1945
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,160
(In the back row, Jong Kook made a comeback.)

1946
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,890
- I was on point. - We all got it right.

1947
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,090
They all got it right.

1948
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,300
(Back row scores, Ye Eun: 2, Hye Yoon: 1, Lomon: 1, Jong Kook: 2)

1949
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,730
- I was totally on point. - We all got it right.

1950
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,560
Two points were scored...

1951
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,960
- by Jong Kook, - Right.

1952
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,600
- Haha, and Ye Eun. - Ye Eun.

1953
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,970
(Jong Kook, Haha, and Ye Eun receive the 1st-place benefit.)

1954
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,230
- Yes! - Hold on.

1955
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,800
You won the first-place benefit...

1956
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,800
- in the dice roll. - Right.

1957
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,040
Wait. Are we having noodles today?

1958
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,970
(They arrive somewhere at that moment.)

1959
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,470
Are we?

1960
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,740
- Kalguksu. - That looks good.

1961
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,380
(A kalguksu restaurant in Seongsu)

1962
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,140
They must offer jeon options too.

1963
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,510
I bet that jeon is good.

1964
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,310
- This will be good. - Jong Kook, Haha, and Ye Eun,

1965
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,850
(Jong Kook, Haha, and Ye Eun won the rhythm mission.)

1966
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,480
this is for winning the game on the road.

1967
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,950
- We're seated together. - Look at us.

1968
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:11,150
(They can choose whether to roll the dice.)

1969
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,020
- It's just us. - Who wants to roll the dice?

1970
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,020
- How many can we roll? - I should.

1971
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,860
The winning team will roll a die with only 1, 2, or 3 on it.

1972
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,060
I'll go first.

1973
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,230
(Jong Kook: 0 tails)

1974
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,390
Three is the maximum I can get.

1975
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,290
(Jong Kook will roll the dice.)

1976
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,760
- I need all three. - I don't know.

1977
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,930
Let's go!

1978
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,570
Three is better.

1979
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:26,970
- One. - Just one.

1980
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,840
(Just 1)

1981
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,700
- It doesn't go as planned. - You get one.

1982
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
One.
- Just one. - He's going at a slow pace.

1983
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,240
- He's moving slowly. - Jong Kook gets one.

1984
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
Mr. Muscle is moving slowly.

1985
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,080
(Ye Eun with 4 tails will also try.)

1986
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,980
Like it'll actually go according to your plan, Muscle.

1987
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,280
Mr. Muscle is moving slowly.

1988
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,710
(Ye Eun: 4 tails)

1989
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,450
- The game... - Ddochi?

1990
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,610
(How many tails do you have?)

1991
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,650
- How many do you have? - I...

1992
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,050
- I have 4, and 2 sounds good. - Here comes the giant.

1993
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,090
I'm too far behind to be satisfied with just one.

1994
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,750
She needs to roll a three.

1995
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,490
- Three! - Three.

1996
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,560
Please let it reset.

1997
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,190
- Two. - Two! I'm lucky today.

1998
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,560
(Ye Eun: 6 tails)

1999
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,260
- Two. - Two! I'm lucky today.

2000
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,860
(She gets 2, which is what she wanted.)

2001
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,760
- Ye Eun gets two. - Is it better...

2002
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:57,200
(Haha: 8 tails)

2003
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,370
Is it better to hit reset...

2004
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:59,370
or just get one at a time?

2005
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,400
(Contemplating)

2006
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,570
We still have two games left.

2007
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,600
- You only have one game left. - Just one?

2008
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,870
Then it's safer not to roll the dice right now.

2009
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,270
(Haha, who has 8 tails, will stay.)

2010
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,910
Who on the losing side wants to throw two dice?

2011
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,710
(The losing team can roll 2 dice numbered from 1 to 6.)

2012
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,410
- Me. - I should.

2013
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,950
I'll hit reset if I roll a seven.

2014
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,950
(Se Chan: 2 tails)

2015
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,050
(2-tailed fox Ssaebssaeb will roll the dice.)

2016
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,080
- I'll go. - Se Chan, go ahead.

2017
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,090
Here I go.

2018
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,690
Please, no.

2019
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,790
Seven!

2020
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,020
(Se Chan: 9 tails)

2021
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:20,890
That brings me to nine tails.

2022
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,960
(He's become a nine-tailed fox.)

2023
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,920
Seven! That brings me to nine tails.

2024
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,590
- Good. - Se Chan...

2025
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,860
(Will he be able to keep his 9 tails until the end?)

2026
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,690
- has nine tails. - Good.

2027
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,960
- Did you get nine tails? - I'm a nine-tailed fox now.

2028
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,560
I'd like about seven.

2029
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,660
(Jae Seok: 0 tails)

2030
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,400
(Jae Seok, who has no tail, rolls the dice.)

2031
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,770
- Let it be a five. - Do you have eight?

2032
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,400
Five and four. Five and three?

2033
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,900
- Seven. - Seven!

2034
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,540
(He rolled a 7 like he wanted.)

2035
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,570
- What? - That's perfect.

2036
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,540
(Jae Seok: 7 tails)

2037
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,570
- Seven. - Seven.

2038
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,010
(Even Jae Seok had a successful dice roll.)

2039
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,110
- That's perfect. - He got what he wanted.

2040
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,080
- I got seven just like I wanted. - That's great.

2041
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,380
Seok Jin, are you going to roll the dice?

2042
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,210
(4-tailed Seok Sam is contemplating.)

2043
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:42,910
I'm on the fence.

2044
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,810
Should I roll the dice or not?

2045
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,850
- Do it. Just go for it. - Should I?

2046
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,580
- Seok Jin. - Aren't you Chef Choi Kang Rok?

2047
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,050
- They look alike! - Seriously.

2048
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,760
- Chef Choi Kang Rok. - They look alike.

2049
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,860
- Chef Choi Kang Rok. - Braising Master.

2050
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,590
(What will Jee Kang Rok, the scared master, choose?)

2051
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,260
But with an extra die.

2052
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:01,730
(Seok Jin: 4 tails)

2053
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,090
Should I roll? Okay, then.

2054
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,530
Seok Jin, don't do it. You shouldn't.

2055
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,660
Of course you should.

2056
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,370
- I need less than five. - Of course.

2057
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,630
(If he has more than 9 tails, it'll be reset.)

2058
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,430
Wait, not five.

2059
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,900
- It'll be over if you go over five. - You should take a chance.

2060
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,270
- You grabbed the die. - I won't do it.

2061
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,440
(Scared)

2062
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,070
- You should go for it. - Come on.

2063
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,440
- Seok Jin, come on. - Jee Seok Jin!

2064
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,840
- That's it. - Jee Seok Jin!

2065
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,110
- Does this make me look cool? - You should do it.

2066
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,080
(Does taking on the challenge make me look cool?)

2067
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,410
- You look cool. - A 2 and 3, 2 and 2, or 1 and 2.

2068
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,710
(The gullible Seok Sam tries.)

2069
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,480
- Let's go! - Go ahead.

2070
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,680
- Let's go! - Go ahead.

2071
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,320
(He'll hit the reset button if he gets more than 6!)

2072
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,520
- Let's watch. - One and two.

2073
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,120
- Five? - He has nine.

2074
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,650
You rolled a 5 and a 4.

2075
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,590
(And 4)

2076
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,690
Boom!

2077
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,560
(Seok Sam's tails are reset.)

2078
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:26,960
- He hit reset. - Boom!

2079
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,190
Five and four.

2080
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,220
Why did I roll the dice?

2081
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,030
- I thought three was the maximum. - Why did you do it?

2082
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,690
I thought three was the maximum.

2083
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,000
(Shameless)

2084
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,260
- Why did you roll them? - Why did I roll the dice?

2085
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,500
Were you using the same dice as us?

2086
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,830
(Were you using the same dice as us?)

2087
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,900
You shouldn't have done it then.

2088
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,770
- Why did you do it? - Don't say that.

2089
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:43,270
(Persuaded by Jae Seok, he has 0 tails now.)

2090
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:41,800
- Why did you roll them? - It's fine.

2091
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,670
- Why did you roll them, Seok Jin? - A lot of them have zero tails.

2092
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,740
- That's right. - I don't have any.

2093
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,010
(Hye Yoon and Ji Hyo rolled the dice and lost all their tails as well.)

2094
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,180
- Anyway, we're at a restaurant. - Right.

2095
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,280
(The perfect dishes for the old foxes)

2096
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,150
The menu was picked to satisfy the old foxes' tastes.

2097
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,010
Kalguksu with seasonal surf clams...

2098
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,380
(Surf clam kalguksu in a rich broth)

2099
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,750
- is what you'll be having. - That sounds great.

2100
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:54,850
Surf clams? The broth will be good.

2101
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,020
(And crispy seafood scallion jeon)

2102
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,150
- That sounds good. - That sounds delicious.

2103
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,050
Seafood and scallion jeon and surf clam soup.

2104
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,150
I've been craving kalguksu lately.

2105
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,560
- Ji Hyo, remember how I wanted pho? - Pho?

2106
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,460
However,

2107
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,830
the meal isn't free.

2108
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,960
(There's no way they can enjoy the food without having the price.)

2109
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,200
- Then what? - Do we pay using our tails?

2110
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,360
A tail is worth ten dollars.

2111
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,600
Yes!

2112
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,070
Oh, no. I'm broke.

2113
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,640
- No! - They're broke.

2114
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,040
(Those with no tails will have to starve.)

2115
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,570
- Why did I gamble? - They're broke.

2116
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:17,940
Look at my tails.

2117
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,610
(Those with many tails are thrilled.)

2118
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,540
My tails.

2119
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,540
(Wild twerking)

2120
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,110
I'm rich!

2121
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,210
(An 8-tailed fox)

2122
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,020
- Why did I gamble? - I have one.

2123
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,220
- Nice. - It's ten dollars a tail.

2124
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,020
(They can pay with tails to order food now.)

2125
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,150
Hand in your tails and place your orders.

2126
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,790
You forced me into rolling the dice, so get me a bowl of kalguksu.

2127
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,420
- What... - Get me a bowl!

2128
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,790
(He asks him to pay for him out of nowhere.)

2129
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,130
I only rolled the dice because you egged me on.

2130
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,500
- Get me a bowl. - Why me?

2131
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,400
- Pay for mine. - Ddochi, pay up.

2132
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,470
- Ddochi, pay up. - Pay up already.

2133
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,140
- Why? - Pay up!

2134
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,740
It's your fault for choosing to roll.

2135
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,170
Hurry. Ddochi, come on.

2136
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,480
(He's already lost it.)

2137
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,140
Bucktooth, you.

2138
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,680
Get me a bowl of kalguksu.

2139
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,010
(He bullies everyone.)

2140
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,780
Get me a bowl.

2141
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,180
Dance for me then.

2142
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,720
- Something youthful. - Something youthful.

2143
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,480
Seok Jin, do this.

2144
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,690
Dance to "Where You At" by ALLDAY PROJECT.

2145
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:05,750
- I don't know the song. - We'll...

2146
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,690
(They ask Young Sixty to show the newest dance.)

2147
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,660
- Just get me a bowl. - We'll play the music for you.

2148
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,160
- I'll play "One More Time." - How do you dance to that?

2149
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,590
(By ALLDAY PROJECT)

2150
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,330
Like this.

2151
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,400
Baby, one more time

2152
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,360
("One More Time" released in 2008)

2153
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,730
Just don't.

2154
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,600
(The music plays.)

2155
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,300
- Here we go. - Baby, one more time?

2156
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,840
(A hot new song that's way too young for Seok Sam)

2157
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:24,140
(Will he be able to pull it off?)

2158
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,040
What do you mean I should dance?

2159
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,310
Show us.

2160
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,040
(Turning on the engine)

2161
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,680
Bring it!

2162
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,350
Bring it. ALLDAY PROJECT.

2163
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,850
Did he say Old Project?

2164
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,150
Yes!

2165
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,920
One more time.

2166
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,290
One more time.

2167
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:45,460
(Boldly mixing Jewelry's dance move to ALLDAY PROJECT's song)

2168
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,800
- Just to eat lunch. - All this for one tail.

2169
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,170
At the age of 60...

2170
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,970
- As if this is worth it. - Just to get a tail.

2171
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,230
As if this is worth it.

2172
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,470
(He sways mindlessly to the beat just for a bowl of kalguksu.)

2173
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,070
Nice. You know how to move.

2174
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,270
Look. He's bringing out his moves.

2175
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,840
(It's the Bongsan Mask Dance, not ALLDAY PROJECT.)

2176
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,410
Seok Jin, that's enough.

2177
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,610
(A fascinating sight)

2178
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,840
Do this for us.

2179
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,810
(The performance grows more dynamic.)

2180
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,650
(He gave it his all.)

2181
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,980
All this for just one tail.

2182
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,050
Give him one already.

2183
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,590
(Following Seok Sam who tore up the stage,)

2184
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,090
Go for it.

2185
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,290
(Lady Song joins the battle.)

2186
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,860
- Nice! - Go, Mom!

2187
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,130
(She aims for the win with a classic 90s gun dance.)

2188
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,060
Go, Mom!

2189
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,200
- Go, Mom! - Go, Mom!

2190
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,800
Did we really have to dance just to eat lunch?

2191
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,600
(Suddenly mad)

2192
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:26,530
(Touched by their dancing, Se Chan gives them a tail each.)

2193
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,600
I'll pay for Ji Hyo's. Kalguksu, right?

2194
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,840
Hye Yoon, what will it be?

2195
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,040
(Hye Yoon with no tails also comes out.)

2196
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,170
- Me? - Yes.

2197
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,570
(Anticipating)

2198
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,140
- Who's buying? - Name one you can dance to.

2199
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,340
Girls’ Generation sounds great. I'll dance to "Gee."

2200
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,180
- Nice. - "Gee?" Hold on.

2201
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,250
- Ddochi, she's dancing to "Gee." - No, don't.

2202
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,050
She's been sitting here swaying to the beat.

2203
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,350
(The dancing machine was constantly swaying.)

2204
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,520
- Seriously. - Get out there.

2205
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,590
- Why were you swaying like that? - Come on.

2206
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:44,820
- Go on. - Hurry out there.

2207
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,760
(The Girls' Generation fan joins in, pretending she doesn't want to.)

2208
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,850
- Oh, no. - Come on.

2209
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,260
- It's "Gee." - Ye Eun wouldn't stop swaying.

2210
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,890
- It's true. - We can both dance to "Gee."

2211
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,930
("Gee" by Girls' Generation)

2212
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,430
Hye Yoon is tiny and adorable.

2213
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,330
You're dancing to "So pretty it's blinding."

2214
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,730
"So pretty it's blinding."

2215
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,070
(The Girls’ Generation fan takes over from the intro.)

2216
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,300
(Flustered)

2217
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,740
She would've cried if we hadn't told her to dance.

2218
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,640
- It's blinding - Blinding!

2219
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,640
(Ye Eun shows how it's done...)

2220
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,480
Let's go!

2221
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,510
(while Hye Yoon remains shy.)

2222
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,880
- Let's go! - Gee, gee, gee, gee

2223
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,250
Baby, baby, baby

2224
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,250
- Gee, gee, gee, gee - That's the move, right?

2225
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,150
(Cheering)

2226
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,660
She's great at this.

2227
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,490
Gee, gee, gee, gee

2228
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,790
Baby, baby, baby

2229
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,090
Gee, gee, gee, gee

2230
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,330
Kim Hye Yoon!

2231
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,800
Kim Hye Yoon!

2232
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,900
(Hesitant)

2233
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,530
(Flapping)

2234
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,370
Hye Yoon, you're so precious!

2235
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,370
It's like she's dancing with a giant.

2236
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,770
- Kim Hye Yoon! - My heart is racing

2237
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,800
(The tall girl with ghost-like long hair...)

2238
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,240
Look at her.

2239
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,970
(leads the dance performance.)

2240
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,110
- What are you doing? - You fool

2241
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,870
(Excited)

2242
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,480
As my eyes are on you

2243
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,940
(It's the highlight now.)

2244
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,550
- "So pretty." - So pretty it's blinding

2245
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,980
- "So pretty." - It's blinding!

2246
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,680
So pretty it's blinding

2247
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,850
No, no, no, no, no

2248
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,950
(Hye Yoon finally loosens up.)

2249
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,190
- Nice. - You're no match for her.

2250
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,450
Hye Yoon's way cuter!

2251
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,860
Out of the way, you giant!

2252
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,890
The Undertaker, step aside!

2253
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,660
(The uncle fans are cheering aggressively.)

2254
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,590
- "Gee" is supposed to be cute. - Move!

2255
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,960
- You're scaring us. - Move!

2256
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,330
(The 2-member girl group's debut performance...)

2257
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,760
Hey, 2m giant, move out of the way.

2258
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,300
(was successful.)

2259
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,170
- Giant, out of the way. - Nice!

2260
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,070
- Good job. - That was great.

2261
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,900
- Nicely done. - I loved it.

2262
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,740
(Let's eat now.)

2263
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,210
- Go, Ye Eun. - You did it.

2264
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:11,940
- Nice. - Good job, Ye Eun.

2265
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,110
Aren't you Soo Young?

2266
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,810
- Yes, I'm Soo Young. - That's right.

2267
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,480
- And you must be Sunny. - I am.

2268
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,310
- You're looking good. - Nice.

2269
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,280
(Haha gifts Hye Yoon a tail for her performance.)

2270
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,020
I'll pay for Hye Yoon's kalguksu.

2271
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,420
- Please bring in the food. - Unbelievable.

2272
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,890
(Each of them paid with tails to order.)

2273
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,990
This will taste amazing.

2274
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,020
(It's time to eat.)

2275
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,590
- That looks great. - The kalguksu looks great.

2276
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,190
Check out this kalguksu.

2277
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,690
This looks amazing!

2278
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,930
(Kalguksu with a generous amount of surf clams)

2279
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,790
Kalguksu is my favorite.

2280
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,430
- I'll enjoy. - I'll enjoy.

2281
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,160
(And spicy, crispy seafood and scallion jeon!)

2282
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,230
- This looks so good. - This looks amazing.

2283
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,030
- Over there. - Let's share.

2284
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,170
- We'll pay for this. - Sure.

2285
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,330
I'll enjoy.

2286
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:44,810
(It suits the noodle lover's palate.)

2287
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,100
I haven't had kalguksu in a while.

2288
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,670
No way. This kalguksu...

2289
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,040
The noodles are nice and chewy.

2290
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,910
- What is this place? - Unbelievable.

2291
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,310
- No way. - Look at all these clams.

2292
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,810
(Exclaiming)

2293
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,950
- My gosh. - These are mulchong clams...

2294
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,920
(Hye Yoon takes a bite, hungry from all the dancing.)

2295
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,250
also known as surf clams.

2296
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,820
This is good.

2297
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,050
Gosh, this is good.

2298
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,260
They serve generous portions.

2299
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,330
The kimchi is delicious.

2300
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,330
The scallion jeon is like pizza.

2301
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,030
(Glancing)

2302
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,160
The scallion jeon...

2303
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,200
- Take it all. - Hold on. Lomon.

2304
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,600
- Yes? - I see...

2305
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,700
two scallion jeons on that table.

2306
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,770
Of course.

2307
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,510
No, don't. That's ours!

2308
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,640
I was just asking.

2309
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:21,110
(Proudly)

2310
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,540
Lomon, don't you think two of those...

2311
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,810
are too much for the three of you?

2312
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,350
- Even they have some. - Don't.

2313
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:29,920
(Paid with Jae Seok and Se Chan's tails, paid with Lomon's tail)

2314
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,520
We're the only table without any.

2315
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,720
- What should I do? - Just eat.

2316
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,090
- Just enjoy your meal. - Jong Kook.

2317
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,890
We paid for all our food,

2318
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,390
- while he's freeloading. - Exactly.

2319
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,960
Do you want me to take that kalguksu away?

2320
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,230
(If you keep going)

2321
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,690
Lomon, I'm just asking what you think.

2322
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,860
(Persistent)

2323
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,430
There are three tables. Hear me out.

2324
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,900
There are three tables.

2325
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,270
One, two, three.

2326
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,670
There are three scallion jeons,

2327
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,900
but two of them are on your table. How is that not weird?

2328
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,710
(He's doing his best to persuade him.)

2329
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,710
There isn't any on this table.

2330
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,170
- That seems odd. - Look at Hye Yoon.

2331
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,270
She still hasn't had any scallion jeon.

2332
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,980
- Give her some of ours. - We'll give her some. Go ahead.

2333
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,910
Not saying anything is how you get to eat.

2334
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,180
- Hye Yoon, go ahead. - Right.

2335
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:01,880
(Secretively)

2336
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,880
Grab some and pass it to me.

2337
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,690
(He changes his target to Hye Yoon.)

2338
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,790
- Sure. - Get me some.

2339
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:05,290
Can I...

2340
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,490
Can I have about a quarter of this?

2341
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,160
(Obedient)

2342
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,820
Take only what you can eat.

2343
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,430
(Strict)

2344
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,830
Right.

2345
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,930
Get some.

2346
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,130
Here.

2347
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,460
Right, thanks.

2348
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,600
(Glancing)

2349
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,570
- Pass it along. - What is it?

2350
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,130
Place it in my bowl.

2351
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,670
(Secretively)

2352
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,800
Chuck that in here.

2353
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,270
- Goodness. - Oh, dear.

2354
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,040
(He eventually gets some by persuading the sweet Hye Yoon.)

2355
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,810
- Are you okay? - Hye Yoon, come on.

2356
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:28,140
- How could you drop that? - I dropped it.

2357
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,010
- I'm not very good with chopsticks. - Oh, my.

2358
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,110
(Taking care of Hye Yoon in the same way)

2359
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,650
- Oh, dear. - I'm so clumsy.

2360
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,850
- Enjoy. - Thanks, Hye Yoon. Thanks to you...

2361
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,950
Thanks to you...

2362
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,590
(Ssaebssaeb's interception)

2363
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:42,490
Mister, are you trying to eat for free?

2364
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,160
We paid hard-earned tails for this.

2365
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,760
It was almost in my mouth.

2366
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,560
(Disappointed)

2367
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,730
- Gosh, that Choi Kang Rok... - Hey, Hye Yoon dropped that.

2368
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,200
- No, you can't have it, mister. - What do you think you're doing?

2369
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:55,240
(They all ate according to their tails.)

2370
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,270
- It's so good. - It's good.

2371
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,900
- Seok Jin. - Darn it.

2372
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,170
Just eat.

2373
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,110
(Number of tails)

2374
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,270
- I don't get to have any. - There's so much green onion jeon.

2375
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,270
I know, right?

2376
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,580
Get a good look at Lomon now while you can.

2377
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,740
(They're heading to the next location with full stomachs.)

2378
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,540
He will become a huge star because of his drama with Hye Yoon,

2379
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,080
- you know? - Of course.

2380
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:06,180
(The hot drama, "No Tail to Tell")

2381
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,080
- Don't forget about us, Lomon. - Of course.

2382
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,820
Don't forget about us, Lomon.

2383
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,420
(Don't forget us.)

2384
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,450
Lomon, be honest.

2385
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,720
Who did you want to meet in person when you came on Running Man?

2386
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:15,090
(Which member did he want to meet the most?)

2387
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,790
- Me? I wanted to see everyone, - Yes.

2388
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,930
but I wanted to see Haha and you, Jong Kook.

2389
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,960
- Really? - I love working out so much.

2390
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,600
- Oh, you like working out? - I love working out.

2391
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,360
- You're such a manly man. - He likes working out.

2392
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,970
- But Lomon, Haha doesn't work out. - Pardon?

2393
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:26,730
(Jealous)

2394
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,870
- Haha doesn't work out. - Come on. I work out.

2395
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,270
He's very famous in my neighborhood.

2396
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,970
- Oh, is he? - Haha?

2397
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,870
A shining graduate of Osan Middle School.

2398
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:34,010
- He used to steal bikes, right? - Was he famous for being short?

2399
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,680
Not bikes. Antenna.

2400
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,740
Is that so?

2401
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,110
(Haha)

2402
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,150
(Out of nowhere)

2403
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,650
Punch in your number.

2404
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,320
Punch in your number.

2405
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,590
I can't stand the sight of you.

2406
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,160
- Call if you're bored in Hongdae. - My goodness.

2407
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:47,560
(He'll never meet another fan.)

2408
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,760
If you like working out, I might ask for your number too.

2409
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,760
(He joins in to get his number.)

2410
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:54,160
- Ye Eun. Should I give him yours? - Add contact.

2411
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,760
I have Lomon's number.

2412
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,470
(Ddochi has Lomon's number?)

2413
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,430
- Why do you have his number? - You have Lomon's number?

2414
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,070
- Yes! - Why do you have it?

2415
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,270
- Why do you have that? - Did you ask him earlier?

2416
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,440
- No. - During the break?

2417
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,540
I think I have it.

2418
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,270
- I think you do. - What? Lomon, what happened?

2419
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,980
- I think I do. - Yes, I'll check.

2420
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,580
Wait, what? Have you seen each other before?

2421
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:11,750
(Everyone is baffled by their friendship.)

2422
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,750
- We have met before. - When?

2423
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,080
- Oh, really? - Before.

2424
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,550
- Don't lie, Ji Ye Eun. - Really?

2425
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:15,780
- The second time was... - For real?

2426
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,990
- Haha, you know... - Haha, if you save him under Park,

2427
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,690
you won't be able to find Lomon's number later.

2428
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:21,220
(She really has his number.)

2429
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:19,720
- Is that right? - It is.

2430
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,490
- He has my number. - Hey, how do you have it?

2431
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,960
We know each other.

2432
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,090
- How did you get to know him? - Lomon, how did this...

2433
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,290
She's friends with my older sister.

2434
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,500
- Really? - Lomon is...

2435
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,660
She's friends with my older sister.

2436
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,870
- Really? - Lomon is like my little brother.

2437
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,170
- For real? - Big sister.

2438
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,700
(They even high-five.)

2439
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,170
Lomon!

2440
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,870
- What? Why, all of a sudden? - Seriously?

2441
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,140
- Why didn't you say this sooner? - Why are you saying this now?

2442
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,070
- Lomon was born in 1997, - Yes.

2443
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,410
(It's hard to believe they're acquainted.)

2444
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,280
and he's like my little brother.

2445
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:42,440
(How did that happen?)

2446
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,980
- But how did you get to know him? - Oh, really?

2447
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,110
How do you know him?

2448
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,250
Who did I meet you through?

2449
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,020
- Wasn't it because of work? - Don't you remember?

2450
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,280
Was it while she was chasing after Kang Hoon?

2451
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,750
- Ga I. - Oh, you're right.

2452
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,990
- Kang Hoon? - Is it through Kang Hoon?

2453
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,290
- Kang Hoon. - No, Kang Hoon doesn't know him.

2454
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,020
- Who? - Ga I.

2455
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,630
- She shot a drama with him. - Ga I.

2456
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,490
- Yoon Ga I. - Yoon Ga I.

2457
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,600
(Both of them know Yoon Ga I.)

2458
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,460
- Ga I. - I shot a drama with her before.

2459
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,170
We met up once like... We had a blind date back then.

2460
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,230
- What are you saying? - What?

2461
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,570
- Hey, Lomon! - We had a blind date back then.

2462
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,900
(They even had a blind date?)

2463
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,740
- What are you saying? - Hey, Lomon!

2464
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,210
- Hey, who are you? - Hey!

2465
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,340
(Shocked)

2466
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,510
- Why did you hide it? - Hey, what are you...

2467
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,010
- What is this? - Ji Ye Eun, what is this?

2468
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,410
- Ye Eun, don't you remember? - What's wrong with him?

2469
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,080
- What are you doing? - What's wrong with him?

2470
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,410
- I'm kind of upset. - Is this true?

2471
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,580
Hey, close your mouth.

2472
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,320
(Ddochi is flustered for real.)

2473
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,320
- What? - "Close your mouth?"

2474
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:26,020
(What on earth is the relationship between them?)

2475
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,420
- You had a blind date with Lomon? - Her face is red!

2476
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,750
- I mean, what... - Her face is bright red.

2477
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,320
- Ye Eun. - Oh, Lomon...

2478
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,020
(Deep dimples)

2479
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,160
- Wait, what... - Did you meet as a group?

2480
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,330
- Yes, we met as a group. - But did you two grow closer?

2481
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,160
(They met with many people.)

2482
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:34,300
- Within the group? - Car the garden was there.

2483
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,230
There's a game called Avatar Blind Date.

2484
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,740
(They did a blind date skit for fun.)

2485
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,300
- We just did that for fun. - Yes, for fun.

2486
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,530
Avatar Blind Date.

2487
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,900
Ji Ye Eun was rejected, right?

2488
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:44,140
(Pretending to know)

2489
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,700
Kind of like the Truth Game.

2490
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,010
- I don't think that's what it is. - So, Ye Eun and Lomon...

2491
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,410
(Glaring)

2492
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,740
- went on a blind date. - We didn't go on a blind date.

2493
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,710
- The Truth Game? - It's different from Truth Game.

2494
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,710
Kind of like the King Game.

2495
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,010
(Whenever he says something, he refutes.)

2496
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,410
- It sounds totally different. - Very different.

2497
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:54,120
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2498
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,750
- They're so childish, aren't they? - Yes.

2499
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,490
- They're really childish. - Hey, that hurts.

2500
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,990
- We're here. - We're really childish, right?

2501
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:02,020
(They arrive at the next location in no time as they bicker childishly.)

2502
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,030
Let's have some coffee.

2503
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,460
(A table with desserts welcomes the members.)

2504
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,930
I bet we have to pay with our tails again.

2505
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,660
- Okay. - We have to pay for it again.

2506
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,500
(Covering his mouth)

2507
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,830
Gosh, look at this.

2508
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:11,230
- I want this one! The green tea! - I want this.

2509
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,400
I won't get to eat again.

2510
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,040
Hey, the smell of iced Americano is just...

2511
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,370
(Gulping)

2512
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,070
- I can't hold myself back. - Okay!

2513
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,100
- I have to buy this. - This one.

2514
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,310
Hey, don't we have to pay for these?

2515
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,410
(Don't we have to pay with our tails just like earlier?)

2516
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:21,840
Yes. Earlier, we catered to the tastes of old foxes...

2517
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:25,180
(They had kalguksu for lunch, which was old foxes' cup of tea.)

2518
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,150
- and ate at a kalguksu restaurant. - Yes.

2519
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,710
This is a cafe that sells...

2520
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,180
(This time, they came to a cafe...)

2521
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:30,590
the popular matcha desserts that Gen Z likes.

2522
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,820
(known for its matcha dessert for the younger foxes.)

2523
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,850
- I can have matcha. - Ye Eun.

2524
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,320
(Sweet and bitter beverages and cakes,)

2525
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:32,850
- It looks so good. - Is this...

2526
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,760
(which make a perfect dessert)

2527
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,520
I want this one. The latte.

2528
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,890
I want this one the most.

2529
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:38,590
- It's matcha. - It's cool.

2530
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:41,400
But just like before,

2531
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,130
(Of course, it's not free.)

2532
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,970
- for one tail, - Please.

2533
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:44,970
you get one item from the menu.

2534
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,500
- Come on! - Please!

2535
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,940
- We need something in between! - I used mine all up earlier!

2536
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,940
(Those with no tails are devastated.)

2537
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,840
- I don't have any left now. - Let us earn some tails.

2538
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,610
Yes, it's unfortunate for those who don't have any, but...

2539
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,640
(The dancers will have to starve again.)

2540
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,880
You should let us earn some!

2541
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:56,210
(He has 0 tails after having lunch.)

2542
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,880
Gosh, we have to use more of these?

2543
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,910
- There was nothing in between. - I know.

2544
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,710
- Then, I should have 2 things. - I should have 2 as well.

2545
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:59,710
- My gosh. - Come on.

2546
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,280
(Meanwhile, those rich in tails are laid back.)

2547
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:00,980
Eat. Just eat first.

2548
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,050
I want any one of these.

2549
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,680
These are all sweet, right?

2550
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,890
- Then, an unsweetened one... - Why not?

2551
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,190
(He pays 2 tails out of 5 for a dessert.)

2552
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:08,020
I'll take two. An unsweetened one...

2553
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,690
You know this, right?

2554
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,560
(With tails, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.)

2555
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,130
- Come on. Give me one. - Why?

2556
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,390
An unsweetened one with this.

2557
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,760
Gosh, I spent too much.

2558
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:19,300
(Those with 0 tails want to eat in any way possible.)

2559
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,600
Oh, my gosh.

2560
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,030
- I really won't eat. - Why did I do that earlier?

2561
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,970
Should I dance again? I'll dance.

2562
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,970
- An iced Americano? - Just buy me a coffee.

2563
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:26,570
(Hye Yoon with 0 tails should earn one again.)

2564
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:26,610
- I mean, do I have to dance again? - Hey.

2565
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,380
- Ddochi. - You won't be able to eat this.

2566
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,980
- Can't you buy me this? - No, I can't.

2567
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,050
Why not?

2568
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:36,180
(He pleaded with his daughter but failed.)

2569
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,920
- An unsweetened one... - No, I can't.

2570
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,580
Give me a cup of coffee. Mister.

2571
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,020
- A cup of coffee. - Mister, how many do you have?

2572
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:39,820
(How many tails do you have?)

2573
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,750
- What? Why? - How many do you have, mister?

2574
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,050
- You have a lot. - You have so many. Mister!

2575
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:41,690
Mister. Buy me a cup of coffee.

2576
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,190
(Acting like a gangster)

2577
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:42,690
You're basically stealing from me.

2578
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,230
- No, you can't. - Don't move.

2579
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,990
(The gangster fox gets started.)

2580
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,660
- Just buy me one. - I'm not giving you any.

2581
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,200
Gosh, right now, this is...

2582
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,560
- Look at his face. - I mean...

2583
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,100
Can't you just buy me a cup of coffee?

2584
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,800
(Shameless)

2585
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,570
- But... - Can't you even buy me a coffee?

2586
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,700
(Widening his eyes)

2587
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,100
Why are you suddenly asking me to buy it for you?

2588
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,870
- Gosh, this... - Buy me one.

2589
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:58,970
- Buy me one. - Buy me one.

2590
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,980
(Hye Yoon joins in.)

2591
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:00,910
- Just give me one. - What's up with you, Hye Yoon?

2592
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,410
- Buy one for Hye Yoon. - Buy me one.

2593
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,610
(She quickly picked up bad habits.)

2594
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,150
- Buy me one. - Buy me one now.

2595
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:08,850
(While the threat-like begging is ongoing)

2596
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:05,210
Buy me a coffee.

2597
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:08,020
- Hey, hurry up and get your own. - What?

2598
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,380
- Lomon. - Yes?

2599
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,290
Please buy me a cup of coffee.

2600
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:14,620
- A cup of coffee? - Yes. Lomon.

2601
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:18,330
(A 2nd request to Lomon, who could be his son)

2602
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,230
- This guy has a good... Lomon. - Yes?

2603
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,560
Buy me one!

2604
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,330
(Glancing)

2605
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,130
I want to surprise those guys.

2606
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,830
- I'm not going to. - I mean...

2607
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,200
(The good son gives him a tail in the end.)

2608
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,760
- Just one. Thanks. - Oh, indeed.

2609
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,800
(An excited laugh)

2610
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,770
- Here you go. Lomon gave me one. - Oh, I know.

2611
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:28,940
(Happy)

2612
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,510
Buy me one with Antenna's tail.

2613
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,910
(Meanwhile, they were trying extort them.)

2614
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,570
"Antenna's tail?"

2615
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,810
- Just buy him one. - I mean...

2616
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,410
- Buy me one! - Why are you all...

2617
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:39,880
(He might tear off all their tails if they don't pay for him.)

2618
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:36,810
- How many do you have, Jae Seok? - Please buy me one!

2619
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,410
- Buy me one. - Please buy me one.

2620
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,980
- What's up with you, Hye Yoon? - I mean...

2621
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,420
- Buy one for Hye Yoon. - I have five.

2622
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,850
- One for Jong Kook... - Buy me one now.

2623
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,220
- Buy me one. - I'll give one to Jong Kook.

2624
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,250
- Let me give him one. Here. - Buy me one.

2625
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:47,790
(He ends up giving one of his tails to the thug.)

2626
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,260
- Yes! - I'll give you one.

2627
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,920
See? How nice is that?

2628
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,020
- I had no other way. - All right. Here.

2629
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,930
I'll have an iced Americano.

2630
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,230
I'll stop Haha for you.

2631
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,360
(He'll protect him in return.)

2632
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,900
- Okay. Got it. - Thank you. Please remember me.

2633
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,600
- Oh, okay. Of course. - That loser.

2634
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,530
(He lashes out at Haha.)

2635
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,800
Okay, that loser.

2636
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,170
- That loser. - Gosh, this is delicious.

2637
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,130
(He doesn't care.)

2638
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,940
- First, I'll take a coffee. - Hye Yoon wants one.

2639
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,510
(They buy one for others and get a drink for themselves.)

2640
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,100
Se Chan gave me one.

2641
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,010
- One for you? - Yes, it's for me.

2642
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,110
Then, Hye Yoon can have one.

2643
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:09,010
(Jae Seok gives Hye Yoon one of his tails.)

2644
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,880
- Oh, thank you. - Yes, Hye Yoon.

2645
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,250
- Pay me back. - I'll also take a coffee.

2646
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,450
- Okay. Ye Eun, I'll take yours. - Me too. Yes.

2647
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:16,120
(Ye Eun also pays tails and orders for herself and Ji Hyo.)

2648
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,220
- I'll take a coffee. - Ye Eun took a coffee.

2649
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,220
You have too many.

2650
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,120
- I'm trying to hold back. - I still have three.

2651
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,520
We never know what might happen later on.

2652
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:22,460
(He didn't order a drink for himself to keep his tails for later.)

2653
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,690
I should hold on to four, at least.

2654
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,790
- All right, Ddochi. I get it. - Yes, I bought her one.

2655
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,130
- We all bought one for others. - Hey, but mister.

2656
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,500
- What? - You don't have any tails.

2657
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,160
(You don't have any tails.)

2658
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,460
- Where do you keep getting stuff? - Lomon bought it for me?

2659
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:32,370
- Lomon says he wanted to meet me. - Really?

2660
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,200
(Lying)

2661
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,970
Hey, but Lomon is such a softie,

2662
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,500
- so you keep sticking to him. - I know.

2663
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,740
- Thank you. - This blowfly.

2664
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,310
My little brother, Lomon.

2665
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,510
What?

2666
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,310
(They're bickering again.)

2667
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:44,850
The blowfly and this pumpkin fruit fly are stuck together...

2668
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,910
What fly?

2669
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:47,580
- What's wrong? - What?

2670
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,720
- Stuck together... - What fly?

2671
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,790
(Seok Sam suddenly falls back?)

2672
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,390
- What's wrong? - What?

2673
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:53,620
- Oh, dear. - Oh, man.

2674
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,690
What's wrong with you, Seok Jin?

2675
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,020
(He banged the back of his head against the wall.)

2676
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,630
- Hey, mister! - Oh, dear.

2677
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,690
(Shouting)

2678
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,490
What's wrong with you?

2679
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,700
(What's wrong with him?)

2680
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,300
- Seriously, what's wrong with you? - I'm okay.

2681
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,870
- Gosh, Seok Jin... - You moved my chair, didn't you?

2682
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,800
- You little! - Seok Jin, are you okay?

2683
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,870
(Jong Kook pulled his chair, which is an old prank.)

2684
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,800
Are you okay?

2685
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,200
Gosh, here.

2686
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,600
- Goodness, that scared me. - Are you okay?

2687
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,210
(Father Jee is fine.)

2688
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,940
- I'm okay. - Gosh, our dear brother...

2689
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,770
- Hey, what is this? Stone? - Are you okay?

2690
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,110
- No, it's not. - No.

2691
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:16,680
(It made a loud noise because the wall was plywood.)

2692
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,480
- It's not. - It's just plywood.

2693
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,680
Help him out.

2694
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,580
- Gosh, you little... - Are you really okay?

2695
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,510
(Feeling sorry and embarrassed)

2696
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:22,850
Hey, buy him one. You have enough tails.

2697
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,320
- Hey, you. - What did you say?

2698
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,790
Buy him one. I bought a lot for others.

2699
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:26,890
I...

2700
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,120
I used eight tails.

2701
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,160
(Buy me this!)

2702
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,690
I think I'll be okay if I eat this.

2703
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,090
- He even bumped his head. - I mean...

2704
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,060
(It hurts.)

2705
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,860
Seok Jin just fell over!

2706
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,030
- He fell over! - Buy me one!

2707
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,870
(Jong Kook joins in because he feels sorry.)

2708
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,030
- Buy him one! - Why won't you?

2709
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,100
- Come on! - He's in pain!

2710
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,670
- He fell over! - Buy him one!

2711
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,500
I got wobbly because I didn't eat this!

2712
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,570
- How many do you have? Four? - I only have four.

2713
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:45,170
(I only have 4 tails.)

2714
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,410
- If only you hadn't tempted me, - I have three.

2715
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:47,240
- I wouldn't have rolled the dice. - You should use one.

2716
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,980
- Buy him one! - Buy it for him!

2717
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:51,310
- But he fell over by himself. - He fell over!

2718
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,950
- He fell over by himself. - He fell.

2719
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:55,880
No, he fell over because I moved his chair!

2720
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:58,420
(Shouting out a confession)

2721
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,790
Then, you should buy it for him!

2722
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,490
(Shameless)

2723
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,620
I don't have any! How can I buy him anything?

2724
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,160
(There you go.)

2725
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:03,960
Hey, go and get one.

2726
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,030
- Hurry up. - I don't have any! Give it here!

2727
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:07,030
(He's highly reliable when he's on your side.)

2728
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,030
- I mean... - Hurry up and pay!

2729
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,130
- Seok Jin is in pain! - Are you a thug?

2730
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,200
Yes, I'm a thug!

2731
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,200
The strong guy being younger...

2732
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,930
- Is that right? - Yes.

2733
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:16,240
(He gives him a tail in the end.)

2734
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,040
- Here you go. - All right.

2735
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,470
- Oh, you're a thug. - There you go.

2736
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,010
- Eat it. - Okay.

2737
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,940
- I'll let you off for this. - All right.

2738
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,380
- You punk. - I brought it.

2739
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,310
I said something too.

2740
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,550
- That's funny. - I only have three tails left.

2741
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,210
(I only have 3 tails left.)

2742
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,520
Here comes the mission that gives you...

2743
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,250
the last chance to become a nine-tailed fox.

2744
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:32,690
(A precious chance to earn tails)

2745
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,560
It's Speak Famous Lines With Your Actions.

2746
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,260
(Mission 3: Speak Famous Lines With Your Actions)

2747
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,720
Okay.

2748
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,960
You can only communicate through actions.

2749
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,890
(They have to communicate through actions without making any sound.)

2750
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:40,090
Three members will make up one team.

2751
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,060
(3 members will make up 1 team.)

2752
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,100
- Okay. - I'm good at this game.

2753
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,570
(Movie, "The Terminator," "I'll be back.")

2754
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,370
You'll see a famous line...

2755
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:45,770
- from a movie or a drama. - I'm good at this.

2756
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,700
- You'll need to guess the answer. - Seriously.

2757
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,770
(Correct)

2758
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,770
The team that gets more questions right in three minutes will win.

2759
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,810
- Okay. - You can only pass twice.

2760
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:54,040
There are ten questions in total.

2761
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,610
- Twice? - Yes.

2762
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:58,250
(Worried)

2763
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,380
- I'm really bad at this. - My goodness.

2764
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,610
You can get it right if you use your wits.

2765
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,280
The first-place team members...

2766
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,450
- will get five tails each. - Five?

2767
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,820
- Five? - Five?

2768
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:07,090
(He currently has 3.)

2769
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,990
- I'll just need 1 more. - If I hadn't given 1...

2770
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
Five?

2771
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,290
(He currently has 3.)

2772
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:09,960
- Five? - Five?

2773
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,860
If I hadn't given one...

2774
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:13,060
(If I hadn't given one to Seok Jin...)

2775
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:13,690
If I hadn't given one...

2776
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,430
(Awkward)

2777
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,700
- I could use five tails. - For goodness' sake.

2778
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,970
- Ye Eun, shall we switch places? - Why?

2779
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:22,770
(3 women can split up to make 3 teams.)

2780
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:23,400
- Women can each take a team. - Shall I do that?

2781
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,470
- Will you go there? - Instead of doing that,

2782
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:29,180
- You should pick your teammates. - Thank you.

2783
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,510
(Scanning quickly)

2784
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,210
- I think this team will be nice. - Okay.

2785
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:34,620
- I think this team will be nice. - Okay.

2786
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,920
(She picks Lomon's table.)

2787
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:37,080
- It's a blind date. - A blind date.

2788
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,390
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

2789
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,390
"Hello."

2790
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,760
(Cheers.)

2791
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,690
(Laughing)

2792
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,790
(She bursts out in laughter and stops herself.)

2793
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,130
- Okay. - This is a good team.

2794
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,600
(The 3 people sitting at each table make up a team.)

2795
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:49,660
- We make a good team. - We make a good team too.

2796
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,370
- Okay. We'll go first. - Okay.

2797
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:53,470
Okay. Team Hye Yoon will go first.

2798
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:56,070
(Team Hye Yoon with the cunning Protruded Brothers goes first.)

2799
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:55,740
- I think Hye Yoon will do well. - Seriously.

2800
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,510
We'll get something like, "Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong."

2801
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,570
Then we should do this.

2802
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,280
- Famous lines. - What?

2803
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,310
- Okay. - Hye Yoon, you can...

2804
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,510
(Hye Yoon will explain first.)

2805
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:05,110
- Shall I do the actions? - You can explain. We'll guess.

2806
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,480
I think Hye Yoon will do well.

2807
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:10,680
(5 tails are on the line! Which team will win?)

2808
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:07,920
Let's go.

2809
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,020
- Let's go. - Let's do this.

2810
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,850
Here comes the question.

2811
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,620
(The first question is revealed.)

2812
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:15,160
- Okay. - Set, go.

2813
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:21,230
(Movie, "Friend," "You go to Hawaii.")

2814
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,260
What will it be?

2815
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,830
"You go to Hawaii."

2816
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,930
(You go!)

2817
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,500
- Go. You go. - You go.

2818
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,540
- You go. - You go.

2819
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:32,570
- "You go to Hawaii." - Correct.

2820
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:32,440
(Correct)

2821
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,940
(It took 7 seconds!)

2822
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,240
- Correct. - Okay.

2823
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,280
- No way. - That's it.

2824
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,680
That's it.

2825
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:38,180
(It's Jae Seok's turn to explain.)

2826
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,750
- Good. - Let's go.

2827
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,950
- Can they answer together? - Yes, they can.

2828
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:42,450
(Drama)

2829
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:39,950
Okay.

2830
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,150
(Is Jae Seok smelling something?)

2831
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,050
- Smelling something? Smell? - What smell?

2832
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,860
- Smelling something? - What smell?

2833
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,890
- Smell? - That...

2834
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,460
That isn't a person. That's an insect.

2835
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,560
Smelling something?

2836
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,660
- What? - Smell?

2837
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,430
That isn't a person. That's an insect.

2838
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,530
- Is it a line? - "Do you smell something burning?"

2839
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:57,160
(Whispering)

2840
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,960
- You're right. - It's...

2841
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:03,440
(Drama, "Phoenix," "Do you smell something burning?")

2842
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,800
"Do you smell something burning?"

2843
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,300
"My heart is burning right now."

2844
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,270
(He's pretending to be Eric.)

2845
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,140
- Smelling something? - What smell?

2846
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,140
- Smell? - That...

2847
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,170
Is it a line?

2848
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:08,680
- You're right. - It's...

2849
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,080
(Yes.)

2850
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,380
- You smell something. - What smell?

2851
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,180
- I know what it is. - What?

2852
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,180
(Other teams figure out the line.)

2853
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,250
I know it.

2854
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,950
- I know what it is. - What?

2855
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:15,950
I know it.

2856
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,550
- I know what it is. - I know it.

2857
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,650
(He explains the burning smell with a bonfire.)

2858
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,690
I figured it out.

2859
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:20,990
- Okay. - I know what it is.

2860
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,390
- Okay. Furnace. - Pot?

2861
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,460
- Furnace. - Is it "Exhuma?"

2862
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,660
How do they not know it?

2863
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:25,860
Which movie is it?

2864
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,290
- Furnace. - Do you smell something?

2865
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,030
What's this smell?

2866
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,060
Burning smell!

2867
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,230
Burning smell!

2868
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,830
(They almost got it!)

2869
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:33,530
The smell of my burning heart.

2870
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,170
- "Phoenix." - Do you smell something?

2871
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:35,400
(Almost there)

2872
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,100
- "Phoenix." - Do you smell something?

2873
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,870
(That's it!)

2874
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,210
- Burning smell. "Phoenix." - "Phoenix."

2875
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,240
- "Phoenix." - Your smell.

2876
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,940
(Disturbing)

2877
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,040
- "Are you hurt? I'm hurt too." - Your smell.

2878
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,110
- "Phoenix." - "Are you hurt? I'm hurt too."

2879
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,980
(It's "Damo.")

2880
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:45,810
- No. - Say the line.

2881
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,620
"Do you smell something burning?"

2882
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,720
- Correct. - Correct.

2883
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,680
- "Do you smell something burning?" - Correct.

2884
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:53,250
(Team Hye Yoon answers two questions!)

2885
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,950
Good.

2886
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:54,320
- I'm good at this. - Seriously.

2887
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,460
- You're good at this. - Yes.

2888
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,790
- I figured it out right away. - Yes.

2889
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:04,930
(Drama)

2890
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,730
Good.

2891
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,400
- Okay. - Okay.

2892
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,630
"You're inside my heart."

2893
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,100
"You're inside my heart."

2894
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:09,340
- "You're inside my heart." - "Lovers in Paris."

2895
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:10,640
- My heart. - Love.

2896
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,770
- My mind. - My heart.

2897
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:13,370
- My heart. - My chest.

2898
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,880
- My mind. - It's hard.

2899
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,680
- It's hard. - Why did you leave me?

2900
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,950
- Don't mouth the words. - Love.

2901
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,910
- Big heart. Love. - Love.

2902
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,650
(Yes!)

2903
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,620
- "I want to go back." - My love...

2904
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,620
I want to fall into your love.

2905
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,620
(Yes!)

2906
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,920
- What? Your love? - I fell in love.

2907
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,260
- I fell in love. - What?

2908
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,520
- I figured it out. - Love.

2909
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,660
- I figured it out. - Love.

2910
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,560
- "Falling in love isn't a crime." - Love... What was that famous line?

2911
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,090
- It's over. - What? Falling in love...

2912
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,630
- "Falling in love isn't a crime." - Falling in love.

2913
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:39,600
(Drama)

2914
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,360
Falling in love.

2915
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,770
- You're right. - Right?

2916
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,570
(Drama, "A World of Married Couple")

2917
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,200
"Falling in love isn't a crime!"

2918
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,970
I want to fall into your love.

2919
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:47,540
("Falling in love isn't a crime.")

2920
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,240
- Your love? - I fell in love.

2921
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,680
- I fell in love. - What?

2922
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,810
- I don't want to fall in love? - Love.

2923
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:50,040
- I don't want to fall in love? - Love... What was...

2924
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,250
- that famous line? - It's over.

2925
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,610
"Love comes back."

2926
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:54,210
- It's over. - "Love comes back."

2927
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,350
(That's "Stairway to Heaven.")

2928
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,380
Fall in love.

2929
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,250
- Love. - Fall in love.

2930
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,420
(They have no idea.)

2931
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,120
- Why? - I love you.

2932
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,820
Why would I fall in love?

2933
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,990
(He decides to move on in the end!)

2934
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,660
- Pass. - How do they not know the line?

2935
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,160
- What is it? - "Falling in love isn't a crime."

2936
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,030
"Falling in love isn't a crime."

2937
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:07,700
(The next line gets revealed.)

2938
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:15,600
(Drama, "The Glory," "I'm so excited right now.")

2939
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,600
- I don't know. - Gosh.

2940
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,270
- You just need the right actions. - We're good at this.

2941
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,400
- An actor sure is different. - Yes.

2942
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,640
I'm so excited right now.

2943
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:23,310
(I'm...)

2944
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,710
- I'm... - I'm...

2945
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:24,810
(So excited!)

2946
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:24,910
- I'm fine. - Cute?

2947
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,210
- I'm fine. - Cute?

2948
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,650
I'm cute? I'm...

2949
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,750
- I'm so cute. - I'm...

2950
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,920
- I'm... - Adorable.

2951
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,590
(She does look very excited, but...)

2952
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,050
- I'm going crazy? - Jump.

2953
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,250
- I'm jumping. I'm... - Is it "200 Pounds Beauty?"

2954
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:36,320
- I'm... - I'm back?

2955
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,460
- I'm so cute. - I'm...

2956
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:38,930
- I'm... - Adorable.

2957
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,290
- I'm excited? - I'm jumping.

2958
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:42,560
- I'm 190cm tall. - I know!

2959
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,230
- I'm 190cm tall. - "I'm so excited."

2960
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,400
- I... - I'm...

2961
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,470
- Jump. - I'm free.

2962
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,240
(Ddochi gets it right again.)

2963
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,740
- Gosh, Ye Eun. - Isn't that right?

2964
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,770
That's right.

2965
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:53,070
- I'm... Here... - "I'm so excited."

2966
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,940
- Right? - I'm the main character.

2967
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:57,640
(The drama fanatic shows off her knowledge after a long time.)

2968
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:57,540
- You're good. - I'm...

2969
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,650
- Happy. - I'm rooting for you.

2970
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:02,220
(Team Hye Yoon only has 1 minute left.)

2971
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:00,850
I'm going crazy?

2972
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,380
- Turn. - It's over.

2973
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:03,550
- Hands up. - It's over.

2974
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,950
- I'd pass. - Jump.

2975
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,250
- What is it? - Pass.

2976
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,860
- "I'm so excited right now." - "I'm so excited right now."

2977
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,960
(She uses their last pass!)

2978
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,160
- I didn't know that. Let's go. - "The Glory."

2979
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,160
(The question Jae Seok will explain is revealed.)

2980
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,660
"I'm so excited right now."

2981
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,030
(Movie, "Once Upon a Time in High School,")

2982
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,960
- Ye Eun is the best. - You.

2983
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,900
("Are you really good at fighting? Come to the rooftop.")

2984
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,030
You can't pass a question anymore.

2985
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,200
- Ye Eun is the best. - You.

2986
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,730
(You. Come up here.)

2987
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,470
You can't pass a question anymore.

2988
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,800
Follow me. Follow me to the rooftop.

2989
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,670
(He gets close to the answer despite the clumsy actions!)

2990
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,410
Follow me to the rooftop.

2991
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:27,410
What?

2992
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,140
(You, come to the rooftop.)

2993
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:29,080
- You. Follow me to the rooftop. - Follow me to the rooftop.

2994
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,410
(That's right. You...)

2995
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,410
- You... - I guess that isn't it.

2996
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,580
- Follow me to the rooftop. - Follow me to the rooftop.

2997
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,020
(There's more!)

2998
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,850
- You... - I guess that isn't it.

2999
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,180
You...

3000
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,180
Follow me to the rooftop.

3001
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,420
- It's... - "Are you really good at fighting?"

3002
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:40,450
- "Follow me to the rooftop." - Correct.

3003
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:41,520
"Are you really good at fighting?"

3004
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,920
(With 20 seconds remaining, they answer 3 questions.)

3005
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,090
- "Follow me to the rooftop." - Correct.

3006
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,090
- Good. - Is that how you do it?

3007
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,260
(Movie, "King and the Clown," "I'm here, and you're there.")

3008
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,160
They needed to make it longer.

3009
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,900
You have to say it, right? When it's right...

3010
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:53,970
Tightroping?

3011
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,240
- When it's right... - Tightroping?

3012
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,270
(I'm here! And you're there!)

3013
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,540
- Tightroping? - When it's right, say so.

3014
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,600
I'm going to you right now.

3015
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,240
I... I see.

3016
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,640
"I'm here, and you're there."

3017
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,080
- Correct. - Correct.

3018
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,280
(He got it right after 10 seconds!)

3019
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,740
- What's that? - What?

3020
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,810
- No way. - "King and the Clown."

3021
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:08,320
(Drama, "Squid Game," "We're gganbu.")

3022
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,010
"King and the Clown."

3023
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:08,350
- Try it. Explain it. - Try it.

3024
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,190
- We. - We're...

3025
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,490
(Will they be able to get one more question right?)

3026
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:12,950
- Five, four, - We.

3027
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:14,390
- We. - three,

3028
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,460
- two, - We're...

3029
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,560
- one. - We're one.

3030
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,590
- We're one. - I can't do it.

3031
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,430
(Time is up.)

3032
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:18,590
I got it.

3033
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,830
- "We're gganbu." - "We're gganbu."

3034
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,500
(Drama, "Squid Game," "We're gganbu.")

3035
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,330
- It was hard. - It was hard.

3036
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,360
(If it's gganbu, you should do this.)

3037
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,460
- Had you done this... - Okay.

3038
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,130
- Gganbu. - You answered four questions.

3039
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:28,240
(Team Hye Yoon got 4 questions right.)

3040
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,700
- Really? - We could've gotten one more.

3041
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,100
Which team wants to go next?

3042
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,600
"Falling in love" was a hard one.

3043
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,410
(They still take the lead for now.)

3044
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,940
I know. "Falling in love isn't a crime."

3045
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,040
"Falling in love isn't a crime."

3046
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,880
Okay. Let's go second. Okay.

3047
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:37,310
(Team Ye Eun comes out with confidence.)

3048
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,510
- Team Ye Eun. - Who wants to go first?

3049
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,210
- Who should explain first? - Shall I do it?

3050
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:40,280
I'll guess first.

3051
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:41,450
Okay. I'll explain first.

3052
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:42,550
- Good. - Lomon, sit here.

3053
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,050
Okay. Good.

3054
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,650
(The blind-date couple will answer.)

3055
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,990
(And Jong Kook will explain the questions.)

3056
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,720
- Jong Kook, explain well. Okay. - Ye Eun, let's do this.

3057
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,590
- Yes! Okay. - Let's go.

3058
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,860
(Energetic)

3059
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,460
Here comes the first question.

3060
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,060
(The first question for Team Ye Eun is revealed.)

3061
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,130
- Set, go. - Sitting here makes me nervous.

3062
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:53,190
Set, go.

3063
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:56,860
(Movie, "Veteran,")

3064
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,530
It's a hard one.

3065
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:00,800
("I'm the owner of this ARTBOX store.")

3066
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,900
"I'm the owner of this ARTBOX store."

3067
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,570
- Is it hard? - It's a hard one.

3068
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:07,370
(He shows a scene of the character stepping forward from the crowd.)

3069
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:07,170
- It's a hard one. - What?

3070
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,410
(Ye Eun easily guessed another team's lines earlier.)

3071
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,110
- Is it hard? - It's a hard one.

3072
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:14,110
I'm good at this. I'm obsessed with dramas.

3073
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:14,550
(Will she be able to answer her team's questions?)

3074
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,980
- It's hard. - What?

3075
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,990
(She doesn't know!)

3076
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,780
They'll never get it right.

3077
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,920
What?

3078
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,820
- They'll never get it right. - Never.

3079
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:21,960
What's this?

3080
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,260
Is it hard?

3081
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:26,590
(A millstone)

3082
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:26,360
"Do you know why a millstone handle is called 'Eoi?'"

3083
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:30,200
(She figured out it's the movie "Veteran!")

3084
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,630
"Do you know why a millstone handle is called 'Eoi?'"

3085
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,860
- "I can't believe it." - "I can't believe it."

3086
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,300
(The line after that!)

3087
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:33,200
Is it a line that comes later?

3088
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:37,300
(Ji Hyo figures it out.)

3089
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,500
"I'm the owner of this ARTBOX store."

3090
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,400
- Your chief... - I'm...

3091
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,540
Your chief...

3092
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:39,740
I'm...

3093
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,480
I'm...

3094
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:44,610
(A similar line crosses Ye Eun's mind!)

3095
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,940
- Yes. - That's right.

3096
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,440
"I'm here, and you're there."

3097
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,150
- I'm... - I'm...

3098
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,350
- "I'm here, and you're there." - I'm here to die.

3099
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,580
That's right.

3100
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,620
- This one... - Pass.

3101
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:51,950
- isn't hard. - It's a famous line.

3102
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,120
I think I know the line.

3103
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,860
- Shall we pass it? - Pass.

3104
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:56,860
(He skips the question in the end.)

3105
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:56,760
"I'm the owner of this ARTBOX store."

3106
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:04,670
(Movie)

3107
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,360
Let's go.

3108
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,630
It was a hard one.

3109
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,700
- This one is hard. - This one is hard.

3110
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,100
This one is hard.

3111
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,670
(What's that?)

3112
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:08,970
- Giant. - What's that?

3113
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,440
- "Attack on Titan." - Knock, knock.

3114
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,610
- Fool. - "Attack on Titan."

3115
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:14,940
(What kind of creature is she portraying?)

3116
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:14,340
- Ugly doll. - "Attack on Titan."

3117
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,580
- What is it? - Wait!

3118
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,810
Isn't it "Guardian: The Lonely and Great God?"

3119
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,150
- "I love you." - You're right.

3120
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:22,520
(Does she look similar?)

3121
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,020
- Dental veneers. - "I love you."

3122
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,750
"I love you, mister."

3123
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,620
(No)

3124
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,890
"I love you, mister."

3125
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,790
- Camel cricket. - You made a sound.

3126
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,420
(It rains.)

3127
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,060
- You made a sound. - Camel cricket.

3128
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,090
(Inside a rectangular box)

3129
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,260
Don't make a sound.

3130
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:32,190
(Knocking)

3131
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,560
Knock, knock.

3132
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,230
- Ring, ring. - Ring, ring.

3133
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:35,600
- Bba ba bam - "Apartment."

3134
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,030
- Bba ba ba ba bam - "Apartment." Ring, ring.

3135
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,270
(While Jae Seok behaves flippantly)

3136
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,030
Why are you cold?

3137
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:40,900
- You're cold. - You're cold.

3138
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:43,340
(Someone is shaking in the rain.)

3139
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,870
- Ring, ring. - Why are you cold?

3140
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:43,900
Look.

3141
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,070
You can pass one more question.

3142
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,440
You went inside. You went down to the basement.

3143
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:48,580
You went down to the basement.

3144
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,840
I know what it is. It's...

3145
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,450
I know what it is. It's...

3146
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:53,450
"Parasite."

3147
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,680
- That one. - He doesn't know.

3148
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:58,220
(Is Ye Eun acting out a character from "Parasite?")

3149
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,850
A drama.

3150
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,950
That one. A drama.

3151
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,090
I mean, a movie.

3152
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,490
"Parasite."

3153
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,390
"Parasite."

3154
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,560
(Movie)

3155
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,360
(Movie, "Parasite," "Would you open the door?")

3156
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,890
Would you open the door for a second?

3157
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:06,290
"Parasite."

3158
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,200
- What is it? - What is it?

3159
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,600
Would you open the door for a second?

3160
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:11,530
(They just need to guess the line now!)

3161
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,870
Which line from "Parasite" is it?

3162
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,070
- I don't remember. - Right?

3163
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,410
(They don't know the line!)

3164
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,870
- I don't know it either. - The lines are hard.

3165
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,640
- I don't know it either. - What is it?

3166
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,740
- I really don't know. - From "Parasite..."

3167
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,340
"Are you the tutor?" Which line is it?

3168
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,250
- Your chief. - "Your chief..."

3169
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,480
(Open the door!)

3170
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,650
- "Lives in Namcheon-dong." - Right. "Would you open the door?"

3171
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,050
(Jong Kook got the answer without realizing it.)

3172
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:29,820
- Correct. - Is it correct?

3173
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:30,880
- What did he say? - "Would you open the door?"

3174
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,120
- Is this line famous? - Seriously. I don't know it.

3175
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:34,420
- Is this line famous? - Seriously.

3176
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,390
(It's Lomon's first time acting out the question.)

3177
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,960
"Would you open the door?"

3178
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,690
- Is this line famous? - Seriously.

3179
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,960
(Drama, "Heirs," "By any chance, do I like you?")

3180
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,260
- "Would you open the door?" - Yes.

3181
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:40,960
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong."

3182
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,030
(The right person for the question)

3183
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,230
He's handsome.

3184
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:49,740
(Drama, "Heirs," "By any chance, do I like you?")

3185
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,630
By any chance,

3186
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,130
do I like you?

3187
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,440
He's handsome.

3188
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,570
He's cool.

3189
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:53,610
"Do you love me?"

3190
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:54,710
"Do I love you?"

3191
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,510
- Correct. - "Do I love you?"

3192
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,910
"Do I like you?" "Do I love you?" is correct.

3193
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,310
(Ye Eun quickly got the answer within 8 seconds.)

3194
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:02,880
Gosh, why did you answer his question so easily?

3195
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,480
(Up next is Jong Kook's question.)

3196
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:11,490
(Drama, "The Slave Hunters," "Un Nyeon.")

3197
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,190
What?

3198
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,730
- You can't mouth the words. - He's mouthing the words.

3199
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,160
You can't mouth the words.

3200
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:16,200
- You can't mouth the words. - I think I know.

3201
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,230
(He mouths the words.)

3202
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,830
- I think I know. - I have no idea.

3203
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,600
(But these two can't get the hint.)

3204
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:18,900
- Don't mouth the words. - Don't do it.

3205
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,740
(Jang Hyuk eating gukbap.)

3206
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:19,970
It's...

3207
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:22,770
- He's eating. - It's tasty. Gukbap is the best.

3208
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:23,170
(Distracting)

3209
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,740
- Gosh, gukbap is the best. - Gosh.

3210
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,210
Gosh, this is the taste.

3211
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,640
- I want one more bowl. - Ha Jung Woo?

3212
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,710
I want one more bowl.

3213
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:29,780
I finished the bowl!

3214
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,010
- Gosh. - It's tasty.

3215
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:33,080
- Rice ball. Is it "Oldboy?" - It's so tasty.

3216
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,450
- Your cheeks are full. - This is the taste.

3217
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,620
(Snickering)

3218
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,180
By the way,

3219
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,350
(Time passes mercilessly.)

3220
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,720
- I'm doing this. - "Oldboy."

3221
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,890
That's Jung Jun Ha.

3222
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:41,590
- By the way, I'm doing this. - That's Jung Jun Ha.

3223
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,620
(What's this?)

3224
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:42,620
What's that?

3225
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,030
That's it!

3226
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:47,460
(He does Dae Gil's Jeet Kune Do!)

3227
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,400
Wing Chun.

3228
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,230
- Isn't that Jang Hyuk? - Kung fu.

3229
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,270
- That's right. - Jang Hyuk.

3230
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,070
(Lomon contributes for the first time!)

3231
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,570
- Isn't that Jang Hyuk? - Kung fu.

3232
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,100
- That's right. Who? - Jang Hyuk.

3233
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,070
(And Un Nyeon!)

3234
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,500
- Jang Hyuk. "The Slave Hunters." - Jang Hyuk.

3235
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:58,710
- "The Slave Hunters." - Chun Hyang!

3236
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:00,240
- Chun Hyang! - Right.

3237
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,610
"The Slave Hunters."

3238
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:05,180
(Empty Head looks for Chun Hyang in "The Slave Hunters.")

3239
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,010
Chun Hyang.

3240
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:06,280
- Gosh. - I get it.

3241
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:07,510
- You can't speak. - Don't mouth the words.

3242
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:09,280
- Don't mouth the words. - What was it? "Un Nyeon."

3243
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:10,580
(Correct)

3244
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,520
- Correct. - "Un Nyeon."

3245
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,520
- "Un Nyeon." - Correct.

3246
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,290
(With 40 seconds remaining, they answer 3 questions!)

3247
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,850
How did you not know this one?

3248
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:16,090
(If they answer one more question, they'll tie with Jae Seok's team.)

3249
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,660
How did you not know this one?

3250
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,520
I thought it was an easy one.

3251
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:19,130
(What's Ye Eun's question?)

3252
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:25,670
(Movie)

3253
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,360
I thought it was an easy one.

3254
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:23,060
Look at me.

3255
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:27,700
"Am I so bad?"

3256
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,670
(Movie, "Decision to Leave," "Am I so bad?")

3257
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,470
(It's related to Mala Tang Wei, one of Ye Eun's alter egos!)

3258
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,840
- Look at me. - "Am I so bad?"

3259
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,970
- Didn't we see that earlier? - Titan.

3260
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,780
- "Attack on Titan." - Earlier... "Attack on Titan."

3261
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,510
(Me!)

3262
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,040
- Titan. - That's right.

3263
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,180
(Am I so bad?)

3264
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:41,680
"Shut it!"

3265
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:42,950
- No. - No?

3266
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:44,180
- Earlier... - Thirty seconds remain.

3267
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,850
(Only 30 seconds remain!)

3268
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,190
Thirty seconds remain.

3269
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:46,450
- They'll place last. - That's right.

3270
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:47,690
- Yes. - They'll place last.

3271
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,420
(They need to get this to tie the score with Team Hye Yoon's.)

3272
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:50,190
- "Attack on Titan." - I...

3273
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,730
Titan with the downturned eyes.

3274
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,490
(Disturbing)

3275
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,560
- I... - I...

3276
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,700
- She's sleepy. - Okay.

3277
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,230
It's "Lady Vengeance."

3278
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,330
(Disturbing)

3279
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,500
- Ji Ye Eun. - Ji Ye Eun.

3280
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:00,830
(They have 10 seconds left.)

3281
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,040
Ji Ye Eun.

3282
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:03,440
(She even unties her hair to act.)

3283
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,700
- "Attack on Titan." - "I love you, mister."

3284
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,110
Five,

3285
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,170
(Will they be able to get it?)

3286
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:06,770
- four, three, - "Behave yourself!"

3287
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,340
- two, - "Behave yourself!"

3288
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,540
- one. - No!

3289
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:11,380
(Time's up.)

3290
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,210
No!

3291
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:13,210
- "Am I so bad?" - What?

3292
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:14,580
"Am I so bad?"

3293
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:16,120
- Tang Wei. Mala Tang Wei. - Tang Wei.

3294
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,250
I see.

3295
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,250
(He got it belatedly.)

3296
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,590
- It was so hard. - We beat them.

3297
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:20,520
(Team Ye Eun gets 3 questions right.)

3298
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,320
Three questions!

3299
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,720
(Currently, Team Hye Yoon is in 1st place with 4 questions.)

3300
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,690
- "Un Nyeon" was the easiest. - Let's answer five questions.

3301
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,130
- Let's answer five questions. - This time...

3302
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:29,300
(If Team Ji Hyo gets more than 5, they win.)

3303
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:28,400
Let's answer five questions. You should guess.

3304
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,430
- The first question? - Yes.

3305
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:31,000
(Actually, this team...)

3306
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,760
You're good at this.

3307
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:32,830
- It's... - "Parasite."

3308
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,140
("Parasite")

3309
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:33,970
- That one. - He doesn't know.

3310
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,340
A drama. I mean, a movie.

3311
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,700
(Do you smell something burning?)

3312
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:36,740
- Is it a line? - "Do you smell something burning?"

3313
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,370
- You're right. - Your chief...

3314
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:41,310
(I'm the owner of this ARTBOX store.)

3315
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:39,910
"I'm the owner of this ARTBOX store."

3316
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:40,940
- Your chief... - I'm...

3317
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,010
Hey, let's answer five questions and win.

3318
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,840
(They became the dark horse after getting all the remaining ones.)

3319
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:47,150
(Will they be able to win after winning more than 5 questions?)

3320
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,350
- Here comes the first question. - We really need to win.

3321
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:48,680
- Set, go. - "Am I so bad?"

3322
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:53,120
(Movie, "Miracle in Cell No. 7." "Ye Seung, you must eat beans.")

3323
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:51,650
- "Ye Seung, you must eat beans." - What's this?

3324
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:53,120
- He doesn't know it. - It's a hard one.

3325
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,150
He doesn't know it.

3326
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:55,660
- It isn't easy. - He doesn't know it.

3327
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:59,160
- Don't say anything. - Chopsticks.

3328
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,260
- Eat. - Eat.

3329
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,290
"Do you want to come in for ramyeon?"

3330
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,330
I know this one.

3331
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:03,760
I figured it out right away.

3332
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:05,870
(Acting fiercely to pick up beans)

3333
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,500
- I know this one. - We should've gotten that one.

3334
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,500
- You know what it is, right? - You eat one.

3335
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:10,070
(But they mistook it as another movie.)

3336
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,570
- That's right. - I eat two.

3337
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:11,340
- That's right. - You eat one.

3338
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,570
I'll give you one.

3339
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:13,940
- Chef Choi Kang Rok! - I'll give you one.

3340
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:14,940
Chef Choi Kang Rok!

3341
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,580
I'll give you one.

3342
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,410
(They begin the mental attack.)

3343
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,350
- Braising Master. Braising. - Braising Master.

3344
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,010
- Braising Master. - Braising Master.

3345
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,110
Braising Master,

3346
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,450
- Chef Choi Kang Rok! - It's a wrap.

3347
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:24,780
- Braising. - Pass. You can't get it right.

3348
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:27,220
(He ended up skipping the question.)

3349
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:27,190
- Chef Choi Kang Rok. - Braising Master.

3350
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:28,660
- Braising Master. - Braising Master.

3351
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:30,220
(It's Haha's turn.)

3352
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:29,860
"The Fishermen and the City," good luck.

3353
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,020
It's over.

3354
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:35,530
(Movie, "Extreme Job," "Why is the business flourishing?")

3355
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,060
"The Fishermen and the City," good luck.

3356
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,660
Why is the business flourishing?

3357
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:35,730
"The Fishermen and the City," good luck.

3358
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,060
(He explains the chicken part first.)

3359
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,800
"The Fishermen and the City," good luck.

3360
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,030
Chicken. You gnaw on it.

3361
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,330
Chicken. You gnaw on it. Chicken.

3362
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,670
Chicken. You gnaw on it.

3363
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:43,670
- Chicken. - You gnaw on it.

3364
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,970
(Describing stakeout)

3365
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:45,170
- Chicken. - You have a toothache.

3366
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:46,770
- Come on, Haha. - You have a toothache.

3367
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,440
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong."

3368
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,540
(Ringing)

3369
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:51,010
(Why is the business flourishing?)

3370
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:49,980
Why...

3371
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,440
- Your chief... - Don't mouth the words!

3372
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,880
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong."

3373
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:55,580
(Did Seok Jin figure it out?)

3374
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:54,650
Why...

3375
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:55,650
- Your chief... - I know.

3376
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,920
- Don't mouth the words! - Why are you doing this to me?

3377
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,020
It's similar.

3378
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,590
- Why are you doing this to me? - It's similar.

3379
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:02,720
(It's similar in a strange way!)

3380
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:02,720
No.

3381
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,960
Why?

3382
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,590
- Why? - Come on.

3383
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,460
(Frying chickens)

3384
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:07,960
Chicken.

3385
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,930
(Making money)

3386
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,660
- Chicken. - Money.

3387
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:10,960
- You're counting money. - Okay.

3388
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,300
- "Why is the business flourishing?" - That's right.

3389
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,630
(Correct)

3390
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,570
"Why is the business flourishing?"

3391
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,100
That's right.

3392
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:18,710
(With 2 minutes remaining, they answer the 1st question!)

3393
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,270
One question.

3394
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:21,680
(What's Ji Hyo's first question?)

3395
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,810
I can't believe they got it right.

3396
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:21,810
This one is easy.

3397
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,710
(Movie, "Frozen," "Let it go.")

3398
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:25,650
Let it go

3399
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,980
Hey, this line is famous.

3400
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:29,950
(Ji Hyo got a rather easy question.)

3401
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,150
It's easy.

3402
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,580
It's very easy.

3403
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,920
It's easy.

3404
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,850
(She shows the Elsa vibes right away.)

3405
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,490
(It's snowing too.)

3406
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,720
- It's snowing. - It's snowing.

3407
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,160
- Ballet. - It's very easy.

3408
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,030
- I know. "Frozen!" - Okay.

3409
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,160
(Precise)

3410
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:41,490
- "Frozen!" - Okay.

3411
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,500
(They get the movie title right away!)

3412
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,660
From "Frozen..."

3413
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,960
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong."

3414
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,800
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong."

3415
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:51,340
(Feeling pressed, they do anything to distract them.)

3416
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,740
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong."

3417
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:51,810
It's snowing.

3418
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,770
- "In Namcheon-dong." - It's snowing.

3419
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:56,040
(The gaming place turns into the market of Namcheon-dong.)

3420
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:55,080
So...

3421
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:56,880
- "Your chief lives..." - "Your chief lives..."

3422
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,780
- "in Namcheon-dong." - "in Namcheon-dong."

3423
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:01,110
- Open the door and come on out - Open the door and come on out

3424
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:02,920
(They start singing along among the noise.)

3425
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,620
- What are the lyrics? - Open the door

3426
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,820
- You only look at me - No!

3427
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,820
What are the lyrics?

3428
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,190
- "Your chief lives..." - "Your chief lives..."

3429
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,360
- "in Namcheon-dong." - "in Namcheon-dong."

3430
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,020
(Loud)

3431
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,260
Stop it!

3432
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:13,060
Is it incorrect?

3433
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:14,830
(Less than a minute left because of Choi Min Siks)

3434
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,960
- Give us 20 seconds. - It doesn't matter anyway.

3435
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,600
(Explaining "Go")

3436
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,900
- You run. - Running.

3437
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,700
Give us one word at a time.

3438
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,830
- Explain. - Why...

3439
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:22,340
Why do you suddenly...

3440
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,410
Why do you suddenly run after doing ballet?

3441
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:29,880
- Do one thing. - He's angry for real.

3442
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,380
(The elder gets upset all of a sudden.)

3443
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,180
Listen.

3444
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,280
- Come on. - He's angry for real.

3445
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,610
- Just give us the line. - Why do you run?

3446
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:36,050
We know that it's "Frozen."

3447
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,580
- He's angry for real. - Is it ballet or running?

3448
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,690
We know that it's "Frozen."

3449
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:40,690
- Give one word at a time. - Yes.

3450
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:43,190
All right. Start with "Your."

3451
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:46,160
- "Your..." - All right.

3452
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:47,790
(Team Ji Hyo's chance of winning is already gone.)

3453
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,230
- All right. - Running. Foot.

3454
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,600
(They only have 10 seconds.)

3455
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:50,130
- No. - Run.

3456
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:51,360
- It isn't like that. - "Your chief lives..."

3457
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,530
- "in Namcheon-dong." - What's the song?

3458
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:53,470
(Influenced)

3459
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,100
- Winter. - It's a song.

3460
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,340
- What are the lyrics? - Five,

3461
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,500
- This is driving me crazy! - four,

3462
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,940
(Haha and Seok Sam don't get the hang of it until the end.)

3463
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,670
- What is it? - three,

3464
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:00,270
- two, - Run.

3465
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,510
one.

3466
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,910
(Time's up)

3467
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,580
What is it?

3468
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,280
- "Let it go." - "Let it go!"

3469
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:05,910
- "Let it go." - "Let it go."

3470
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,150
Hey, why did you explain "Let it go" like that?

3471
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:10,750
(The worst teamwork)

3472
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,450
Why did you explain "Let it go" like that?

3473
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:11,450
I knew it was "Let it go."

3474
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:15,090
(Team Ji Hyo places last with 1 question.)

3475
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:13,190
- Was it like, "Let's go?" - You answered one question.

3476
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,120
We placed first!

3477
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:17,260
We placed first!

3478
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:19,490
(Team Hye Yoon won 1st place after getting 4 questions.)

3479
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,490
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong."

3480
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:22,060
Team Hye Yoon won.

3481
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:24,430
(They each won 5 tails as the benefit.)

3482
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,500
The members will get five tails each.

3483
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,630
- What? - Five tails each.

3484
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:26,500
- Hurrah! - If you hadn't sold one...

3485
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,440
If I hadn't sold one...

3486
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:36,880
(Se Chan's tails, Jae Seok's tails, Hye Yoon's tails)

3487
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,600
I wish I had one more tail.

3488
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:31,240
- Five tails each. - Yes.

3489
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:34,470
I wish I had 1 more tail. I would've become a 9-tailed fox.

3490
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:35,780
I'm sorry.

3491
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,840
It's okay.

3492
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,680
- Does second place get anything? - No.

3493
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:39,910
Second place doesn't get anything.

3494
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,310
Why not?

3495
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,520
- We played so diligently. - However...

3496
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:44,780
- However, - Okay.

3497
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:46,290
you'll get one last chance...

3498
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:50,290
(They have one more chance to win a tail.)

3499
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,620
- like the last time. - Okay.

3500
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:48,960
- Let's do well. - Good.

3501
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,590
- But this time, - Okay.

3502
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:52,590
- you won't roll a die. - Oh, yes!

3503
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:54,260
- You'll have a draw. - That's good.

3504
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,830
- I have no luck with that. - That's good.

3505
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:56,860
(Not confident)

3506
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:56,930
How many do you need?

3507
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,870
(Even the team that placed last, Team Ji Hyo has a chance.)

3508
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,200
That's good.

3509
01:24:58,570 --> 01:24:59,570
- Okay. - How many do you need?

3510
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:01,900
- Team Hye Yoon won. - Yes.

3511
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:02,870
(Team Hye Yoon's benefit for winning first)

3512
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,940
Each member can say the number of tails he or she wants.

3513
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:06,940
Oh, my.

3514
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:08,480
(Falling)

3515
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,740
Let's say Jae Seok wants...

3516
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,540
(Jae Seok's tail)

3517
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,040
- One. Yes. - He's one tail short.

3518
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:14,150
(Jae Seok will get 9 if he wins 1 more.)

3519
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,780
- He'll pick one. - That's right.

3520
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:14,250
We'll give 2 cards with 1 written on them.

3521
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,820
When Se Chan gives a number, we'll give two cards with it.

3522
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,620
(Two notes of the numbers they want)

3523
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,890
Hye Yoon's number will go on 2. So there'll be 6 cards in total.

3524
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:23,820
(Picking 1 note out of 6 randomly)

3525
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,160
- You'll pick one of them. - Okay.

3526
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,120
The probability is 33.33 percent.

3527
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:26,460
(Hye Yoon has a chance of 1 out of 3.)

3528
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,260
- One-third. - Yes.

3529
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,530
My number will be one too.

3530
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:27,660
- One? - My number will be one too.

3531
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:30,260
(Protruded Brothers have a chance of 2 out of 3.)

3532
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:28,760
- It's good for us. - You're right.

3533
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,530
- How many do you need? - I need four.

3534
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:33,970
As for the remaining teams that didn't win,

3535
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,270
everyone will get the cards with numbers from 1 to 9.

3536
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:38,940
You can pick a card from them.

3537
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:40,010
Jong Kook, you could end this in one go.

3538
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,340
It'll be hard to do that.

3539
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,710
- I'll need 9. - We won't end this in 1 go.

3540
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,580
(A lot less chance of winning compared to the winning team)

3541
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:44,710
Thus, the winning team has...

3542
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:45,810
- a better probability. - That's right.

3543
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:47,880
You should've won.

3544
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,420
(The last chance to become a nine-tailed fox)

3545
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,980
We have a ten-percent chance.

3546
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:54,590
Jae Seok, tell us which number you want.

3547
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,690
(Jae Seok's tails)

3548
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:55,690
- It's one. - One.

3549
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,460
(Se Chan's tails)

3550
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:58,530
- It's also 1 for me. - Okay. Se Chan, your number is 1.

3551
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:01,130
(Hye Yoon's tails)

3552
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:00,130
- Hye Yoon, how about you? - Four.

3553
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:01,130
Okay.

3554
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:02,760
All right. Let's go.

3555
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:07,070
(Will they be able to pick the number they want?)

3556
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,430
We need to pick 1 and Hye Yoon needs to pick 4.

3557
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:07,470
That's right. Please.

3558
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:08,900
Team Hye Yoon.

3559
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:09,840
(Team Hye Yoon picks one.)

3560
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,900
I just need to avoid the penalty.

3561
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:12,240
I don't need anything else.

3562
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,570
For your information, today's penalty is very bothersome.

3563
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:15,580
- Really? - Yes.

3564
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,480
Bothersome?

3565
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:19,210
(The tedious penalty that the members hate)

3566
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,210
I don't know.

3567
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:20,480
Should I get the one that dropped to the floor?

3568
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,950
Don't open it yet.

3569
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,120
(They'll get the penalty if they don't become nine-tailed foxes.)

3570
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,920
- Jae Seok, did you drop it? - This is mine.

3571
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,720
I'll get the one that dropped to the floor.

3572
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:26,890
- I bet they got 1. - Open it 1 at a time.

3573
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:27,920
I bet they got one.

3574
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,390
Let's see it.

3575
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,920
There are many cards with one.

3576
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,290
Jae Seok won't succeed in it.

3577
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:34,060
- Hye Yoon, please go first. - Okay.

3578
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,790
(They only succeed if they get 4.)

3579
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,260
It'll be incredible if you get four.

3580
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:40,730
(Hye Yoon's tails)

3581
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:37,660
- My goodness. - My goodness.

3582
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,730
- You became a nine-tailed fox. - Oh, my.

3583
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,700
- My goodness. - My goodness.

3584
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:43,670
(It's really 4!)

3585
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,640
- You became a nine-tailed fox. - Oh, my.

3586
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:44,700
(Hye Yoon's tails)

3587
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,340
- Really? - Congratulations.

3588
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:48,410
(Hye Yoon becomes a 9-tailed fox in 1 go!)

3589
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,070
- Really? - Congratulations.

3590
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,370
- My goodness. - My goodness.

3591
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,740
- Really? - No way.

3592
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:50,980
- That's insane. - That's insane.

3593
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,010
That's incredible.

3594
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:52,680
(Jealous)

3595
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,250
- My goodness. - Jae Seok, you're next.

3596
01:26:52,680 --> 01:27:00,620
(Jae Seok's tails)

3597
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,380
I can't believe it.

3598
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:57,550
Jae Seok is lucky when it comes to big things,

3599
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:58,690
not small things like this.

3600
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:00,390
If he picks 4, I'll become a 9-tailed fox.

3601
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:01,420
What's your number?

3602
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:04,720
(Since Hye Yoon got 4, the probability is 4-5th now.)

3603
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:02,860
If he succeeds in it too, it'll be very boring.

3604
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:03,860
- Please. - Hurry up.

3605
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:04,890
Hurry up.

3606
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,560
Hurry up. In 1, 2, 3.

3607
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:08,060
Jae Seok.

3608
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:09,300
(Jae Seok's tails)

3609
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,430
Jae Seok.

3610
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,400
(Jae Seok succeeds in becoming a nine-tailed fox.)

3611
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,500
Jae Seok, you became a nine-tailed fox.

3612
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,500
- Congratulations. - This is boring.

3613
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,730
Come on. This is boring.

3614
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:15,840
Come on.

3615
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,240
You should have entertained the viewers.

3616
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:19,870
- There's no thrill. - What are you doing?

3617
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:21,640
Is it your role to succeed?

3618
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:25,410
- Well, I succeeded... - Look. No one is amused.

3619
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,450
(Dumbfounded)

3620
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,180
- Your failure would be fun. - Quickly pick one again.

3621
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,350
- Pick again. - What is this?

3622
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:30,150
- Pick again. - I already picked this.

3623
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,620
Why did you get that?

3624
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:33,220
(The face of SBS didn't win laughter.)

3625
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,220
Aren't you the face of SBS?

3626
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,890
- If he also gets it, it'd be worse. - Se Chan.

3627
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:35,860
(Se Chan's tails)

3628
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:35,960
- Ssaebssaeb. - If he also gets it...

3629
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:39,190
(Will Ssaebssaeb be able to win laughter?)

3630
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,690
- How many do you need? - I need one.

3631
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,090
One, two, three.

3632
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,260
Yes!

3633
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,830
- It's not fun. - It's not fun.

3634
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:46,200
It's not fun.

3635
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,430
- What is this? - This is amazing.

3636
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,970
(Even Se Chan made it.)

3637
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:48,700
- Lucky! - Lucky, indeed.

3638
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,970
Hold on. Did both of you need one?

3639
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:51,470
(He finally understood the rule.)

3640
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,670
- Yes. - So you needed four.

3641
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,010
(Everyone got the prize as all three of them became nine-tailed foxes.)

3642
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:53,940
- It's not fun. - Right.

3643
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,440
- We needed four. - Se Chan is also a nine-tailed fox.

3644
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,010
They took 4 out of 6.

3645
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,480
- The team that failed will pick... - They did it. Goodness.

3646
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,710
(Time to pick the losing team)

3647
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,580
- among 1 to 2 tails. - They're different.

3648
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,750
We should have won earlier.

3649
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:03,950
(The chances of becoming the losing team is 1 out of 9.)

3650
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,790
(Seok Sam picks first.)

3651
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:05,890
Let's go, Chef Choi Kang Rok!

3652
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:07,850
Now, bring the braised dish, Braising Master.

3653
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:08,290
(Seok Jin's tails)

3654
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:11,620
(The king of teasing needs to pick 9.)

3655
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,860
Braise it.

3656
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,690
- This won't work. - Lomon.

3657
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,890
Which one do you think it is?

3658
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:14,060
Well...

3659
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,630
I'll do as you say.

3660
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,270
(Out of those, 9 would be...)

3661
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:22,270
- How many... - The third one from the right.

3662
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:24,670
- The third one from the right. - Third right?

3663
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:26,570
- Third right. - One, two, three.

3664
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:29,210
(He picked it out of Lomon's guts.)

3665
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:27,840
You need nine.

3666
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,080
But why did you ask Lomon?

3667
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,510
Lomon bought me coffee.

3668
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:31,440
(He's simple.)

3669
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,480
- Then... - Could you kiss it?

3670
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,680
He bought you coffee.

3671
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,550
(Will Seok Sam with 0 tails survive like a miracle?)

3672
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:37,180
- Right. - Let's get nine!

3673
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:38,320
Nine!

3674
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,190
- What is this? - Really?

3675
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:41,620
(Is it really 9?)

3676
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,690
Let's get nine! Nine!

3677
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,320
- What is this? - Really?

3678
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,390
- It's really nine. - What?

3679
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:50,130
(Seok Sam is really unlucky.)

3680
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:48,490
- No way! - Seriously...

3681
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,500
Really!

3682
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,700
Isn't it six?

3683
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:51,560
(He can't believe it.)

3684
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,030
It's really nine.

3685
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:55,300
- What? - It makes no sense.

3686
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,940
(It's not 6. It really is 9.)

3687
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,870
- Lomon! - Congratulations.

3688
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,840
You've become a nine-tailed fox.

3689
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:02,180
(Lucky boy Lomon saved the king of teasing)

3690
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:00,910
Congratulations.

3691
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:02,780
- What is this? - Let's take a picture.

3692
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,240
- That's amazing. - That's amazing.

3693
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,950
- Nine. - The odds were really low.

3694
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:07,710
The third one from the right.

3695
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:09,820
(Congratulations on winning "Culinary Class Wars 2.")

3696
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,820
- It's crazy. - No way, Braising Master.

3697
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,350
Lomon did it.

3698
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:12,720
Lomon is...

3699
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,850
(Human talisman)

3700
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,520
- Lomon did it. - It's crazy.

3701
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,790
- It's really nine. - It's really awesome.

3702
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,020
(He can't believe it.)

3703
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:18,520
- Your drama will do well. - Right.

3704
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,530
- You need a nine. - Okay.

3705
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,290
(Jong Kook has to pick 9 as well.)

3706
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,860
You have to pick nine.

3707
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,300
- Jong Kook. - Which one should I pick, Lomon?

3708
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:23,500
(Jong Kook's tails)

3709
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:23,460
Goodness.

3710
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,860
It would be really amazing if you got it this time.

3711
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,930
(The place that Lomon, hero of the win, picked)

3712
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,030
The fourth from the left.

3713
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:27,970
- Mister! - One.

3714
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:29,340
(Fourth from the left)

3715
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:29,340
- Mister! - Yes!

3716
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,570
Didn't you turn 50 this year?

3717
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:32,310
- That's right! - Congratulations.

3718
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,140
Goodness.

3719
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:36,810
(He picked the paper with savage remarks.)

3720
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:36,680
You never know. He might get it right again.

3721
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,080
- If he gets it right again... - That won't work.

3722
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,110
You never know.

3723
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:42,050
(Is Lomon's gut right this time?)

3724
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,580
The odds are ridiculous.

3725
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,880
- Hold on. - Nine.

3726
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,080
- It won't work. - But that nine was amazing.

3727
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,090
(Opening half of it first)

3728
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,490
Nine was amazing.

3729
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:47,190
- But that nine was amazing. - Nine was amazing.

3730
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,790
It's round!

3731
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,160
- It's really round. - Look.

3732
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,360
Does it look like this?

3733
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,390
- Yes! It's round. - Like this?

3734
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:58,100
(Is it really the round part of 9 that Jong Kook is looking for?)

3735
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,430
- Does it really look like this? - It's round. It really is.

3736
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:58,260
- Three. - No way.

3737
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:01,400
(What is it?)

3738
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,300
- It's round. It really is. - Three.

3739
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:02,030
It's round.

3740
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,500
- Three. - Eight.

3741
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:03,940
(If it's round...)

3742
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:06,610
- It's 3. - It's 3.

3743
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,640
(It's 3.)

3744
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,210
- Mister! - What?

3745
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:11,340
- Mister! - What?

3746
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,440
(Exclaiming)

3747
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,910
Why did you spoil it...

3748
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:14,210
- even before I opened it? - I guess it, didn't I?

3749
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:15,680
Why are you ruining it?

3750
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:18,150
(They failed to have 9 tails just as the Namcheon-dong guy said.)

3751
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,850
- He flattered you. You got three. - Okay.

3752
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,150
I think Lomon used his luck on this.

3753
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:22,190
(Lomon needs 8.)

3754
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:23,520
- Right. Lomon used it on me. - Lomon...

3755
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:28,430
(Lomon's tails)

3756
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:25,730
Five!

3757
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:27,060
I had a feeling it would be five.

3758
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,530
It's not bad.

3759
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:32,900
(Haha's tails)

3760
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:29,600
Two.

3761
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,060
He didn't get it.

3762
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:32,830
- Two. - What?

3763
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:35,270
(Ji Hyo's tails)

3764
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,070
- Three. - Three. Okay, you're gone.

3765
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:37,570
(Haha and Ji Hyo failed as well.)

3766
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,700
- I'll get six. - Don't get your hopes up.

3767
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:40,570
(It's Ye Eun's turn, the last one.)

3768
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,410
- I need to get six. - How many do you have now?

3769
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:41,410
Three.

3770
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:41,870
(Ye Eun's tails)

3771
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:45,210
(She can transform into the nine-tailed fox if she gets 6.)

3772
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:44,810
- If you have 3, you need 6. - I need 6.

3773
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,850
You can do it, Ye Eun!

3774
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,050
Your chief...

3775
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:50,280
- lives in Namcheon-dong, right? - Lives in Namcheon-dong, right?

3776
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:53,950
If Ye Eun gets it, it would be...

3777
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:55,520
If Ye Eun really gets it...

3778
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:58,020
(Choosing with all her might)

3779
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,720
She'd be using all her luck for this year.

3780
01:30:58,490 --> 01:31:00,790
But Seok Jin's was amazing.

3781
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,790
(She tries opening the paper.)

3782
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:03,260
What?

3783
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,900
(Screaming)

3784
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,930
What?

3785
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:09,300
(She got 6.)

3786
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,430
Really?

3787
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:15,580
(Ye Eun, a regular penalty receiver, completes 9 tails!)

3788
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,640
- I got six. - Really?

3789
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,580
- What? - Really?

3790
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:17,440
(Screaming)

3791
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,650
Congratulations, you became a nine-tailed fox.

3792
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:21,910
(Legendary nine-tailed fox shrieks out of happiness.)

3793
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:21,280
Amazing.

3794
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:25,150
- What's going on today? - It's not fun today.

3795
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:26,250
(Jee and Ji father and daughter became nine-tailed foxes.)

3796
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,350
- Everyone got it. It's not fun. - What is this?

3797
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:29,420
- I really got six. - The Jee and Ji are doing great.

3798
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:31,560
(Everyone's scapegoat turned into nine-tailed foxes.)

3799
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:31,220
- Six. - This doesn't make sense.

3800
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,230
Ye Eun won't be getting the penalty.

3801
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:33,430
The energy is amazing.

3802
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:34,830
- It's amazing. - This doesn't make sense.

3803
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:38,060
Starting From Today, I'm a Nine-Tailed Fox has ended.

3804
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,700
(The race is over.)

3805
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,870
The winners of the race are those who completed the nine tails.

3806
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:41,900
(The final winner of the race)

3807
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:44,040
Yu Jae Seok, Yang Se Chan, Kim Hye Yoon, Jee Seok Jin,

3808
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:47,210
(The 5 of them became the 9-tailed foxes.)

3809
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,610
- Ji Ye Eun. - and Ji Ye Eun.

3810
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,470
These five members.

3811
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:50,110
- Unbelievable. - This is really awesome.

3812
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,250
- We'll get a prize! - We'll get a prize.

3813
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:55,550
Today's prize is a fruit set that foxes like.

3814
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:57,450
(Today's prize: Fruit set)

3815
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:57,480
I like fruits.

3816
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,390
- How nice. - I should give this to Lomon.

3817
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:00,890
(For choosing him)

3818
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:05,160
(The real fox wants a heartwarming story for himself.)

3819
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,360
- Lomon. - That's right!

3820
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,790
- Okay! - Lomon did everything.

3821
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:05,890
Right. Good luck with your drama.

3822
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:07,730
- That's right. - Thank you.

3823
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:10,160
It airs on January 16, right?

3824
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:10,660
(The last remark from the guests)

3825
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,900
Yes. Please enjoy "No Tail to Tell."

3826
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:14,170
(Airing at 9:50pm on Fridays and Saturdays)

3827
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,300
(Those who failed to become nine-tailed foxes...)

3828
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:16,300
- Okay. - It should do well.

3829
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,870
(will reveal their penalty on the Running Man YouTube channel.)

3830
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,970
Let's go, "No Tail to Tell."

3831
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:20,040
- He's good-looking. - Right.

3832
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,710
- It will do well. - All the best!

3833
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:23,010
(We thank Hye Yoon and Lomon, and please enjoy "No Tail to Tell!")

3834
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,310
- What is this? - What is this?

3835
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:26,910
(Running Man's official poster with 16 years of history!)

3836
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:27,210
- We have to shoot a full poster. - This is amazing.

3837
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,410
The concept?

3838
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,320
Our hair will be ruined, and we'll be unclothed.

3839
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,450
(A brand-new full-team poster will be made in the New Year.)

3840
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,750
- Ye Eun will be an avatar. - What is that?

3841
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,550
(Painter Yu pours his artistic passion.)

3842
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,620
(She's horrified.)

3843
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:35,190
I like Yu Jae Seok!

3844
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,420
The Antenna people will shoot in the toilet.

3845
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:37,560
(The bottled-up emotions pour out using the concept as an excuse.)

3846
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,330
- You... - How dare you raise your voice?

3847
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:40,130
(They exchange provocations,)

3848
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:40,490
This...

3849
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:41,690
(and they slowly lose it.)

3850
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,100
Are your parents doing well?

3851
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:43,300
(Suddenly speaking in Chinese)

3852
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,860
(The poster shoot went off the rails.)

3853
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:47,070
(The format is completely flipped.)

3854
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,970
- He looks awkward. - What?

3855
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,370
- What judge is that? - What is that? There's something.

3856
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,070
(A mysterious NPC appears!)

3857
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:52,100
(The NPCs suspiciously wander through the snowy winter field.)

3858
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:52,040
- There are many suspicious people. - They're holding something.

3859
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,670
- What? Judge! - Hold on.

3860
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:55,310
- What is this? - Hold on.

3861
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:55,340
(Secrets are hidden all over their bodies.)

3862
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:56,580
Where should I hide this?

3863
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:58,710
(Only those who manage to keep the secret to the very end...)

3864
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,510
- Awesome. - This can't be hidden.

3865
01:32:58,510 --> 01:32:59,550
The door will open.

3866
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,650
(will be granted access to the poster shoot.)

3867
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:00,550
- Here it is! - Where is it?

3868
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:01,810
- What's wrong with this? - Run!

3869
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,320
(The tiger moths are fully fired up.)

3870
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:02,850
- Run! - Why?

3871
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,750
(Who will be the winner of the TV Rating Notice battle?)

3872
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:05,380
- What's wrong with him? - Haha! Hurry up!

3873
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,750
(TV Rating Notice Survival)

3874
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:10,890
(Running Man)
