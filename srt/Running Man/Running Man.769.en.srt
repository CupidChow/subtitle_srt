1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,840
Hello.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,840
Why am I alone here?

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,010
Hello, Jae Seok.

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,280
You suddenly say hello to me.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,680
Hello. What is going on?

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,390
Today, the members will
have the opening separately...

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,690
- in different places.
- Okay.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,390
What is it? What are we doing today?
I have no idea.

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,190
- One, two, three. Hello.
- Hello.

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,630
- Hello.
- What is going on?

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,500
- Besides Dosan Park,
- Okay.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,770
which place comes to mind
when you think of Gangnam?

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,870
When I think of Gangnam?

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,610
A place that comes to mind
when I think of Gangnam?

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,710
- A place?
- Yes.

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,080
Gosh, I'm doomed.

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,580
(Gangnam's representative landmark)

18
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,750
(Jamwon Hangang Riverside Park)

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,890
(Bongeun Temple)

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,850
(Coex Mall)

21
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,920
(Apgujeong Rodeo Street)

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,990
(G department store)

23
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,200
(There are countless
other attractions in Gangnam.)

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,600
Tower Records?

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,000
- What?
- Tower Records.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,300
- Tower?
- Tower Records.

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,500
Is it still there? Tower Records.

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,510
- Why did it come to mind?
- Tower?

29
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,610
Records.

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,210
(The record ship in Gangnam
disappeared 15 years ago.)

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,140
The New York Bakery
near Gangnam Station.

32
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,650
It's gone now.

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,920
Hang on. Let me think.
When I think of Gangnam?

34
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,080
There are a lot of places.

35
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,620
There's the Han River.

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,620
Jamwon Hangang Riverside Park.
There's a cafe.

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,190
Come to think of it, that's where
Ji Hyo and I became a couple.

38
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,560
- Will you drive?
- We drove there.

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,900
(It's the place where they recently
enjoyed delicious ramyeon.)

40
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,770
There's Bongeun Temple.

41
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,140
(They recently had a shoot
at Bongeun Temple.)

42
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,840
(A place where they had the mission
with Jae Seok's drawing)

43
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,940
Apgujeong comes to mind
when I think of Gangnam.

44
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,610
Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

45
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:53,450
(Rodeo Street is a place
in Gangnam beloved by the members.)

46
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,090
- G department store.
- New York Center.

47
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,620
- Coex Mall.
- Kyobo Tower.

48
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,590
- Apgujeong Station.
- L department store.

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,990
Garosu-gil.

50
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,330
There are a few places.

51
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,800
- There are a lot.
- Tell us the place...

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,870
you most want to go to now,

53
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,700
and we will go there.

54
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,770
We just go there?

55
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Really?

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,240
- Just go to a place I want?
- Yes.

57
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,340
There's the Han River Park.

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,780
Is that possible?
Can I go to the Han River Park?

59
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,050
I'll go to the Han River Park. Okay.

60
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,120
It's close. Should I take this van?

61
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,650
Am I going just like this? What?

62
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,820
Right now?

63
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,020
Am I going there just like this?

64
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,860
Yes. We will go
to the place you mentioned.

65
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,690
Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

66
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,830
I'm going to Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

67
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,460
What is happening now?

68
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,570
What are we doing today?

69
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,100
- The Han River. Okay.
- Go.

70
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,200
Landmark?

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
What are we doing today?

72
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,670
Once we get to the Han River Park,

73
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,340
- Will you tell me?
- I'll tell you the rules.

74
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,810
If I said...

75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,650
Sinsa Station instead of Garosu-gil,
would I be going there?

76
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,910
Really?

77
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,950
It depends on my answer.

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,790
I think we're supposed
to gather in one place.

79
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,490
Telepathy?

80
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,060
Should we give the same answer?

81
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,230
There would be at least one person
with the same answer.

82
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,300
There's a dental clinic
Se Chan goes to near here.

83
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,370
The dental treatment
I'm getting now is...

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,770
the gum treatment.

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,300
My gums have become weak.

86
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,810
- Really?
- Yes.

87
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,210
I wonder how the other members
have strong gums.

88
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,980
Do they go to the dentist regularly?

89
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,850
Why are they sending me hearts?

90
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,850
Are they fans of mine?
Why are they sending hearts?

91
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,960
Are we having a fan meet today?

92
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,820
Garosu-gil.

93
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,860
I live nearby, but it's been a while
since I've been here.

94
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,200
Which part of Garosu-gil
are we going to ?

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,760
The place with Jennie's photo?

96
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,030
- Do you want to go there?
- Yes. Let's go there.

97
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,170
I saw that passing by,
but I've never stayed there.

98
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,270
I want to take a picture
with Jennie.

99
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,610
Jennie, I'm coming to see you now.

100
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,910
To see your photo.

101
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,910
Hi, Jennie.

102
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,950
The color is...

103
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,980
(He happens to be wearing
the same color as Jennie.)

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,890
(Double-V)

105
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,990
(An old-fashioned pose
at a trendy place)

106
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,790
Jennie. I'll wait for you.

107
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,130
I'll tell you today's rules
in front of Jennie.

108
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,660
Today's rules?
What are they? I'm so curious.

109
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,830
The members are
currently scattered...

110
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,200
to the places they chose.

111
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,270
Are we supposed to be of one mind?

112
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,570
If all the members
gather in one place...

113
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,040
within the 20-minute time limit,
you will have a race...

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,150
- with no penalties and only prizes.
- Really?

115
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,510
If you fail to gather
within the given time,

116
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,520
a member will be added
every 20 minutes for the penalty.

117
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,820
(1 member will get added
every 20 minutes for the penalty.)

118
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,920
No way.

119
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,090
This is ridiculous.

120
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,860
I should've given it
more thought then.

121
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,090
You can't use your cellphone.

122
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,630
How can we gather then?

123
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,160
We can't use our phones?

124
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,530
I need to look at the map.

125
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,130
(Until they are gathered,
they can't use their phones.)

126
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,270
Here's mine.

127
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,470
You can communicate
with the members...

128
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,310
using a walkie-talkie
within a 300m range.

129
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,110
What is this?

130
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,350
(They can communicate
only through the walkie-talkie.)

131
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,850
Hello? Can you hear me?

132
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,420
We can use the walkie-talkie
within the 300m range?

133
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,420
(They have to get closer
to each other through guesswork.)

134
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,550
Is anyone there?

135
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,890
Is anyone around?

136
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,390
Does it work
only within the 300m range?

137
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,590
- We should hurry.
- Twenty minutes?

138
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,800
Only using the walkie-talkie?

139
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,960
Did she say 300m?

140
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,830
Can anyone hear me?

141
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,900
Do you hear me or not?

142
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,970
- Who is it?
- Is anyone around?

143
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,100
Apgujeong, do you copy?

144
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,240
- Over. Apgujeong.
- Over.

145
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,870
Hello? Do you hear me?

146
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,040
(Jae Seok is at
the Jamwon Hangang Riverside Park.)

147
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,380
Does it work
only within the 300m range?

148
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,780
Yes. Only within the 300m range.

149
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
So it means nobody is around.

150
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,250
Hello?

151
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,050
How can there be nobody here?
Jamwon Hangang Park?

152
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,090
Should I walk around here?

153
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,060
Hello? Do you copy?

154
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,660
I think at least
one person would be around.

155
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,730
Do you copy?

156
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,430
There's the Han River.

157
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,130
(Haha was the first
to mention the Han River.)

158
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,930
The center of Gangnam is still...

159
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,540
Apgujeong.

160
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
The Bongeun Temple.

161
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,240
(After all that thinking,
did Haha pick the Han River?)

162
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,040
I will stay here
for just five minutes.

163
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,450
I might be able to meet someone.

164
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,780
Do you copy?

165
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,850
(He starts the search.)

166
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,520
Do you copy?

167
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,350
There's litter everywhere.

168
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,650
(There's litter everywhere.)

169
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,820
Come on.

170
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,330
What's wrong with you people?

171
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,660
If you drank it,
you should put it in the bin.

172
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,700
(Instead of members,
he ran into litter.)

173
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,300
Why would you toss it here?

174
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,630
(Why would you toss it here?)

175
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,770
I need to complete the mission.

176
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,470
I have a mission to complete.

177
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,510
(His mission is to save Earth.)

178
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,070
This person either sat here...

179
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,010
or here.

180
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,610
- So why would you...
- Come in.

181
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,380
Over.

182
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,550
- So why would you...
- Come in.

183
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,280
Over.

184
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,450
(Jae Seok hears
a radio transmission.)

185
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,320
- Over.
- Where are you? Over.

186
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,990
(Is someone around?)

187
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,120
Where are you? Over.

188
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,360
- Over.
- Haha.

189
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,630
(He spots Haha.)

190
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,790
(Haha was lost
in the parking lot too.)

191
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,800
Hey.

192
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
(Haha was lost
in the parking lot too.)

193
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,300
(5 minutes into the race,
the dream team reunited.)

194
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,070
I knew you would
come to the Han River.

195
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,170
(5 minutes into the race,
the dream team reunited.)

196
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,500
I knew you would
come to the Han River.

197
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
What's that?

198
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,770
- I was...
- What?

199
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,740
- What is it?
- I was waiting here.

200
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,580
- Did you pick up trash?
- There was too much...

201
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,310
- litter everywhere. Look.
- Right.

202
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,610
- Goodness.
- How can they just leave it here?

203
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,880
(Environmental class
from the get-go)

204
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
- Jae Seok.
- There's the trash bin.

205
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,050
- Hey.
- The trash bin is just here.

206
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,590
(Upset)

207
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,490
This is just wrong.

208
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,120
(He leaves Haha behind
and works hard to protect Earth.)

209
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,590
This is wrong.

210
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,060
Wait. At least I met one person.
This is what's important.

211
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,700
- The litter distracted me.
- Jae Seok.

212
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,330
- We're at the Han River.
- Right.

213
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,630
Shouldn't we eat ramyeon?

214
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,070
We have to gather in 20 minutes.
Don't you know?

215
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,640
You must be out of your mind.

216
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,740
Are you in your right mind or what?

217
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,840
Why would you do this?

218
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,940
Have you lost your mind?

219
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,010
- Come.
- We're...

220
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,280
at the Han River.
Perhaps a banana milk then?

221
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,380
Gosh, we have to
gather in 20 minutes.

222
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,620
- Jae Seok.
- What?

223
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,650
We are at the Han River.

224
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,320
So what?

225
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
(While the two
with different motives argue...)

226
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,560
- We are at the Han River.
- We have to find them.

227
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,720
I know.

228
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,930
Hey, where are you?

229
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,500
(Seok Sam says hello
to Jennie at Garosu-gil.)

230
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,960
Jennie, I will see you
on Running Man.

231
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,300
Can anyone...

232
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,240
Can anyone hear my voice?

233
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,570
I feel like I'm in a movie.

234
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,340
Where on earth are you?

235
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,810
I don't know what year this is.

236
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,210
I'm stranded here alone.

237
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,150
Find me, guys.

238
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,650
Class President!

239
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,480
Class President, where are you?

240
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,950
Class President, where are you?

241
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,620
Gosh.

242
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,060
Hello.

243
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,220
(Immersed in the play,
Seok Sam goes in circles nonstop.)

244
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,390
Where are you?

245
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,390
Or perhaps...

246
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,300
We've done a lot of missions
at the Han River.

247
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,100
Some must've
thought of the Han River.

248
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,440
If we stay here,

249
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,540
- everyone else will come.
- You're wrong.

250
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,410
If we leave,
we will miss each other.

251
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,480
Not many people have
memories here at the Han River.

252
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,010
I knew you would come here.

253
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,550
- I knew you would come here.
- You did?

254
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,020
- I really did.
- I knew you would come here.

255
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,020
I will go to the Jamwon District.

256
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,550
There has to be at least
one person at the Han River.

257
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,520
I am certain
there will be someone there.

258
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,030
I remember us going there
and shopping.

259
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,560
They must've remembered that.

260
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
I believe more than
one person will be there.

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,230
It's here.

262
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,900
(Seok Sam arrives at the Han River.)

263
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,940
Guys.

264
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,200
- Come here.
- Let's have ramyeon.

265
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,170
We can't.

266
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,210
Hey.

267
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,370
(Trying the radio)

268
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,540
There's the convenience store.

269
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,150
Gosh, that startled me.

270
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,710
(He hears the radio!)

271
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,750
Gosh.

272
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,120
That frightened me.

273
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,250
Who is it?

274
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,550
Someone must be here.

275
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,590
Someone must be here.

276
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,360
(He hurriedly gets off
in front of the convenience store.)

277
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,290
Who is it?

278
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,660
Jong Kook.

279
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,600
(The two are unresponsive.
Where are they?)

280
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,300
Please go straight
towards Galleria Department Store.

281
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,940
Hello?

282
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,140
While eating ramyeon...

283
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,270
Come.

284
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,540
Come on.

285
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,040
We're not here
to eat ramyeon, are we?

286
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,740
Let's get out of here.

287
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,880
Hello?

288
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,580
(Jae Seok talked on the radio
on the way out of the Han River.)

289
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,750
(Seok Sam passed right behind him.)

290
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,250
(The radio connected for just
a moment as they passed each other.)

291
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,890
- I think...
- They must be at Galleria.

292
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,820
Come in.

293
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,290
Do you copy or not?

294
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,890
Please go there.

295
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,060
Apgujeong Intersection.

296
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
- Let's...
- Near Apgujeong Station.

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,030
(They move towards
Apgujeong Station.)

298
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,030
(Drifting farther apart)

299
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,870
- This is super frustrating.
- Gosh.

300
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,440
We would've met everyone
if we had ramyeon.

301
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,900
Come on.

302
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,610
You are...

303
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,640
- Why don't you trust me?
- How can you be...

304
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,240
so thoughtless?

305
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,010
You move around too much.

306
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,480
That's why you always miss everyone.

307
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,180
- Over there...
- Twenty minutes have passed,

308
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,420
so one more person
will be penalized.

309
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,650
Hey.

310
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,490
Let's go to Dongho Bridge.

311
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,460
Wait. Where are you now?

312
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,290
This is Apgujeong Station.

313
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,430
It's here.

314
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,730
Do you copy?

315
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,360
Hello.

316
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,130
Do you have a moment?

317
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,900
Have you seen
the members of Running Man?

318
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,100
- Today.
- Today?

319
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,440
- I just saw Im Woo Il.
- Woo Il?

320
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,840
(Im Woo Il?)

321
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,340
He was filming.

322
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,510
- Woo Il?
- Yes.

323
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,740
Is he the guest?

324
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,780
Im Woo Il?

325
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,380
He's not a member of Running Man.

326
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,950
- He was dressed like a zookeeper.
- A zookeeper.

327
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,490
- He was dressed like a zookeeper.
- Yes.

328
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,650
Is Woo Il keeping us?

329
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,360
Is he like a zookeeper
who's coming after us?

330
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,290
He must be the one coming after us.

331
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,860
(While Seok Sam is obsessing
over Woo Il, who's not a guest...)

332
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,260
Hello? Where are you?

333
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,860
Where are you?

334
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,730
The signal keeps cutting out.

335
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,800
(Se Chan is
at Apgujeong Rodeo Street.)

336
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,830
Is it this way?

337
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,030
(Se Chan is
at Apgujeong Rodeo Street.)

338
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640
Hey, it's not the time
to look at that.

339
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,940
(Is he with someone?)

340
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,970
- It's...
- When I was filming...

341
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,410
"High Kick 2,"

342
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,380
I got my fortune read here.

343
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,350
With Hwang Jung Eum.

344
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,350
Apgujeong comes to my mind
first when I think of Gangnam.

345
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,520
Apgujeong Rodeo Street?

346
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,820
If we leave out Dosan Park,

347
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,250
Jae Seok is definitely
going to mention Apgujeong.

348
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,650
The boxing gym Jong Kook goes to...

349
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,260
is in Apgujeong, isn't it?

350
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,590
That's what I know.

351
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,790
Who are you?

352
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,360
- It's me, Se Chan.
- Who is it?

353
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,900
I'm Daniel.

354
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,830
(The Apgujeong Duo met
6 minutes into the race.)

355
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,230
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Gosh.

356
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,270
- Should we move?
- We should.

357
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,440
I don't think they are here.

358
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,540
(Together, they search
for other members.)

359
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,840
Do you hear my voice?

360
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,980
It's him.

361
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,210
Where are you, Daniel?

362
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,550
Answer me if you hear me.

363
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,580
(Taking turns trying the radio)

364
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,420
(Someone talks.)

365
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,780
Where are you?

366
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,920
(Someone is nearby!)

367
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,560
Where are you, Ssaebssaeb?

368
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,190
I'm at
the Apgujeong Rodeo Intersection.

369
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,760
(The voice in the radio
was Jae Seok!)

370
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,930
Where are you?

371
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,400
I'm at Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

372
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,230
I'm at
the Apgujeong Rodeo Intersection.

373
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,240
(They were just passing
Apgujeong Rodeo Street.)

374
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Where are you now?

375
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm at the main
Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

376
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,140
The main Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

377
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,780
Sir, please go
to the main Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

378
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,540
The main street.

379
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,980
You know where
Jun Ha's old restaurant is, right?

380
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,080
The main street.

381
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,250
You know where
Jun Ha's old restaurant is, right?

382
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,320
I hear you well now.

383
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,050
- The signal is good.
- Nice.

384
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,420
(They got the specific place.)

385
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,190
Come in, this is Eagle.

386
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,820
Please tell us...

387
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,160
There they are. The two of them.

388
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,190
- They are coming.
- There.

389
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,230
Roger.

390
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,460
We're here.

391
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,930
There they are.

392
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,100
There are two of them.

393
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,570
There are two of them here.

394
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,800
- Please stop here.
- Okay.

395
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,810
Okay.

396
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,580
(The 4 of them meet
at Apgujeong Rodeo Street.)

397
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,680
- They came together.
- They came together.

398
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,210
- We met at the Han River.
- You two met.

399
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,210
- Goodness.
- Where did you go?

400
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,980
- Your voice has gone hoarse.
- Where have you been?

401
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,180
We were at the Han River.

402
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,650
Ye Eun and Ji Hyo are missing.

403
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,590
- I wonder where Ji Hyo might be.
- Ji Hyo...

404
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,120
She must be moving around.

405
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,420
Did you go to the Han River?

406
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,820
I went to the Han River.
Near Apgujeong.

407
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,260
- We were on Rodeo...
- He found me.

408
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
You two met.

409
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,430
We met here
at Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

410
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,500
- You met here.
- Yes.

411
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,600
- Wait. I hear someone.
- I hear someone.

412
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,900
Hello?

413
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Hey.

414
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,330
It's Jong Kook.

415
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,640
Where are you, Kook Jong?

416
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,140
- Kook Jong.
- He must be in a car.

417
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,010
Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

418
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,510
We are at Apgujeong Rodeo Street.
Where are you?

419
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,380
I think we lost him.

420
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,250
Why doesn't he speak?

421
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,180
I'm in front of
Apgujeong Middle School.

422
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,550
(Jong Kook is in front
of Apgujeong Middle School.)

423
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,990
I'm in front of
Apgujeong Middle School.

424
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,490
Apgujeong is the center of Gangnam.

425
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,620
(Apgujeong is
the center of Gangnam.)

426
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,020
Apgujeong is the center of Gangnam.

427
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,530
Let's go!

428
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,760
The most expensive apartment.
Hyundai Apartment.

429
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,770
I'm in front of
Apgujeong Middle School.

430
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,430
Hello?

431
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,900
It's our car.

432
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,900
- I'm...
- Hello?

433
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,910
I'm in front of Hyundai Apartment.

434
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,940
- He must be in a car.
- Kook Jong.

435
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,410
- Is he in a car?
- Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

436
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,480
I'm at Hyundai Apartment,
in front of Apgujeong Middle School.

437
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,920
I'm in front
of Apgujeong Middle School.

438
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,660
(Jong Kook can't hear anything
on the radio.)

439
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,160
(Since Jong Kook doesn't take risks,
he keeps standing there.)

440
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,130
I'm at Hyundai Apartment.

441
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,830
(Will they be able to unite?)

442
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,440
Kook Jong.

443
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,270
I heard Jong Kook's voice.

444
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,440
Kook Jong?

445
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,110
- Let's wait here.
- We should wait here.

446
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,680
Or maybe over there.

447
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,140
One should stand there
while one stands here.

448
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,410
Let's spread out.

449
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,710
- Look.
- A van is approaching.

450
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,550
(Just then,
a familiar van approaches them.)

451
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,180
- Who is it?
- Who's there?

452
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,020
It's not one of ours.
There aren't any cameras.

453
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,650
- What?
- Why are you pointing...

454
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,220
- at someone else's van?
- Sorry.

455
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,590
- That's not one of ours.
- No?

456
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,330
- No?
- There isn't a camera.

457
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,260
- We're sorry.
- Guys, let's spread out.

458
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,260
- Spread out.
- Cover more distance.

459
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,300
The four of us should spread out.

460
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,330
- Sure.
- I'll head that way.

461
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,970
- Come with me. Sure.
- Spread out.

462
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,770
Seok Jin.

463
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,770
(The four members spread out
to search for the others.)

464
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,970
Seok Sam?

465
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,740
Ji Ye Eun, Zoned-out Ji Hyo.

466
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,640
Kook Jong?

467
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,180
Can anyone hear me? This is Daniel.

468
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,680
Hey, who's this?

469
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,810
Hello? Hey, who's this?

470
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,180
Hey, who's this?

471
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,750
I'm getting confused
now that we're not together.

472
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,760
You startled me.
I thought you were Jong Kook.

473
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,690
- I'm at the entrance,
- Jong Kook?

474
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,530
but I can't hear a thing.

475
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,830
I can't see him even though
he should be around here.

476
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,600
That means we need to get
on the road.

477
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,500
Gather at the arcade.

478
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,200
(They end up gathering again.)

479
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
There's no one here.

480
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,870
Haha, where are you?

481
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,840
We're running out of time.

482
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
Let's get moving.

483
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,650
Guys, hop in.

484
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,980
I can't hear anyone
on the radio anymore.

485
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,410
The four of us have gathered.

486
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,220
Jong Kook, where are you?

487
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,490
- Didn't we hear Jong Kook's voice?
- We did.

488
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,990
Where on earth is Ye Eun and Ji Hyo?

489
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,490
She could've gone to a place like
Bongeun Temple.

490
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,290
- No way.
- She could've thought of a place...

491
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,600
- We were there.
- we recently went to on the show.

492
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,660
That's Bongeun Temple.

493
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,400
(30 minutes ago)

494
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,530
(Ji Hyo really went
to Bongeun Temple.)

495
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,740
- Ye Eun! No way.
- Ji Hyo.

496
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,140
We're the only ones who came here.
No way.

497
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,010
- Ji Hyo, my gosh.
- This is incredible.

498
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,510
Isn't this the only place
you can come?

499
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,440
I thought of this place
since we were recently here.

500
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,180
- Exactly.
- That's what I thought.

501
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,510
Here's what I think. The others...

502
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,480
didn't think of the temple.

503
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,980
We don't come to this area often.

504
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,120
Haha and Se Chan...

505
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,520
could've gone to Garosu-gil.

506
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,590
Let's go there.

507
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,960
Garosu-gil, Sinsa.

508
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,530
I'm so glad I met you here, Ye Eun.

509
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,530
Tell me about it.
I couldn't do this by myself.

510
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,030
- Seriously.
- I'd get lonely doing this alone.

511
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,770
By the way, did you hear Ji Hyo
or Ye Eun on the radio?

512
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,730
Why can't we hear Ji Hyo or Ye Eun?

513
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,100
Can't anyone hear me?

514
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,800
Hold on. That's Seok Jin's voice.

515
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,270
Isn't that Jong Kook's voice?

516
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,110
- That's Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin.

517
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,640
- Anyone?
- Ask where he is.

518
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,780
Who's there?

519
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,250
(On the road,
they came closer to Jong Kook.)

520
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,310
(Jong Kook is now
within radio range.)

521
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,850
I heard someone just now.

522
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,050
This is Haha.

523
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,360
We'll come find you,
so stay where you are.

524
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,460
How can he come to me
when he doesn't know where I am?

525
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,830
I'm at Hyundai Apartment
in Apgujeong.

526
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
I'm at Hyundai Apartment...

527
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,370
in front of Apgujeong Middle School.

528
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,770
- Apgujeong Middle School?
- The middle school.

529
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,070
Apgujeong Middle School?

530
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,500
Okay, copy.

531
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,240
As you know, this is a wide street.

532
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,710
He won't be able to find me here.

533
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,610
Let's meet in front
of Galleria Department Store.

534
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,680
(It's close by.)

535
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,220
(He changes the rendezvous point
to a better meeting spot.)

536
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,250
Okay, the band can get together now.

537
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,560
- We've got this.
- All right.

538
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,620
(Meanwhile in the van)

539
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,830
- I'll buy this just for you.
- Won't he be there?

540
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,190
- I'll enjoy, Haha.
- Ji Hyo and Ye Eun...

541
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,360
What are you two eating?

542
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,960
- Galleria Department Store.
- Are you kidding me?

543
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,000
(Some were busy eating
and one was busy scolding them,)

544
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,400
(so they didn't hear Jong Kook
on the radio.)

545
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,910
I'll wait in front
of Galleria Department Store.

546
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,580
(Jong Kook heads
to Galleria Department Store.)

547
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,550
I'm heading
to Galleria Department Store.

548
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,150
That's your problem, you know.

549
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,780
(They missed Jong Kook's radio
once again.)

550
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,820
This is exactly why
I tell you off all the time.

551
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,890
(In the end, they make a left
instead of taking a right...)

552
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,990
(toward the department store.)

553
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,660
- Did you see us?
- You just couldn't help yourselves.

554
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,560
(They arrive at the middle school
not knowing Jong Kook had left.)

555
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,330
That's the middle school.

556
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,330
(The original rendezvous point)

557
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,900
Unless he crossed the street...

558
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,700
Didn't he say
he was at the middle school?

559
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,670
- That's right.
- Let's keep the windows open.

560
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,740
Wouldn't he be at the front gate
of the middle school?

561
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,510
Where on earth is he?

562
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,710
(Jong Kook's already gone.)

563
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,280
Jong Kook, where are you?

564
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,120
I'm on my way
to Galleria Department Store.

565
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,890
(Like I said I would)

566
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,590
(They were late to learn
that he had moved.)

567
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,260
You said you were
at Apgujeong Middle School.

568
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,130
I was there,

569
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,930
but I said I was heading
to Galleria Department Store.

570
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,800
Apgujeong...

571
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,100
(The two vans drove
in opposite directions.)

572
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,970
Should I head back
to Apgujeong Middle School?

573
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,340
(Apgujeong Middle School,
Galleria Department Store)

574
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,440
This is exactly
why our parents told us...

575
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,510
to stay only in one place
if we ever lost track of them.

576
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,040
It was so we would
not miss each other.

577
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,980
(Playing-it-safe Kim
just missed the others.)

578
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,850
I'm headed
to Galleria Department Store.

579
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,980
Should I stay in Apgujeong?

580
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,750
Just tell him to stay there.

581
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,050
- That's right.
- Tell him to stay there.

582
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,150
Jong Kook, head
to Galleria Department Store.

583
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,060
Forty minutes have passed,

584
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,590
- Darn.
- and two will receive...

585
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,090
- a penalty.
- Stop it already!

586
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,160
(40 minutes have passed,
so 2 will receive a penalty.)

587
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,300
We would've met him already...

588
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,300
had you two not stopped
by the convenience store.

589
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,800
We're nearly
at Galleria Department Store.

590
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,300
- Okay, got it.
- Okay.

591
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,410
The number of people
getting a penalty keeps growing.

592
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,210
We'll all get a penalty
at this rate.

593
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,210
I can't believe
it's taking us this long.

594
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,380
I heard Seok Jin's voice,
so where did he go?

595
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,320
My guess is that
they're at the Han River.

596
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,980
No way.

597
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,850
I think Seok Jin's driving around
in a van.

598
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,820
Guys.

599
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,990
(That is correct.)

600
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,930
Guys?

601
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,560
Guys.

602
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,330
Where are you?

603
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,300
Who's this?

604
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,970
Isn't this Ddochi?

605
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,770
Ddochi?

606
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,440
Garosu-gil.

607
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,340
Garosu-gil?

608
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,610
Seok Jin, this is Ye Eun!

609
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,710
(While wandering around, he managed
to get in touch with Ye Eun.)

610
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,620
- Where are you?
- I'm at Garosu-gil.

611
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,320
It's where the coffee shop
used to be.

612
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,250
Got it. Stay right there.

613
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,820
(Wanderer Jee
heads straight to Garosu-gil!)

614
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,420
Where are you?

615
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,690
Ye Eun!

616
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,260
- Where are you?
- What?

617
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,430
- Ye Eun!
- What?

618
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,930
(They could hear Ye Eun on the radio
even in Jae Seok's car!)

619
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,630
- Where are you?
- Galleria Department Store.

620
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,570
(They heard her on their way
to the department store.)

621
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,470
(Garosu-gil)

622
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,740
Where are you?

623
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,210
- Garosu-gil.
- Garosu-gil.

624
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,040
They were at Garosu-gil.

625
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,540
Should we tell her to stay there?

626
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,580
- Tell her to stay there.
- Stay at Garosu-gil.

627
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,080
They should stay there.

628
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,820
Stay at Garosu-gil.

629
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,220
Okay, the band can get together now.

630
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,520
- We can do this.
- All right.

631
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,890
There he is on the left.

632
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,020
- Where?
- Where?

633
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,030
I think I see him
in the neon T-shirt.

634
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,600
He's over there. Unbelievable.

635
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,030
Okay!

636
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,200
He needs to hurry.

637
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,230
(They finally meet Jong Kook
outside Galleria Department Store.)

638
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,240
- Yes!
- All right!

639
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,700
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

640
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,140
Hurry and close the door.

641
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,240
- Sure.
- We need to get going.

642
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,570
We'll get Ye Eun at Garosu-gil.

643
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,110
Two people are already set
to face a penalty today.

644
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,480
Keep trying the others on the radio.

645
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,980
Who's at Garosu-gil?

646
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,180
(They arrive at Garosu-gil
with 3 minutes remaining.)

647
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,250
- I'm getting nervous now.
- Tell me about it.

648
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,820
We're entering Garosu-gil.

649
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,120
- We're here!
- I hear them.

650
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,730
Stay on the main road.

651
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,430
Meet us out in the street.

652
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,500
Come to the main road.

653
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,130
Where are you? We're at Garosu-gil.

654
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,530
(Only 2 minutes left.
They should see the van by now.)

655
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,470
Stay on the main road of Garosu-gil.

656
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,470
This is the main road.

657
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,440
No, we're on the main road.

658
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,970
I think I see them.

659
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,240
Answer me if you can hear me.

660
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,810
Who's that? Where are they?

661
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,010
Who's that? Where are they?
Aren't they them?

662
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,850
- Hello.
- Gosh, hello.

663
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,650
- Goodness. It's Ryu Hye Young.
- What?

664
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,960
Gosh, hello.
You're not joining us today, are you?

665
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,560
- I'm not.
- You're not?

666
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,960
- Bye.
- Have a good day.

667
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,960
Can you wave? Wave for us.

668
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,330
I see them behind the car.

669
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,730
- I see her. They're all here.
- The rest are here!

670
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,070
They're all here.

671
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,240
- The rest are all here.
- Even Ji Hyo?

672
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,470
- Where?
- What's going on?

673
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,540
(All the members have gathered.)

674
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Who's there?

675
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,040
- Let's head out of the van.
- They already met.

676
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,440
- We'll get out.
- I see.

677
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,880
- Ji Hyo's here too. What a relief.
- You were all here.

678
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,280
What a relief.

679
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,750
- We were able to gather.
- We actually got together.

680
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,490
- You all managed to gather.
- We did it.

681
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,290
However,
because 60 minutes have passed,

682
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,450
- three people...
- Three?

683
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,620
will receive a penalty today.

684
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,660
It only took us an hour,
which is good enough.

685
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,460
Now, let's move
to where the race will take place.

686
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,160
- Sure.
- Let's go!

687
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,330
I got emotional doing that.

688
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,830
It felt like I was living
in a real-life episode of "Signal."

689
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,430
I haven't been here in a while.

690
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,040
This place? It's been a while.

691
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
- What's this?
- What is this place?

692
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,610
(A door with a digital lock
and an R sticker?)

693
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,280
A combination... There's no code?
Shouldn't there be a code?

694
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,910
Was there such a place?
I've never been to the basement.

695
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,780
What's this place? What's going on?

696
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,020
(Puzzled)

697
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,890
What? Hey, this place...

698
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,990
- This place...
- Hello.

699
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,120
- It's nice and spacious.
- Gosh.

700
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,060
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

701
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,390
What is all this?

702
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,030
The current time
is a little over 11 a.m.,

703
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,370
and you all got together
after an hour,

704
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,070
- so three of you will be penalized.
- Three of us.

705
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,570
Today's race is called
Time Attack Win, Lose Fighter...

706
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,140
where every minute
and second counts.

707
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,680
If you finish every task
and go home before 4 p.m.,

708
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,080
you win a prize and are exempt
from the penalty.

709
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,550
If we succeed to go home.

710
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,390
- Go home by 4 p.m.
- We just have to go home.

711
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,420
- How...
- Oh, dear.

712
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,860
You went all over Gangnam
looking for each other,

713
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,430
- so you must be hungry.
- Yes.

714
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,430
Here's your first task.

715
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,130
It's Jeon So Min's idea.

716
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,670
- What? Jeon So Min?
- It's Jeon So Min's idea.

717
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,100
- What? Jeon So Min?
- Yes.

718
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,840
- Jeon So Min?
- You're in touch?

719
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,970
- So Min?
- You're in touch?

720
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,670
She sends us games for you to play.

721
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,140
So Min sends you stuff?

722
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,180
- For real?
- Was this discussed?

723
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,480
Do you pay her?

724
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,150
- Tell her to come on.
- She can play here.

725
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,650
Seok Jin, you met up with her.

726
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,680
Yes.

727
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,150
- Good luck!
- She suggested this first game.

728
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,320
The first task is a game
that's popular on short-form reels.

729
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,790
It's called
Cook to a Three-Minute Song.

730
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,390
- What's that?
- A song?

731
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,690
- It's an individual race...
- Really?

732
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,790
where one person...

733
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,600
sings the cooking instructions
on how to prepare a dish...

734
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,030
- that takes three minutes.
- What then?

735
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,470
Two other people must listen
to the instructions and follow them.

736
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,500
Within three minutes.

737
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,270
You gain one point each time
you cook a dish successfully.

738
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:07,640
(Each time you follow the recipe,
you gain 1 point.)

739
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,580
After 3 minutes, the other members
will taste and judge the 2 dishes,

740
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,920
- and the better one wins points.
- There could be soy sauce.

741
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,550
- Food...
- The more points you get,

742
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,020
the easier it'll be
for you to go home.

743
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,060
Okay.

744
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,990
- It's an individual race.
- It's an individual race.

745
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,390
- I can't memorize stuff.
- We need to do well.

746
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,860
- We selected the first group...
- I'm pretty good at this.

747
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,570
to try the game.

748
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,470
- Oh, really?
- The first two participants are...

749
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,640
Se Chan and Seok Jin.

750
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,070
- Seok Sam?
- We compete?

751
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,210
- We cook?
- The song...

752
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,110
- will be sung by Jae Seok.
- Me?

753
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,580
- Jae Seok. Okay.
- Okay.

754
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,780
Here are some extra instructions.

755
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,680
If the two cooks just can't keep up,

756
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,750
you can sing
the same instructions repeatedly.

757
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,920
- I see.
- Okay.

758
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,190
- It must be hard.
- But by the time the song ends,

759
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,590
you must sing the complete recipe.

760
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,090
- Is it three minutes?
- If you sing slowly at first,

761
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,660
you must speed up
toward the end, and the singing...

762
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,300
- Is that so?
- could turn into rapping.

763
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,760
- Shouldn't you sing to a ballad?
- This game...

764
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,000
- It must be hard.
- This is hard.

765
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Can the two cooks
go to their spots...

766
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,370
- behind the table?
- Okay.

767
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,540
We'll react.

768
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,340
- Gosh, this...
- Keep your wits about you.

769
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,950
- Seok Sam and... Stay alert.
- Okay.

770
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,950
Yes.

771
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,780
(Scoping out the worktop)

772
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,650
Oligosaccharide.
Wait, let me see what stuff...

773
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,650
(Various sauces and ingredients)

774
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,790
Vinegar, oligosaccharide, oil.

775
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,290
How do I sing this in three minutes?

776
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,060
- Oil, chili powder.
- This isn't easy at all.

777
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,590
The first dish you will make...

778
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,630
is pad thai with beef loin.

779
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,100
- Pad thai with beef loin?
- Pad thai with beef loin?

780
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,830
- That must be hard to cook.
- What's that?

781
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,000
What's pad thai?

782
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,640
The Thai noodle dish.

783
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,270
- It's stir-fried.
- Slightly sweet.

784
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,270
It sounds good.

785
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,240
- Hey!
- I know how to make it.

786
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,310
I love to eat this when I drink.

787
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,480
Stir-fried rice noodles.

788
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,750
- Yes.
- I see.

789
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,280
Oyster sauce and...
It's easy to make.

790
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,420
You need to move quickly.

791
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,050
Se Chan's a good cook.

792
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,660
We'll begin the first mission.

793
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,790
You won't tease, will you?

794
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,690
Pronounce everything properly.

795
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,630
Play the music.

796
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,730
Follow the order.

797
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
- This is hard.
- There are lots of choices.

798
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,670
- "Yellow Jacket."
- Sing to "Yellow Jacket."

799
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,900
"Yellow Jacket" is Jin Sung's... No.

800
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
- This song...
- It's Kang Jin's song.

801
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,270
It's not bad. It's not too fast.

802
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,410
- No.
- Yellow jacket.

803
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,010
Let's go.

804
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,380
(The time limit is 3 minutes.)

805
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,540
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

806
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,850
Enjoy the food!

807
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Make it good.

808
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,080
(Here's the recipe.)

809
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,380
One, two, three, four.

810
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,420
(Into a well-heated...)

811
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,690
(frying pan)

812
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,290
A well-heated frying pan.

813
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:37,030
(Into a well-heated frying pan)

814
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,060
- Let's keep up.
- Where's the water?

815
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,870
(Put 100g of beef loin.)

816
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,770
- What?
- Put in 100g.

817
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,770
How do you know how much that is?

818
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,100
(While it cooks)

819
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,400
Watch the heat.

820
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,210
(Halve an onion)

821
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,680
(5 scallion stalks)

822
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Watch out.

823
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,780
(Chop them finely)

824
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,180
(The instructions keep coming
with no time to spare.)

825
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,650
Five scallion stalks.

826
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,590
(1 Cheongyang chili, 1 red chili)

827
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,790
(Slice them diagonally)

828
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,560
- I don't know what that means.
- How many?

829
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,700
(Onto the beef, add the vegetables)

830
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,830
(And two spoons of ground garlic)

831
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,870
Two spoons.

832
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,670
(Two spoons of ground garlic)

833
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,170
(This is doubanjiang.)

834
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,870
- Where's the ground garlic?
- Add sand lance sauce

835
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,870
- Sauce.
- Two spoons.

836
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,480
(Two spoons of cooking wine,
one spoons of oyster sauce)

837
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,650
What? Fish sauce.

838
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,080
(One spoon of doubanjiang)

839
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,120
(Add one spoon of dark soy sauce)

840
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,690
- Shoot.
- "Cook..."

841
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,590
(Cook, then add a fistful)

842
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,920
(Of pre-soaked rice noodles)

843
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,390
- Fish sauce.
- Cook it all together.

844
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,300
Soy sauce. Soy sauce for soups.

845
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,630
- Follow the song.
- Your pronunciation...

846
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,130
(Using the wrong fish sauce
and soy sauce)

847
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,530
Your pronunciation is horrible!

848
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,570
What do you want me to do?

849
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,770
Your pronunciation...

850
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,210
Did you say sugar?

851
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,640
What is it? Was there sugar?

852
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,680
(While semi-deaf Seok Sam struggles)

853
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,850
Your pronunciation is horrible.

854
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,580
(1 Cheongyang chili, 1 red chili)

855
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,080
(Slice them diagonally)

856
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,420
(Se Chan is
following the instructions.)

857
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,690
I don't know what that means.

858
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:16,660
(Finely slice 5 stalks of scallions)

859
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,260
(1 Cheongyang chili, 1 red chili,
slice them diagonally)

860
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,970
(Onto the beef, add the vegetables)

861
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,570
(Add two spoons of ground garlic)

862
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,880
(Se Chan memorized
what he missed and catches up.)

863
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,550
(Two spoons of sand lance sauce,)

864
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,680
(two spoons of cooking wine,
one spoon of oyster sauce)

865
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,290
(One spoon of doubanjiang)

866
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:49,330
(One spoon of oyster sauce,
one spoon of doubanjiang)

867
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,860
(Cook, then add a fistful
of pre-soaked rice noodles)

868
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,700
- Where's the sand lance sauce?
- Where are you going?

869
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,270
(Cook, then add a fistful
of pre-soaked rice noodles)

870
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,070
(Then cook everything together)

871
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,140
There's no sugar.

872
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,370
(Se Chan added everything
but the soy sauce and cooking wine.)

873
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,780
You could memorize
the recipe as you go.

874
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,580
(2nd verse begins.)

875
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,090
(Take a new frying pan)

876
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,720
- A new frying pan?
- A new pan? What's that?

877
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,560
(Coat it with a spoon of oil)

878
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,590
- Coat it with oil.
- Where's the oil?

879
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,060
(Break two eggs)

880
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,640
(Cook them for a while)

881
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,870
(What?)

882
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,370
(Cook them for a while)

883
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,370
What? Cook whole sesame seeds?

884
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,480
(Cook sesame seeds?)

885
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,780
(He poured sesame seeds
instead of eggs.)

886
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,080
What? What's wrong
with your pronunciation?

887
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,390
When the scrambled egg is done

888
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,220
(Wok-ing with both hands)

889
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,590
Se Chan's doing well.

890
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,160
- Jong Kook.
- Look at that.

891
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
(Put the scrambled egg
in the other pan)

892
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,990
Se Chan, get the egg.

893
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,330
(Cook it all together)

894
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,000
Do I put this in here like this?

895
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,000
How do I scramble eggs?

896
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,140
It's working.

897
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,740
(Add 130g of mung bean sprouts)

898
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,870
(Stir-fry it all together)

899
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,940
(While it cooks)

900
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,480
- He's good.
- Add 30g of peanuts

901
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Thirty grams.

902
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,780
(30g of peanuts)

903
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,050
(They both throw in whole peanuts.)

904
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,550
(30g of peanuts)

905
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,850
(Crush them well in a mortar)

906
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,620
Shoot. Crush them?

907
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,120
(They must be crushed!)

908
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,390
- They didn't crush them.
- Shoot!

909
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,730
(Top the noodles
with the finely ground peanuts)

910
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,530
We had to crush the peanuts?

911
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,530
Se Chan's doing well.

912
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,830
- He's good.
- Three peperoncino

913
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,540
- What?
- Three!

914
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,570
(Crush them)

915
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,640
(The peperoncinos
are here somewhere.)

916
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,910
What are you saying?

917
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,740
- Lemon.
- Three drops

918
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,580
(Cut a lemon
and add 3 drops of lemon juice)

919
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,210
My gosh.

920
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,850
(A lemon juice waterfall)

921
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,850
The juice...

922
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,550
I think that's it.

923
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,290
It smells good.

924
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,160
- It smells good.
- Onto a well-heated

925
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,120
- When do I add this?
- Frying pan

926
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,890
Wait. Onto a well-heated frying pan?

927
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,160
Is that
a web-footed octopus or what?

928
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
- When...
- That went in long ago.

929
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,860
- When?
- That should be in already.

930
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,530
- When? I didn't hear that.
- Stop cooking now.

931
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,930
- Plate it up.
- That's the end of the cooking.

932
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,100
- The three minutes are up?
- It's hard.

933
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,140
Se Chan did great.

934
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,770
Se Chan's looks good.

935
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,210
Put the plate
on the table in the front.

936
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,280
This is fun.

937
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,580
Se Chan, you did well.

938
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,880
I don't know how it'll taste.

939
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,110
- It looks good.
- Se Chan's looks good.

940
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,780
It looks tasty.

941
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,980
It looks tasty.

942
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,350
Hey, it's really hard.

943
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,020
- Hey!
- It smells good.

944
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,060
Isn't this insane?

945
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,190
I don't know. How will it go?

946
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,060
Ye Eun has fallen for you.

947
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,990
- Ye Eun. How's that?
- Are you in love?

948
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,900
- Isn't he charming?
- Do you like a man who can cook?

949
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,300
I still won't fall for you.

950
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,770
(A sudden pat attack)

951
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,300
(Squeal of disgust)

952
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,040
She squealed.

953
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,540
- Okay, then.
- I mean...

954
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,170
The other members
will taste the food...

955
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,240
to decide who gets the extra points.

956
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,740
(Pad thai with beef loin by Se Chan)

957
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,850
It smells amazing.

958
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,880
- Se Chan did amazing.
- It smells so good.

959
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,980
- He didn't miss a thing.
- What's this?

960
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,920
Is this a pajeon or what?

961
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,490
When did you add the egg?
It needs an egg.

962
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,420
- What's this?
- Pick the better-tasting one...

963
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,560
- and they get five extra points.
- Five points?

964
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,860
- I want to eat.
- Be objective.

965
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,060
- We must be.
- Yes.

966
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,330
But Seok Jin's...

967
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,660
- I missed a lot...
- Is this even edible?

968
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,030
- Do we have to taste this?
- The egg...

969
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,870
When did the egg go in?

970
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,940
Why bother?

971
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,870
(Jae Seok tastes Se Chan's first.)

972
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,540
- That looks good.
- Yes.

973
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,670
This looks nice.

974
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,440
- The smell...
- It could be salty. I don't know.

975
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,840
That's all right.

976
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,410
Salty is better than bland.

977
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,050
It's better than having bland food.

978
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,250
I'll try Se Chan's food.

979
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,350
Okay, thank you.

980
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,520
The meat was...

981
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,590
You don't have to cook the meat...
for that long. I'll eat the meat.

982
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,790
(Nodding)

983
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,130
(Surprised)

984
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,300
It tastes good.

985
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,300
It tastes good.

986
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,130
It's really good.

987
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,570
Se Chan, it's all right.

988
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,870
(The flavors of Thailand are
alive in Se Chan's pad thai.)

989
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,900
It's really good.

990
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,310
Se Chan, it's all right.

991
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,870
I should eat this first.

992
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,940
You should eat
the one that tastes worse first.

993
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,040
(You should eat
the one that tastes worse first.)

994
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,510
- Yes, eat the worse one first.
- Can we eat this?

995
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,950
- Is it okay to eat this?
- It's clean.

996
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,250
The meat is well...

997
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,250
You don't have to cook the meat...

998
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,280
- for that long. I'll eat the meat.
- The meat is done.

999
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
- What?
- I want it to...

1000
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,150
- taste good.
- The bean sprouts are okay... What?

1001
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,220
What is this?

1002
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,590
(Gosh, what is this?)

1003
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,060
Hey, is it that bad?

1004
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,460
Hey, this isn't edible.

1005
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,900
- Really? How is it?
- Hey.

1006
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,100
- Hey. Ddochi.
- This isn't edible.

1007
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,470
It smells rotten.

1008
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,100
- Ddochi.
- It smells rotten.

1009
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,970
(Fails based on the smell)

1010
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,440
- Just try it.
- Ddochi...

1011
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,370
But it smells okay.

1012
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,110
- Really?
- The meat is red.

1013
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,810
- Is this all right?
- How are you supposed to eat this?

1014
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,580
- The meat is red.
- How are you supposed to eat this?

1015
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,910
- Oh, that?
- Yes.

1016
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,980
It's just for decoration.

1017
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,550
- Oh, just decoration?
- Yes, decoration.

1018
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,520
(He tries his own dish.)

1019
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,790
(Exclaiming)

1020
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,420
(Jae Seok takes a bite
of Seok Sam's dish too.)

1021
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,460
It's seasoned.

1022
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,000
Look at Jae Seok. That's the face
he makes when food tastes bad.

1023
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,830
You taste it, don't you?
Kind of like... Yes.

1024
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:56,970
- Yes, it's kind of...
- It's good.

1025
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,130
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook was eating
Seok Sam's dish.)

1026
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,340
- This is good.
- What?

1027
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,870
- You know, I think...
- It's good.

1028
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,440
most things taste good.

1029
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,540
- He really does.
- But...

1030
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,940
Se Chan's is okay.

1031
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,210
- My goodness.
- Seok Jin.

1032
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,340
(He grabs more food!)

1033
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,380
- This is...
- Come on.

1034
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,680
- It's too sour.
- Let me see.

1035
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,350
- It's okay, isn't it?
- I think this tastes better.

1036
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,580
It's nice and simple, isn't it?

1037
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,220
Everyone, beef is...

1038
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,950
even eaten rare.

1039
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,990
- It's a bit sour, though.
- It's sour.

1040
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,260
- So, this one is...
- Seok Jin.

1041
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,730
- on the salty side,
- Seok Jin.

1042
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,790
and this is a little bland.

1043
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,130
- I like my food bland, you know?
- But...

1044
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,660
objectively speaking,
this one is better to eat.

1045
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,760
- Seok Jin, try this.
- That's right.

1046
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,200
Food should be seasoned well
to taste at least...

1047
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,300
- Instead of being bland...
- This is...

1048
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,070
Then, we'll decide who gets...

1049
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,110
the extra points first.

1050
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,940
Those of you who thought
Se Chan's food tasted better,

1051
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,510
- please raise your hand.
- Me.

1052
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,710
Those of you who thought
Seok Jin's food tasted better,

1053
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,710
- keep your hand down.
- Be objective.

1054
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,350
Well, Seok Jin's dish was also...

1055
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,650
- It's not bad.
- It wasn't bad.

1056
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,680
For something
he made in three minutes, sure.

1057
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,690
- Okay. One.
- Do I get to vote too?

1058
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,950
- Two. Three.
- I'm drawn to this one.

1059
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,860
Is it Seok Jin?

1060
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,620
- It's 4 versus 4.
- You have to keep your hand down.

1061
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,830
Keep your hand down to vote for me.

1062
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,190
No, you keep your hand down
to vote for me.

1063
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,360
- What?
- Keeping it down is for me.

1064
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,470
Look at Jong Kook.
Even Jong Kook raised his hand.

1065
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,570
- Okay, then.
- Keeping it down is for me.

1066
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,900
It's 7 versus 1.

1067
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,170
Jee Seok Jin loses.

1068
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,340
- Yang Se Chan gets 5 extra points.
- I get 5 points!

1069
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,370
- Doesn't Seok Jin get any points?
- Right now,

1070
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,710
from the recipe told out loud,
the points you got right...

1071
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,650
Seok Jin, you got seven points right
from the recipe.

1072
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,580
- You got a lot right.
- And Se Chan,

1073
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,720
- you got 14 points right.
- What? Really?

1074
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,950
- How did you get so many right?
- You have a total of 19 points.

1075
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,190
(Se Chan, Recipe score: 14,
Taste score: 5, Total: 19)

1076
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,890
- Did you win?
- You got 14 points right?

1077
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,060
Seok Jin, I called it out for you.

1078
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,490
- I didn't hear you.
- But you know, I could hear him.

1079
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,930
Add doubanjiang and oyster sauce.

1080
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,060
Did you hear doubanjiang,
oyster sauce, and everything?

1081
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,160
- Yes, and sand lance sauce.
- This tastes good.

1082
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,200
But this was
actually possible to make...

1083
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
- in three minutes.
- I guess so.

1084
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,570
- I know. It worked.
- You can cook it in three minutes.

1085
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,330
- I don't think I'd know anything.
- It's fascinating.

1086
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,440
Who's up next?

1087
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,000
Okay, next up,

1088
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,810
- it's Ji Hyo and Daniel.
- Okay.

1089
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,570
And Jae Seok will be singing again.

1090
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,880
- Should I do it again?
- Okay.

1091
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,940
- This dish is...
- You can hear it well.

1092
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,310
a creamy abalone pasta.

1093
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,320
- That sounds delicious.
- Gosh, a creamy abalone pasta?

1094
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,180
- You're good at cooking, right?
- I'll try it.

1095
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,920
A creamy abalone pasta.
That sounds delicious.

1096
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,950
The cream...

1097
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,890
Creamy abalone pasta?

1098
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,220
- Ji Hyo is good at this stuff.
- But she cooks huge portions.

1099
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,360
(She used 6-months' worth of
anchovies and sardines...)

1100
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,260
(just to make some broth.)

1101
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,500
(She prepares enough salad
for a family of elephants.)

1102
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,540
(Infamous in the industry,
Huge Portions Madam Song)

1103
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,670
Get ready,
and please start the music.

1104
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,510
- Play the music.
- Gosh, look at him without glasses.

1105
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,080
(Choi Daniel's skills are
still hidden under wraps.)

1106
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,950
- It's creamy abalone pasta.
- Okay.

1107
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,580
- It's "Woman on the Beach."
- It is "Woman on the Beach."

1108
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,720
"Hey, it's something."

1109
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,090
Here it goes.

1110
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,260
Gosh, I'm hungry!

1111
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,490
(He starts off
by changing the lyrics intuitively.)

1112
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Shouldn't you start
cooking the noodles already?

1113
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,230
But he didn't tell us to yet.

1114
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,730
(Quick pasta noodles that cook
in less than 3 minutes)

1115
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,870
(The recipe is revealed.)

1116
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,900
Press it down.

1117
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,110
(A pinch of salt in boiling water)

1118
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,580
(Five drops of olive oil)

1119
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,710
A quarter-sized bunch
of pasta noodles

1120
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,850
Gosh, she put so much oil in.

1121
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,790
Five drops

1122
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,420
(She actually added it
in the frying pan, not the pot.)

1123
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,160
(Grab it and cook it in the water)

1124
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,400
(Add butter to the pan
and while it melts)

1125
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,030
(Take two cooked abalones
and cut them up)

1126
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,970
(Into small pieces
so they're easy to eat)

1127
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,170
Add the chopped up abalones

1128
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,310
- And cook them
- She's adding that much butter?

1129
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,040
Over higher heat

1130
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,680
(While Ji Hyo throws in
a huge chunk of butter)

1131
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,840
She's adding that much butter?

1132
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,550
A pinch of salt in boiling water

1133
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Five drops of olive oil

1134
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,850
(A pinch of salt in boiling water)

1135
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,420
(Five drops of olive oil)

1136
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,630
- Oh, nice.
- Add butter to the pan

1137
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,190
(A quarter-sized bunch
of pasta noodles)

1138
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,660
- Butter in the pan.
- Put butter in the pan.

1139
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
(Add butter to the pan
and while it melts)

1140
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,030
- I told you he was good.
- Into small pieces

1141
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,100
- He's good.
- So they're easy to eat

1142
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,970
(Daniel hasn't gotten anything wrong
and did everything right so far.)

1143
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,510
When the abalones are cooked
to golden brown

1144
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,910
Put them aside on a plate

1145
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,310
Pour 180ml into the pan

1146
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,190
And add two slices of cheddar cheese

1147
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,090
Just a quarter of an onion

1148
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,620
(It's time to slice the onion.)

1149
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,960
Hey, he's good.

1150
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,530
- You're so cool!
- It says to skip that part.

1151
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,760
Hey, he knows how to cook.

1152
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,670
Add a spoonful of minced garlic
to the pan...

1153
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,270
and bring it to a boil
as you stir it well.

1154
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,540
- Hey, Daniel!
- Hey, he's good!

1155
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,510
Daniel has his charms.

1156
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,040
The milk!

1157
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,840
- Sexy Chef.
- He's pretty good.

1158
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,750
(Swishing)

1159
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,780
He can do this motion.

1160
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,880
Sexy Chef.

1161
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,050
He knows how to use a wok.

1162
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,020
(They've found something Daniel
is good at for the first time!)

1163
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,320
- Slice up the bacon into 3cm pieces
- The milk!

1164
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,090
So they're easy to eat in one bite

1165
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,160
You're doing well.

1166
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,930
The button mushrooms and bacon
that are all chopped

1167
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,370
Add them to the pan
and let them simmer too

1168
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,940
Let the sauce seep into the noodles

1169
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,000
Stir them around some more

1170
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,740
Woman on the beach

1171
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:09,180
Add the two abalones
that you had put aside

1172
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:15,550
Grate and add
the Grana Padano cheese

1173
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,490
(Ji Hyo's butter is still sizzling.)

1174
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,860
(Meanwhile,
she adds cheddar cheese.)

1175
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,530
She's adding that much butter?

1176
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,330
(An interim check on Ji Hyo's pan)

1177
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,600
(5 pumps of olive oil)

1178
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,240
(Adding butter)

1179
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,310
(Leaving it unattended for 1 minute)

1180
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,340
(Adding cheddar cheese)

1181
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,610
(Huge Portions Chef Song is
fixated on greasy flavors today.)

1182
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,850
(A huge block of butter)

1183
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,380
(It's pretty much oil soup.)

1184
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,820
Grate and add
the Grana Padano cheese

1185
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,260
- What?
- Take out a plate

1186
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,760
(She misses everything else...)

1187
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,800
(but she never forgets
to add cheese.)

1188
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,170
(Adding another slice of cheddar)

1189
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,110
(So greasy)

1190
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,440
(Thankfully,
she adds the bacon and abalone.)

1191
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,410
The creamy pasta is finished

1192
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,680
It's creamy pasta!

1193
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,620
(Right before the end, she manages
to remember the name of the dish.)

1194
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,090
- Daniel is good!
- You're doing well!

1195
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,620
(Finishing it off with cold milk)

1196
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,460
(Retching)

1197
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,960
- Is Haha vomiting?
- Haha.

1198
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,260
- My goodness.
- We're nearly there.

1199
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,830
Hang on. Ma'am.

1200
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,930
- It's no joke.
- No!

1201
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,560
She added a whole block of butter
this big.

1202
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,870
Our arteries
are going to burst open.

1203
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,400
- This is our last day.
- I was watching and suddenly...

1204
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,500
Hey, So Min!
What will we do about our arteries?

1205
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,270
- Chopsticks.
- Chopsticks.

1206
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,440
But once I started cooking,
I couldn't hear a thing.

1207
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,810
Ma'am, I want to try your pasta.

1208
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,880
Okay.

1209
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,880
Gosh, it looks delicious.

1210
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,910
(Creamy abalone pasta by Daniel,
Replicated exactly like the recipe)

1211
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,410
- Okay, let's eat.
- It looks delicious.

1212
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,620
- I'm sure it's good.
- Gosh, this is...

1213
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,820
Oh, I'll try this one first.

1214
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,050
- I want to try this too.
- Me too.

1215
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,090
I'll try the delicious one first.

1216
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,260
- Daniel really knows how to cook.
- Right.

1217
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,490
(Will Daniel's pasta taste as good
as his cooking skills?)

1218
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,860
The smell is insanely good.

1219
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,160
(Slightly nervous)

1220
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,190
- Gosh, it smells insanely good.
- It does, Jong Kook.

1221
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,460
The abalone.

1222
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,700
The smell is okay.

1223
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,000
How is it?

1224
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,030
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1225
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,170
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1226
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,700
It's really hot.

1227
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,370
- It's delicious.
- Is it?

1228
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,340
- It's delicious.
- Is it good?

1229
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,880
It's totally good.

1230
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,240
(Daniel didn't miss out on the taste
for his 3-minute dish.)

1231
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,310
- It's good.
- Hey.

1232
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,750
- He's just...
- Is it good?

1233
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,210
- The Shilla Hotel.
- It's good.

1234
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,320
For real?

1235
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,520
Let me see.

1236
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,750
- Jae Seok, it's good.
- You have to try it.

1237
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,720
- It's good.
- I want a whole plate of this.

1238
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,860
What is this? Are you flirting?

1239
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,820
Ye Eun, is it good?

1240
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,890
- Yes.
- Ye Eun.

1241
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,930
It's so delicious.

1242
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,060
- Hey, Haha.
- It's so good.

1243
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,360
- Hurry up and try Ji Hyo's.
- Right.

1244
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,160
- Try Ji Hyo's pasta too.
- Right.

1245
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,200
(Ji Hyo's dish isn't popular because
of the other restaurant next door.)

1246
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Hey, don't crowd around over there.
Try this one too.

1247
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,340
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo's.

1248
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,740
This is Ji Hyo's pasta.

1249
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,240
This one is Ji Hyo's.

1250
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,270
(He tries a bite
after the owner pleads with them.)

1251
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,340
- It's so bland.
- It smells okay.

1252
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,610
(His face gradually becomes sadder.)

1253
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,910
Try some.

1254
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,280
(He feels the same way.)

1255
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,350
- It's greasy.
- This is so good.

1256
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,220
(Ye Eun tries Ji Hyo's pasta too.)

1257
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,830
You can actually cook something
in three minutes.

1258
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,660
- Is it all right?
- What is it?

1259
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,930
It's so bland.

1260
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,930
(Reflecting on herself)

1261
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,270
- It's greasy.
- This is so good.

1262
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,440
- Hey, don't we have any kimchi?
- Is it good?

1263
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,370
- It's really greasy.
- For real.

1264
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,710
I think it's greasy too.

1265
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,610
You can't eat this.
This isn't edible.

1266
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,280
Don't be silly.
Of course, you can eat this.

1267
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,750
- That's...
- It's butter soup.

1268
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,150
- It's too heavy for me.
- It's delicious.

1269
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,550
The second you eat Ji Hyo's noodles,

1270
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,150
you taste the butter, the milk,

1271
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,250
- and then the cheese.
- That's right.

1272
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,320
- The flavors aren't combined?
- You can taste the ingredients.

1273
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
- They're very distinct.
- Sure.

1274
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,160
- Now...
- Come over here, guys.

1275
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,360
- Have mine.
- Please raise your hand...

1276
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,800
if you liked Ji Hyo's.

1277
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,170
Keep your hands down
if you prefer Daniel's.

1278
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,500
- Got it.
- Raise for Ji Hyo...

1279
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,040
and lower for Daniel.

1280
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,540
- Goodness.
- One, two, three.

1281
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,010
(Everyone stays put.)

1282
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,210
Even Ji Hyo likes Daniel's.

1283
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,140
I admit, Daniel's is better.

1284
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,280
With a score of 8 to 0,

1285
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,710
- Daniel takes this round.
- It was tasty.

1286
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,320
Daniel, you get
an additional five points.

1287
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,820
Meanwhile, you followed ten
of the instructions,

1288
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,050
which gets you 15 points in total.

1289
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,820
- Ten?
- Ji Hyo got six of them right.

1290
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,260
- No way.
- That gets you six points.

1291
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,660
All right.
The next round will be between...

1292
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,190
Jae Seok and Jong Kook.

1293
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,400
Jong Kook and I.

1294
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,230
Cucumber?

1295
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,970
(The locust was fumbling nonstop.)

1296
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,540
Is Jong Kook sharpening a pencil?

1297
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,400
Jong Kook, chop the cucumber.

1298
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,370
- Was it oyster sauce?
- This is too difficult.

1299
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,670
I'm just adding this in.

1300
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,940
- In that?
- In that?

1301
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,680
- This is so hot.
- You need to cook the meat.

1302
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,780
What on earth?

1303
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,210
- No way.
- You did great.

1304
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,180
- I lucked out with my opponent.
- In seventh place...

1305
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,490
is Ji Hyo with six points.

1306
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,450
- What?
- And in last place...

1307
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,390
is Jae Seok with five points.

1308
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,830
He sang the songs,
but couldn't cook his dish.

1309
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,560
(He couldn't beat the sour pad thai
or the butter-cheese pasta.)

1310
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,260
He just had a good time today
singing the songs.

1311
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,600
He got to sing twice.

1312
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,500
Are you kidding me?

1313
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,400
Based on the rank you finished in,

1314
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,900
you'll be given a benefit
before you leave today.

1315
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,140
- Really?
- That's nice.

1316
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,140
Meanwhile, in August,
three of the members...

1317
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,080
- celebrate their birthdays.
- Yes, birthdays.

1318
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,050
- Jae Seok, Haha, and Ji Hyo...
- That's right.

1319
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,710
will soon celebrate their birthdays.

1320
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,480
We'll celebrate
their birthdays together.

1321
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,680
- A happy birthday?
- When did we do that?

1322
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,290
- What's that?
- Really?

1323
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,790
That's what Jae Seok likes.

1324
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,220
It's a cake.

1325
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,060
- Here.
- And go.

1326
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,860
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

1327
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,830
(It's embarrassing in that moment.)

1328
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,130
(But it feels wrong to skip
the cake and the song.)

1329
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,370
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

1330
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:37,640
(Jae Seok, Haha, Ji Hyo,
happy birthday.)

1331
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,870
- Thank you.
- You should've worn these.

1332
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,140
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1333
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,710
- You should've worn these.
- Don't.

1334
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,910
- It's fine.
- Don't do this.

1335
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,350
This is scary. How do you pop this?

1336
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,950
- Save it for the kids.
- What's tricky about this?

1337
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,380
- What's this?
- How do you use this?

1338
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,890
- How do you pop it?
- Don't do it.

1339
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,420
- Aren't you supposed to twist it?
- That's it.

1340
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,890
- Really? How do you do it?
- Like this.

1341
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,420
- Come on.
- No, don't.

1342
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,730
(The prankster has found his prey.)

1343
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,090
- Don't!
- Put on the hat.

1344
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,600
- Don't.
- Put on the hat.

1345
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,230
- I hate it.
- You should put on the hat.

1346
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,770
- No.
- That's scary.

1347
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,730
A 60-year-old man just said, "No."

1348
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,240
"No. No, don't."

1349
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,710
"Don't do it."

1350
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,970
(The only 60-year-old
who can react like a 6-year-old)

1351
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,270
At the age of 60.

1352
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,480
- What is this, anyway?
- Anyway,

1353
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,510
since it's lunch time,

1354
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,680
you'll have the food cooked
and with the ingredients...

1355
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,380
(Bang!)

1356
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,990
(Even the cameras shook.)

1357
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,420
Are you kidding me?

1358
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,360
- My gosh.
- What on earth?

1359
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,690
She was talking just now!

1360
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,190
- She was talking.
- Are you kidding me?

1361
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,660
- What was that?
- You crazy locust.

1362
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,730
You startled me.
I bet that startled you.

1363
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,300
- That's not it.
- "You crazy locust."

1364
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,540
- "You crazy locust."
- I didn't mean...

1365
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,400
- I wet myself.
- I didn't mean it.

1366
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,470
I almost farted.

1367
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,910
- No way.
- That's how you pop it.

1368
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:48,010
How... Stop it, okay?

1369
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,810
- Just don't.
- Don't do it.

1370
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,080
- By the way,
- That was loud.

1371
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,280
I haven't seen you angry in a while.

1372
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,250
It's been a while
since I was startled.

1373
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,690
Nothing really gets to me.

1374
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,590
(It surprised Jong Kook
who isn't even scared of ghosts.)

1375
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,090
- It really surprised him.
- I haven't been shocked in a while.

1376
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,160
Let's see a junior
teach his senior a lesson.

1377
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,830
Teach your senior a lesson.

1378
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,600
- Okay.
- That's enough.

1379
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,900
So this is something
that scares Jong Kook.

1380
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,400
- That was a strong batch.
- That was loud.

1381
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,670
Since we have
a lot of cooking ingredients...

1382
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,070
and even ramyeon,
you'll enjoy lunch freely.

1383
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,140
We'll keep playing games...

1384
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,410
- that earn you...
- Okay.

1385
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,540
- Really?
- birthday presents.

1386
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,010
Did you get us birthday gifts too?

1387
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,080
Let's get them something nice.

1388
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,110
What's this?

1389
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,080
(After the birthday party)

1390
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,020
Gosh, I should sit next to Ye Eun.

1391
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,050
- Sit next to her.
- Please, Se Chan.

1392
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,460
Have you been well?

1393
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,690
(Cheesy)

1394
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,690
Stop it.

1395
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,360
- What are you doing this evening?
- Stop.

1396
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,630
Shut it.

1397
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,430
- You're finally working her.
- Right.

1398
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,830
I'll make you cry.

1399
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,030
You're trying to win her over.

1400
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,100
They're on either side of her.

1401
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,040
They keep following me around.

1402
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,710
- She thinks we're following her.
- They follow me around.

1403
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,770
- Ye Eun, can you hear me?
- Shut it.

1404
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,380
(Putting up a steel wall)

1405
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,880
Isn't there a gift
you're reminded of...

1406
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,350
when you think of Running Man?

1407
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,680
- A gift?
- Gold!

1408
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,020
- Gold.
- Yes, gold.

1409
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,920
It's a gift for those
celebrating birthdays in August.

1410
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,790
- No way.
- We've prepared gold...

1411
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,930
that can also be won
by the other members.

1412
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,760
You're actually giving us gold?
No way.

1413
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,100
It's real gold.

1414
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,160
- There's a lot.
- That's a lot.

1415
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,100
We prepared the coins
for you to take today.

1416
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,900
Okay. The gold price
has gone up recently.

1417
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,200
That's insane.

1418
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,640
You will play two games as a group.

1419
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,870
How well you do will determine
the amount of gold you win.

1420
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,310
All right.

1421
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,540
The more gold you win as a group,

1422
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,980
- the more you'll get individually.
- We need to win more gold...

1423
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,410
- as a group.
- That's right.

1424
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,420
Only the three of us
need to win the gold.

1425
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,920
- No way.
- That's absurd.

1426
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,420
It's best if we all win some gold.

1427
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,660
- Win more gold.
- He's right.

1428
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,720
Here's the first game you'll play...

1429
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,060
- to win the gold coins.
- Sure.

1430
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,300
It's a quiz.

1431
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,800
You don't want us to have any gold!

1432
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,530
- Unbelievable.
- You don't want us to have any.

1433
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,970
That's the same as saying
you won't give us any gold.

1434
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,370
- Unbelievable.
- You'll tease us all you want,

1435
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,470
but you won't give us any gold.

1436
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:55,470
- I get it.
- Whatever.

1437
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,940
- I'll get it right.
- As you can see here,

1438
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,010
there are squares with scores...

1439
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,310
- from 10 to 100.
- I don't know about this.

1440
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,450
You will answer the question...

1441
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,480
in the category shown
beneath the number.

1442
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,480
The scores must indicate...

1443
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,650
- how difficult they are.
- That's right.

1444
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:13,490
If all eight of you get it right,

1445
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,290
you will score
that number times eight.

1446
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,730
- Really?
- Let's go with the tens.

1447
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,030
- However, I told you...
- The tens.

1448
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,100
- you're playing as a group.
- Right.

1449
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,530
You won't score anything
if one of you gets it wrong.

1450
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,270
Come on.

1451
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:26,700
We won't be getting any gold.

1452
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,170
At the end of the quiz,

1453
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,710
you will receive 0.1g of gold...

1454
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,840
- for every ten points...
- Goodness.

1455
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,680
- you have.
- Did she say 0.1g?

1456
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,050
It'll be better to score...

1457
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,310
as many points as you can.

1458
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,750
Let's do this!

1459
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,680
Let's start with one for 30 points.

1460
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,120
Shouldn't we go with the tens?

1461
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,190
- Wait.
- The tens.

1462
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,160
- Start with the tens.
- The tens.

1463
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,560
We should see
what we're dealing with.

1464
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,860
- Start with the 30s.
- Yes, the 30s.

1465
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,860
Then we can decide
to go up or down from there.

1466
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,360
He's right. Start with the 30s.

1467
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,400
- Start with the 30s.
- Start with a middle one.

1468
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,270
Exactly. If they're easy enough,

1469
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,740
- we'll go with the 50s.
- Let's see what we're dealing with.

1470
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,340
I don't think I'll know this.

1471
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,810
There are four squares
worth 30 points.

1472
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,110
- That one.
- Which one...

1473
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,080
- will you choose?
- The kind one.

1474
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,980
There's a 30 in that line of 10s.

1475
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,180
It's next to a ten.

1476
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,580
- What's the category?
- Guess who.

1477
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,880
Nice!

1478
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,620
(Category: Guess who)

1479
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:17,890
It's never easy to guess a person.

1480
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,960
- I love it.
- It's only worth 30 points,

1481
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,990
- This won't be so bad.
- so it'll be someone we know.

1482
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,930
- It won't be difficult.
- Someone historical.

1483
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,860
It'll be eight times the score
if you all get it right.

1484
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,560
- Let's do this!
- That means you'll get 240 points.

1485
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,630
Sure.

1486
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,100
What's the name of the count,

1487
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,810
the main character
in Alexandre Dumas's revenge novel,

1488
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,410
who also shares his name...

1489
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,680
with a fried sandwich?

1490
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,980
- A fried sandwich?
- A fried sandwich?

1491
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,550
A fried sandwich?

1492
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,980
- What?
- A fried sandwich?

1493
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,120
- I get it. Yes, of course.
- A fried sandwich?

1494
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,090
- A fried sandwich?
- Yes, him!

1495
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,360
You know what it is.
The famous triangle sandwich.

1496
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,190
- What was its name again?
- What is it?

1497
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,490
The famous triangle sandwich.

1498
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,560
(A famous triangle sandwich?)

1499
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,370
- Hold on a second.
- I can't remember the name.

1500
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,870
(Jong Kook's comment
gives Jae Seok a hint.)

1501
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,800
Is it not Earl of Sandwich?

1502
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,110
He shares a name
with a fried sandwich.

1503
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:14,410
(The answer finally comes to him.)

1504
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,840
It's a dish I love.

1505
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,820
(The Monte Cristo sandwich is a dish
Jae Seok is head over heels for.)

1506
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:25,120
(Answer: Count of Monte Cristo)

1507
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,090
It's a dish I love.

1508
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,520
- I know!
- What's the dish Jae Seok loves?

1509
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,630
You get five more seconds.

1510
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,160
What's the dish Jae Seok loves?

1511
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,530
(Food Fighter gets
the food reference.)

1512
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,900
Even I know the name.

1513
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,500
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's delicious.

1514
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,630
What is it?

1515
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:39,870
- It's a tasty dish.
- There was a restaurant...

1516
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,370
famous for this dish.

1517
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,000
- This is the one.
- Don't you all know this?

1518
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,710
The name won't come to me though.
Oh, wait.

1519
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,110
You'll get three more seconds.

1520
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,810
- I know what it is.
- Three, two...

1521
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,250
(They will win 240 points
if everyone gets it right.)

1522
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,080
(They will score 0 points
if one of them gets it wrong.)

1523
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,620
- Two.
- I don't like that sandwich.

1524
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,490
(Will everyone be able
to get it right?)

1525
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,020
- One. Hold up your answers.
- I don't know.

1526
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,220
- Is this it?
- I'm clueless.

1527
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,560
- I don't think this is it.
- Hold up your answers.

1528
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,930
- This isn't easy.
- Hold up your answers.

1529
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:05,960
Here you go.

1530
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,830
(Ye Eun and Jae Seok are correct.)

1531
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,100
I think I'm right.

1532
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,570
Is this right?
I couldn't remember the name.

1533
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,640
Jae Seok, what's your answer?

1534
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,370
- It's Count of Monte Cristo.
- That's right.

1535
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,170
Ye Eun, what did you write?

1536
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,310
- Monte Cristo.
- Monte Cristo.

1537
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,210
Daniel also wrote Monte Cristo.

1538
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,680
- Here.
- I got it right.

1539
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,680
- I see.
- Let's check Jong Kook's answer.

1540
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,880
- Monte Cristo.
- Monte Cristo, yes.

1541
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,110
I got it right.

1542
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,480
I remembered correctly.

1543
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,420
- I got it right.
- Currently...

1544
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,990
(Only the other four
need to get it right.)

1545
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,320
Seok Jin, what's your answer?
"Fry San."

1546
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,090
- Yes, short for fried sandwich.
- A fried sandwich?

1547
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,890
- A fried sandwich.
- Se Chan wrote churros.

1548
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,360
(1. A made-up word,
2. Any fried dish they know)

1549
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,530
Ji Hyo wrote Count Bennigans.

1550
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,930
(3. Only remembering
the restaurant name)

1551
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,670
Also, Haha wrote...

1552
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,140
- Tell them yourself.
- What did you write?

1553
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,670
(One person couldn't laugh
at the others' wrong answers.)

1554
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,640
- What did you write?
- What is it?

1555
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,540
- Haha, hold up your answer.
- It was a tough one.

1556
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,380
(The staff laughs.)

1557
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:00,020
(The staff bursts out laughing
at Haha's answer.)

1558
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,050
- Why are they laughing?
- What is it?

1559
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,090
The staff laughed in a mocking way.

1560
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,820
- What did Haha write?
- Beats me.

1561
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,920
(What did he write as his answer?)

1562
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,360
- What did he write?
- What is it?

1563
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,390
He wrote "Isaac."

1564
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,430
(Count of Toasties)

1565
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,530
(A wrong answer fitting
for Mr. Free Meals)

1566
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,740
I love the toast sandwiches
they sell but...

1567
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,370
- Isaac?
- Isaac!

1568
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,710
- I mean...
- That was a good answer.

1569
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,740
Monte Cristo.

1570
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,780
(Shuddering in humiliation)

1571
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,680
- Four of you got it correct.
- Okay.

1572
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,880
Yes, that's how it goes.

1573
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,850
- It's hard.
- You have zero points.

1574
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,320
(Sighing)

1575
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,620
- I really don't want to do this.
- Let's do this.

1576
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,490
Hey, Hyung In. Can I be honest
since it's my birthday?

1577
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:42,560
- What?
- I don't want to do this.

1578
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,460
I won't play. Seriously, I really...

1579
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,100
don't want to do this.
It's my birthday today.

1580
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,260
But the questions aren't that hard.

1581
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,630
- You have to play.
- It's not hard.

1582
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,470
- Then, let's go for 50 points.
- We could answer...

1583
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,970
- Shall we? Let's try the 50.
- Let's try the 50-point question.

1584
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,570
- We could get 50 points.
- Shall we try to get 50 points?

1585
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,070
- This one?
- Yes.

1586
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,570
- Let's go for it.
- We'll do all of them anyway.

1587
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,540
(Trivia, 50)

1588
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,180
- Trivia.
- Gosh, I can't do trivia.

1589
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,710
- It's trivia.
- We're better than we think.

1590
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,810
- Right.
- Trivia is good.

1591
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,380
- Let's try the trivia question.
- Yes.

1592
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,680
This is a question worth 50 points
in the trivia category.

1593
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,750
- I think it'll be hard.
- Please read it slowly.

1594
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,090
All right.
Write one syllable each...

1595
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,690
of the full name of the author...

1596
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,330
who wrote the novel,
"The Old Man and the Sea."

1597
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,360
- One syllable each?
- What?

1598
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,900
We're not writing the whole name?

1599
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,570
Ji Hyo will write
the first syllable,

1600
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,270
and Haha will write the last.

1601
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,740
- Okay.
- This is hard.

1602
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,670
One syllable each
of the full name...

1603
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,440
(The brainy guys write their answers
without hesitation this time.)

1604
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,680
Hey, but isn't this...

1605
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,540
This is doable.

1606
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,050
(What about Haha,
who has to write the last "Y?")

1607
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,080
I got it.

1608
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,650
- Is he the last?
- Yes.

1609
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,080
(Haha wrote the correct answer too!)

1610
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,650
(Er, Ne, S, T)

1611
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:46,220
- Siberian Husky.
- Is he the last?

1612
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,220
What is it? Is that guy a foreigner?

1613
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,330
Hey, this is pretty doable
for a 50-point question.

1614
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,460
It's hard.

1615
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,500
You guys know his full name, right?

1616
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,670
I don't know his full name.

1617
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,930
- I don't.
- But why?

1618
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,170
Then, do you know his short name,
not his full name, Ji Hyo?

1619
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,570
- Yes, I know it.
- You do?

1620
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,070
- Four syllables.
- Then...

1621
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,670
- Really?
- Can't we start from that side?

1622
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,740
- Shall we go the opposite way?
- Yes!

1623
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,980
(They ask to change the order
since Ji Hyo knows Hemingway.)

1624
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,280
- But I already wrote it.
- You did?

1625
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,780
Ji Hyo says
she knows four syllables.

1626
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,320
Dong Hoon,
you can do the first part.

1627
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,490
Right, Dong Hoon.

1628
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,590
- Yes, Haha, you should go first.
- Go the opposite way.

1629
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,490
Okay, I'll do the first syllable!

1630
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,690
(Will Haha know his full name?)

1631
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,990
- Here I go! There!
- Really?

1632
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,000
(What's up with this?
He wrote the correct answer!)

1633
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,560
- Then, let's change it. First,
- Really?

1634
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,200
- second, third, fourth,
- Okay.

1635
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,100
- fifth...
- Hey, I'll go first!

1636
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,170
Then, Ji Hyo will write
the last syllable.

1637
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,140
- All right.
- There.

1638
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,410
- You have five seconds. Five.
- Hemingway.

1639
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,080
Four.

1640
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,510
Three.

1641
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,650
- Two.
- Hey, if you don't get this right,

1642
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,880
you're seriously...

1643
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,250
All right?

1644
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,320
Hey, we can do this!

1645
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,050
You have to know this.

1646
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,450
One. Lift up your answers.

1647
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,290
I'm confused. Is this correct?

1648
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,660
One. Lift up your answers.

1649
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,060
(Anxious)

1650
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:58,890
- Is this right?
- Ernest Hemingway.

1651
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,600
- This is a foreign name.
- I think it's right.

1652
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,560
- Okay. The answer is...
- Yes?

1653
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,670
- Ernest Hemingway.
- Oh, I got it.

1654
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,630
- You got Ernest right.
- We're right, aren't we?

1655
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,000
- Okay.
- We got it right?

1656
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,810
(Will changing the order pay off?)

1657
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,970
For the last name,
starting with Se Chan,

1658
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,040
your answer was Besmingway.

1659
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,650
- What? Ernest Besmingway?
- I thought you knew it, Ji Hyo!

1660
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,550
(Ernest Besmingway?)

1661
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,350
- Ernest Besmingway?
- I thought you knew it, Ji Hyo!

1662
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,050
Gosh, seriously.

1663
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,820
- Gosh, seriously.
- I knew Hemingway!

1664
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,460
- Oh, were you right?
- What did you write?

1665
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,590
Oh, Ji Hyo got it right.

1666
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,760
- Besmingway?
- He, Ming, Wa, Y.

1667
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,160
I wrote S because of Ernest.

1668
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,700
Ernest.

1669
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,170
- Oh, were you right?
- I got Hemingway right too.

1670
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,630
- What? Heming...
- But...

1671
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,170
- Wa.
- You should've said Wa, not Ming!

1672
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,400
I thought it was Hemingway
Sam Hammington. So, Ming...

1673
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,740
Seok Jin, who's Bernard Werber?

1674
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,810
- That's...
- Bernard Werber.

1675
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,440
- That's a different...
- "Empire of the Ants."

1676
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,550
Oh, "Empire of the Ants."

1677
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,050
I honestly thought
his name was Augustine.

1678
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,850
This time, five of you were right,
including the final Y.

1679
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,190
- Gosh, let's focus, guys!
- My goodness.

1680
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,660
Jae Seok, shouldn't we try
a 30-point question?

1681
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,920
- Let's try the 30-point question.
- Let's go for 30 points.

1682
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,690
- Let's go for 30. Let's try it.
- Did you say 30 points?

1683
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,890
- I'm sure we'll get one right.
- Oh, boy.

1684
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,600
- Trivia.
- Let's get this one right.

1685
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,100
- Let's get it right.
- Jong Kook, I'm sorry.

1686
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,130
No, we'll get it right.

1687
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,530
In the trivia category,

1688
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,900
- this question is worth 30 points.
- Gosh, trivia?

1689
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,770
In the folktale,
"Kongjwi and Patjwi..."

1690
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:16,770
That's it!

1691
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:20,480
Kongjwi receives help
from a toad to finish a task.

1692
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,440
This is expressed
in an eight-syllable Korean proverb.

1693
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,280
- Please write...
- What?

1694
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,650
- the eight syllables.
- Oh, right!

1695
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,950
- What does that mean?
- Se Chan, don't you know that?

1696
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,550
With the help of a toad?

1697
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,120
- Yes, in "Kongjwi and Patjwi..."
- Hang on.

1698
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,660
- I know this.
- This is...

1699
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,390
She receives help.

1700
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,860
Okay.

1701
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,190
The Korean proverb
reflecting that story.

1702
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,160
- This is easy.
- Write the eight syllables.

1703
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,030
Eight syllables? Wait a minute.
A proverb?

1704
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,300
Jae Seok, this is easy.

1705
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,500
You know this.

1706
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,270
- Why do I only have seven?
- What is it? I don't know.

1707
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,270
A proverb?

1708
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,870
- Wait. There's a toad in the story?
- Why did the toad...

1709
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,040
- Of course, there's a toad.
- Yes, there is a toad.

1710
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,180
- It's not "Kongjwi and Patjwi..."
- There is a toad!

1711
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,280
- Hey, Haha.
- Yes?

1712
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,220
- The toad did this for a reason.
- The toad.

1713
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,780
Why did the toad go inside?

1714
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,820
Why did he get physical
right in that spot?

1715
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,120
(Frustrated)

1716
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,490
- Sorry if that sounded vulgar.
- Oh, right.

1717
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,820
Oh, this... It had a hole in it.

1718
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,160
"It's like pouring water
into a bottomless jar?"

1719
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:15,000
Oh, right! "It's like pouring water
into a bottomless jar."

1720
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,870
"It's like pouring water
into a bottomless jar."

1721
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,540
But does this go in the middle?

1722
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,800
It's nine words.

1723
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,170
I don't know this proverb.

1724
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,380
Or if you're confused about
the number of words,

1725
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,540
- as long as you get the meaning...
- We just need the same meaning?

1726
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,580
- Then, the meaning...
- You should each write...

1727
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,850
- the whole proverb.
- All right.

1728
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,380
Gosh, is this hard?

1729
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,080
I'm smart.

1730
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,120
I have eight words.

1731
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,150
Did you get it?

1732
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,320
- Hang on.
- Hey, look.

1733
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,890
Jae Seok, I'll give you a hint.

1734
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,730
- Wait a second.
- Why are you...

1735
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:48,000
Jae Seok has only been doing
hard quizzes...

1736
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,430
It's too... Well, it's because...

1737
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:52,870
- Jae Seok.
- We can't solve questions...

1738
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,300
meant for elementary school kids.

1739
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,040
- Gosh, Jae Seok. What happened?
- Come on, Jae Seok.

1740
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,310
Oh, that!

1741
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,040
- This is so easy! Hang on.
- Lift up your answers on three.

1742
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,280
(Did he finally
think of the answer?)

1743
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,280
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Jae Seok, if it's about a toad...

1744
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,880
- Lift up your answers.
- He suddenly figured it out.

1745
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,080
Gosh, but this is...
Is this a proverb?

1746
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,680
- It's this, isn't it?
- Haha, please read it out loud.

1747
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,090
Hey. It's like pouring water
into a bottomless jar.

1748
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,190
- Oh, is that it?
- He's right.

1749
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,990
(Did he write the correct answer?)

1750
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,230
Pouring water into a broken jar.

1751
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,330
- "Pouring water into a broken jar?"
- Yes.

1752
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,970
Pouring water into a broken jar.

1753
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,300
- I wrote that too.
- "Pouring water into a broken jar?"

1754
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,070
- Yes.
- Pouring water into a broken jar.

1755
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,740
Yes, I wrote "Pouring water
into a broken jar" too.

1756
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,570
Okay, then. So far,
they all mean the same thing.

1757
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,940
Oh, really?
What do you mean by "so far?"

1758
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,540
- I mean... Is there something else?
- But...

1759
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,850
Don't say that.
Just say that you'll keep going.

1760
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:42,180
Okay, next is Se Chan's answer.
Please read it out loud.

1761
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,850
"Take my old house for a new house."

1762
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,490
That fool...

1763
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,490
- Oh, like the song with the toad?
- Because of the toad?

1764
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:49,990
- "Here's my old house..."
- Hey, this is...

1765
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,630
- I couldn't think of it.
- Sebastian.

1766
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:52,830
(What's that?)

1767
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,560
Okay, but the phrase goes,
"It's like pouring water."

1768
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,270
It should be spelled with an S,
not a Z.

1769
00:59:58,270 --> 00:59:59,530
- Who did that?
- Who was it?

1770
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:00,740
- Daniel.
- But...

1771
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,640
(It'z like pouring water
into a bottomless jar.)

1772
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,010
(He checks it far too late.)

1773
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,540
- Daniel.
- Hey, man!

1774
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,910
No, wait!
I just had to get my part right.

1775
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:09,580
- Gosh, seriously?
- Hang on.

1776
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,710
- "It's."
- Oh, did I write a Z, not an S?

1777
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,080
Goodness, what's wrong with him?

1778
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,480
- This is bad.
- That's so embarrassing.

1779
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,880
Gosh, but how could it be so hard
to think of that proverb?

1780
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,950
- I knew it.
- But Se Chan!

1781
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,220
- No, but the toad...
- You're such an Empty Head!

1782
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,790
Hey, you're seriously an Empty Head.

1783
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,590
Daniel, I'm not feeling great today.

1784
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,960
- My gosh.
- My brain is rotten.

1785
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,530
- Seriously...
- It was eight words, though.

1786
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,200
"Take my old house for a new house."

1787
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,900
That was why I wrote it.
It was eight words. My gosh.

1788
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,670
(They haven't even seen
a bit of gold yet.)

1789
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,140
Jae Seok, how about 100 points?
We could get lucky.

1790
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,880
- Let's try the 100-point question.
- Let's go for 100 points.

1791
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,580
- Let's try that once.
- This won't do.

1792
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,550
- You should go...
- Jae Seok, this spot...

1793
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,180
- Come here.
- It has bad vibes.

1794
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,580
Just once. I'm sorry.
Haha, that spot has...

1795
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,750
No, that spot in the middle
has bad vibes. I'll sit at the end.

1796
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,820
(He escapes the tail end,
blaming the seat for no reason.)

1797
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,220
Gosh, I'm really not
feeling so great today.

1798
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,460
My goodness!

1799
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,290
- We might get lucky and win 100.
- You never know what it'll be like.

1800
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,860
We might know this!
We might know the 100-point question.

1801
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,970
Well, you guys said
even the ten-point question...

1802
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:04,970
- was so hard too.
- Right.

1803
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:07,140
- We'll try the 100-point question.
- Let's see the 100-point question.

1804
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,870
- Shall we try this one?
- Yes, let's do that.

1805
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,370
- Let's go.
- If it's hard...

1806
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,070
- Newly coined words.
- Gosh, no!

1807
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,180
(Category: Newly coined words)

1808
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,210
New words are hard!

1809
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,010
- Who said we should do this?
- This is hard!

1810
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:22,220
We know you find new words hard.
That's why it's worth 100 points.

1811
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,820
- Here's the new word.
- Give us "BCC" for Bus Card Charge.

1812
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,290
TFD.

1813
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,090
- What?
- TFD?

1814
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,690
Write what TFD is short for.

1815
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,090
- TFD?
- TFD?

1816
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,590
- TFD?
- TFD.

1817
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,530
- "Terrible failure of a day?"
- TFD?

1818
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,530
TFD?

1819
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,430
- Today.
- Today. That's right.

1820
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,000
TFD?

1821
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,470
It has to have "Fail" in it,
for sure.

1822
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,870
- "Fail?"
- That's right.

1823
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,940
It might not be that, Jae Seok.

1824
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,210
Could it be something else?

1825
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,110
I think I know this one.

1826
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:47,710
I'm on a roll today.

1827
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,010
(Correct)

1828
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,380
- TFD.
- TFD?

1829
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,710
- Could it be...
- TFD?

1830
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,850
TFD.

1831
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,120
Does it mean something bad?

1832
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,450
TFD. Hang on.

1833
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,190
From what I can see,

1834
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,420
Haha will probably use this a lot.

1835
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,660
- TFD?
- I think Ye Eun would too.

1836
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,660
- Oh, I think I got it right.
- Is that so?

1837
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,560
(Something Haha and Ye Eun
would say often?)

1838
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,630
Oh, I got it! This is easy!

1839
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,070
Hey, it's easy!

1840
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,970
Hey, it's this. It's not hard!

1841
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,110
- I see.
- Jong Kook, is it a bad meaning?

1842
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,740
Hey, this...
You have to think about Ye Eun.

1843
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,180
- Ye Eun?
- Not so much Haha. Ye Eun.

1844
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,850
- Oh, okay. Mr. Free Meals.
- You got it, right?

1845
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:27,580
- You got it, didn't you?
- You have five seconds.

1846
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,020
- Five.
- Just a second.

1847
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,290
- Hey, I know this. Ye Eun.
- Isn't it...

1848
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,320
- Ye Eun?
- Three.

1849
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,320
(They fill out their answers
after that crucial hint.)

1850
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,490
- Hey, that was a nice hint.
- Really?

1851
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:37,860
- You said Ye Eun, right?
- I got it because of Ye Eun.

1852
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:39,930
- One. Lift up your answers.
- Okay.

1853
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,230
- Since Jong Kook said Ye Eun,
- Ye Eun.

1854
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,430
- I changed my answer.
- Me too.

1855
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:48,040
- What is it?
- The answer is, "Today..."

1856
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,800
"I failed my diet."

1857
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,070
- Oh, this is what I wrote.
- I got it!

1858
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,180
"I failed my diet."

1859
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,940
(Jong Kook and Se Chan
got it right!)

1860
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,980
- This... Yes, I did.
- Did you get it right?

1861
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,480
"Today, I failed my diet."

1862
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,590
(She was so confident,
but she got it wrong.)

1863
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,890
- This...
- Did you get it right?

1864
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,790
(Ji Hyo and Daniel are incorrect.)

1865
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,160
Because of Ye Eun, I said,
"Today, it's mango flavor day."

1866
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,760
- My gosh.
- I wrote,

1867
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,560
"I will finish all the food today."

1868
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,830
Seok Jin, read yours out loud too.

1869
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:16,900
- Oh, mine?
- Yes.

1870
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,070
(Giggling)

1871
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,270
What did you write?

1872
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,540
(Checking his answer)

1873
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,210
- My goodness.
- What is it?

1874
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,740
- What?
- What's this?

1875
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,510
"Mama."

1876
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:32,080
"Mama, I won't ruin it next time!"

1877
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,980
- What? "Mama?"
- I just guessed.

1878
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,320
- Who says "Mama" these days?
- "Mama."

1879
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,520
(Mama, I won't ruin it next time!)

1880
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,020
I really can't think of anything.

1881
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:42,890
See? I get lucky and answer
a 100-point question.

1882
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,290
- "Mama."
- That's right. He must be correct.

1883
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,360
I get lucky and answer
a ten-point question.

1884
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,230
- I couldn't answer one question.
- One question remains.

1885
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,630
- One more question.
- Let's go.

1886
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,000
Let's try
another 100-point question.

1887
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,030
- One more time.
- Let's get 100 points.

1888
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,200
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1889
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:54,870
Another 100-point question.

1890
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,200
Let's see what it's about.

1891
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,470
- Economy.
- Economy.

1892
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,110
(Last category, economy)

1893
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,340
- I'm bad with that category.
- Economy? It'll be hard.

1894
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,340
Okay.

1895
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,540
Economy will be hard.

1896
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:03,580
All right.

1897
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:06,480
Here comes a 100-point question
from the economy category.

1898
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,480
Economy will be hard.

1899
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,220
Write down...

1900
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,150
one economic term each...

1901
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,120
- That one is mine.
- so that there's no overlap.

1902
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,220
- It's an easy question!
- An economic term?

1903
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,690
- The eight members...
- It was practically given to us.

1904
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,820
need to write different terms.

1905
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,330
Then you guys have to write
something difficult.

1906
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,030
The older members have to write
something difficult.

1907
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,060
I'll write a difficult term.

1908
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,170
We can do this. Think about it.

1909
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,770
- We can do this.
- It's worth 100 points,

1910
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:26,800
but we can do this.

1911
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,370
For your information,
you need to write down a term...

1912
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,340
and give an explanation
of its meaning.

1913
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,870
- What?
- What? I don't know the meaning.

1914
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,210
(She must've written down a term
she heard about.)

1915
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,480
What does it mean?

1916
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,580
I'm a bit uncertain
about explaining its meaning.

1917
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,950
(I'm a bit uncertain
about explaining its meaning.)

1918
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,280
I'll give a vague explanation.

1919
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,390
We can do this.

1920
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:46,250
This is incredible.

1921
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:50,960
On the count of three,
hold up your answer.

1922
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,390
One,

1923
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:53,660
(It's the last question.
Will it be a success this time?)

1924
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,700
two,

1925
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,060
three. Hold up your answer.

1926
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,200
(The answers are revealed.)

1927
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,300
This is...

1928
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,600
Hold up your answer.

1929
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,870
(Economic bubble, IMF Crisis,
Fund, Decoupling)

1930
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:04,110
This is...

1931
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:07,070
(Engel's coefficient, Black swan,
Inflation, Bankruptcy)

1932
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,180
- Okay. Everyone wrote something.
- Did I spell it right?

1933
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,780
- Are all of them different?
- Please take turns...

1934
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,580
- to explain the term.
- Are all of them correct?

1935
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,880
After writing down a few terms,

1936
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,590
I decided to go with "Bankruptcy."

1937
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:18,890
I decided to go with "Bankruptcy."

1938
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,150
Bankruptcy?

1939
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,760
- Is that an economic term?
- What?

1940
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:22,990
What did you say?

1941
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,490
If this one doesn't count,

1942
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,630
I have many others.

1943
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,190
Rehabilitation.

1944
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,700
Is that an economic term?

1945
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,600
- Isn't it?
- Choose something different.

1946
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,100
Okay. I have something else.

1947
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,170
Opportunity cost.

1948
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,900
- That's good. Opportunity cost.
- Clearly explain...

1949
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,700
- what the opportunity cost is.
- Opportunity cost is a good one.

1950
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,840
Opportunity cost is...

1951
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,310
Must I explain in words
for you to understand?

1952
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,510
(Hesitant)

1953
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,680
You need to explain the meaning.

1954
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,210
So, if I have...

1955
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,180
Option A and Option B...

1956
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,680
(So, if I have
Option A and Option B...)

1957
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,950
(He begins to speak gibberish.)

1958
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,950
- Gosh, what is he doing?
- So,

1959
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,360
it's a bit vague.

1960
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,520
You get it, right?
Let's say there's Person A.

1961
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,760
If Person A...

1962
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,930
wants to buy something... Right?

1963
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,560
You understood, right?

1964
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,430
- You understood, right?
- "To buy something."

1965
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,430
- It's pretty much correct.
- To buy...

1966
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,170
- something...
- That's right.

1967
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:09,800
To buy something...

1968
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,940
- I think I get it.
- That's right.

1969
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,110
- You know, he's right.
- Then he can't buy something else.

1970
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,410
It's about...

1971
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:16,340
how you divide up the money.

1972
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,350
- "How you divide up the money?"
- Yes.

1973
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,650
No. It's about
how you use the money.

1974
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,750
It's something like that.

1975
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,480
Hey, today is my birthday.

1976
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,550
(To the producer)

1977
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:25,150
- I'll give it a pass for now.
- Okay.

1978
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,520
- Se Chan, please explain.
- I have an advanced term.

1979
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,490
I went with "Inflation."

1980
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:33,530
- Explain it.
- Please define "Inflation."

1981
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:34,930
What?

1982
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:35,930
(An increase in prices
and a reduction in the value of money)

1983
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:37,260
Isn't it something...

1984
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,400
people hate?

1985
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,900
- So, what is it?
- People hate it.

1986
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,470
(It shows that he has only heard
about it in passing.)

1987
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,570
It's...

1988
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,970
when things...

1989
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:46,140
- and their prices rise.
- "Things."

1990
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,840
They go up like crazy.

1991
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,040
I'm sorry,

1992
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,140
but I understood.

1993
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,110
Who knows why this occurs?

1994
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:53,310
- That's right.
- It just occurs.

1995
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,520
- I understood.
- The prices...

1996
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,680
- go up.
- Inflation.

1997
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,080
That's it. Isn't that enough?

1998
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,520
- It's correct.
- I'll give it a pass for now.

1999
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,220
I wrote "Black swan."

2000
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,390
It's an unusual event
that suddenly occurs.

2001
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:05,990
- That's correct.
- That's nice.

2002
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,030
He's smart.

2003
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,060
Ye Eun, what did he say?

2004
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,100
I don't know.

2005
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,330
It's the ratio of your food expenses
to your income.

2006
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:12,500
Something like that.

2007
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,470
My economic term is "Decoupling."

2008
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,700
It's the growth
without corresponding increases.

2009
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,110
Decoupling.

2010
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,770
You're cool.

2011
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,440
How cool.
The older members are cool.

2012
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,110
Ye Eun, how about you?

2013
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,750
- Mine is "Fund."
- What?

2014
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,780
- "Fund?"
- "Fund" is a good one.

2015
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,080
- What is it?
- Fund.

2016
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,950
Isn't "Fund" an economic term?
It is, right?

2017
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,250
- What is it?
- What's "Fund?"

2018
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,490
Well,

2019
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:33,220
for people like me who are bad
at investing in stocks,

2020
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,960
the bank does it instead.

2021
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,690
(It's an explanation
that only has a whiff of "Fund.")

2022
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:37,860
That isn't it.

2023
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,830
A fund manager.

2024
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,000
I mean...

2025
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,500
- How do you explain it?
- Yes.

2026
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,000
- I think I understand.
- Still, that was...

2027
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,870
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- What's the exact term?

2028
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,000
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

2029
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,740
- Se Chan and I understood.
- We understood.

2030
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,940
- You understood, right?
- You explained well.

2031
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,670
- A fund manager.
- I explained well, right?

2032
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:52,810
Well done.

2033
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,210
Mine is "IMF Crisis."

2034
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,480
- All right.
- You're smart.

2035
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,980
Let me explain the IMF Crisis.

2036
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,550
It occurred
when I was in elementary school.

2037
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:01,250
That isn't it.

2038
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,520
Explain what it is.

2039
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,150
- IMF is...
- I experienced it myself.

2040
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,320
My dad got fired from work.

2041
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:07,790
- Oh, no.
- He lost his job.

2042
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,960
While talking on the phone,
he punched a closet with his fist.

2043
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,630
- The closet door broke.
- Is that IMF?

2044
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:14,660
I witnessed it myself.

2045
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,460
- The IMF Crisis.
- Explain what it is.

2046
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,730
- I mean...
- That was...

2047
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:18,830
- the IMF Crisis.
- It isn't like that.

2048
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,170
- Come on.
- I have...

2049
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:22,170
that memory from childhood.

2050
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:23,370
I understood.

2051
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,440
- That was great.
- I'm done.

2052
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,310
- Thank goodness.
- Ji Hyo.

2053
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,010
Mine is "Bubble economy."

2054
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,750
What is it?

2055
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,850
It's an economy...

2056
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,050
with bubbles.

2057
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,250
(It's an economy with bubbles.)

2058
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,450
Ji Hyo.

2059
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,620
I understood.

2060
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,220
- I understood.
- I explained it...

2061
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,290
perfectly, right?

2062
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:43,520
Se Chan, you made it so easy
to understand.

2063
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,530
(Insisting when you don't know,
879 times)

2064
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:46,260
- It's correct.
- That's right.

2065
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,530
- That's right.
- It's economy with bubbles.

2066
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:49,900
(Understanding a lousy explanation,
2,371 times)

2067
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,800
Well, she isn't wrong.

2068
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,330
- She's correct.
- Bubble economy.

2069
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,770
- She isn't wrong.
- I'm right.

2070
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,100
- It was so easy to understand.
- Yes.

2071
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,940
All of us wrote different answers.

2072
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,370
Give us points.

2073
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,910
Since there were some members
who couldn't explain the term,

2074
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:03,610
- we can't give you 100 points.
- How about half the points?

2075
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:05,150
- We'll give you half the points.
- That's good.

2076
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,210
- That's good.
- Thus,

2077
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,250
- you have 400 points.
- That's good.

2078
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,220
- Times 10.
- It's 0.1g per 10 points.

2079
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,150
That means
you've acquired 4g of gold.

2080
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,660
- Did you say 4g?
- That's incredible.

2081
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:18,330
What you've acquired is
more than 3.75g of gold.

2082
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,390
All right.

2083
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,930
- Let's move on to the next mission.
- Let's go.

2084
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Through the first quiz mission,

2085
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,100
you've acquired 4g of gold.

2086
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:31,140
These make up 4g of gold.

2087
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,110
- There are a lot.
- Do they make up 4g?

2088
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:35,380
- Do they make up 4g?
- Each one weighs 0.1g.

2089
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,240
- It's real gold.
- How are there so many?

2090
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,450
- These ones...
- We prepared it this way...

2091
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,350
- for easier distribution.
- May I touch them?

2092
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,680
- Each one weighs 0.1g.
- You know,

2093
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,990
- it's very light.
- There are 40.

2094
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,390
- It has been spread thin.
- You know,

2095
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,960
- it's a good souvenir.
- Just how thin is it?

2096
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,460
- Well,
- Is it about 40 dollars?

2097
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,290
is it like a gold flake
you put on food?

2098
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,990
If I throw it in the air, it'll fly.

2099
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,530
A gold flake on sushi.

2100
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:57,100
It's over 3.75g of gold.

2101
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,370
- It's over 3.75g of gold.
- Good.

2102
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,600
Now, you'll have a chance
to win more gold.

2103
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:07,140
You'll be given a total of 30 balls.

2104
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,580
The members will take turns...

2105
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,680
rolling the balls toward the stick
that's taped on the ground.

2106
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,320
The ball needs to hit the stick,
fly in the air,

2107
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,020
and go into a container.

2108
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,320
However, the balls
must go into the boxes...

2109
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,120
in a set order for success.

2110
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:26,090
There are numbers 1 to 3
on the boxes.

2111
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,700
That means this is Level One.

2112
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,430
If you succeed in Level One,

2113
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:32,570
we'll give you another 1g of gold
and make your prize 5g of gold.

2114
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,570
In Level Two,

2115
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:37,740
you'll get boxes 4 and 5.

2116
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,170
If you succeed in Level Two,

2117
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,610
we'll double the amount
of your gold.

2118
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:44,140
(If they succeed in Level 2,
they'll have 10g of gold.)

2119
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,350
- Doubling the gold is insane.
- Then...

2120
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,250
you'll have a total of 10g.

2121
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,820
- It's no joke.
- However,

2122
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:52,120
if you fail,

2123
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,590
- Will we lose gold?
- you'll lose all of your gold.

2124
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,060
(The moment they fail,
they'll lose all of their gold.)

2125
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,520
They'll make us lose gold...

2126
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,160
- in the end.
- Really?

2127
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,330
Hyung In.

2128
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,800
It's my birthday, Hyung In.

2129
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,070
Why are you doing this
on my birthday?

2130
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,170
You can stop after succeeding in...

2131
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,570
Level One.

2132
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,500
We can decide
whether or not to go further.

2133
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,210
- But we...
- We have to double the gold.

2134
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:13,210
Okay.

2135
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:14,540
Will you give it a go?

2136
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:15,610
We'll give it a go.

2137
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,310
I guess it'll bounce.

2138
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,550
- Bounce.
- This is...

2139
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:19,710
- This is...
- When we roll it...

2140
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,180
It goes up like that.

2141
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,280
- This is...
- When we roll it...

2142
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,020
(The ball hits the stick
and bounces up!)

2143
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,720
We need to make it bounce.

2144
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,490
It'll be very hard.

2145
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:30,960
It doesn't go up high.

2146
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,960
Hold on.

2147
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,590
(They need to make the ball bounce
and go into a box.)

2148
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:34,700
No.

2149
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,860
- That's how it goes.
- Try again.

2150
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,300
- Okay.
- Send it to the center.

2151
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,430
Send it to the center.
It's like bowling.

2152
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:40,030
- If it goes like that...
- Should we roll it harder?

2153
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,200
Send it to the center.

2154
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,880
If you roll it too hard,

2155
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,680
- it goes upward.
- It's better than being too gentle.

2156
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,010
- Nice.
- That's it.

2157
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,580
- Nice.
- That's it.

2158
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:56,650
- There you go.
- You're good.

2159
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:57,650
Roll it hard.

2160
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,390
- It's better than being too gentle.
- There you go.

2161
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,620
Ji Hyo, you're good.

2162
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,160
- There you go.
- Ji Hyo, you're good.

2163
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,430
- Ji Hyo is good.
- Can I roll it gently?

2164
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,830
Hey, Ye Eun.

2165
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,230
Why did you do it too weakly?

2166
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,300
- I rolled it hard.
- Put it on the floor. Watch.

2167
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,200
Roll it from this position.

2168
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,970
- Okay.
- Watch me do it.

2169
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,240
- So, you just...
- Roll it like this, okay?

2170
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,270
- To the floor?
- Put it on the floor...

2171
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:20,510
- and roll it like this.
- You shouldn't throw it.

2172
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,010
- Okay.
- It went in.

2173
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:23,580
- You're good.
- You're good.

2174
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:25,650
(Standing next to them,
Se Chan gets the hang of it.)

2175
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:26,750
- Okay.
- It went in.

2176
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,120
- You're good.
- You're good.

2177
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,250
(Standing next to them,
Se Chan gets the hang of it.)

2178
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,250
Try it.

2179
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:32,590
- Nice.
- He's good.

2180
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,360
- Nice.
- He's good.

2181
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,420
- Nice.
- Good.

2182
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:37,990
- Nice.
- He's good.

2183
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:39,530
- You're good.
- Okay.

2184
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,230
- He's good at using his body.
- He's good.

2185
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:42,630
I want to do this well.

2186
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,000
- I want to do this well.
- Roll it hard.

2187
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,500
- Do it like you're bowling.
- It's hard.

2188
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,200
Why can't I do it?

2189
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,570
I had the same thought.

2190
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,370
- No.
- Why are you so bad at games...

2191
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:52,170
- that involve balls?
- I can't do it.

2192
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:53,270
To the white one in the center.

2193
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,310
- The white one?
- Yes.

2194
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,740
I bet women are good at this.

2195
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:56,940
- That's good.
- Ji Hyo.

2196
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,410
- Ji Hyo.
- My goodness.

2197
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,510
It's better to roll it hard.

2198
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,080
- That's good.
- Ji Hyo.

2199
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,350
- Ji Hyo.
- My goodness.

2200
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,820
Okay.

2201
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,820
We're set. We're totally set.

2202
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:06,950
Now, put the balls in the baskets.

2203
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:09,220
Practice time is over.

2204
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,960
While one member
can roll multiple balls,

2205
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,960
each member must roll...

2206
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,400
- one or more balls.
- Okay. We understand.

2207
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,400
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

2208
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,500
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

2209
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,830
- Yes.
- Let's go.

2210
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,330
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2211
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,500
(They get started with Level 1.
Success will add 1g of gold.)

2212
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,140
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

2213
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:27,340
If you fail in Level One,

2214
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,380
you'll lose 4g of gold
you've accumulated.

2215
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,780
- Okay.
- Roll it comfortably.

2216
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,780
- Watch how well Ye Eun does,
- Okay.

2217
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,820
- okay?
- All right.

2218
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,920
(The first player, Ye Eun)

2219
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,020
There she goes.

2220
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:41,160
Thank goodness
it didn't go over the stick.

2221
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,060
- I'll go next.
- Go ahead.

2222
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,530
(Ji Hyo goes next.)

2223
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,630
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 29
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, and 3)

2224
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,960
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 28
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, and 3)

2225
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,000
- Hey.
- It's okay.

2226
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,360
- Jae Seok, go.
- Do it with more effort.

2227
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,530
(Jae Seok was the first one
to succeed in it.)

2228
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,570
- There you go.
- That's it.

2229
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,140
(At that moment,
the ball changes direction.)

2230
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,370
- Gosh.
- No.

2231
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,710
- There you go.
- That's it.

2232
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,610
(The parabola fell a bit short.)

2233
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,780
- You can do it. One at a time.
- Go ahead.

2234
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,940
Let's do one at a time.

2235
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,650
Box 1 and box 2.

2236
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:07,750
One person can keep going.

2237
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,420
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 27
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, and 3)

2238
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:13,020
(The ball bounces well.)

2239
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,720
- No. Not box 2.
- Not box 2.

2240
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,520
- Box two?
- It doesn't count. Take it out.

2241
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,660
It needs to go into box one.

2242
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,030
Was it box two?

2243
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:22,130
(Jong Kook goes next.)

2244
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:24,100
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 26
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, and 3)

2245
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,970
- It's box 2.
- It keeps going into box 2.

2246
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:28,170
- It went into box two.
- Let's reduce the power a bit.

2247
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:29,640
It went into box two.
Do it a bit more gently.

2248
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,840
- Okay.
- One.

2249
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,010
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 25
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, and 3)

2250
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:33,970
- Haha.
- For goodness' sake.

2251
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,910
- It needs to go into box 1.
- It keeps going into box 2.

2252
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:37,640
- It needs to go into box 1.
- Box 1.

2253
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:39,580
I need to do it with more strength.

2254
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,080
(The weak member,
Seok Jin, gives it a go.)

2255
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,450
(At that moment,)

2256
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,650
(the ball goes towards the boxes!)

2257
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,190
(It goes into box 1.)

2258
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,860
- Nice!
- Okay.

2259
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,290
- Box 2 is easy.
- Box 3.

2260
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:52,760
- Box 2.
- You can put it in box 2.

2261
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,030
With this energy, I'll try again.

2262
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,900
- Box 2.
- Box 2 is easy. Roll hard.

2263
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:56,930
Box two.

2264
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,800
- Good.
- There you go.

2265
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,230
I put it in box two earlier,
so I'll give it a go.

2266
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,800
- You did it earlier. You can do it.
- I'll give it a go.

2267
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,040
You did a good job
of putting it in box two earlier.

2268
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,810
Box 2. This is the vibe for box 2.

2269
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:05,870
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 22
Remaining boxes: 2 and 3)

2270
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:07,470
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 21
Remaining boxes: 2 and 3)

2271
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,840
- What?
- Don't make it bounce.

2272
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,240
Gosh, we don't have many balls left.

2273
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,450
(The ace member, Se Chan, enters.)

2274
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,550
I'll give it a go.

2275
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,980
Do it in a relaxed way.

2276
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,520
Do it in a relaxed way.

2277
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:22,290
(Will he make it go into box 2
as he did in the past?)

2278
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:24,560
You did it!

2279
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,190
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 20
Remaining boxes: 2 and 3)

2280
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:27,260
(It goes into box 2.)

2281
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,300
- You did it!
- Okay.

2282
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,300
- Okay.
- Let's put it in box three.

2283
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,800
Now, you just need to put a ball
in box three.

2284
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:33,300
Box three.

2285
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,800
- Roll it hard.
- Roll it hard.

2286
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,100
You don't need to run up.

2287
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,100
- No, it's necessary.
- Haha, you can't use a ball...

2288
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,270
- you picked up.
- What?

2289
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,710
- Hyung In.
- It's his birthday.

2290
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:44,810
It's my birthday. It's mine.

2291
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:47,310
You can only use a new ball
from the basket.

2292
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,220
- All right. Box three.
- Go.

2293
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:51,650
- Box 3. Let's do box 3.
- Okay.

2294
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:52,820
- Don't roll it so hard.
- It's okay.

2295
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:53,950
- Roll it hard.
- It's better that way.

2296
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,520
- You need to roll it hard.
- You need to roll it hard.

2297
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,760
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 18
Remaining boxes: 3)

2298
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,790
Seok Jin, roll it hard.

2299
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,190
Okay.

2300
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:03,030
Haha, not many balls remain.
You need to focus.

2301
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,930
We'll lose all of our gold.

2302
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,000
- No.
- No, that isn't it.

2303
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,100
- I'll give it a go.
- Daniel.

2304
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,340
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 16
Remaining boxes: 3)

2305
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,510
- Daniel.
- He doesn't have the strength.

2306
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,810
- I don't think it'll work.
- I don't think it'll work.

2307
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,110
I knew it.

2308
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,580
For goodness' sake.
Why did it come backward?

2309
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:20,650
- All right.
- Haha.

2310
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,750
(Despite the continued effort)

2311
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,920
Gosh, this is...

2312
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,650
- It worked!
- No.

2313
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,790
(They begin to lose hope.)

2314
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:29,990
What's wrong with you?

2315
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,930
- Why are you using so many balls?
- Why are you using so many balls?

2316
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:33,130
- Stop it.
- Move.

2317
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,700
- Each ball is precious.
- Move.

2318
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,960
- This is driving me crazy.
- Now, not many balls remain.

2319
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:38,070
I should roll it hard, right?

2320
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:40,200
- Yes.
- Seven balls remain, right?

2321
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:41,640
Roll it hard.

2322
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,670
No!

2323
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:43,900
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 7
Remaining boxes: 3)

2324
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,710
(The ball flies up!)

2325
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,180
(Will it go straight into box 3?)

2326
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,780
(It bounces off.)

2327
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:52,650
It was so close.

2328
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,280
- Who will go next?
- Se Chan, go next.

2329
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,750
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan, let's go.

2330
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,720
Se Chan looks a bit like
Ryu Hyun Jin right now.

2331
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,590
- Really?
- You're the starting pitcher.

2332
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,790
Hey, Ye Eun is getting confused.

2333
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,560
- Daniel has the cooking skills,
- That's right.

2334
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,430
- but you have the gaming skills.
- You're an all-rounder.

2335
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:07,060
- Boyfriend.
- For goodness' sake.

2336
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,900
- Go.
- It was too strong.

2337
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,060
Relax.

2338
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,200
(He throws it!)

2339
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,270
There you go.

2340
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:17,370
(Level 1, Remaining chances: 6
Remaining boxes: 3)

2341
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:20,070
- There you go.
- He did it!

2342
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:21,880
(It's a goal.)

2343
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,180
(Se Chan did it.)

2344
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,450
Se Chan!

2345
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,180
(They succeed in Level 1
in 25 attempts.)

2346
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,950
Okay.

2347
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:32,150
- Is it a success?
- Se Chan!

2348
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,450
- Is it a success?
- You did so well.

2349
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:35,960
You've succeeded in Level One.

2350
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,790
For Level Two,

2351
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,590
boxes 4 and 5 will be added.

2352
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:40,790
I think it's doable.

2353
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,200
However, the number of balls
will remain at 30.

2354
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,700
- What will it be? Shall we do it?
- Of course.

2355
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:45,900
- Shall we do it?
- Of course.

2356
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,370
- Of course.
- We have to do it.

2357
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,000
- We have to do it.
- We have to do it.

2358
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,970
- We have to do it.
- Will you go for Level Two?

2359
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,640
No, it'll be hard.

2360
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,940
- I think it'll be okay.
- Why don't we have Se Chan roll...

2361
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,510
- about 15 balls?
- Yes.

2362
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,150
Don't put me under so much pressure.

2363
01:17:58,150 --> 01:17:59,280
- Let's divide up the balls.
- All right.

2364
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,380
- Shall we go for Level Two?
- Let's go for it.

2365
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:01,380
- One, two...
- Let's go for it.

2366
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,580
- Let's go for it.
- Let's go for it.

2367
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,850
- Let's go for it.
- We have to go for it.

2368
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,250
If you fail,

2369
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,520
your 5g of gold will disappear.

2370
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,120
- Okay.
- We know that.

2371
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,560
- Life is like that.
- Let's give it a go.

2372
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,090
Will you go for it?

2373
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,500
- Yes.
- Do it with caution.

2374
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,530
Here I go.

2375
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:19,130
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 30
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2376
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:20,370
- There you go!
- Good!

2377
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,000
- It was great.
- It was great.

2378
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,240
(She failed despite the shout.)

2379
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,370
- It was great.
- Go ahead.

2380
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:26,070
- Seok Jin, a ball is in the way.
- A ball.

2381
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,710
- Let's take it out.
- Let's take it out.

2382
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,340
- What is a ball boy doing?
- Go.

2383
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,880
Give it to us.

2384
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,610
It's his birthday, Hyung In.

2385
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:35,680
- Hyung In.
- It's Haha's birthday.

2386
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:38,050
You embarrassed him.

2387
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:40,390
She's right.
I was going to steal it.

2388
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,420
(An unexpected dark horse,
Seok Jin, comes next.)

2389
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,660
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 29
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2390
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,590
- It's okay.
- Don't be nervous.

2391
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,130
- Get the direction right.
- Get the direction right.

2392
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,030
(Fail)

2393
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,330
It's okay.

2394
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,370
I have a talent
for putting the ball into box one.

2395
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:56,840
- Why is he using 3 balls?
- Why are you using 3 balls?

2396
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,470
Why are you using three balls?
Move out of the way.

2397
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:59,840
- Move out of the way.
- I'll wait.

2398
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,070
- You aren't that good.
- Okay.

2399
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,140
- Wait.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

2400
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,210
Let's go.

2401
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,950
- Jae Seok, I'll go next.
- Roll a ball.

2402
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:05,950
- Box 1.
- Roll 1 ball.

2403
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:06,980
(Daniel steps forward instead.)

2404
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:07,980
I'll go for box one.

2405
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,820
Maybe Daniel shouldn't do it.

2406
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,320
- I guess box one will be okay.
- You can do it.

2407
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,620
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 27
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2408
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,350
- You can do it.
- It went in!

2409
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,990
Why did it go into box two?

2410
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,090
- It's okay, Daniel.
- You know,

2411
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,590
- it goes into box two the most.
- Haha.

2412
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:20,390
- We need to put it in box 1.
- Box 1.

2413
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:21,460
Se Chan, go next.

2414
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,500
(Se Chan successfully put
a ball in box 1.)

2415
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,060
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 26
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2416
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,470
- That's good.
- Do it gently. It's for box one.

2417
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:29,670
- We need to put it in box 1.
- We need to put it in box 1.

2418
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:33,870
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 25
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2419
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,540
- It missed.
- It needed the right direction.

2420
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:39,050
- Gosh, that startled me.
- I'll get the direction right.

2421
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:40,310
- Go for box one.
- We're in trouble.

2422
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:41,650
- This is driving me crazy.
- We should've gotten a ball...

2423
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:43,150
- in box one by now.
- Curve it a bit.

2424
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,520
(It's already the 8th attempt.)

2425
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,120
- He did it.
- Okay.

2426
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,590
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 23
Remaining boxes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2427
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,320
- He did it.
- Okay!

2428
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,230
(Thankfully, the groom-to-be
put a ball in box 1.)

2429
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,300
- The right direction was the key.
- Box 2. Jae Seok, it's box 2.

2430
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:57,760
- The right direction was the key.
- Box two.

2431
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,830
- Jae Seok, it's box two.
- Okay.

2432
01:19:58,830 --> 01:19:59,830
Box two.

2433
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:00,900
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 22
Remaining boxes: 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2434
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,370
For goodness' sake.

2435
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:04,340
Why did you bounce it on the floor?

2436
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:06,340
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 21
Remaining boxes: 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2437
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,370
He did it.

2438
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:11,710
(It's another close fail.)

2439
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:13,880
- It's okay.
- Number two.

2440
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,880
- Let's go for box 2.
- Box 2.

2441
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,880
- You specialize in box two.
- I'll use a different ball.

2442
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,390
Box two.

2443
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,560
Shouldn't Ji Hyo go for box two?

2444
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,860
Let's do well.

2445
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,730
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 20
Remaining boxes: 2, 3, 4, and 5)

2446
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,000
- It went into box two.
- Ji Hyo should go next.

2447
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,130
- It went in.
- Ji Hyo should go next.

2448
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,530
- Box three.
- It went in.

2449
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,400
- Box three.
- It'll try again.

2450
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,540
- I have good energy right now.
- Throw it hard.

2451
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,310
Make it bounce up
and hit the backboard.

2452
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:40,640
- Box three.
- Then it'll go in.

2453
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:42,080
- Focus.
- He'll fail.

2454
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,110
- Focus.
- He'll fail.

2455
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,780
He did it!

2456
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,380
(It really hits the backboard!)

2457
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,980
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 19
Remaining boxes: 3, 4, and 5)

2458
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:51,990
He did it!

2459
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,920
(It bounces off.)

2460
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,690
- It's different when you focus.
- It's different. Box three...

2461
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,790
What is he doing?

2462
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:01,800
- What is he doing?
- Seok Jin, why...

2463
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,030
- Why...
- Stop.

2464
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,970
- Stop.
- I put a ball in box two.

2465
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:06,770
- Seok Jin.
- I put a ball in box two.

2466
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,170
Gosh, box three.

2467
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,500
- We're in trouble.
- We won't succeed in it.

2468
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:11,940
Box three.

2469
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,640
Make it bounce
and hit the backboard.

2470
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,710
Ji Hyo, give it a try.

2471
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:15,880
- Box 3.
- I've never put it in box 3.

2472
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,010
- Roll it hard.
- Give it a go.

2473
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,250
- Roll it hard.
- You can do it.

2474
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:19,350
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 16
Remaining boxes: 3, 4, and 5)

2475
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:20,580
You shouldn't make it bounce.

2476
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,880
- It's okay.
- Box three.

2477
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,880
Box three is next.

2478
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,820
No, it's box 3.
It went into box 3, right?

2479
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,350
- It didn't go in.
- It didn't go in.

2480
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,820
Haha, hit the backboard
that's box four.

2481
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,320
You need to roll it.

2482
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,520
(It hits the side.)

2483
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,330
We should've gotten a ball
in box three by now.

2484
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:34,930
- We need to put it in there.
- Earlier, box three...

2485
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:39,530
It was hard to put a ball
in box three.

2486
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,270
- Gosh, we're in trouble.
- It was hard to put it in there.

2487
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,100
Gosh.

2488
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:46,140
It's a success!

2489
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:50,080
(At this rate, they'll lose
the gold they have.)

2490
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:53,680
Why didn't it go in?

2491
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,050
(Even the ace members struggle.)

2492
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:56,850
- This is driving me crazy.
- This won't do.

2493
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,220
- Just 2.
- Boxes 3, 4, and 5 are too...

2494
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,920
(As their hopes fade,
only 7 attempts remain.)

2495
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,120
Okay.

2496
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,490
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 7
Remaining boxes: 3, 4, and 5)

2497
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:07,390
(At that moment,
the ball boy throws a ball!)

2498
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,270
(It goes into box 3.)

2499
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,770
- Okay.
- Haha!

2500
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,670
- The remaining balls.
- Now...

2501
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:17,500
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2502
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,470
- If you put them in boxes 4 and 5,
- Yes.

2503
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:21,740
- Four and five.
- you pass Level Two.

2504
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:23,180
Four and five.

2505
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:25,080
- Those with two can throw once.
- Okay.

2506
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,380
- Right.
- Those with two can throw once.

2507
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,720
- Let's throw once.
- Throw it hard.

2508
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,780
Throw it hard.

2509
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,650
If you throw it hard,
it might bounce away.

2510
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,060
Let's go!

2511
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:37,590
(Level 2, Remaining chances: 6,
Remaining boxes: 4 and 5)

2512
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:38,690
- Throwing hard doesn't work.
- But...

2513
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:40,660
- Why does it fly back?
- I'll give it a go.

2514
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,530
It was a good throw.

2515
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,200
Why does it fly back?

2516
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,270
Let's just put it in box four.

2517
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,470
- It should go to four...
- It went in!

2518
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:50,700
(Did it go in?)

2519
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:52,170
- It went in!
- It went in!

2520
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,440
(The ball hit the backboard
and went too far.)

2521
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,610
I thought it went in.

2522
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,180
- I thought it went in.
- I thought it went in.

2523
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,620
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

2524
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,590
- Put it in box 4.
- I'll put it in box 4,

2525
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,560
- and you 2 can put it in box 5.
- Right.

2526
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,560
That would be amazing.

2527
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,190
Throw it hard.

2528
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:12,860
(It would be a miracle
if it happens as they want.)

2529
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,300
(Taking on the challenge
with the energy of the universe)

2530
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:23,470
(It's circling around the corner
of box 4.)

2531
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:29,540
(He really did it.)

2532
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:30,940
(The Weak Hero created
the miracle of box 4 in the end.)

2533
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:33,080
What just happened?

2534
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,680
- Seok Jin!
- Calm down.

2535
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,980
- It worked.
- Well done.

2536
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,650
- It worked.
- It's crazy.

2537
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:39,490
- It's crazy.
- Calm down.

2538
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,650
Calm down. That's 1 for 2.

2539
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:41,890
We have one left.

2540
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,490
(The production crew
was more shocked.)

2541
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,490
(If they succeed until the end,
1,600 dollars will go away.)

2542
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:48,190
They thought we would fail.

2543
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,160
- You have two attempts left.
- Calm down.

2544
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,200
(They have to fill the last box
in the remaining 2 attempts.)

2545
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,570
Calm down.

2546
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:53,870
Just throw it hard. It's better.

2547
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:55,170
(They have to fill the last box
in the remaining 2 attempts.)

2548
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:57,170
- If it's too hard...
- If it's too hard...

2549
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,170
Right. It would...

2550
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:01,340
You have two attempts now.
There will be no reattempts.

2551
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,980
Let's not make it messy.

2552
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,240
- I think...
- I'll try.

2553
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,480
I think this is right.

2554
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,750
- Sideways?
- Yes. Not sideways.

2555
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,010
- From this spot.
- Without a running start.

2556
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,420
- Throw it here. It just went in.
- Okay.

2557
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,590
- That's right.
- The direction...

2558
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,990
If this enters box five...

2559
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:16,190
- That would be great.
- It would be amazing.

2560
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:17,560
We have the variety deity with us.

2561
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,290
- Of course.
- That's right.

2562
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,630
The variety deity...

2563
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,600
(The ball of destiny was thrown.)

2564
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,430
- You got it.
- You did it!

2565
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,370
(It flew!)

2566
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:30,440
(If it goes in, they will earn
10g of gold immediately!)

2567
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,870
- It worked.
- It worked!

2568
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:35,380
(The distance was too short.)

2569
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:37,380
- But...
- I thought it went in.

2570
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:38,580
Goodness.

2571
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,280
- I thought it went in.
- That was close.

2572
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,550
Why did it go that way?
It was a good throw.

2573
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,480
- It was really close.
- This location is better.

2574
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,290
- Instead of taking a running start.
- Jong Kook.

2575
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,750
- Let's go.
- It's a bit too strong.

2576
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:48,790
- It has to be a bit strong.
- It has to be strong?

2577
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:50,260
- Or this will all be lost.
- Jong Kook.

2578
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:53,090
Please.

2579
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:56,000
- Throw it well. Make a miracle.
- Please.

2580
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:57,360
- Please.
- You never know

2581
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,470
- Right?
- Please.

2582
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,270
You never know.

2583
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,470
It's here! You never know.

2584
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:06,440
(What will the result be?)

2585
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:11,710
- You got it!
- This was a bit...

2586
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,610
- This isn't fun.
- Now.

2587
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,780
- Now. The mission ended.
- This isn't fun.

2588
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:19,650
The 5g of gold
you have gained until now...

2589
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:21,190
- are gone.
- No.

2590
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,920
- Gosh...
- No!

2591
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,590
(The gold prize disappeared.)

2592
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:27,090
Why are you so bad
at throwing a ball?

2593
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,190
It doesn't work.

2594
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,930
Honestly, we reached box three
after struggling so much.

2595
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:34,530
Who decided to attempt it
until box five?

2596
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,340
- We should go.
- We should go.

2597
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,970
- We should go for it.
- We made a dramatic success.

2598
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:40,740
Who decided to continue
until box five?

2599
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,010
It wasn't me, Kook.

2600
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:44,210
- It wasn't me.
- I swear it was him.

2601
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:47,750
Anyway, you failed to earn...

2602
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:50,080
10g of gold.

2603
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,090
- That should have gone in.
- They disappeared.

2604
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:54,490
Lastly, we will decide on the person
to get the penalty,

2605
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,690
with getting off work at stake.

2606
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:58,660
- What would this be?
- This again...

2607
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:00,460
Three people will receive
the penalty, right?

2608
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:02,830
- It was so close.
- It's a shame.

2609
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,530
This will decide
if you will get off work.

2610
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:07,030
- We should do this.
- Yes.

2611
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:11,770
I said you had to get off work
before 4 p.m.

2612
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,810
It's almost time.

2613
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:16,540
So the last leaving work mission...

2614
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:19,950
is to open the door behind you
and go out...

2615
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,510
- before it's 4 p.m.
- What?

2616
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,380
There's a passcode.

2617
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,490
- There's a passcode.
- Thirty...

2618
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:29,220
We prepared 30 card keys.

2619
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,590
There are eight real card keys.

2620
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,560
- Eight.
- There's one for each person.

2621
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,600
- You have to pick.
- Through the opening mission,

2622
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,000
it was decided
that there would be...

2623
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,060
- three penalty receivers.
- Yes.

2624
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,070
- So only five can leave.
- Is that so?

2625
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,170
The remaining three...

2626
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,800
- will receive a penalty.
- I hope I can leave.

2627
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,140
For your information,
today's penalty takes time.

2628
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:49,580
It's a physically tiresome
and bothersome penalty.

2629
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,040
- This is crazy.
- Why, of all times?

2630
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:53,380
- We should decide the order.
- We said...

2631
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:55,880
- we would give you benefits...
- Yes.

2632
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,580
after the three-minute
cooking mission.

2633
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,490
- At the beginning.
- You will decide the order...

2634
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:01,490
according to your rank
in the mission.

2635
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:03,790
You can decide the order you want.

2636
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:04,960
- That's really nice.
- That's an advantage.

2637
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,230
- Okay. Good.
- That's an advantage.

2638
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:09,360
You should always be somewhere
in the middle. I'll be fifth.

2639
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,330
- I'll remain second.
- Fourth.

2640
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:12,800
- It will go around and come back.
- Also,

2641
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,700
if the door doesn't open,
the order will repeat again.

2642
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:16,840
- Right?
- It will come back.

2643
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,970
This is fun.

2644
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:21,470
There's a red sticker on the lock.
Place it there.

2645
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,810
- When you hear the beep...
- If it doesn't beep,

2646
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,380
- you have to stay here.
- It's important.

2647
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:26,610
- This makes me nervous.
- It would be really thrilling...

2648
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:27,810
if it opened at once.

2649
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:28,950
No one should open it
at the beginning...

2650
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:30,280
- No one should open it.
- to increase my chances.

2651
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,420
- No one should open it.
- It would be good for us then.

2652
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,450
It would be fun that way.

2653
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:35,020
(Seok Sam goes first.)

2654
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:38,090
For me, Hyun Jin's number
is 99, right?

2655
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:39,490
Right. Hyun Jin wouldn't like it.

2656
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:40,590
- The number?
- Yes.

2657
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:42,100
Should I put it down, then?

2658
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,760
There's lucky seven as well.

2659
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,970
I'm sorry,
but if I get to go out first,

2660
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:49,000
I'll leave without saying bye.

2661
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
- Yes.
- Of course.

2662
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,770
- I won't say goodbye.
- You can leave.

2663
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:53,470
- That would be great.
- You can leave first.

2664
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:54,640
- I'll leave work first.
- Yes.

2665
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:55,780
- I won't say goodbye.
- Okay.

2666
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:57,640
You can go out when it beeps.

2667
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,610
- Bye.
- I always cheer for you, Hyun Jin.

2668
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:02,250
- Number 99.
- I'll go first.

2669
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,880
(Seok Sam boldly chose to go first.)

2670
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,120
Please.

2671
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,020
(Could it be...?)

2672
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,660
Okay. It's not that one.

2673
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,830
It beeped.

2674
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,230
Come back.

2675
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,030
- Come here.
- Beep.

2676
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:18,800
- The sound...
- Come here, sir.

2677
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,830
- It made a sound.
- Come here, sir.

2678
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:24,340
- Okay.
- Come here, sir.

2679
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:27,740
I'm really lucky
when it comes to choosing things.

2680
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,440
- He's not good at anything, but...
- But I think he'll pick it.

2681
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,840
- I'm really lucky with choosing.
- He's good at choosing, though.

2682
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,850
- You should keep going.
- I'll take seven.

2683
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,850
- That's a traditional pick.
- He's a beginner.

2684
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,750
They wouldn't have put it
in the lucky seven card.

2685
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,750
- I picked it.
- He won't get out.

2686
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,750
Go.

2687
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,690
- Okay.
- Good!

2688
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,490
The latter turns are good.

2689
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,090
The chances are increasing.

2690
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,760
- It didn't work.
- Ddochi.

2691
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,730
- I'll go with this. Number 151.
- Good.

2692
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:52,970
- Is there a reason?
- Okay.

2693
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,270
There's no reason.
I'm just going with my feeling.

2694
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,570
- Ddochi!
- Goodbye.

2695
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:56,570
- Go.
- For real.

2696
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:58,770
- Bye.
- Bye.

2697
01:28:58,770 --> 01:28:59,910
(Will her gut feeling be correct?)

2698
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:02,780
(It didn't work.)

2699
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:05,580
(The number of people
who can escape remains the same!)

2700
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,080
- Okay!
- Good!

2701
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,180
- Come here.
- Okay, good.

2702
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,580
- Good.
- It's really good for you.

2703
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,920
- Good.
- If you aim to die, you will live.

2704
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,220
- Four for death.
- I'll take number four.

2705
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,860
I always chose number four.

2706
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,690
Just die!

2707
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:20,030
(He is cursed
before his chance to go home.)

2708
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,760
- Hey.
- Die.

2709
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:23,860
- Okay.
- Okay.

2710
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,000
Let's go home!

2711
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,630
(The newlywed husband
tries to get off work early!)

2712
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:29,340
- Darn it.
- Okay!

2713
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,440
I'm excited.

2714
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,070
- I'm excited.
- Good!

2715
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:33,340
- I'm excited.
- This is good!

2716
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:35,010
- Se Chan.
- This is fun.

2717
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:36,480
Come here, Jong Kook.

2718
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,540
There are eight real card keys...

2719
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,980
- remaining.
- What's going on?

2720
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:41,580
- It's time someone picks it.
- It's not easy for us to all fail.

2721
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:42,980
I should have just picked anything.

2722
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:44,750
I'll go with 38 Gwang-ttang.

2723
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,090
- Se Chan.
- Great work today.

2724
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:48,550
- Your girlfriend is watching.
- See you later.

2725
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:51,090
- Please.
- I think it will open.

2726
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:52,460
No way.

2727
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:55,290
(It opened.)

2728
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,930
What?

2729
01:29:56,930 --> 01:29:59,000
(Yang Se Chan will get off work.)

2730
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,270
Bye!

2731
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:02,570
This is crazy.

2732
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:04,070
(With Se Chan's exit,
4 people can leave now!)

2733
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,170
Amazing.

2734
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:07,840
- Amazing.
- Okay.

2735
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:10,340
- I'll get going.
- Seriously.

2736
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,350
Too many...

2737
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:14,610
- He's really...
- Hey.

2738
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:17,180
Birthday people. The three
birthday people are gathered.

2739
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:18,790
- From the streets.
- Okay, let's go!

2740
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:20,190
The birthday people should go home.

2741
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:22,050
Come back here.

2742
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:23,860
Is this not the sound?

2743
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,090
Come back.

2744
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:26,290
Let's go. Okay!

2745
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:27,960
(The 7th attempter,
Lucky Ji Hyo, also fails.)

2746
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,560
- Okay!
- There are spots left.

2747
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,800
- Okay.
- Okay!

2748
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,500
Let's go!

2749
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,570
(Yu also fails...)

2750
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:34,570
Jae Seok.

2751
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:35,670
(despite his higher chances!)

2752
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:38,070
- Welcome back.
- Come here, Jae Seok.

2753
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:39,210
We're entertainers, indeed.

2754
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,440
- No one is succeeding.
- Welcome.

2755
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,010
You should greet before you leave.

2756
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,610
- No. I'll just leave.
- Come to the side.

2757
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:44,940
Jae Seok caught this earlier.

2758
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,480
I was eyeing that.

2759
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,980
- I'm taking it.
- I chose that earlier.

2760
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:50,880
Fifty-six!
If you add 3 and 8, it's 11.

2761
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,120
When you add 5 and 6,
it's still 11. I won't say goodbye.

2762
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,190
- Okay.
- Bye?

2763
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:55,560
Let's go!

2764
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,090
(Beeping)

2765
01:30:57,090 --> 01:30:58,090
(Laughing)

2766
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:59,260
What was that?

2767
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:01,130
Did I hear that wrong?

2768
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:02,960
- Come here.
- Did I hear that wrong?

2769
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,960
- Okay!
- Did I hear it wrong?

2770
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,700
There are so many cards left.

2771
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:07,770
That's not open, right?

2772
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:09,270
I'll pick one right away.

2773
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,370
- It's here.
- I'll pick...

2774
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,540
There are seven cards.

2775
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,970
I'll pick number 22. My birthday.

2776
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:14,970
Okay.

2777
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:17,540
- This is hard.
- I said bye earlier. I'll just go.

2778
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:18,950
- Go.
- Go.

2779
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,950
Please.

2780
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:22,880
No way.

2781
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,790
Come back here.

2782
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,890
- What number was that?
- Go on.

2783
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:31,020
(The clumsy, lucky man is the 2nd
to leave with 6 minutes left!)

2784
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,260
- Thank you.
- This is annoying.

2785
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:36,700
My stomach hurts. It really does.

2786
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,870
Only three can leave now.

2787
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:40,270
Three.

2788
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:43,170
And there are six
real card keys left.

2789
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:44,770
There are six of them.

2790
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:45,870
We have three spots left.

2791
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:47,270
Should I take this? I'll take this.

2792
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:48,670
- Okay.
- I thought of taking that before.

2793
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,540
- Bye.
- I thought of taking that earlier.

2794
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:52,210
Ye Eun. You'd probably come back.

2795
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:54,480
(It opened.)

2796
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,050
(The frequent penalty receiver,
Ddochi, succeeds in escaping!)

2797
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:59,290
- That screeching voice.
- It's crazy.

2798
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,590
- What number was it?
- Bye.

2799
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,560
- Seriously.
- There are five left.

2800
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,890
These are people
who have a crush on me.

2801
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,690
- Hey.
- Goodness.

2802
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:09,100
How did it end up this way?

2803
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,630
There are five card keys left.

2804
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:12,670
All the birthday people are here.

2805
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,670
The birthday people
might get the penalty.

2806
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:15,840
Ninety-four.

2807
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:19,440
If Jong Kook and I leave,
it will be fun.

2808
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,710
- It's 94.
- Only the birthday people stay.

2809
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:22,070
Will it be 94?

2810
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,540
You will come back here.

2811
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,850
- Come here.
- Come here.

2812
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,110
He will come.

2813
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:28,480
(Failed)

2814
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,550
Darn it.

2815
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:30,580
Okay.

2816
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,650
He comes back.

2817
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,590
- We have 2 spots left.
- We still have 5 cards left.

2818
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,920
- And two spots.
- If Haha and Ji Hyo leave,

2819
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,060
the three of us will stay.

2820
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,660
- I'm 47.
- Okay.

2821
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:38,720
(If Haha and Ji Hyo leave,
the three will get the penalty.)

2822
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,630
- Okay. Move over.
- My gosh.

2823
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:42,860
The three birthday people will stay.

2824
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:43,930
We have two spots left.

2825
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,530
- Two spots left.
- I don't know.

2826
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:47,630
(They have 4 minutes left,
and only 2 of them can go home.)

2827
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:51,200
(If she fails this time,
she won't stand a chance.)

2828
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,840
Let's go.

2829
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,840
(Open)

2830
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,680
Bye. Thank you for today.

2831
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,680
(With her golden hands,
Ji Hyo manages to go home.)

2832
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:00,980
- What did she pick?
- We have one spot left.

2833
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,080
You have one spot left.

2834
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,080
- What did she pick?
- I'll just pick...

2835
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,850
- Ji Hyo. We...
- Ji Hyo.

2836
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,050
- The Empty Heads.
- The Empty Heads.

2837
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:07,320
- The Empty Heads.
- It's us, the Empty Heads.

2838
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,290
And the young members
of Running Man.

2839
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,420
We all succeeded.

2840
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:11,420
(They may not be smart,
but they are nice and lucky.)

2841
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:13,630
You have one spot left now.

2842
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,690
I don't know.
I'll just pick anything.

2843
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:16,560
- I'm next.
- I'm sorry.

2844
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,000
(I'm sorry.)

2845
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:19,970
- One spot left.
- If he leaves, it's over.

2846
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,070
We have one spot left.

2847
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,670
- What number is it?
- It's 50.

2848
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,100
(He calmed down Seok Sam, who got
carried away, and picked a card.)

2849
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,810
Please.

2850
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,140
(Will Jae Seok be the last one
to get out of here?)

2851
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,310
Please.

2852
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:30,110
Please.

2853
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,040
He will come back.
This doesn't make sense.

2854
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:33,880
(Failed)

2855
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,180
- Yes!
- Yes!

2856
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,280
- Yes!
- This is driving me nuts.

2857
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,950
(Now he can't leave
unless the other 3 fail.)

2858
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:41,320
This is driving me crazy.

2859
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,720
All right. Four for death.
It has two fours.

2860
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,160
- It's 44.
- I was going to pick that.

2861
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,790
- Number 51...
- Let me go. It's time.

2862
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:48,030
- These three look good.
- I'll pick 51.

2863
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:49,460
I'm leaving. Bye.

2864
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:50,600
- Please. Let him fail.
- Please.

2865
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,070
- Please. Let him fail.
- Please.

2866
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,340
(Old Boy is leaving.)

2867
01:33:58,340 --> 01:33:59,910
Bye!

2868
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:01,110
(Seok Sam successfully escaped
with 3 minutes left until 4pm.)

2869
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:02,170
- Yes!
- Darn it.

2870
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:04,610
(Seok Sam successfully escaped
with 3 minutes left until 4pm.)

2871
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:07,080
- I'll get going.
- Now, the remaining three...

2872
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,150
will get the penalty.

2873
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:10,780
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Haha
will get the penalty today.)

2874
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:11,880
What's wrong with this year?

2875
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,350
How could I keep failing like that?

2876
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,320
What's the penalty?

2877
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,790
- Just go.
- I want to see what the penalty is.

2878
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:17,890
Just leave.

2879
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:18,890
What's the penalty?

2880
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:20,390
- Don't tell them.
- What's the penalty?

2881
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:21,960
- Just go. Don't tell them.
- I want to see what it is.

2882
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,030
Just go.

2883
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:24,360
Seok Sam should be here.

2884
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,730
He's not getting the penalty.

2885
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:27,870
All right.

2886
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:30,470
The Time Attack
Win, Lose Fighter Race is over.

2887
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:32,810
The five members,
who successfully opened the door...

2888
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:34,810
before 4 p.m., may go home now.

2889
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:36,280
Bye.

2890
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,680
For the three members
to get the penalty...

2891
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,750
The penalty is
something popular these days.

2892
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,350
They say if you stir
ice cream 100 times,

2893
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:45,950
it becomes gelato.

2894
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,220
- Right.
- Did you say 100 times?

2895
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,360
Good luck with that.

2896
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,090
- Bye.
- Enjoy your gelato.

2897
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,430
- All right.
- Okay. Let's stir it.

2898
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:53,490
Gelato.

2899
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:57,130
- Let's go.
- Bye.

2900
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,270
You should stir it 100 times
and make gelato.

2901
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:01,530
Then you will put a candle on it...

2902
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:04,040
and celebrate the birthday again,
which you like.

2903
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,100
(Make gelato and celebrate
the birthday one more time.)

2904
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,640
- Then you can go home.
- Okay.

2905
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,140
That's not so bad.

2906
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:11,110
My gosh. How am I so unlucky?

2907
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,880
Gosh, seriously...

2908
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,080
This ice cream...

2909
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:16,580
tastes really good with puffed rice.

2910
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,120
Puffed rice, my foot.

2911
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:19,650
What?

2912
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:20,750
(What?)

2913
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:24,860
It's too hard. It's not working.

2914
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:27,160
It's working.
I'm stirring the top part.

2915
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,290
Really?

2916
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,830
I will break it first.
From the edge.

2917
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:32,930
I'm breaking it.

2918
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:35,400
So, I should melt it a little.

2919
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:36,840
Look. This is gelato.

2920
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,140
No.

2921
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:39,770
- Hey.
- What are you talking about?

2922
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:40,940
- That's not gelato.
- Jong Kook.

2923
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:42,780
Help me.

2924
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:45,240
- Let's keep up the pace.
- Well...

2925
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,810
It's becoming bibimbap.

2926
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:48,780
I'm almost done.

2927
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:51,020
- It's not done at all.
- It's not done at all.

2928
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:53,420
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Don't be absurd.

2929
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,850
That's not gelato.

2930
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:55,960
(The father of three is
getting bullied for no reason.)

2931
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:57,690
It becomes gelato?

2932
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,560
We can just eat it as is.

2933
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,530
Why do we have to
turn it into gelato?

2934
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:03,760
I really wanted to eat
this ice cream when I was little.

2935
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:04,860
All right. It's done, right?

2936
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,130
Come on.

2937
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,530
What's wrong with him?

2938
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:08,830
- Look.
- That doesn't count.

2939
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,800
- It's gelato, right?
- No way. That's not it.

2940
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,240
- This is crazy, right?
- You should stir it more.

2941
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:13,240
Stir it more.

2942
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,940
That's not gelato.
What are you talking about?

2943
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:17,610
I just can't do this with them.

2944
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:19,310
- No.
- He's there...

2945
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:20,580
to make them light a candle.

2946
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:23,320
- Gosh, he keeps nagging.
- No. That's not it.

2947
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,480
I hate him.

2948
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,650
Why do we have to do this?

2949
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,120
You don't know
what gelato is, do you?

2950
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,220
I'm done.

2951
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:30,560
It's done.

2952
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,130
(The galto is almost done.)

2953
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:35,260
- Jong Kook, that's it.
- Me?

2954
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:37,060
I know. This is good, right?

2955
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,260
Just go.

2956
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,630
- This is good enough.
- Definitely.

2957
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:40,630
Gelato.

2958
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:41,930
He works hard.

2959
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:43,500
- He finds it interesting.
- Right.

2960
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:47,040
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to myself

2961
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:49,340
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

2962
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,680
(They are done celebrating
the birthday with handmade gelato.)

2963
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:54,380
(The Saja Boys are having a fan meet
in the heart of the city?)

2964
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:55,750
- I'm Jee Saja.
- He's the leader of the Saja Boys.

2965
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,820
(Something's very wrong
with the Saja Boys.)

2966
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,490
(What made them look like this...)

2967
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:03,320
(is the random 10 questions.)

2968
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,220
(A character in a movie?)

2969
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:07,430
(Brad Pitt has aged really well.)

2970
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:10,060
(Their favorite food?)

2971
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:11,260
(I like baked potatoes.)

2972
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,470
(The answers they wrote down
without much thought decide their fate.)

2973
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:16,470
(I wrote Busan.)

2974
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:18,170
(Se Chan said he'd go to Tongyeong.)

2975
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,670
(Why did you write such a thing?)

2976
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:21,210
(They are in a hurry.)

2977
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:23,510
(It takes five and a half hours
to get there?)

2978
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:26,010
(They suddenly board a train?)

2979
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,080
(Yu Bin!)

2980
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:30,550
(What kind of day will those
who can't control their mouths have?)

2981
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,020
(Go Straight as You Answer)
