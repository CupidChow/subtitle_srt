1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,870
(Testing the microphone)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,210
The members of
the Running Selling Association...

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,980
shall gather at the cafe immediately.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,310
Hey.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,680
- Hey.
- I'll have a hot latte.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,550
I'll have one iced Americano.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Hello.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,820
- Hello.
- Hello.

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,620
- Oh, dear.
- Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,820
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay!

11
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,760
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,260
By the way, this is supposed to be
the Running Selling Association.

13
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,530
- Hey.
- Come here.

14
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,100
- Listen.
- Some of us are too dressed up.

15
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,370
- You're too dressed up.
- If you don't do things right...

16
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,100
This is
the Running Selling Association.

17
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,340
- Getting dolled up is fine,
- This is like "Boomer Dae Hee."

18
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,570
- What?
- but the swatter is too much.

19
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,510
- This swatter...
- He's bad at doing skits.

20
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,140
- It's not like that.
- You're a market vendor.

21
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,510
- Hey, you.
- Yes?

22
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,320
You aren't supposed
to look pretty today.

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,480
Hello.

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,020
- No, she is...
- Isn't it upsetting?

25
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,020
- She's lost a lot of weight.
- She looks different.

26
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,020
- This is Dongdaemun.
- She's lost a lot of weight.

27
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,020
I'm running my business
in Dongdaemun.

28
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,360
These two didn't know about it,
but their outfits are matching.

29
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,630
- We're like a couple.
- Stand next to her.

30
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,830
- If it's Dongdaemun...
- You're right. The thing is...

31
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,100
(The part-timers on the 3rd floor
of the M shopping mall)

32
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,900
- Hey.
- Ji Hyo, come here.

33
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,500
- Okay. I should be with Haha.
- You and I are vintage.

34
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
- Vintage.
- Right.

35
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,270
It looks like you are running
a vintage shop.

36
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,640
- We run a vintage shop.
- That's our taste.

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,010
- You look like an HVAC technician.
- Right.

38
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,110
When you sell something,
I deliver it.

39
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,850
- Loading a truck.
- Delivery.

40
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,320
- Right.
- Delivering gas containers.

41
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,350
I deliver gas containers.

42
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,220
By the way, I'm not sure about me.
What do I do?

43
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,120
- You are...
- What's my business?

44
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,760
You look great
in your outfit anyway.

45
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,830
- Or...
- It's like you're wearing yours.

46
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,290
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It looks like Seok Jin's clothes.

47
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,630
- Seok Jin's everyday clothes.
- And...

48
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,900
- Don't be absurd.
- I saw...

49
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,200
Seok Jin wearing this outfit,
and I thought Seok Jin finally...

50
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,330
- He's 60?
- found clothes that fit his age.

51
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,640
- He finally looks like 60.
- Seok Jin...

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,740
- Don't be ridiculous.
- finally...

53
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,210
- That's right.
- He looks so natural.

54
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,010
You tried to look cool a little.

55
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,010
- You know what?
- You should immerse yourself.

56
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,680
My stylist was supposed...

57
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,250
to bring something like this, but...

58
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,280
- But she brought a jersey.
- Yes, she brought a jersey.

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,120
- That's not acceptable.
- Actually, I'm wearing a jersey.

60
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,650
- I see.
- So I put this on.

61
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,460
- Why did you get all dolled up?
- You're...

62
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,490
I'm not dolled up.

63
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,820
Your sunglasses are Balenciaga.

64
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,290
No, these are Oakley.

65
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,760
- They're Balenciaga.
- He's wearing the same brand.

66
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,460
- Hey.
- What are you talking about?

67
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,460
- I...
- Take them off.

68
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,500
I've never been told I looked cool
when I'm dressed like this.

69
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,730
You do look cool.

70
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,100
- You look really cool.
- The color.

71
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,940
- You're wearing tinted glasses.
- What?

72
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,440
- And your hair.
- He got dolled up.

73
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,510
- I know, right?
- Yes.

74
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,540
- Your hair.
- Vintage.

75
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,410
- We're vintage.
- Your coat is trendy.

76
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,040
The first floor
of Jeil Pyeonghwa Market.

77
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,280
Be honest. You're all dressed up.

78
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,520
- No.
- Se Chan, you and I tried hard.

79
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,350
- This is it.
- This is what you should do.

80
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,550
- It's the Selling Association.
- This is what you should do.

81
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,750
- I'm wearing orange shoes.
- Look at his shoes.

82
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,820
- Jae Seok.
- This is the least you should do.

83
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,120
- You look like a group of vendors.
- I mean...

84
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,560
- By the way...
- When I saw Se Chan...

85
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,730
outside earlier,
I thought he was a passer-by.

86
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,130
- I didn't recognize him.
- He didn't recognize me.

87
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,830
- I'm serious.
- My gosh.

88
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,470
Ye Eun, are you Lexy?

89
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,100
- What's this?
- I'm the old-style...

90
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,140
It looks great on you.

91
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,440
- She's Bbangkku Ttongkku.
- No.

92
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,240
- She looks like an ostrich egg.
- It's uljjang.

93
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,340
- Bring Two Chins back, Ye Eun.
- Bring it back.

94
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,740
- You've lost a lot of weight.
- Right.

95
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,410
- I'm worried about you.
- I see.

96
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,650
She woke up several times
feeling hungry last night.

97
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,550
I woke up at 4 a.m.

98
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,950
You should work out.

99
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,450
(On standby right before the shoot)

100
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,490
Should I wear this hat or not?

101
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,730
- Oh, right.
- I think...

102
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,560
- By the way, Ye Eun looks troubled.
- Are you cutting it?

103
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,230
- What?
- You look tired.

104
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,270
I couldn't sleep.

105
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,830
I couldn't fall asleep
because I was hungry.

106
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,540
- I'm worried.
- She lost so much weight.

107
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,740
- You should eat and exercise.
- She's lost a lot of weight.

108
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,910
I look like a celebrity, right?

109
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,640
- No.
- You look haggard.

110
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,910
Why are you doing this?
Where did your cheeks go?

111
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,310
- Where did you leave your cheeks?
- Where did they go?

112
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,750
- Bring them back.
- Ye Eun was pretty.

113
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,450
- It's so upsetting.
- Make your face big again.

114
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,720
- Where did your cheeks go?
- Where did they go?

115
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
- That's what makes you cute.
- I know.

116
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,020
- Two Chins makes you look cute.
- You fool.

117
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,890
- Ye Eun.
- You're Food Fighter!

118
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,390
Hang on. You should try doing this
to make two chins.

119
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,390
Try it.

120
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,560
- You can't do it.
- You can't do it.

121
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
(She can't make two chins.)

122
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,770
(Ji Ye Eun's two chins
have disappeared.)

123
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,470
- It's gone.
- She should do it.

124
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,500
- Hey.
- How is this possible?

125
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,270
This is like Samson
cutting his hair.

126
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,470
- The two chins...
- That's your charm.

127
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,680
- Food Fighter has two chins.
- That's true.

128
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,910
It was funny
when Jae Seok fed her last week.

129
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,050
- Right.
- She ate like a cow.

130
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,720
- My gosh.
- This is terrible.

131
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,020
- Too bad.
- She's losing her character.

132
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,350
This doesn't feel right.

133
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,020
- The thing is...
- It was her precious character.

134
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,720
I've been doing many TV shows
for a long time,

135
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,960
and I've seen
something like this before.

136
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,660
- It happened before.
- She's losing her character.

137
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,500
- This is how she's losing it.
- There were precedents.

138
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,400
Jo Young Gu was one,
and so was Jung Jun Ha.

139
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,770
And you're next!

140
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,530
Jo Young Gu was one,
and so was Jung Jun Ha.

141
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,040
(The 3 wax drippings
in the show business)

142
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,800
- What? Why would you say that?
- The wax drippings?

143
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,940
That's too harsh.

144
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,510
You're so mean!

145
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,510
I went through a lot to lose weight!

146
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,950
- She's so skinny now.
- Look at you.

147
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,220
- You can't speak loudly, right?
- She's too tired.

148
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,520
- She has no energy.
- She's tired.

149
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,850
- She's too tired to speak loudly.
- She used to be...

150
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,050
- so loud.
- You used to be so loud.

151
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,420
- You sound so feeble.
- My gosh.

152
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,090
- I'm getting a headache.
- She can't tighten her stomach.

153
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,590
- I'm getting a headache.
- By the way...

154
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,030
Do you like it?

155
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,360
I do!

156
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,600
- You like it?
- I do like it!

157
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,630
- You do?
- I really like it.

158
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,030
It looks like a drama.

159
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,070
But...

160
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,770
(Daniel was being quiet,
but he got yelled at after saying a word.)

161
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,570
- This is it.
- This isn't just right.

162
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,040
- How could you lose so much weight?
- What?

163
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,070
(A tip-off from Reporter Song)

164
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,510
- Hey, Ye Eun.
- It's the same.

165
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,680
Ye Eun, are you looking
to buy a car?

166
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,710
- What?
- Why?

167
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,110
- Will she drive?
- Seriously?

168
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,250
I got a muscle cramp that day.

169
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,510
- Seriously, that day...
- You got a muscle cramp?

170
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,980
- You got it that day, right?
- Because you were nervous.

171
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,250
- I knew it.
- And you're looking for a car?

172
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,850
I started
looking for a car that day.

173
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,990
(Right away)

174
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,590
- That's what happens.
- Right.

175
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,720
It's fun.

176
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
- I watch a lot of cars on YouTube.
- You should get a used car.

177
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,430
- Right.
- Get a used car.

178
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,160
You will get
a lot of scratches at first.

179
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,060
- Okay.
- You're right.

180
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,900
- That's so funny.
- All right.

181
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,000
Today, you are members
of the Running Selling Association.

182
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,740
This is the basic principle
of business.

183
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,840
Today, we will have
the Merchant Chronicles,

184
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,370
You Must Make Money
to Survive race...

185
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,340
- where you should buy well...
- We should make money.

186
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,410
- and sell well to make a fortune.
- I see.

187
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,110
- We're selling things.
- Are we going to walk a lot?

188
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,180
The production crew of Running Man
asked the Selling Association...

189
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,950
to purchase items
that they needed for their work.

190
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,690
Is that so?
They asked us to buy them?

191
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,360
You will be divided into two teams,
find the items they need,

192
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,990
buy them, and then sell them
through an auction.

193
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,290
- I see.
- We're divided into two teams.

194
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,860
- There will be an auction.
- Auction.

195
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,960
The higher your profit,

196
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,430
the higher your chances
of winning the prize...

197
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,000
and the lower your chances...

198
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,330
- of getting the penalty.
- I see.

199
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,970
The captains of each team are
Yu Jae Seok and Kim Jong Kook.

200
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,210
You may discuss it
and divide the members...

201
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,870
- into two teams as you please.
- Okay!

202
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,680
- As we please?
- As we please?

203
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
First of all...

204
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,580
It feels like...

205
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,650
these two and these two
should be on the same teams.

206
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,780
- Right?
- Yes.

207
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,980
- And these two...
- They're a couple.

208
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,690
- The blowfly here...
- You two...

209
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,020
Blowfly?

210
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,590
Did you call me Blowfly?

211
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,090
- Blowfly?
- Who looks like a blowfly?

212
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,330
- Catch him with the swatter.
- Use the swatter.

213
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,630
- Blowfly.
- You two should be split.

214
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,560
- I should go.
- You blowfly.

215
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,060
- All right then.
- Okay.

216
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,370
- We'll play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's do that.

217
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,600
- I should pick them as a team.
- Yes.

218
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,770
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

219
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,900
I win.

220
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,340
These two couples will
play rock-paper-scissors now.

221
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,840
- A winning team and a losing team.
- Let's do that.

222
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,910
- Okay.
- A winning team and a losing team.

223
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,880
- You two are on the same team.
- Right.

224
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,150
You two should play
rock-paper-scissors.

225
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,680
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

226
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,480
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

227
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,750
- So they're on my team.
- You guys are one team.

228
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,490
Blowfly and Se Pal will play
rock-paper-scissors now.

229
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,790
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

230
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,950
- Okay.
- The winning team.

231
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,590
The winning team.

232
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,560
Where?

233
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,160
Who's the winning team?

234
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,330
- It's them.
- Who?

235
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,400
- Jong Kook...
- We're the winning team.

236
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,230
They are the members
Jong Kook likes.

237
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,170
- My favorite...
- This is perfect.

238
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,240
- They're easy to deal with.
- We're his favorite.

239
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,700
- We're easy to deal with.
- You guys...

240
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,410
Obviously, I'm the captain here.

241
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,410
It's obvious. I'm the captain.

242
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,040
- And they're your favorite.
- Right.

243
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,180
My favorite members.

244
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,710
- I like them.
- It's strange it happened this way.

245
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,310
- This is perfect.
- We will start the mission...

246
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,650
where you can make the seed money.

247
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,520
- Okay.
- Please set things up.

248
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,220
- Let's do it well.
- Is it a game?

249
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,720
- I think so.
- Are we going to jump?

250
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,260
This is what we were wearing
for foot volleyball.

251
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,560
(They put on the team vests first.)

252
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,460
He's really funny.

253
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,460
Let me tell you about the mission
for the seed money.

254
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,870
The mission for the seed money...

255
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,930
is Quiz on My Belly.

256
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,000
- What?
- What's that?

257
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,440
You will have a picture of a person
attached to your belly upside down.

258
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,940
You will answer the questions
attached to your belly...

259
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,010
by raising your upper body
while lying face down.

260
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,550
- That's too hard.
- We can't do that.

261
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,480
- And you will...
- I can't raise my upper body.

262
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,750
look at the questions
in the mirror in front of you.

263
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,450
- My gosh. I can't do this.
- We're in trouble.

264
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,660
For your information, you can't
raise your body using your arms.

265
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,960
Without using your arms,

266
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,690
- you can use rebounding to go up.
- Really?

267
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,890
- Can we use rebounding?
- Yes.

268
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,990
We can rebound.

269
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,560
Each member of the team
will take turns to try it.

270
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,600
The team that answers
the most questions...

271
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,430
- within one minute wins.
- Okay.

272
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,670
The winning team will receive
300 dollars for the seed money,

273
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,740
and the losing team
will receive 200 dollars.

274
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,810
That's a big difference.

275
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,540
Ye Eun, you can't play a game
like this because you lost weight.

276
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,610
I can do this.

277
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,850
- Can you?
- I can make it.

278
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,310
- You'll see.
- Come on.

279
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,750
We have two sets of questions,
Set A and Set B.

280
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,850
Please decide which set
your team will choose and tell me.

281
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,650
- And we will attach them.
- There are different kinds?

282
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,890
(Daniel takes it off again.)

283
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,360
- My gosh.
- Hey.

284
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,560
This is too hard.

285
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,460
- You're still putting on it?
- Hang on.

286
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,730
What's taking so long?

287
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,430
- My gosh.
- He's a handful.

288
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,500
- Seriously...
- Come on.

289
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,200
Put your right hand in here.
This is the left.

290
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,700
No. Just one. Good.

291
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,270
I've never seen Seok Jin
take care of others.

292
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,440
Why is he...

293
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,670
Hang on a second.

294
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,070
- What's wrong with him?
- It's done.

295
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,280
- It's done.
- Oh, dear.

296
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,440
- It's finally done.
- I'm good.

297
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,180
Which team will go first?

298
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,610
- Let's go first.
- Okay.

299
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,050
- Go ahead.
- All right then.

300
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,420
- Choose the question.
- We have to win no matter what.

301
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,150
Set A or Set B?

302
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,090
- Let's choose Set A.
- Take Set A.

303
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,590
- A is always good.
- Okay. Let's go with Set A.

304
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,520
- We will attach the pictures then.
- What?

305
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,690
- I think they're attaching them.
- There must be something.

306
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,930
It's a picture.

307
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,360
(It's covered now, and it will be
revealed when it's their turn.)

308
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,570
- We...
- What's that? Is it the question?

309
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,930
- Daniel?
- Okay.

310
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,640
- I'll go first.
- Go ahead.

311
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,440
- But...
- I can do this.

312
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
I don't think he can do it.

313
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,610
He's innately strong.

314
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,040
- But he's clumsy.
- He can't do it.

315
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,510
And he's tall.

316
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,080
- He likes to expose his body.
- Hey.

317
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,450
Why are you showing your skin?

318
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,350
I can see your belly button hair.

319
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,380
He should get his hair singed off.

320
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,990
- I see your belly button hair.
- Hey, your belly.

321
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,760
Why are you showing your skin?

322
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,220
(He pulled out the hair.)

323
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,630
- What's with him?
- He's not ashamed at all.

324
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,630
I should bend...

325
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,100
- That's right. Good.
- I should be flexible.

326
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,800
- Seriously, Daniel is...
- He doesn't care at all.

327
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,300
- He's a little like Ro Hong Chul.
- No.

328
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,570
He resembles a lot of people.

329
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,970
He's also like Kwang Soo.

330
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,810
- And Hong Chul.
- He resembles everyone.

331
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,840
There are about five people.

332
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,880
- Should I take this off?
- I'll do it for you.

333
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
- Close your eyes.
- He's strange.

334
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,310
- He is.
- This is really hard.

335
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,320
So this is how it looks. I get it.

336
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,020
- I'll lie down.
- It's upside down, so it's hard.

337
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,120
Good.

338
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,190
- Ready.
- He's so tall.

339
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,860
- Okay.
- Start.

340
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,790
- Okay.
- Start.

341
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,890
(Start)

342
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,190
- He's good.
- He can't see it.

343
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,800
- You're good.
- The mirror is only this big?

344
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,300
- But the mirror is...
- You have to see it.

345
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,400
- It's working.
- Hang on.

346
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,500
One, two.

347
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,670
The arms. Come on.

348
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,670
It's working.

349
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,700
One, two.

350
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,040
(It's shown!)

351
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,470
- My gosh.
- It's great.

352
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
He's good.

353
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,710
(The higher he raises his belly,)

354
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,280
(the better he can see the face.)

355
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,680
- He's good.
- He's good.

356
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,580
- He's really good.
- His belly is strong.

357
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,280
- You're sexy.
- He's really good.

358
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,890
- Higher.
- What?

359
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,420
- Don't go higher than that.
- Who's that?

360
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,520
- Who is it?
- Go.

361
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
- Higher.
- What?

362
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,260
(Can he guess who it is?)

363
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,760
- Good.
- He should kick like that.

364
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,630
- He's good.
- Let me answer.

365
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,360
- He's good.
- Let me answer.

366
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,630
Son Suk Ku?

367
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,640
(Correct)

368
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,600
- What? Let me see.
- He's good.

369
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,070
(Answer: Son Suk Ku)

370
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,740
So it's upside down.

371
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,010
You're the best.
You have strong core muscles.

372
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,240
- I'm strong, right?
- You're good.

373
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,780
- You're sexy.
- Those who are not flexible...

374
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,850
- Right.
- This will make you popular.

375
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,750
- Seriously, you're so sexy.
- Haha.

376
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,420
I may be a little hunched,

377
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,850
- but I have strong core muscles.
- That's true.

378
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,020
Ye Eun.

379
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,120
(The second player is
Dieter Ji Ye Eun.)

380
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,430
Ready. Start.

381
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,690
- What?
- What was that?

382
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,960
Start.

383
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,400
(She barely lifts her chin
while groaning.)

384
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
What was that? Are you doing it?

385
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,240
- What are you doing?
- What is she doing?

386
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,270
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

387
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,740
- What's with her?
- What is she doing?

388
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,110
- Ye Eun is...
- What is she doing?

389
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,670
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

390
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,640
- Hey.
- She has no energy.

391
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,710
Ye Eun.

392
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,150
- What are you doing?
- Raise your upper body.

393
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,910
- The upper body.
- She's too weak.

394
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,550
- She has no strength.
- What are you doing?

395
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,880
- Raise your upper body.
- She can't do this.

396
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,820
- She has no energy.
- Use rebounding.

397
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,090
- Push.
- What?

398
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,490
Why are you...

399
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,120
She has no energy.

400
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,030
- Because she lost weight.
- You have to do this.

401
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,630
- Ye Eun, go back and forth.
- Right.

402
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,500
- Go back and forth.
- Do you have any snacks?

403
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,030
- That's right.
- Use a snack.

404
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,170
- Hey.
- Give me some food.

405
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,300
- What is going on?
- Do you have any snacks?

406
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,400
- I have no energy.
- She will go up if we have a snack.

407
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,170
Ye Eun, we have
something really good.

408
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,010
- I'll use this.
- It looks delicious.

409
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,310
What's that? Cheese?

410
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,510
Chocolate?

411
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,740
- Here. Let's see if it works.
- Gosh, it's not like...

412
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,510
(An extreme strategy
of luring her with food)

413
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,880
- Gosh, it's not like she's a dog.
- Show it to her.

414
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,050
What's that?

415
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,050
- What do I do?
- Ye Eun.

416
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,890
- You're not flexible at all.
- One, two.

417
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,620
Daniel is flexible...

418
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,560
- Gosh, Ye Eun.
- See?

419
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,830
- Okay.
- She's like Samson without hair.

420
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,860
Ye Eun.

421
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,560
It was funny enough, Ye Eun.

422
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,360
- Who is that?
- I have a headache.

423
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,870
- It's Jin.
- Who is it?

424
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,570
- Jin of BTS.
- Is it Jin?

425
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,170
I'm sorry.

426
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,200
- Let me see.
- Don't give me an idol.

427
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,340
Let me see.

428
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,640
- But I...
- Jin.

429
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,110
- You should've recognized his lips.
- Let me see.

430
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,510
- It's hard when it's upside down.
- I have a headache.

431
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,110
I should just take a guess
and say random names.

432
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,920
- All right.
- Jae Seok is good at this.

433
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,180
- Daniel is...
- You have to do this.

434
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,320
- I'll start.
- Let's begin. Start.

435
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,620
- Start.
- Start.

436
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,090
(Jae Seok with the top-tier
core muscles on Running Man!)

437
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,960
(Will he make it again this time?)

438
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,430
- Start.
- Daniel was good.

439
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,790
- Try it.
- Go.

440
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,200
You're Locust.

441
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,860
Come on.

442
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,300
(He can't do it!)

443
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,330
- He's a locust!
- Seriously...

444
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,100
(He's flapping on the floor.)

445
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,840
- You're a locust.
- I can't do this.

446
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,410
It's not working.

447
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,910
- I can't do this.
- Like a long-headed grasshopper.

448
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,080
Can't you do that?

449
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,410
You look like a tuna...

450
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,580
- heading out to the sea.
- He is a locust.

451
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,680
He can't do it.

452
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,750
He looks like an anchovy.

453
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,350
- Oh, dear.
- I can't.

454
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,420
- No!
- Use rebounding.

455
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,250
- One more time.
- No.

456
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
No.

457
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,360
- I saw it briefly.
- Good.

458
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,490
- I saw it for a short while.
- Good.

459
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,060
- It's a big fish.
- I saw it briefly.

460
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,530
- Do it one more time.
- Just say any name.

461
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,830
Do the same thing one more time.

462
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,770
One, two, three.

463
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,770
(Shouting)

464
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,740
(He kissed the mat.)

465
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,370
- He used his arms.
- That's cheating.

466
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,070
- Oh, no.
- Is it Yu Jin?

467
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,380
- Hang on.
- I saw it, but I don't know.

468
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,840
- I don't know.
- I saw it, but I don't know.

469
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,310
- Just give it a try.
- Woo Young Woo.

470
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,550
(The suspect is identified!)

471
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,120
- Woo Young Woo.
- Woo Young Woo.

472
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,920
- Wait. I don't remember her name.
- I'll give you five seconds.

473
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,050
- Woo Young Woo.
- Woo Young Woo.

474
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,190
Her face is...

475
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,020
- Four.
- Bin... Ye Bin... Hang on.

476
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Three.

477
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,260
- Park Eun Bin.
- They give him a hint.

478
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,530
- No.
- Come on.

479
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,130
- I came up with it.
- That's cheating.

480
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,200
- Ye Eun...
- What was that?

481
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,870
- I came up with it myself.
- No, Ji Ye Eun.

482
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,300
She said Ji Ye Eun Bin.

483
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,900
I thought it was Park Bo Young.

484
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,870
- Is it Park Eun Bin?
- Ji Ye Eun Bin.

485
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,510
(The hint was given
in surround sound.)

486
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,570
Will you do that?

487
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,940
Both teams gave him a hint,

488
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,810
- so I'll hold the judgment.
- I'll go next.

489
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,850
- I thought it was Nam Sang Mi.
- I really have a headache.

490
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,350
(Who's the person
Seok Jin must guess?)

491
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,220
- This will be tough for him.
- Is it a foreigner?

492
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,720
- Seok Jin can't get this.
- No way.

493
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,220
- Is it a foreigner?
- How can he get this right?

494
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,090
I doubt Seok Jin knows who she is.

495
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,390
- Get ready.
- You can get this one.

496
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,620
I doubt Seok Jin will know.

497
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,790
Oh, no. He's already
having a tough time.

498
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,100
(Groaning!)

499
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,130
You can do this.

500
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,200
- You're doing great.
- Seok Jin.

501
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
(Groaning!)

502
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,630
- Looking good!
- Show us how strong dads are.

503
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,770
Show us how strong
middle-aged men are.

504
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,400
(Another one of
the dad's tear-jerking challenges)

505
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,670
(Just then)

506
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,240
(He flat-out used his arms.)

507
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,780
- Come on!
- Are you kidding me?

508
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,010
That's just wrong.

509
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,980
- He can't help it.
- Come on.

510
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,410
- Stop that.
- He can't help it.

511
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,050
- Seok Jin, you can't help it.
- Just do push-ups, then.

512
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,620
(Blatantly looking in the mirror)

513
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,950
What was that?

514
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,750
- What are you doing?
- He doesn't know who it is.

515
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,190
- He was obviously cheating.
- Exactly.

516
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,520
- That was too much.
- I agree.

517
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,690
Seok Jin, just look in the mirror.

518
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,930
He won't know who it is.

519
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,600
- I know who that is.
- I do too.

520
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,130
(Answer: Ariana Grande)

521
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,160
Is it Hwasa?

522
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,230
- It's not Hwasa.
- That's not her.

523
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,230
- Come on.
- Is it a "she?"

524
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,970
The pop vocalist.

525
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,270
- It's Yang Jung A.
- Isn't it Rose?

526
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,610
- It's Christina Aguilera.
- It's Jeon So Mi.

527
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,880
- It's Christina Aguilera.
- It's Ariana Grande.

528
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,910
- It's Christina Aguilera.
- No, it's Ariana Grande.

529
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,180
- Let us see.
- Show us.

530
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,650
- Is it a foreigner?
- It's Christina Aguilera.

531
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,220
- It's Ariana Grande.
- Ariana Grande!

532
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,580
- I don't know who that is.
- How could he know that?

533
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,820
- You could've just let him see.
- Is it Ariana Grande?

534
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,190
Ariana Grande?

535
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,490
- Ariana Grande.
- I once called her Griana Arande.

536
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,920
How could I know who this is?

537
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,860
- Can I start?
- Go ahead.

538
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,030
(Team Jong Kook's Haha
plays the game.)

539
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,830
- How is he this good?
- He's doing it.

540
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,500
- How is he this good?
- He's so good.

541
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,340
(Of course, it's easy for Ji Hyo.)

542
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,670
Look at her long torso.

543
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,670
No way.
(The three younger members
are all good at the game!)

544
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,310
- It's a woman.
- Looking good.

545
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,480
- It's a woman.
- Good job.

546
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,640
- Once more.
- She's pretty.

547
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,350
- Who is it?
- IU.

548
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,280
- That's not IU.
- That's not her.

549
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,780
Seohyun.

550
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,050
(Answer: An Yu Jin)

551
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,680
Shin Ha Kyun.

552
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,850
- He's now guessing.
- Who is it?

553
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,850
(Answer: Sam Smith)

554
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,890
- It's... Eminem.
- Who is it?

555
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,830
Eminem? Is that what you said?

556
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,330
Eminem?

557
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,590
- Why Eminem of all people?
- It's Sam Smith.

558
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,900
It's Sam Smith.

559
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,530
- They're good but...
- They can't guess correctly.

560
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,870
They can see who it is,
but they don't know who they are.

561
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,900
They have healthy backs,

562
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,970
but they don't know
who the celebrities are.

563
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,270
- No way.
- Come on.

564
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,840
This is one you have
to answer correctly.

565
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,570
- Is it an easy one?
- Very.

566
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,940
- Is it an easy one?
- It's very easy.

567
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,510
Let's do this.
I know you can get this.

568
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,310
- Don't act like you can't do it.
- I can't.

569
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,420
- What's with him?
- What is he doing?

570
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,450
(Can't he even do one?)

571
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,750
- What's his problem?
- Look at him.

572
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,520
- What on earth?
- Look.

573
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,190
- What's wrong with him?
- What is this?

574
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
- What is he doing?
- What's this?

575
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,960
- He can't lift up his chest.
- What are you doing?

576
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,330
- I can't do it.
- Mr. Stiff.

577
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,330
(They found another exercise
he can't do.)

578
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,960
- Lift up your chest.
- I have a chronic illness.

579
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,460
- I have a chronic illness.
- Are you kidding me?

580
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,600
- You could easily tell.
- Seriously?

581
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,340
(The unlucky muscle man
fails to guess the celebrity.)

582
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,370
I can't do it.

583
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,940
- No way.
- It was Hwang Hee Chan.

584
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,270
- Was it Hee Chan?
- How could you not know?

585
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,710
- Team Jae Seok won.
- Nice!

586
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,840
Did we win?

587
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,080
The winning team...

588
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,750
- will receive 300 dollars.
- Nice.

589
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,280
The losing team
will get 200 dollars.

590
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,920
- That's not too bad.
- Okay.

591
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,250
Those who have asked
the Running Selling Association...

592
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,050
to buy items for them...

593
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,460
are Team Producers, Team Cameramen,

594
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,660
- and Team Stylists.
- I see.

595
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,660
- Okay.
- Come on out...

596
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,600
- and get your lists.
- Sure.

597
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,600
There's a lot to eat in Dongdaemun.

598
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,830
Whole chicken stew?

599
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,400
- What's this?
- What's this?

600
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
What is it? Let me see.

601
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,140
- I didn't know such things existed.
- Right.

602
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,440
(Requests for Team Jae Seok:
Team Producers)

603
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,070
Shouldn't we go to Yongsan
to buy keyboards?

604
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,140
- This... Right, camouflage.
- Camouflage.

605
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,640
(Requests for Team Jae Seok:
Team Cameramen)

606
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,510
- These requests...
- What on earth?

607
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,980
- We're to buy odd items.
- Exactly.

608
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,220
- They want a statement piece.
- Right.

609
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,120
- A keyboard?
- I see.

610
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,990
- A calculator or a keyboard?
- It can't be too clicky.

611
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,120
- It must be softer.
- Yes, softer.

612
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,760
The producers who edit our videos
are sensitive...

613
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,060
- when it comes to keyboards.
- Exactly.

614
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,130
(What does Team Jong Kook
have to buy?)

615
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,430
(Team Producers,
Team Cameramen, Team Stylists)

616
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,630
(Team Producers:
What can instantly wake you up!)

617
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,800
What can instantly wake you up?

618
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,000
(Team Producers)

619
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,540
How about nicotine gum?

620
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,100
- You mean no-sleep gum?
- Right.

621
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,010
A stylish hat
that can block the sun.

622
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,070
(Team Cameramen)

623
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,310
They want a clothing item
with a graphic print.

624
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,810
- Who? The stylists?
- The stylists.

625
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,950
Haha, they want something
that's trendy.

626
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,250
Trendy? That's us.

627
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,720
- We have Haha on our team.
- Exactly.

628
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,490
It needs to be clever, right?

629
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,120
- Clever, fun,
- What about the other one?

630
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,660
- and affordable.
- Let me see.

631
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,060
Okay, let's go.

632
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,890
- Let's go.
- Don't forget your money.

633
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,990
It all boils down
to who has good taste.

634
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,330
- That'll be us.
- Let's go.

635
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,560
What do we need to buy?

636
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Where do we need to go?

637
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,900
- Hold on.
- Where are we going?

638
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,170
- What do we have to do?
- Where do we go?

639
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,340
Didn't the stylists
give us an order too?

640
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,340
Buy something that can be
a statement piece for an outfit.

641
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,080
We need to go somewhere...

642
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,380
that has clothes
and statement pieces.

643
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,210
- Then...
- A place with clothes.

644
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,080
How about a wig
or what you put in hair?

645
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,720
- I like the idea of wigs.
- Because...

646
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
- they want a statement piece.
- I like the idea.

647
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,680
- Right.
- Right?

648
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,220
Check this out.
Wait. Are we in Wangsimni?

649
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,890
Yes, Wangsimni.

650
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,560
Then what's nearby?

651
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,030
Folk Flea Market is nearby.

652
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,360
- Folk Flea Market?
- Is it close from here?

653
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,100
There are shops...

654
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,800
that carry hairpieces
or other things you put in hair.

655
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,200
- Can you take us there?
- Folk Flea Market.

656
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
- Can you take us there?
- Right.

657
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,100
That's the perfect place.

658
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,370
What could be a good idea
for matching tops?

659
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,210
Team Cameramen
wanted matching tops...

660
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,780
that embodied spring.

661
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,180
- But...
- Should they be pink?

662
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,710
I remember...

663
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,050
- there being a catch. Camouflage.
- Exactly.

664
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,650
- The colors must blend in.
- Right?

665
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,550
Among flowers.
Think of what flowers they mean...

666
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,620
and decide on that color.

667
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,660
- But... Hold on. Could it be this?
- Azalea or...

668
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
Couldn't it be this?

669
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,860
(Something came to Mr. Choi.)

670
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,630
- A camouflage...
- Among spring flowers.

671
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,330
It's better to be transparent.

672
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,870
- Achromatic colors?
- No.

673
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,430
- The emperor...
- Yes?

674
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,570
You know the story,
"The Emperor's New Clothes."

675
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,410
We won't buy anything...

676
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,240
and fool them
with invincible clothes.

677
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,940
- What?
- Come on.

678
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,580
We'll fool them
with invisible clothes.

679
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,480
Come on.

680
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,350
- That's not how this goes.
- It's not?

681
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,880
- Then...
- Are you saying they should strip?

682
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,180
- As a camouflage...
- They have to strip.

683
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,590
Isn't this the staff trying
to be clever?

684
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,660
- That's not it.
- Do we have to buy actual clothes?

685
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,760
They have to be able
to hide among flowers.

686
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,260
- Flower colors.
- We have to only see...

687
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,730
- the faces.
- This is a tough one.

688
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,960
Shall we hop out first?

689
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,300
- Thank you.
- Goodness.

690
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,860
- Let me.
- I smell something delicious.

691
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,700
She's at it again.

692
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,300
- Why do I smell something tasty?
- You still have an appetite.

693
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,800
She's at it again.

694
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,840
- It's the N pizza place.
- The N pizza place?

695
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,240
- This way, guys.
- Where are we going?

696
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,940
- London.
- This way?

697
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,040
- London! She watches the show.
- Really?

698
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,310
- Really?
- Are you from London?

699
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,810
Yes, I am.

700
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,520
- She watches you so much.
- Where are you from?

701
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,250
- London.
- Yes, we're from London.

702
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,820
Yes, London.

703
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,220
- Are you from London?
- Yes.

704
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,790
My gosh. Let's take a picture.

705
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,660
- Do you know me?
- Yes!

706
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,490
- Please.
- You're Big Nose.

707
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,530
- That's right. He's Big Nose.
- Right.

708
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,800
(A sudden fan meet-and-greet
on the street)

709
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,400
- Okay.
- Have a nice day.

710
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

711
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,070
- Thank you.
- Have a good trip.

712
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,340
- I love you.
- Thanks.

713
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,780
- Thank you.
- Bye.

714
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,880
That was so nice.

715
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,110
- Hello.
- Hi.

716
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,050
What a cheerful family.

717
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,180
- I know.
- Tell me about it.

718
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,850
- They were so cheerful.
- They made our day.

719
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,350
How could they know Big Nose
when they're from London?

720
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,790
They called him Big Nose.

721
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,120
- Big Nose.
- That was a surprise.

722
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,730
- Big Nose.
- How did they know that nickname?

723
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,130
This place looks great.

724
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,530
- Wigs!
- Wigs?

725
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,000
- Can we go in?
- I love this green one.

726
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,530
- No way. Hello.
- Hello.

727
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,330
Could we film in here?

728
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,470
Could we perhaps enter?

729
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,770
- Sure.
- Will you allow it?

730
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,840
- I see.
- They allowed us in.

731
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,940
- Is it okay?
- After you, guys.

732
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,110
(Team Stylists:
A statement piece for my celebrity)

733
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,280
(They enter to buy
their first item to auction off.)

734
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,640
- This place...
- No way.

735
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,850
Thank you
for letting us film in here.

736
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,150
- My gosh.
- This place is amazing.

737
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,320
There are a lot of hairpieces.

738
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,250
I'd like to try this on.

739
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,450
(From various hairpieces...)

740
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,950
This place is incredible.

741
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,760
Can't these
also be statement pieces?

742
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,990
Of course.

743
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,860
Are there hairpieces
that stand out in color?

744
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,460
- What about that yellow one?
- Hairpieces?

745
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,060
- Yes.
- That's within our budget.

746
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,370
- "My celebrity..."
- Right, our budget.

747
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,100
- We...
- Let's find what's affordable.

748
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,200
- How much are these?
- Are they expensive?

749
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,740
Do you have cheaper ones?
I bet these are all expensive.

750
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,340
We have hairpieces
that only cost a few dollars.

751
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,570
- A few dollars? I love that.
- A few dollars?

752
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,910
- What would that be?
- Then...

753
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,140
About eight dollars?

754
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,710
- I can make one at that price.
- Really?

755
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,780
- Really?
- With strands like these?

756
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,050
- Small hairpieces.
- How much would this be?

757
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,050
About 3 to 4 dollars.

758
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,590
- About 3 to 4 dollars?
- Try it on.

759
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,120
- We could buy 2 for 8 dollars.
- I love it.

760
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,960
- What a bargain. I love it.
- Try it on.

761
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,490
- Those are affordable.
- What a bargain.

762
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,790
That looks great!

763
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,290
- You look great.
- I love it.

764
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,930
- Buy that for yourself.
- Buy one.

765
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,260
- Let's take that.
- Keep that for yourself.

766
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,830
It feels nice.

767
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,930
- You look different.
- It changed your look.

768
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,870
(He's copying what G-DRAGON wore
13 years ago.)

769
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,470
- That's nice.
- I love it.

770
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,370
- You look like G-DRAGON.
- I think it's great.

771
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,170
- G-DRAGON.
- G-DRAGON wore something like that.

772
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,740
- I absolutely love it.
- This is three dollars.

773
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,310
We have this too. What do you think?

774
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,410
- What's this?
- No way.

775
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,450
(Groaning)

776
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,850
- It's not bad.
- Isn't this a bit weird?

777
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,720
- I mean...
- You look okay.

778
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,890
- This...
- Isn't it weird?

779
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,390
- You know what this is?
- Clip it on the back.

780
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,430
It's like the string
above old toilets...

781
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,460
you pull on to flush.

782
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,290
- Have one on each side.
- Yes, on each side.

783
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,630
One on this side,
and one on the other.

784
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,770
Why don't you try this one?

785
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,500
(He gives the toilet flusher
to Seok Sam.)

786
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,040
(Longer nose hair
to match his big nose)

787
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,440
(He stands out more than anyone.)

788
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,280
- No way.
- Daniel loves it.

789
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,880
Who knew it'd be this funny?

790
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,180
If I'm being honest,
I want to keep it.

791
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,320
- Why are you flushed?
- I want it for myself.

792
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,090
You want to have these
in your back pocket...

793
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,650
while on variety shows.

794
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,360
- I love it.
- Isn't it great?

795
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,420
I absolutely love it.

796
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,230
(Pulling)

797
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,930
- Ye Eun, would you like to try it?
- Yes.

798
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,560
- But I had that in my nose.
- It's fine.

799
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
- I'm fine with it.
- Really?

800
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,630
This could be quite useful.

801
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,810
(They kindly share pink nose hair.)

802
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,680
- It looks good.
- Really?

803
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,750
- Ye Eun...
- Yes?

804
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,380
- You'd definitely stand out.
- Hey.

805
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,550
- I want this for myself.
- Right?

806
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,580
- Should we buy this?
- I want it.

807
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,650
- Let's take it.
- I'd like to have it.

808
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,690
- Ma'am, we'll take this.
- I see.

809
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,420
- We have to.
- How much is this?

810
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,060
Three dollars.

811
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,120
Three dollars?

812
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,230
Three...

813
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,960
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

814
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,760
- Is it too much?
- That's not the vibe.

815
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,960
Should it be braided?

816
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,770
Shouldn't we buy this too...

817
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,930
- since he put it in his nose?
- Should it be braided?

818
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,100
Why do you keep putting it
in your nose?

819
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
We'll then have to buy it.

820
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,440
- I'll wipe that clean.
- They're both three dollars.

821
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,310
- We have to buy those.
- Let's buy these.

822
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,970
- Yes, buy them.
- We'll buy these two.

823
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,140
- Buy those two.
- We have to buy them.

824
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,580
What about that wig?

825
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,750
- Check that out.
- The yellow-green one?

826
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,850
- Which one?
- This one.

827
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,550
- The really long one?
- This one.

828
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,020
This looks really expensive.

829
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,120
How much is this? I want it.
I'd always wanted to have this hair.

830
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,790
- How much is this?
- Old US movie leads had this hair.

831
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,090
Isn't this the hair
teenage movie leads had?

832
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,500
(Teen movie male leads
had this kind of hair.)

833
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,630
(Zoning out)

834
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,400
Hey, this hair... This is...

835
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,640
It's that hairstyle.

836
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,910
(He sits in a hurry dreaming
of becoming a blond heartthrob.)

837
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,510
This is for people
with a small head because...

838
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,720
- the European style...
- I see.

839
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,320
- It's a smaller size.
- It's tighter.

840
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,090
- European...
- Yes.

841
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,020
Hey, it fits you.

842
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,390
- Does it look okay?
- It's not bad.

843
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,730
- Gosh.
- You look silly.

844
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,730
- You could be on "Surprise."
- You look silly.

845
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,700
(Surprise)

846
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,030
"Surprise?" Don't I look like
an actor from "Surprise?"

847
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,730
A guy who reenacts situations.

848
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,400
- Blond really doesn't suit you.
- A reenactor.

849
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,370
Seok Jin, you want to have
this kind of hair,

850
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,770
- but the color doesn't suit you.
- Right.

851
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,710
- And it's a bit...
- It looks too much like a wig.

852
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,010
It looks like a wig,
and it doesn't suit you.

853
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,080
You'd look better with highlights.

854
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
- Can I try it on?
- Yes, you try it on.

855
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,320
You have a small head.

856
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,920
- I'll try it on.
- Your head's really small.

857
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
- Your head is small.
- Let's have a look.

858
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,220
You know rats, right?

859
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,030
- Rats?
- That's how small his head is.

860
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,560
- Hey, you...
- It slips right on.

861
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,960
Your head is so small.

862
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,730
You look like
a guy from "Surprise" too.

863
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,200
Anyone wearing this looks like
they popped out of "Surprise."

864
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,540
"Hey, Martin?"

865
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,770
(A scientist whose beaker broke.)

866
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,940
"Where are you going?"

867
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,310
I can't help it
that I look like that.

868
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,410
- It doesn't work.
- No.

869
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,110
Can I try on the yellow one?

870
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,550
- Try it on.
- It might suit you.

871
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,220
I want to try being blond.
I've never dyed my hair.

872
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,720
- You haven't?
- What do I do?

873
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,020
- This isn't dyed?
- Do I part this?

874
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,820
- No. If we go as is...
- No?

875
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,460
- Can I have a candy?
- Yes, you can.

876
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,920
- My gosh.
- What?

877
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,390
- Thanks.
- Why would you eat that?

878
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,130
I have a big head. It's...

879
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,630
Your head is pretty big.

880
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,300
- It looks like a hat.
- As a kid...

881
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,700
- It covers only half.
- It doesn't fit.

882
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,010
My childhood nickname was "Alien"
because my head looked like that.

883
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,710
- You have a big head.
- Your head...

884
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,480
- It's not working.
- My head's...

885
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,850
- It doesn't fit.
- You don't have to...

886
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,710
cover the whole head.

887
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,680
- It's two-toned.
- The two-toned look works.

888
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,280
What is this?

889
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,020
- This looks too weird.
- Ma'am.

890
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,090
- You can't...
- What is this?

891
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,560
Doesn't this look too weird?

892
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,120
Two-toned hair. Hey.

893
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,620
It looks natural on you.

894
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,630
The style is ahead of the time.

895
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,500
People color their hair
with two tones on purpose.

896
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,930
- This is awesome.
- But...

897
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,130
- If we do this...
- Let's see.

898
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,600
- If we do this...
- Let's see.

899
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,440
What is this?

900
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,270
It looks like a nice dye job.

901
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,910
It's like "I can dye my hair or not,
whatever I want."

902
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,580
It's like a half-fitted wig.

903
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,180
- Seok Sam. Sit back down.
- What?

904
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,210
Is this okay?

905
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,550
- That might look cute.
- Yes.

906
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,550
(A toupee for Seok Sam)

907
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,320
- That might look cute.
- Yes.

908
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,450
How about a toupee?

909
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,290
Seok Jin. You look young.

910
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,570
Seok Jin. You look young.

911
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,870
You got younger. Seok Jin.

912
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:48,840
(Fainting with laughter)

913
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,440
Ma'am, this one...

914
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,510
- You look like you're in your 20s.
- Show us.

915
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,540
- It's amazing.
- You look so young.

916
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,550
(Young Seok Sam appeared.)

917
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,350
- It's shocking.
- It's magic.

918
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,450
You're young Seok Sam.

919
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,620
- It's really...
- Young Seok Sam.

920
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,320
- It's no joke.
- It's magic.

921
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,850
- You look like Park Bo Gum.
- Isn't it like magic?

922
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,090
A scene from the 1960s
in "When Life Gives You Tangerines."

923
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,430
Could I order one
in the color of my hair?

924
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,990
- My gosh.
- This is crazy.

925
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,960
- This is crazy.
- It is.

926
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,330
How do you look so young?

927
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,360
How much is it?

928
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,270
- It's 400 dollars.
- It's too expensive.

929
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,700
I see why it's that price.

930
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,600
- I want it so badly.
- Is this real hair?

931
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
- Human hair?
- Yes.

932
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,370
- I want it so badly.
- You look ten years younger.

933
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,370
- Yes.
- Ten years...

934
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,540
- This...
- The bangs...

935
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,440
- The hair in the front...
- Look at you.

936
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,650
Pay for it yourself.

937
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,980
If it were the right color,

938
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,150
- I can clip it right on?
- Yes.

939
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,720
It looks like your hair.

940
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

941
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,220
- You look different.
- It's awesome.

942
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,220
- You look different.
- This might be a hit.

943
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,720
- I look so different.
- You do.

944
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,460
Like this... My gosh.

945
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,490
If we rented this, the stylists...

946
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,300
- They'd love it.
- They'd all vote.

947
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,330
- Yes.
- Yes, rentals.

948
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,700
Can I rent this?

949
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,330
- You can.
- For how much?

950
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,370
How much to rent it for a day?

951
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,600
A day? It's 100 dollars
for 4 days and 3 nights.

952
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,610
Then could I rent this
for 2 days 1 night for 50 dollars?

953
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,910
- At a special price of 50.
- Yes, you can.

954
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,480
- Fifty dollars?
- For the day.

955
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,910
- Just for today.
- Today only.

956
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,310
- Yes, okay.
- Thank you.

957
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,820
- Yes, okay.
- Thank you.

958
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,590
Let's do that.
This has to be for the stylists.

959
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,090
Nothing beats this
at making their star stand out.

960
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,290
How much is the total?

961
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,620
- It's fifty-six dollars.
- Fifty-six dollars?

962
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,190
- Fifty-six dollars.
- Fifty-six dollars.

963
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,030
This is a must.

964
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,100
- For Young Seok Sam...
- Yes, Young Seok Sam.

965
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Okay. Thank you.

966
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,700
- Thank you. Bye.
- We'll...

967
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,300
- We'll wear it well and return it.
- We'll return it in good condition.

968
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,570
Can I have your business card?

969
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,910
We need clothes next.

970
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,840
- Clothes...
- Dongdaemun Market has that.

971
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
The Folk Flea Market is nearby too.

972
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,980
The Folk Flea Market?

973
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,750
Today's missions need great sense.

974
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,520
- Yes.
- We must buy all three?

975
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,750
Right.

976
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,290
It's the same for the other team.

977
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,420
It's the same mission.

978
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,120
Something that wakes you up.
There are things like this too.

979
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,060
We could think of an object,
but there are working toys too.

980
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,530
- Something like that...
- For fun?

981
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,000
- Yes. Rattling...
- The thing is,

982
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,600
if we focus too much on fun,

983
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,300
they won't buy
because it's an auction.

984
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,000
When it's time to buy things,

985
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,310
they turn really cool-headed.

986
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,640
- Yes.
- After laughing like crazy.

987
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,080
The first thing
we need to consider is whether...

988
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,550
we think it's something
we'd want to own.

989
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,550
- Hey, the CEO mindset.
- Being a CEO...

990
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,580
- That's cool. Very logical.
- Yes.

991
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,190
- Being a CEO...
- You're good at this.

992
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,790
You have lots of ideas about sales.

993
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,620
Honey, no, I mean...

994
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,530
- "Honey?" What?
- "Honey?" Hang on!

995
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,260
(Did she call Jong Kook "honey?")

996
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,830
- What?
- What was that?

997
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,400
- What was that?
- Hang on.

998
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,470
- You two...
- We must discuss this.

999
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,000
- Hang on.
- No, wait.

1000
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,370
- Explain, Ji Hyo.
- I also...

1001
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,970
- "Honey?"
- I meant to say "excuse me."

1002
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,540
- No. Haha, what does this mean?
- "Excuse me."

1003
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,710
You'll call him
"sweetie" and "babe" next.

1004
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,910
- And then "darling."
- "Excuse me."

1005
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,550
- This is driving me insane.
- Okay, fine.

1006
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,220
- Point taken.
- This is shocking.

1007
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,550
- It's a positive influence.
- Hang on.

1008
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,620
This should be in the news. "Honey?"

1009
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,760
Seongsu-dong has lots of nice stuff.
Like accessories and props.

1010
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,430
I have to walk around Seongsu-dong
looking like this.

1011
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,030
- That hip neighborhood.
- Yes.

1012
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,100
It's crowded, isn't it?

1013
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,000
Yes. And they're young.

1014
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Isn't it Monday?

1015
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,040
It's too crowded to walk around...

1016
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,570
- on weekends.
- Right.

1017
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,370
- It's this busy?
- It's so hip.

1018
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,410
It's this busy on a Monday?

1019
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,110
- My gosh.
- The line stretches that far?

1020
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,410
This is the main road.

1021
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,920
Seongsu-dong is a place...

1022
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,120
I rarely come to
for the sake of the youth.

1023
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,350
I'm the best-dressed guy here.

1024
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,860
- This is Seongsu-dong.
- Hey.

1025
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,090
You and I need to stick together.

1026
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,530
Let's walk along the street.

1027
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,460
What we need to find here
are printed tees.

1028
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,930
- Yes. We must get the tees first.
- Right.

1029
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
- We have 200 dollars.
- Yes.

1030
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,970
I think we should stay under 50.

1031
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,210
- Stay under 50 dollars?
- We can do that.

1032
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,540
Good luck, guys!

1033
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,710
(They plan to buy cheap
and save a lot!)

1034
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,810
There are lots of pretty things.

1035
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,810
- Hello.
- This place...

1036
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,020
We don't usually dress like this.

1037
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,120
He's right. This store is so pretty.

1038
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,620
Where are the printed clothes?
Where are most of them at?

1039
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Where?

1040
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,990
Do you want long or short sleeves?

1041
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,490
- Short sleeves.
- Short would be cheaper.

1042
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,190
- Short sleeves? Then...
- Yes.

1043
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,000
- All these are...
- Printed tees?

1044
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,100
Aisle 14.

1045
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,070
Hang on. The flashiest prints...

1046
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,500
What about this?

1047
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,610
This or this, which is better?

1048
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,610
(Looking hard
for something nice but cheap)

1049
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,580
This jacket looks nice.

1050
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,450
I personally would go for this.

1051
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,450
- Considering the price and all.
- Which one?

1052
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,580
- Let's see.
- It's adorable.

1053
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,620
Hey, that's cute.

1054
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,350
- Isn't it cute?
- It is. It's so you.

1055
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,790
- Isn't it cute?
- It's very Hawaii.

1056
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,920
I'll try it on.

1057
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,930
(CEO Ha's buying tip: Must try on)

1058
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,560
I like this kind of color.

1059
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,730
This is the furthest I can go.

1060
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,000
- I like this. Plain with...
- Jong Kook.

1061
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,070
- What?
- Hi, boss. How are you?

1062
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,210
- Hi, boss. How are you?
- Hey, you...

1063
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,210
(CEO Yang appeared
in something colorful.)

1064
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,010
- Hey, you...
- Isn't this flashy?

1065
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,450
- I like that.
- Your shoulders are stiff.

1066
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,350
- How much is that?
- Because...

1067
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,650
Stylists need something like this.

1068
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,990
How much is it? Thirty-plus dollars?

1069
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,320
It's 6 dollars 80 cents.

1070
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,390
- What? For real?
- Let me see.

1071
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,560
Isn't it 68 dollars?

1072
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,330
We must get that, then.

1073
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,330
- It is 6 dollars 80 cents.
- Should I keep this for now?

1074
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,000
Buy that. Buy it.

1075
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,370
I think it's a steal
for six dollars.

1076
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,000
With that price,
you're in first place.

1077
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,370
I like this.

1078
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,210
Something flashy...

1079
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,240
Hey, how about this?

1080
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,480
- What about this? The cat.
- What?

1081
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,810
- Oh, that's cute.
- Isn't it cute?

1082
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,350
- The cat looks cute. Okay.
- Isn't it cute? Like this.

1083
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,450
The size is perfect too.

1084
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,350
- How much is it? Let's take a look.
- This is about 20...

1085
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,780
- It's 20-something dollars?
- How much is it?

1086
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,290
- It's over 20 dollars?
- Yes.

1087
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,390
It's a good price
if it's 20 dollars.

1088
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,890
- But 24 dollars is...
- Why?

1089
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,660
- This is...
- Even to wear during summer?

1090
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,300
Gosh, Haha. I tried putting mine
back on, but I can't.

1091
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,770
Can't I just wear this around today?

1092
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,370
Jong Kook, can't I wear this around?

1093
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,740
- Wearing mine makes me feel sad.
- Yes, nice.

1094
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,870
Is it too gloomy?

1095
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,910
- Give me that. I'll go and buy it.
- Here you go.

1096
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,310
- Yes, thank you.
- Here you go.

1097
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,610
(Receipt: Printed shirt 6.8 dollars,
Bag 0.2 dollars, Total 7 dollars)

1098
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,180
- Things are going well today.
- I like how things are starting.

1099
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,620
Things are going well for us.
It's satisfying, isn't it?

1100
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,890
For six dollars, it's very fancy.

1101
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,290
If it's 6.8 dollars,
it's worth a lot for your money.

1102
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,460
(They have a pep in their steps
after their first cheap purchase.)

1103
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,390
- The weather is nice too, right?
- Yes.

1104
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,690
Gosh, what could there be here?

1105
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,060
(Team Cameramen: A stylish hat to
block the sun during outdoor shoot)

1106
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,000
- Don't we get to eat snacks here?
- Look at that.

1107
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,470
I think there might be something
at the end.

1108
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,600
My goodness.

1109
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,830
Something to snack on.

1110
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,870
(Mr. Free Meals' blood sugar levels
are starting to drop.)

1111
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,470
- Hey, let's go somewhere hip.
- What's this now?

1112
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,510
- My gosh.
- Yeonmujang-gil. What is this?

1113
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,540
- Gosh, there was such a place...
- Hey, isn't this Standing Galbi?

1114
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,450
- Standing...
- Standing Galbi!

1115
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,820
(Mr. Kim has only ever eaten galbi
while standing at a restaurant.)

1116
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,650
- This is Standing Galbi.
- What is this?

1117
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,150
Oh, is there something to eat?

1118
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,690
- Let's try something here.
- Is it cereal?

1119
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,020
- Let's eat.
- Let's have some.

1120
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,260
- Do we have money?
- Let's eat this.

1121
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,560
- Let's eat something.
- We have money.

1122
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
- Hello.
- How do we order?

1123
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,630
By the way, what is this?

1124
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,500
- Ice cream.
- It's ice cream?

1125
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
I'll have the cinnamon toast...

1126
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,400
- Gosh, I don't eat ice cream.
- All of it?

1127
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,940
- I'll have the plain ice cream.
- The plain one?

1128
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,640
I'll have the cinnamon toast crunch.

1129
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,210
(Everyone starts ordering like crazy
except for Jong Kook.)

1130
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,710
Then, I'll have this.

1131
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,280
- I'll just have some water.
- Jong Kook will have water.

1132
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,850
So, how much is this?
Is it 9.5 dollars?

1133
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,320
The total is 34.5 dollars.

1134
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,720
(Receipt: Ice cream, Cone ice cream,
Cone ice cream, Water, Total 34.5)

1135
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,880
- We have to eat it, though.
- Right?

1136
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,090
(They bought a shirt for 6 dollars
and ice cream for 30 dollars.)

1137
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,390
I'll help ring you up.

1138
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,160
Hey, let's just have fun here.

1139
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,660
Gosh, I'm about to go crazy.

1140
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
- This is just...
- It's been a while...
since I felt this young vibe.

1141
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,690
It's a bit of a waste
to buy water here.

1142
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,300
- Right.
- Because we have water in the car.

1143
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,170
- Right, I thought of that too.
- My gosh.

1144
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,300
- I'm driving away the customers.
- Hey, what's wrong with him?

1145
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,970
The vibe is so weird here.

1146
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,470
The vibe is so bad.

1147
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,080
- Mister, what are you doing here?
- My goodness.

1148
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,540
(His hiking outfit doesn't match
his hip movements.)

1149
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,910
You're ruining the vibe.

1150
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,550
Oh, my. What do we do?
You look awful.

1151
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,720
I drove away the customers.

1152
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,580
Mister,
you must've had some makgeolli.

1153
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,120
(The nasty duet dance
might make customers turn away.)

1154
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,850
- You must've had a few drinks.
- Hey.

1155
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,590
Hey, you guys are going to
put this place out of business.

1156
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,220
- Hey, this won't do. Let's go.
- You'll ruin their business.

1157
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,660
Gosh, I'm being a nuisance
to the owner here.

1158
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,300
- This is so hip.
- It's huge.

1159
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,500
- My gosh.
- Here is your order.

1160
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,830
Thank you.

1161
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,440
Hey, what is this?

1162
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,340
This is so good!

1163
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,410
I mean, what is this on the inside?

1164
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,710
Haha, this feels like bread too.

1165
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,810
(Chewing loudly)

1166
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,110
Can't you eat over there?

1167
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,710
- Gosh, this is bad.
- I'm sorry.

1168
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,780
It's not that I don't like you.

1169
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,220
I don't think I can walk around
with him anymore.

1170
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,250
Hey, but he is seriously...

1171
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,720
(Chowing down)

1172
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,490
This is delicious, Jong Kook.

1173
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,460
To be honest, do you feel confident
when you keep your distance from us?

1174
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,530
- What do you mean? On my own?
- Yes.
- Without any cameras?
- None.

1175
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,000
I don't think I could do it.

1176
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,170
Well, I'm okay here with the cameras
and you guys,

1177
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,070
but how would I come here by myself?

1178
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,470
I could never do that.

1179
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,610
(Comedian Yang is only confident
in front of the camera.)

1180
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,240
Let's get moving.

1181
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,980
- Let me see here.
- Hello.

1182
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,680
- Let me see here.
- Let me see here.

1183
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,050
Oh, they have items here.

1184
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,480
- Look at these.
- It's an item shop.

1185
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,180
This place is cute.

1186
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,650
- Let's go.
- Let's go inside.

1187
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,960
- Hey, this character is so cute.
- Right, it's cute.

1188
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,120
If this character wakes you up
in the morning,

1189
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,220
you'd wake up right away.

1190
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,790
- But here... This kind of place.
- Hello.

1191
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,860
- At this kind of place... Okay.
- Let's see if they have anything.

1192
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,000
Hello.

1193
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,760
These are so adorable. Look.

1194
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,830
- So cute.
- These guys.

1195
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,400
Couldn't we buy something and say
it wakes you up as it's too cute?

1196
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,540
What about this?

1197
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,570
I think nothing else can beat this.

1198
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,810
- The yellow raincoat.
- Which one?

1199
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,040
- It's a coin bank in the back.
- Isn't it so cute?

1200
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,680
Oh, it's a coin bank?

1201
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,080
Jong Kook, look at this one.

1202
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,280
(Exclaiming at the cute coin bank)

1203
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,410
Hey, this one with the umbrella
is cute. What was this one's name?

1204
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,580
Is it "My Neighbor Totoro?"

1205
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,020
Gosh, this place is
full of cute stuff.

1206
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,820
- He's so into cute stuff lately.
- Jong Kook, this one.

1207
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,390
- Why does he like them so much?
- When you touch this one...

1208
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,190
- This place is full of cute stuff.
- Look, his eyes have gone mad.

1209
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,030
(Chuckling)

1210
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,360
(Jong Sook's eyes have gone mad
at cute things again today.)

1211
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,370
- Gosh, this is so cute too.
- Jong Kook, this one.

1212
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,930
This is so adorable. Look at these.

1213
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,270
(Patting)

1214
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,100
What about filling this tumbler
with a beverage...

1215
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,910
- and drinking from it?
- Hey, it's cute!

1216
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,710
- What do you think?
- It's so adorable.

1217
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,710
- For waking up. Yes.
- You mean it'll wake you up?

1218
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,110
- How much is this?
- What about the tumbler?

1219
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,310
It's 55 dollars.

1220
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,880
- It's 55 dollars?
- That's not bad.

1221
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,680
When you fill this up...

1222
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,220
- Let's get this.
- Fill this with a cold drink...

1223
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,380
- Let's do this.
- Shall we?

1224
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,990
(They're hooked on the cuteness
and forget about buying cheap things.)

1225
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,150
- Yes, with a cold beverage.
- Let's do this.

1226
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,420
The cuteness
as well as the cold drink...

1227
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,660
- wake you up. What do you think?
- Hey.

1228
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,960
- We have to get this.
- Let's get this.

1229
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,990
- Hey, so...
- Jong Kook.

1230
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,730
- Let's ask the staff. How is it?
- They'll buy it, no matter what.

1231
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,330
- They'll definitely buy it.
- Of course, they'll buy it.

1232
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,860
- Women go crazy for these things.
- Hey, they'll definitely buy it.

1233
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,570
- Let's keep this on the list.
- But really, this is crazy cute.

1234
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,770
- It's so cute.
- No, because...

1235
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,070
- It'll wake you up.
- It's a good fit.

1236
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,440
- Yes, it wakes you up.
- Because if you add...

1237
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,310
- something like coffee...
- That's it.

1238
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,410
- How much did you say it was?
- It's 55 dollars.

1239
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,640
(Receipt: "Crayon Shin-chan"
tumbler 55 dollars)

1240
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,210
Gosh, how pretty and cute.

1241
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,580
I like the tumbler.

1242
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,010
- The tumbler is not bad.
- It's not bad.

1243
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,380
- It's good.
- The tumbler is the best.

1244
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,350
- Gosh, there's good food here too.
- Look, twisted donuts.

1245
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,950
- Twisted donuts sound good.
- My gosh.

1246
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,150
When we go to folk flea markets,
there is a lot to eat.

1247
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,690
- It'll be amazing.
- My gosh.

1248
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,220
- I love markets.
- I've never been to one.

1249
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,530
- Me either.
- Really?

1250
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,590
- Don't they sell jeon at markets?
- Of course they do.

1251
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,600
- Gosh, that sounds so good.
- And snack food too.

1252
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,530
- Kalguksu.
- Janchi guksu.

1253
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,700
- Dumplings.
- Let's go.

1254
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
- Hang on.
- Let's get out here.

1255
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,870
(Seoul Folk Flea Market)

1256
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,970
- They sell clothes too.
- Let's go.

1257
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,270
Let's get out here.
Gosh, what is this?

1258
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,310
(The hot place of merchants where
they have practically everything)

1259
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,010
They have various old items,

1260
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,150
but they especially have
antique items at folk flea markets.

1261
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,880
Gosh, but this place is really...

1262
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,320
There's all sorts of stuff.

1263
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,880
Gosh, this is incredible.

1264
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,560
This place really suits my outfit.

1265
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,420
Oh, the smell. I smell food.

1266
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,420
(Sniffing as soon as she gets out)

1267
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,160
Oh, over here. The folk flea market.

1268
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,530
Hang on. Let's look at some clothes
for our cameramen.

1269
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,700
They have clothes over there.

1270
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,960
Oh, they have some here too.

1271
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,200
Hey,
shouldn't we wear stuff like this?

1272
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,670
- Team outfits?
- Aren't these nice as team outfits?

1273
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,400
- That looks nice.
- They do look nice.

1274
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,140
- It's truly camouflage.
- That's really nice.

1275
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,710
They look nice.

1276
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,310
- That's really nice.
- It has a pheasant on here.

1277
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,740
A pigeon...

1278
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,980
The camouflage is perfect
for our cameramen.

1279
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,450
What do you think of these?

1280
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,220
- If you wear this in the woods,
- What do you think of these?

1281
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,520
we wouldn't be able to find you.

1282
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,950
- I mean...
- Look.

1283
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,220
Something like this.

1284
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,890
- This one has snakes on it.
- Snakes.

1285
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,020
- There are snakes in the woods.
- It's pretty.

1286
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,620
- So, like a snake in the woods...
- You're right.

1287
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,230
during springtime...

1288
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,960
Isn't this the perfect camouflage?

1289
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,330
- This would seriously...
- It's incredible.

1290
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,530
be impossible to spot in the woods.

1291
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,100
- Isn't this all right?
- It is.

1292
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,570
- There are birds on it too.
- Right.

1293
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,870
Hey, that outfit is all right.

1294
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,000
(The CEOs' top choice is
the pheasant camouflage shirt.)

1295
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,040
- How about this one?
- It's totally camouflage.

1296
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,570
During springtime...

1297
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,810
It's so nice.

1298
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,410
Hey, during springtime?

1299
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,910
- During springtime, this is...
- That's nice.

1300
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,780
- There are flowers and leaves...
- And...

1301
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,180
It's so stylish.

1302
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,620
- Amid the flowers...
- They wanted...

1303
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,220
a camouflage T-shirt
amid the flowers.

1304
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,450
In that case,
what do you think about this vibe?

1305
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,590
- Tell us honestly.
- Be really honest.

1306
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,620
Sir, what do you think of this?

1307
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,430
We can't tell
unless we see him standing in it.

1308
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,260
You should try it on for now.

1309
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,800
You'll know if you try it on.

1310
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,730
- Then, you should try it on.
- Is it because of the pheasant?

1311
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,730
- The size is a bit...
- Why not...

1312
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,170
Shall I try it on for you?

1313
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,600
- Yes, you should try it on.
- Sir.

1314
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
- Just to see how it looks.
- I'm sure it'll look good.

1315
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,470
- But this outfit is...
- Just to see how it is.

1316
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:38,170
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Me either.

1317
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,340
You must come...

1318
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,480
- to the folk flea market...
- You're right.

1319
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,710
I've never seen an outfit like this.

1320
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,250
- It's unexpectedly stylish.
- Hey, Jae Seok.

1321
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,510
It's not bad.

1322
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,320
(That belongs to you.)

1323
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,490
- It's so pretty.
- You look so cool.

1324
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,020
- No, when I put it on...
- Today, I feel...

1325
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,220
- It looks so cool.
- It looks nice.

1326
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,460
- Hey, this looks good.
- It's so pretty.

1327
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,660
- It's not bad, is it?
- You look so cool.

1328
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,960
- It's not bad.
- When I put it on, it's nice.

1329
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
- You look cool.
- The reaction changed...

1330
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,990
once I put it on.

1331
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,600
- You look cool.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1332
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,200
Welcome. My gosh!

1333
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,330
Does this look all right?

1334
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,800
(Welcome!)

1335
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,970
(A strong appearance)

1336
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,510
(Bursting out in a funny dance)

1337
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,910
(The folk flea market sales tactic
that exudes experience)

1338
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,350
- By the way...
- You're so energetic.

1339
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,680
Gosh, all of a sudden.

1340
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,650
(They learned a lesson.)

1341
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,820
Ma'am, how much is this outfit?

1342
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,950
It's rather pricey.

1343
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,290
- Oh, how much?
- How much is it?

1344
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,920
(How much is the pheasant jacket?)

1345
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,030
It costs 50 dollars.

1346
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,260
- It is pretty pricey.
- But I'll give it to you for cheap.

1347
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,500
Ma'am, when would you say
that people purchase...

1348
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,100
this type of jacket?

1349
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,830
Only peculiar people like me buy it.

1350
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,270
(Wiggling)

1351
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,970
(Are you still not going to buy it?)

1352
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,080
- You sure have flashy steps.
- Well...

1353
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,710
Ma'am, you break out
into dance quite often.

1354
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,810
That's right.

1355
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,950
- You look cool.
- Does it look okay?

1356
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,980
- Is this good to wear in spring?
- Yes.

1357
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,920
- This is the perfect camouflage.
- It would go well with jeans too.

1358
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,790
The owner said this was 50 dollars,
but she said...

1359
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,060
- Yes.
- She said she'd give us a discount.

1360
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,120
- She said she'd give us a discount.
- You donate...

1361
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,730
a lot of money to the country.

1362
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,990
I'll give it to you
for a cheap price.

1363
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,400
- All of a sudden?
- What?

1364
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,600
(A donation discount
instead of a celebrity discount)

1365
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,270
Why are you
suddenly mentioning that, ma'am?

1366
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,940
- Since he donates lots of money...
- Oh, because of that?

1367
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,740
- Let's keep that on the list.
- We should find several options.

1368
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,840
Let's take a look around elsewhere.

1369
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,040
- This is our first stop, so...
- Okay.

1370
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,540
- That's not bad, is it?
- We'll be back.

1371
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,140
- That one is nice.
- We'll come back.

1372
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,540
- It's all right.
- Bye.

1373
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,210
- Yes, thank you.
- We'll be back, ma'am.

1374
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,710
Shoes like these...

1375
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,880
By the way, Jae Seok,
I think it could be brighter than that.

1376
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,150
Let's look for something bright too.

1377
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,350
Something slightly brighter.

1378
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

1379
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,660
- Pung... What is that called?
- They have American antiques.

1380
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,330
What are these? Pung...

1381
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,360
(Pungmul)

1382
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,060
- Which one?
- Was it called "public lewdness?"

1383
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,300
- No, what is this? Pung-something?
- "Public lewdness?"

1384
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,270
- Which one?
- Was it called "public lewdness?"

1385
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,730
- No, what is this? Pung-something?
- "Public lewdness?"

1386
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,540
- It's samulnori.
- Right, samulnori.

1387
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,640
- Samulnori. This is a janggu.
- Janggu.

1388
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,840
- My gosh. Pung...
- Why'd you say, "public lewdness?"

1389
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,110
Pungmul.
Gosh, the folk flea market is...

1390
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,650
- Shall we go over here?
- Okay, let's try going this way.

1391
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,210
(They look through
the antiques alley first.)

1392
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,320
Right now,
we're looking for clothes...

1393
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,990
- for the cameramen or a keyboard?
- Right.

1394
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,790
- Oh, the keyboard.
- Yes, a keyboard.

1395
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,220
- A keyboard.
- A keyboard?

1396
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,760
Let's try to find a keyboard
here too if they have them.

1397
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,630
- Either a calculator or keyboard.
- Will they have one?

1398
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,990
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

1399
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,800
- Look. Old coins.
- What is it?

1400
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,130
- Is this for real?
- Aren't you familiar with these?

1401
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,970
Yes, of course. I used to use those.

1402
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,030
(Reminiscing)

1403
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,770
Sangpyeong Tongbo. You know?

1404
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,570
Gosh, it's a really old phone.

1405
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,500
- Ye Eun, do you know this?
- I know what it is,

1406
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,840
- but I've never used one.
- Oh, really?

1407
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,110
- Have you at least seen it before?
- It's like the ones we had.

1408
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,410
- It's a phone.
- We had one of these too.

1409
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,640
- We had one when I was young too.
- Really?

1410
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,910
- We had rotary phones.
- We used to make calls on these.

1411
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,420
Wait, what's this? A dalgona kit?

1412
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,780
- Dalgona sounds delicious.
- Look at these old phones.

1413
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,390
- I love things like this.
- Over here.

1414
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,690
There's an album by Cho Yong Pil.

1415
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,720
- And Chang Deok.
- He's so cute.

1416
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,990
No way.

1417
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,890
They have anything and everything.

1418
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:44,890
Tell me about it.

1419
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,700
- This is a fun place.
- There are a lot...

1420
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,830
of amusing items.

1421
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,130
It's a fun place.

1422
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,100
(Enjoying their time
at the Folk Flea Market)

1423
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,000
It's a food court.

1424
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,100
- No way.
- My gosh.

1425
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,240
- Tell me about it.
- Whole chicken stew looks tasty.

1426
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,670
(They freeze in front
of the restaurant.)

1427
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,940
- Tell me about it.
- Whole chicken stew looks tasty.

1428
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,780
- Let's have some bindaetteok.
- Grade A beef...

1429
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,180
- But...
- There's janchi guksu.

1430
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,750
I get that we'll be given time
to eat later,

1431
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,380
but why can't we have
some bindaetteok?

1432
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,150
Janchi guksu isn't technically
a rice-based meal.

1433
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,220
- Exactly.
- It's not a dinner menu.

1434
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,250
Janchi guksu
can't be considered a meal.

1435
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,320
The doenjang jjigae
smells incredible.

1436
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,390
- Shall we head inside?
- Tteok and dumpling soup?

1437
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,690
- That's allowed.
- What do you say to bindaetteok?

1438
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,690
- Hello.
- The smell is insane.

1439
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,390
- Everything looks good.
- The smell is incredible.

1440
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,660
- Hello.
- They serve delicious food.

1441
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,830
(A food court within the market
where merchants can relax)

1442
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,530
- Everything looks so good.
- Hello.

1443
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,500
- What should we have?
- Potato jeon?

1444
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,540
- Don't have too much.
- Potato jeon!

1445
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,340
- Potato jeon.
- You sound energetic again.

1446
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,080
- Potato jeon.
- Wait. Is this the place?

1447
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,780
- Yes.
- Can anyone sit here?

1448
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,810
Yes, anyone's allowed to sit here.

1449
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:36,810
(They snack first
before buying their items.)

1450
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,610
Potato jeon...

1451
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,020
- is like hotteok.
- Everything's on the cheaper side.

1452
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,120
Absolutely.

1453
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,520
- And janchi guksu...
- What about ramyeon?

1454
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,250
is like a fish cake broth.

1455
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,260
Why do you suddenly
sound lively again?

1456
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,260
There's more energy
in your voice now.

1457
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,660
Shouldn't we have potato jeon?

1458
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,730
- Potato jeon.
- We should have that.

1459
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,230
- Can we have one potato jeon?
- We'll take one for now.

1460
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,400
- Sure.
- Good.

1461
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,100
Everything's affordable.

1462
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,630
- No way.
- This makes it feel like...

1463
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,170
we're merchants here on a job.

1464
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,240
Don't I look like
a merchant at this place?

1465
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,970
What kind of clothes should we buy?

1466
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:04,970
- We need to buy some.
- Yes, the clothes.

1467
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,540
We're short on time
and must buy the clothes here.

1468
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,310
I'm experiencing vertigo.

1469
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,410
"I'm experiencing vertigo."

1470
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,350
- Ye Eun, it could be just me,
- Stir-fried pork?

1471
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,820
but you haven't been
talkative today.

1472
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,220
- That's...
- This isn't you.

1473
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,490
- You're not talking a lot today.
- That's because...

1474
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,060
- she's lacking energy.
- She's lacking energy.

1475
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,460
- She doesn't have the strength.
- Because she hasn't eaten.

1476
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,560
- Hardly.
- She's lacking energy.

1477
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,660
- She is weak now.
- I'm packed with energy.

1478
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,600
- Also...
- Also, from what I saw,

1479
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,800
- her gaze was weak.
- Exactly.

1480
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,140
Her eyes aren't shooting lasers,
and her gaze is weak.

1481
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,310
- You're imagining things.
- And after yelling for a bit,

1482
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,440
she suddenly feels lightheaded.

1483
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,610
This surprised me.

1484
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,380
- You never had dimples here.
- I did.

1485
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,610
Were they always there?
They're more defined today.

1486
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,350
- Is it because I lost weight?
- You lost weight,

1487
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,880
and it shows
with your defined dimples.

1488
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,150
- But...
- These were usually more defined.

1489
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,250
- Look.
- Ye Eun, come on.

1490
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,190
Her dimples below
were never that defined.

1491
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,190
- I feel terrible.
- It's not what you think.

1492
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,030
(While they feel bad
for the weakened food fighter)

1493
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,830
- Look how thick that is.
- No way.

1494
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,230
- Can you believe it?
- Look how thick that is.

1495
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,630
That has to taste good.

1496
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,230
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

1497
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,670
I'm lightheaded.

1498
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1499
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,210
- I'll enjoy it.
- Dig in.

1500
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,110
This has to be tasty.

1501
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,250
(Yummy)

1502
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,880
- Is it good?
- I haven't had any yet.

1503
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,880
(It's even better
since the break is short.)

1504
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,150
- It's good. Go ahead.
- Is it good?

1505
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,580
This is driving me crazy.

1506
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,520
- It's really good.
- My hands are shaking.

1507
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,820
Gosh, it's really good.

1508
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,360
(Food Fighter
replenishes her carbs.)

1509
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
Isn't it good?

1510
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,830
(Eyes widen.)

1511
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,100
My gosh.

1512
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,100
(My gosh)

1513
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,700
It's to die for.

1514
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,100
It's so good.

1515
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,440
(A bite of potato jeon
rapidly recharges her battery.)

1516
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,910
The young radish kimchi!

1517
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,140
The young radish kimchi is divine.

1518
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,210
- It's so good.
- It's good.

1519
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,880
The young radish kimchi
is delicious.

1520
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,250
I love kimchi that's sour.

1521
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,580
Have the bigger piece.

1522
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,950
Thanks. Thank you.

1523
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,990
(Before eating, While eating)

1524
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,490
(With Food Fighter who's in a trance
taking the lead)

1525
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,790
- There's potato inside this.
- It was nice and chewy.

1526
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,290
- Check this out.
- This has fermented well.

1527
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,230
This potato jeon
is one of the best you can have.

1528
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,860
(They gobble the snack in a trance.)

1529
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,900
It's so good.

1530
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,360
- It's good.
- This has fermented well.

1531
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,000
(The merchants fill their stomachs
before filling their pockets.)

1532
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,240
- Is it good?
- Is it good?

1533
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,710
It's nice and savory.

1534
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,270
- It's so good.
- It's really good.

1535
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,940
You can't easily
make potato jeon at home.

1536
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,940
Exactly.

1537
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,010
(Polished off in a heartbeat)

1538
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,150
I haven't had enough.

1539
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,820
There's still room in my stomach.

1540
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,980
I'm left wanting more.

1541
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,050
For now, let's...

1542
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,090
(They finally begin their meeting.)

1543
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,620
- We'll borrow the wig.
- The wig.

1544
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,120
We borrowed the wig.

1545
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,660
- We also bought hairpieces.
- The clothes.

1546
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,090
Clothes? We need to buy some.

1547
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,600
Do we need to buy colorful clothes?

1548
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,130
Yes, colorful clothes.

1549
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,730
That's the way to go...

1550
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,070
since they mentioned
spring and flowers.

1551
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,200
Why don't we get them something
that's really bright and colorful?

1552
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,470
- Let's see our options.
- Sure.

1553
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,940
- Thank you for the meal.
- That was amazing.

1554
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,210
- That was delicious.
- That was incredible.

1555
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,410
Thank you for the meal.

1556
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,380
We should see what kind
of clothes they have here.

1557
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,450
- Guys, check out this section.
- Also look for keyboards.

1558
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,080
I think we should get them
colorful clothes.

1559
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,120
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1560
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,320
- I don't see anything colorful.
- Bright and colorful...

1561
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,620
I don't see any.
Do you have keyboards here?

1562
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,820
They don't have keyboards.

1563
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,290
- I love riding bikes.
- There aren't any keyboards.

1564
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,430
- There aren't any keyboards.
- Right.

1565
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,460
- Hear me out.
- Yes.

1566
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,300
Don't you think we came
to the wrong place for keyboards?

1567
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,030
- Right?
- I've been looking around but...

1568
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,470
We came to the Folk Flea Market
because it was nearby.

1569
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,800
- Right.
- This isn't the spot...

1570
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,140
- to find keyboards.
- I doubt there are keyboards here.

1571
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,670
Shouldn't we go to Sewoon Arcade?

1572
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,010
- Isn't it nearby?
- Sewoon Arcade for keyboards.

1573
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,780
We should find one here
since this is where we are.

1574
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,610
Right. We also need to buy clothes.

1575
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,110
- Yes, clothes. Hello.
- We need to buy clothes too.

1576
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,850
- Goodness.
- Hello, sir.

1577
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,020
Look at all these adorable toys.

1578
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,120
They're so cute.

1579
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,220
- They're pretty.
- Check this out.

1580
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,620
No way.

1581
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,220
They're so pretty!

1582
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,830
Ye Eun, pick one to buy.
Do you have a favorite anime?

1583
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,190
- I bet you like stationery.
- This is cute.

1584
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,300
- I'd like to give this to you.
- What's this?

1585
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,100
- Goodness.
- This isn't necessary.

1586
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,500
- Take it.
- Sir, please.

1587
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,800
- What is it?
- It's a gift.

1588
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,040
- He gave me a gift out of nowhere.
- A gift?

1589
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,440
- We should be buying this.
- That's not necessary.

1590
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,710
- It's a gift.
- Just take it.

1591
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:58,810
- What?
- What is that?

1592
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,580
- But this is something you sell.
- It's fine.

1593
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,310
- I'm a fan.
- Don't overlook his generosity.

1594
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,880
- But still...
- It's all right.

1595
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,950
This is out of the blue.

1596
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,820
- He only gave one to Jae Seok.
- I'll pay for this.

1597
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,220
Please don't. It's okay.

1598
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,350
- Shouldn't you be selling this?
- It's fine.

1599
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,360
Have you sold anything today?

1600
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,760
I believe I will pretty soon.

1601
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,360
- Why don't Ye Eun...
- If you haven't...

1602
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,330
- Ye Eun, choose whatever you want.
- Right. Buy what you want.

1603
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,900
- Take your pick.
- Really?

1604
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,500
- You can hang it from your purse.
- He hasn't sold anything today.

1605
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,630
Oh, no.

1606
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,100
- Take your pick.
- How much was this?

1607
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,840
I don't really know.

1608
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,170
- Really? Did you just...
- This looks expensive.

1609
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,170
It's okay.

1610
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,110
Did you give him this
when you're not the owner?

1611
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,050
- How can you not know the price?
- This is out of the blue.

1612
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,920
- It's fine.
- You should be selling this.

1613
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,780
- Let's buy something here.
- Exactly.

1614
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,750
Ye Eun, choose whatever you want.

1615
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,760
- A calculator.
- We can buy a calculator.

1616
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,120
That's one of the items
we need to buy.

1617
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,890
- No, we need a keyboard.
- You're wrong.

1618
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,130
- A keyboard or...
- A keyboard or a calculator.

1619
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,360
There's a calculator here.

1620
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,730
We need to buy
a keyboard or a calculator.

1621
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,860
- This is great.
- Where is it?

1622
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,130
- I'm glad this worked out.
- The calculators.

1623
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,370
- Sir.
- Let's get a calculator.

1624
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,570
How much
is the Shin-chan calculator?

1625
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,940
- A keyboard or a calculator.
- The Shin-chan?

1626
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,440
- That's 60 dollars.
- Did you say 60?

1627
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,440
The Shin-chan calculator.

1628
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,670
(It's pricier than they thought.)

1629
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,110
- Look.
- Is it vintage?

1630
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,710
Yes, but it doesn't work.

1631
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,010
It doesn't work, guys.

1632
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,150
- It was made in 1993.
- In 1993?

1633
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,050
- The calculator doesn't work?
- It doesn't.

1634
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,650
- It was made in 1993.
- Only the sound matters.

1635
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,780
- What? Then...
- Oh, right.

1636
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,120
(Only the sound matters.)

1637
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,020
- Can we take a look at it?
- Let's take a look.

1638
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,060
- Even with batteries...
- The Shin-chan calculator.

1639
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,830
- The Shin-chan calculator.
- Even batteries won't do the trick?

1640
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:24,830
(Team Jae Seok wants to see
a calculator that doesn't work.)

1641
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,460
From what I can tell,

1642
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,560
- It's a vintage shop.
- this is a vintage shop.

1643
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,030
It was made in 1993.

1644
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,400
- When were you born again?
- What's this?

1645
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,540
- I was born in 1994.
- Since you were born in 1994...

1646
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,870
This is older than me.

1647
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:35,970
- It can't be clicky.
- Since you were born in 1994...

1648
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,810
(How do the keys sound?)

1649
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:38,940
I see it's not making
a pleasant sound.

1650
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,640
It's a year older than Ye Eun.

1651
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,040
I like how the buttons feel though.

1652
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,350
What type of calculator
do we have to buy?

1653
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,350
- One that goes "toc, toc."
- Toc, toc?

1654
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,320
- Sir, we'll take this.
- But...

1655
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,520
- Sure thing.
- Good.

1656
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,620
- The Shin-chan calculator.
- The Shin-chan calculator.

1657
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,650
- It's pretty.
- I agree.

1658
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,650
It was made in 1993.

1659
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,120
It can't calculate anything,
but it'll be nice to press.

1660
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,630
- You can't find this just anywhere.
- This is hard to find.

1661
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,900
It's brand-new even though
it was made in 1993.

1662
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,700
- How much is the calculator?
- It's 60 dollars.

1663
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,770
- That's right.
- Is the calculator 60 dollars?

1664
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,800
- Let's not ask for a discount.
- Got it.

1665
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,000
- Pay the full 60 dollars.
- Sure.

1666
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,040
This is all because...

1667
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,370
he showed his generosity first.

1668
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,810
- Exactly.
- Thank you so much.

1669
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,080
This is actually for the best.

1670
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,240
- I'm glad we bought this.
- Hand him the money.

1671
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,980
Here you go, sir.

1672
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,820
- This is adorable.
- We're your first customers today.

1673
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,380
- That's right.
- Thank you.

1674
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,920
- We wish you the best.
- Thank you.

1675
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,450
(They focused more
on the aesthetics.)

1676
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:26,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1677
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,020
This is great.

1678
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,060
(But he ended up leaving
his gift behind.)

1679
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,430
Sir, we'll get going.

1680
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:31,690
- We'll get going.
- Thank you.

1681
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,130
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

1682
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,800
(Jae Seok Association's
Purchase List)

1683
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,130
We also need to buy clothes.

1684
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,800
What type of clothes
do we need to buy?

1685
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:40,100
We should buy something
that'll suit Kang Chan Hee.

1686
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,400
Kang Chan Hee
would look great in this.

1687
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,440
Okay, got it.

1688
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,970
(The merchants gather
at a Korean diner.)

1689
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,280
They serve
a traditional Korean meal.

1690
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,510
- This is insane.
- No way.

1691
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,910
I see you bought a lot of things.

1692
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,110
- Well, we...
- There wasn't a lot to buy.

1693
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,150
You'll be surprised
to see what we bought.

1694
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,720
The items we bought
are more than amazing.

1695
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,250
We looked everywhere
in Seongsu-dong.

1696
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,660
- Did you go to Seongsu-dong?
- Yes.

1697
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,960
Everything hip is in Seongsu-dong.

1698
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,260
Don't go to Seongsu-dong...

1699
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,830
if you're only going
to taint the scene there.

1700
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,360
- What?
- Before you gathered here,

1701
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,560
- Yes?
- each team chose the item...

1702
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,270
- they were fondest of.
- Sure.

1703
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:15,040
(They chose the item
they were fondest of?)

1704
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,710
Out of the items you bought,

1705
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,910
please choose the one
you like the most.

1706
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:21,180
- Just one?
- Yes.

1707
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,810
- Should we go with the wig?
- Sure.

1708
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,750
- The wig?
- It'll be the wig.

1709
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,880
- The shirt?
- The shirt.

1710
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,920
- The one that cost 9.8 dollars.
- Wasn't it 9.8 dollars?

1711
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,980
- It was so affordable.
- That's insane.

1712
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,390
Why we told you to choose one
will be revealed at the diner.

1713
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,820
- Sure.
- Got it.

1714
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,820
The color of the item
that you chose...

1715
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,030
- will be the color of your team.
- What?

1716
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,690
Team Jae Seok chose an item...

1717
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,300
- that is black.
- That's right.

1718
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,130
Team Jong Kook's item
had too many colors,

1719
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,000
- so we asked an AI program.
- Sure.

1720
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,900
The color of this item is red.

1721
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,500
(If I'm to choose one color,
it has to be red.)

1722
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,940
Out of everything
that is served at this diner,

1723
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,480
you can only eat dishes
that match your team's color.

1724
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,780
- No way!
- Seriously?

1725
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,210
(Their world came crumbling down.)

1726
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,950
- Are you kidding me?
- The sausage.

1727
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,320
- Braised black beans.
- And kimchi.

1728
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,450
- We...
- Team Jae Seok...

1729
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,490
can only have braised black beans.

1730
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,320
- Yes!
- Nice!

1731
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,930
- Are you kidding me?
- Yes!

1732
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,860
- But...
- Are you serious?

1733
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,960
- Is this for real?
- Team Jong Kook's color is red.

1734
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,960
- Yes?
- The rice...

1735
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,600
(What side dishes are red?)

1736
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,770
Our team's color is red.

1737
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,840
You can have
the napa cabbage kimchi for free.

1738
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,240
And you can also have
the kimchi stew and stir-fried pork.

1739
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,640
- Nice.
- My gosh.

1740
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,910
- For free?
- What about us?

1741
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,110
Hey, we're good
as long as we have stir-fried pork.

1742
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,510
- We only get braised black beans?
- With stir-fried pork...

1743
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,150
We can eat with kimchi
and stir-fried pork.

1744
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,250
- Can't we buy more food?
- We're all set.

1745
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,420
- The fish cakes.
- What about this?

1746
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,820
- The fish cakes too.
- The carrots are red too.

1747
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,920
There's lots of red.

1748
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,620
But that's orange.

1749
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,160
There's the radish too.

1750
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,930
We took a photo
and scanned it through AI...

1751
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,190
to get the colors.

1752
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,360
- So, this side...
- But then, what do we do?

1753
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,900
only gets braised black beans
for free.

1754
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,900
If you want to add more food,
you have to pay money to eat.

1755
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,900
The food prices, including the rice,

1756
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,910
- are listed on the menu.
- Okay.

1757
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,410
A bowl of rice is one dollar,

1758
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:02,180
and 1 serving of side dishes...
is 1 dollar as well.

1759
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,210
- Let's have a rolled omelet.
- This is red.

1760
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,080
- We should eat this sausage.
- The pink sausage.

1761
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,920
This one.

1762
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,350
- We don't need the eggplants.
- Take it out.

1763
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,790
- What about this?
- I don't think we'll eat it.

1764
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,290
I don't think we'll eat this either.
Or this one.

1765
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,160
- But this has black.
- The braised black beans...

1766
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,160
- Can we eat this for free?
- No, we'll eat this.

1767
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,860
- We'll pay for it.
- Then, you can only have...

1768
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,130
the black laver parts from this.

1769
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,100
- Just the laver parts?
- Hang on.

1770
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,270
- My gosh.
- You're being too mean!

1771
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:29,000
- How can we only eat the laver?
- You should let us eat it!

1772
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,510
Should we take this out?
The seaweed?

1773
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:31,640
- But seaweed is good.
- It's good, though.

1774
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,540
- Of course it is.
- It's good. How about this one?

1775
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,280
- Yes, let's take this out.
- This one.

1776
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,410
But that one has the most food.

1777
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,650
- No.
- So, will you eat everything else?

1778
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,480
Let's have sausages, not the ham.

1779
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,020
But that ham must be tasty.

1780
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,120
That's only a dollar.
Can't we eat it?

1781
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,120
- The sausages?
- The Vienna sausages.

1782
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,390
Go ahead, Ye Eun.

1783
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,490
There are only 4 pieces.
We can only have 1 each.

1784
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,390
- Jae Seok, let's just eat it.
- Okay, go and get it.

1785
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,430
- Ye Eun...
- Let's give it to her.

1786
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,900
- Feed her. We must fatten her up.
- She lost weight too.

1787
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,330
- Give us the sausages.
- We'll take back the sausages.

1788
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,330
- Give us the Vienna sausages.
- The Vienna sausages.

1789
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,240
Gosh, Ye Eun is getting so...

1790
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,440
- I have to eat.
- Ye Eun.

1791
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,700
But this is red.

1792
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,010
- Hey, this is red.
- We can have the kimchi stew.

1793
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,380
The AI said everything but
the napa cabbage kimchi wasn't red.

1794
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,280
- This isn't red?
- No.

1795
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,780
- You asked the AI?
- We did.

1796
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:15,150
I want to eat this for a dollar.

1797
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,190
- Will you buy the rolled omelet?
- No, we won't.

1798
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,520
We won't buy it.

1799
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,990
They're buying lots of side dishes.
Let's eat some too.

1800
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,620
They have 100 dollars more than us.

1801
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,390
The stir-fried pork.

1802
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,790
- Let's have stir-fried pork.
- Stir-fried pork and kimchi stew.

1803
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,060
How much is the stir-fried pork?
Is it a dollar?

1804
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,400
- The stir-fried pork is 16 dollars.
- Okay.

1805
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,900
It's the original price on the menu.

1806
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,170
How about we get 1 stir-fried pork
and 1 kimchi stew to share?

1807
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,700
- To get both of those,
- All right.

1808
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,910
- we should take these out.
- Let's take these out.

1809
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,610
- Fine, we can do that.
- But if we do...

1810
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,770
It's better to just eat these,

1811
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,710
- instead of the kimchi stew.
- Let's eat these, not kimchi stew.

1812
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:42,780
- Let's do that.
- Stir-fried pork?

1813
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,610
- We'll take one order.
- One stir-fried pork?

1814
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,150
And four bowls of rice.

1815
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,520
Then, you will order
33 dollars' worth of extra food.

1816
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,150
- A total of 33 dollars?
- That's how much you ordered.

1817
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,250
And this side ordered
four dollars' worth.

1818
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,320
- Gosh, four dollars. That's great.
- Oh, my.

1819
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,730
And we can have cola
since it's black, right?

1820
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,390
Cola is black, so we can have it.

1821
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,000
- Wait, cola is black, isn't it?
- We can have cola since it's black.

1822
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,360
- Cola?
- Oh, you're right.

1823
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,970
- Cola is black.
- Cola is black.

1824
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,800
We'll take a photo of the cola
and scan it through Ai.

1825
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,900
- Cola is red.
- Liquid.

1826
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,240
Gosh, but I didn't know
the meal would go like this.

1827
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,080
We took a photo of the cola,

1828
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,540
and it said it was red.

1829
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,180
Come on.

1830
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,320
(Decide one color of this item
and tell us what it is. Red.)

1831
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,420
- But cola is...
- Come on.

1832
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,350
You can't take a photo of the can.

1833
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,620
- But the cola...
- You're being so mean.

1834
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,620
- Since it's new, we can't open it.
- That's right.

1835
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,990
- Give it to us.
- You can give it to us.

1836
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,390
- All right. That's enough.
- What's this?

1837
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,400
- It's hot.
- Gosh, it's hot.

1838
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,630
- No.
- What's that?

1839
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,800
- What is that?
- Gosh, look at the sausages.

1840
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,900
- Let's eat one of those too.
- Let's eat that too.

1841
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,700
- Let's eat that.
- Let's eat it.

1842
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,370
- What is that?
- Kimchi stew.

1843
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:45,410
- We'll take one.
- Kimchi stew.

1844
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,140
- One kimchi stew.
- My gosh.

1845
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,280
(Next to be delivered...)

1846
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,410
- My gosh.
- Gosh, it's the stir-fried pork.

1847
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,780
The rice thief.

1848
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,880
(The soul food of Koreans,
stir-fried pork)

1849
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,420
- Let's just eat this.
- It looks good.

1850
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,420
- Eat up.
- I haven't had this in a while.

1851
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:01,160
- This guy. You know?
- I knew you'd say that. "This guy."

1852
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,290
This guy that filled our bellies
even for a small amount of money.

1853
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,700
The onions in here are good too.

1854
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,700
(The taste makes them forget
all about the day's fatigue.)

1855
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,100
Gosh, I'll eat you up for the first time
in a while, stir-fried pork.

1856
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,400
Gosh, the stir-fried pork
is delicious.

1857
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,870
This guy, stir-fried pork,
that got us through our youth.

1858
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,610
The owner just cooked it up.

1859
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,340
It's tasty.

1860
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,110
- Gosh, the smell...
- The stir-fried pork is so good.

1861
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,180
I just finished
a whole bowl of rice.

1862
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,320
Have another bowl. Gosh,
the stir-fried pork is incredible.

1863
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,380
(Using both hands)

1864
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,450
This is it.

1865
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,720
Can't I have a sip of cola?

1866
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,490
- I've been craving kimchi stew.
- It's been a while. Me too.

1867
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,360
(Stealing)

1868
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,660
(Seok Sam stole
the other team's cola.)

1869
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,700
Go ahead.

1870
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,800
(Hissing)

1871
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,700
Gosh,
there were so many foreigners...

1872
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,730
- in Seongsu-dong.
- Did I just mishear that? The hiss?

1873
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:50,410
Did someone hiss with their mouth?
Oh, come on.

1874
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,410
(She drinks the cola,
not caring whether she is caught.)

1875
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,910
- There are lots of foreigners.
- That's nice.

1876
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:55,010
You can get a dollar from them.

1877
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,710
- Oh, we can?
- Yes, you should take it.

1878
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,650
- What are you doing?
- Give me a dollar.

1879
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,920
- Ye Eun, what's wrong with you?
- Why are you doing that?

1880
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,890
- Hey, here it comes.
- This is seriously tasty.

1881
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:05,720
It's a kimchi stew
that's like budaejjigae.

1882
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,920
It looks so good.

1883
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,790
Gosh, that's good.

1884
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,760
(Team Jae Seok spent
a whopping 54 dollars on lunch.)

1885
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,630
- My gosh.
- The food here is delicious.

1886
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,600
Hey, it's so good.

1887
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,470
The ramyeon looks good.

1888
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,010
(Food Fighter rinses her mouth
with cola and slurps her noodles.)

1889
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,910
- It's so tasty.
- Hey.

1890
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,440
- It's good.
- So good.

1891
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,810
Yes, that's Ji Ye Eun, indeed.

1892
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,450
- Hang on. Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1893
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,280
I'm going on a trip
with Kang Hoon tomorrow.

1894
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,280
Why?

1895
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,520
- He's going to LA.
- To LA.

1896
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,750
- Why?
- Just because.

1897
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,820
- Really, just to have fun?
- Yes.

1898
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,430
Is Kang Hoon older than you?

1899
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,330
Or are you older than him?

1900
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,360
He's older than me.

1901
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,460
- Is he?
- Yes.

1902
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,800
- Is he that old?
- Yes.

1903
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,300
- Kang Hoon is...
- Is he older than me?

1904
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,370
Kang Hoon?

1905
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,800
- That wouldn't be right.
- Okay.

1906
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,140
(The two giants are
bickering again.)

1907
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,610
- I don't know how old he is.
- You literally can't...

1908
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,810
- Ji Hyo, I'm still curious.
- Yes?

1909
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,410
Why did you call Jong Kook "honey?"

1910
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,250
- No, I really...
- I didn't see the situation.

1911
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,650
While I was talking...

1912
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,120
And that "honey"
sounded so affectionate.

1913
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,420
The tone wasn't like, "Honey."

1914
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,150
It wasn't like, "Hey, honey."
It was just matter-of-factly, "Honey."

1915
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,720
- "Honey."
- Just like a daily occurrence.

1916
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,990
- Honey... I meant, "Hey, there."
- "Honey?"

1917
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,290
"Honey?" Wait a minute.

1918
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,400
It was like a couple who had been
married for 30 years. "Honey."

1919
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,700
- "Hey, honey."
- It was like...

1920
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,200
"What is this, honey?"

1921
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,630
- It wasn't like, "Honey!"
- That is...

1922
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:28,400
We don't try to connect people
as a couple and all that lately.

1923
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,440
- We don't.
- Of course not.

1924
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,510
We don't do that,
but that's kind of weird.

1925
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,510
- Right? Isn't it weird?
- Why did you call him "honey?"

1926
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,980
I was the one she was addressing,
and it was weird for me too.

1927
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,250
I mean, out of the blue...

1928
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,880
- Did you almost go, "Yes, honey?"
- "Honey." Yes.

1929
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,920
- "Yes, honey."
- "Honey."

1930
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,020
I was like, "What?"

1931
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,620
(They finish eating lunch
while digging into their dating rumors.)

1932
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,650
(Team Jong Kook: Total 3 dollars,
Team Jae Seok: Total 54 dollars)

1933
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,820
That's right. We should eat
a hearty Korean meal...

1934
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,090
- to gain... Right.
- It energizes you, right?

1935
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,560
All right, Merchant's Association
members, let's go inside.

1936
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,230
- Okay! Let's do this!
- Let's go!

1937
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,430
For 40 dollars.

1938
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,500
We'll start the auction with
the items you bought.

1939
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,370
Let's do this. We can do it.

1940
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:02,470
In addition to your meal earlier,

1941
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:05,610
Team Jae Seok asked for batteries.

1942
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:06,810
- Come on.
- The cost of the batteries...

1943
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,510
- was 2.8 dollars.
- They bought batteries?

1944
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,550
(The price for buying batteries?)

1945
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,820
Could we get two AAA batteries?

1946
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,350
Oh, right. Can we buy batteries?

1947
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,650
AAA batteries.

1948
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,190
Wait,
did you try to get those for free?

1949
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,820
- But you should've told us...
- Of course, you have to pay.

1950
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,930
You have to pay for those.

1951
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:24,990
- You take money for batteries?
- You have to pay for them.

1952
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,490
- We must pay for everything today.
- My gosh.

1953
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,100
- My goodness.
- You spent an extra amount.

1954
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,530
Gosh, they have lots of money,
so they just spend it like water.

1955
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,600
- Good going.
- Now, we'll begin the auction...

1956
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,800
with the items bought by
the Running Merchant's Association.

1957
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,810
Each staff team will participate
in the auction.

1958
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:42,640
And you will reveal the items
that you bought...

1959
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,810
for each of the staff,
and you can tell them...

1960
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,810
- the price you want to sell it for.
- Sounds good.

1961
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,520
The staff will listen to the price
and buy it if it seems reasonable.

1962
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,550
And if they think
it's too expensive,

1963
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:56,390
- they'll say a price they want.
- Good.

1964
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,230
If you get a price
that you can sell it for,

1965
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,060
- you can decide to sell it.
- Okay.

1966
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,160
Keep in mind that the more money
you make in the auction,

1967
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,400
the closer you get to
the great prize.

1968
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,500
- The more money we make?
- The auction will be led...

1969
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,810
- fairly by Jae Seok.
- All right. Then,

1970
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,640
- I will be fair...
- Okay.

1971
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,280
- as I lead this auction.
- Are you banging the gavel here?

1972
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,150
- This is weird. I'm anxious.
- Jae Seok, you can't have ours...

1973
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,880
- Don't hit the gavel whenever.
- How can this be fair?

1974
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,620
- I am very exact.
- That's right.

1975
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,980
- Don't worry.
- We're in your favor.

1976
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,250
- Yes.
- When you pick up a gavel...

1977
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,090
- You must be fair.
- Don't you worry.

1978
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,650
If you don't do this right,

1979
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,220
- I'm going to flip you upside down.
- The gavel.

1980
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,420
- Don't you worry.
- Right in front here.

1981
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,660
- I will be fair and square. Okay.
- Be cool-headed.

1982
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:34,360
- Then, the first auction...
- Yes?

1983
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,100
will be with Team Producers.
Please come in.

1984
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,630
- Come on in.
- All right.

1985
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:39,370
(The auction-goers
of Team Producers enter.)

1986
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:40,500
They're so young.

1987
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,900
Please come to the front.

1988
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,440
Oh, is it these guys?

1989
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,270
- All right.
- Oh, it was these guys.

1990
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,710
- I like these guys.
- He likes sports.

1991
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,810
- Sportsman Yoon Jong Seo.
- Oh, these guys.

1992
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:52,550
Writer Hong Seon Kyung who dreams
of becoming the main writer.

1993
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,720
- Her surname is Song, not Hong.
- Oh, she's Song Seon Kyung.

1994
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,090
Seon Kyung, why are you suddenly
smiling like a baby today?

1995
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,320
Why are you smiling like this?

1996
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,950
Watch yourself on TV.
You smiled like this.

1997
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,520
I was so surprised.
She smiled like a baby suddenly.

1998
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,790
Did you see it?

1999
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,790
(Being teased again today
after being called John Lennon)

2000
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:08,060
So, Writer Song.
When you become the main writer,

2001
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,500
don't work with guys like Haha.

2002
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,700
- That's right.
- Oh, she nodded with all her might.

2003
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,070
(Strongly agreeing)

2004
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,010
- That's how you get revenge, okay?
- That's right.

2005
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,070
He told her
not to work with him later.

2006
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,110
You know how I feel, don't you?

2007
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,510
I know
who Myung Jae won't work with.

2008
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,510
- Who?
- Who is it?

2009
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:28,680
Before... Was it last week
or the week before? Can I say this?

2010
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,080
- What do you mean?
- What did he say?

2011
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,920
I mean,
Jong Kook kind of told you off...

2012
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,620
about something and left.

2013
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,620
And as soon as he left,

2014
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,990
- you said to me...
- What did he say?

2015
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:36,990
And as soon as he left,

2016
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,230
- you said to me...
- What did he say?

2017
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:39,490
"That jerk..."

2018
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,000
- Jong Kook.
- I'm serious.

2019
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,600
- Jong Kook.
- That's a misunderstanding.

2020
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,500
- For real?
- Also,

2021
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,510
don't trust everything Haha says.

2022
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,410
- Don't trust Haha.
- No, he really did.

2023
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,570
- Just you wait.
- It sounds like a fact.

2024
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,740
I mean, I did say it, but...

2025
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:58,150
- "I did say it, but..."
- Did you call him a jerk?

2026
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,280
(He did say it?)

2027
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,380
- Well...
- You did say it?

2028
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,650
I did, but the expression
I used wasn't, "That jerk,"

2029
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,650
- What did you say, then?
- What was it, then?

2030
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:09,120
- Well, to talk about the past...
- What?

2031
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,660
- Don't get scared, Myung Jae.
- Jong Kook.

2032
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,790
- You should complain to him.
- Say it to the camera.

2033
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:14,000
- Say what you need to say.
- Tell me. What is it?

2034
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,000
- What did you say?
- So...

2035
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,530
- Before, when I was messaging Haha,
- Yes?

2036
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,800
he said, "Myung Jae, you should
stick around for a long time."

2037
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,100
"In order to stand up
to Kim Jong Kook..."

2038
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,310
(To stand up against
Kim Jong Kook...)

2039
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,640
"In order to stand up
to Kim Jong Kook..."

2040
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:30,280
Was he the one who started it?

2041
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,780
- Hey!
- Hey.

2042
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,980
- It was his fault.
- Haha started it.

2043
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,550
(Come here.)

2044
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,220
- Hey.
- It was his fault.

2045
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,220
- Haha started it.
- It was his fault.
You punk!

2046
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,860
- Go back to your seat.
- This is an amicable team.

2047
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,890
- My goodness.
- Myung Jae and I are so close.

2048
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,090
- All right. We're through.
- I see.

2049
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,400
I just went along with him.

2050
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,430
- Haha.
- You just went along with him.

2051
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,500
- He started it.
- I see.

2052
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,670
Myung Jae just went along with you.
He isn't like that.

2053
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:53,940
- He isn't like that.
- All right.

2054
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:56,270
- Now,
- He's a scary man.

2055
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,210
the four members of the team...

2056
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,470
- will check out the products.
- What are the products?

2057
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,310
- An item that goes, "Toduc, toduc."
- Toc, toc.

2058
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,410
- Toc, toc.
- A calculator.

2059
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,950
A keyboard or a calculator.

2060
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:08,380
Would you tell us
why you wanted such an item?

2061
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,420
- I'm trying to save money.
- Okay.

2062
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,650
You're trying to save money!

2063
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,060
- Save money?
- That's good.

2064
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,360
So I began writing a general ledger.

2065
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,960
- A general ledger.
- When I do that,

2066
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,890
- it's inconvenient to use a phone.
- I see.

2067
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,830
If the typing sound is nice,

2068
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,430
it's satisfying to write
a general ledger.

2069
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,430
- That's right.
- I see.

2070
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,770
- That's why.
- That's why I want such an item.

2071
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:28,100
- That was why you added "Toc, toc."
- That's right.

2072
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,670
- Toc, toc.
- Nice.

2073
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:31,310
- Here's our item.
- It's different.

2074
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,170
"Please purchase an item
to wake us up..."

2075
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,740
- "after pulling an all-nighter."
- An item that wakes them up.

2076
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,150
We won this round.

2077
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,080
- An item to wake them up.
- They wanted to wake up.

2078
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,350
They must be very tired...

2079
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:42,850
- after pulling an all-nighter.
- That's right.

2080
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,150
Take out the item.

2081
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:45,290
Do you want to see it?

2082
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,150
- Our item is the best.
- It's so cute.

2083
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:49,190
- How cute!
- What is it?

2084
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,190
- Shin-chan.
- Our item has Shin-chan too.

2085
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,590
- How cute!
- It's Shin-chan versus Shin-chan.

2086
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,060
- What?
- Does your item have Shin-chan too?

2087
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,860
- A Shin-chan calculator.
- My goodness, really?

2088
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,060
- Gosh.
- Really?

2089
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:59,430
- This calculator...
- It's cute.

2090
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,040
It's a limited edition.

2091
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,800
- It's a limited edition.
- This calculator...

2092
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,310
- Hold on.
- It's vintage.

2093
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:05,770
Why do you keep commenting?

2094
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,610
- I shouldn't do that.
- Don't help them.

2095
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,710
That's right.

2096
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:09,710
A gavel.

2097
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:10,750
(Putting batteries
in the calculator)

2098
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,510
- It works.
- It works.

2099
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,480
- The owner said it might not work.
- The owner said that.

2100
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,120
- It makes a sound.
- "It might not work?"

2101
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,050
- "It might not work?" Unbelievable.
- "It might not work."

2102
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:20,550
(They let everyone know
that the item might be faulty.)

2103
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:21,860
- It's expensive.
- But it works.

2104
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,520
- That's just wrong.
- Listen.

2105
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,990
- It's old.
- It's vintage.

2106
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:26,190
- It's a limited edition.
- It's vintage.

2107
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:27,460
- Is it a used item?
- Actually,

2108
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,800
- this calculator is from 1993.
- It's an early model.

2109
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:32,630
- Vintage items can be faulty.
- They don't work well.

2110
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,240
Let me tell you about this item.

2111
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,640
(Let me tell you about this item.)

2112
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,940
Why isn't it working?

2113
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,910
- Don't say such a thing.
- Don't say such a thing.

2114
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,380
- Don't say such a thing.
- Seriously.

2115
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,610
- I...
- You put in the batteries wrong.

2116
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,110
Let me put in the batteries again.

2117
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,980
They can't fix it.

2118
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,750
- It doesn't work.
- Why would anyone pay for it?

2119
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,080
- It's broken.
- It's game over.

2120
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,220
This item...

2121
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,590
Your Honor!

2122
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,260
- Stay still!
- What are you doing?

2123
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,720
Stay calm.

2124
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,160
- I'm an auctioneer.
- Don't act out.

2125
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,290
I'm an auctioneer.

2126
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,930
- An auctioneer.
- I'm not a judge.

2127
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:01,460
- Isn't he a judge?
- Hey.

2128
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,200
The gavel doesn't make him a judge
automatically.

2129
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,970
To be honest, the owner said...

2130
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,970
that it might not work.

2131
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,240
- But you can have it fixed.
- That's right.

2132
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,170
- How much does it cost to fix it?
- "You can have it fixed?"

2133
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,870
- They're so irresponsible.
- "You can have it fixed?"

2134
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:14,880
- Listen.
- That's ridiculous.

2135
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,240
- "You can have it fixed?"
- Everyone.

2136
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,710
- Don't you know what vintage is?
- What is it?

2137
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,280
It'll become more expensive
as time goes on.

2138
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,520
- That's right.
- Why did you buy a vintage item?

2139
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,290
Aren't you vintage?

2140
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,550
- You're the most vintage.
- Vintage Jee.

2141
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,360
- You're vintage.
- I...

2142
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,360
Seok Jin is like a crock pot...

2143
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,260
- that's buried underground.
- As time goes on,

2144
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,990
some things become more valuable.

2145
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,060
- This item is like that.
- Will it become more valuable?

2146
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,330
We paid 80 dollars for it, right?

2147
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,000
- What?
- We paid 80 dollars for it.

2148
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,340
- What?
- It was 60 dollars.

2149
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,440
- This item...
- What?

2150
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,710
- It was 60 dollars.
- Why did you jack up the price?

2151
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,910
Why can't you go along
with my story?

2152
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,440
- It was 60 dollars.
- We never agreed on a story.

2153
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,850
Is there a tax?

2154
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,410
- You shouldn't con people.
- Unbelievable.

2155
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,280
I know that we paid 60 dollars.

2156
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,380
It was 60 dollars.

2157
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,780
- Be honest about the price.
- It was 60 dollars.

2158
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,250
- We should've raised it a bit.
- It was 60 dollars.

2159
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,450
The most important part
of the order was this.

2160
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,920
- Toc, toc.
- Toc, toc.

2161
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,590
All right. Check out how it feels.

2162
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,890
- We tried to find a fitting one.
- Check out how it feels.

2163
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:07,600
- Toc, toc.
- Toc, toc.

2164
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,760
- Check out how it feels.
- Seon Kyung, that isn't it.

2165
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,200
- Come on.
- She tilted her head.

2166
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,100
- It doesn't go, "Toc, toc."
- She tilted her head.

2167
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,270
Soo Wan doesn't have
an older sister.

2168
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,340
- She doesn't have an older sister.
- I have one.

2169
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,610
(Son Soo Wan, Director
who's in charge of Seok Jin)

2170
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,380
- Say that you don't have one.
- My goodness.

2171
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,880
Say that you don't have one.

2172
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,810
- Make him exit for five minutes.
- What are you doing?

2173
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,750
She doesn't have an older sister,
so she's lonely.

2174
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,290
So we got her an older sister
who was born in 1993.

2175
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:34,420
Why did you remove
her family member?

2176
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,590
- It isn't like that.
- Soo Wan, when were you born?

2177
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,490
- I was born in 1996.
- Then this calculator is older.

2178
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:39,630
- We'll give her an older sister.
- He got rid of her older sister.

2179
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,660
This is her older sister,

2180
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,470
- not a calculator.
- All right. Daniel.

2181
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,700
- Lastly, I'll tell you something...
- Go ahead.

2182
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,070
that'll pique your interest.

2183
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,340
It's an ordinary calculator, right?

2184
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:54,580
No, it's a broken calculator.

2185
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,340
It's a calculator
that's out of order.

2186
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,610
It's a calculator that doesn't work.

2187
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:58,610
Exactly.

2188
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,680
It might be out of order. It's okay.

2189
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,320
- He's good.
- Go on.

2190
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,080
But that isn't important.

2191
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:07,150
Let's say
you're watching TV at home...

2192
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,460
or turning on an air conditioner.

2193
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,560
The batteries might be low, right?

2194
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:14,960
Then turn it over
and open the battery box.

2195
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,600
Then you'll get batteries.

2196
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,170
- Is it a battery container?
- I don't think it helped.

2197
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,470
It's the worst.

2198
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:22,770
The batteries are new.

2199
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,540
- They're new.
- The batteries are new.

2200
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,710
- They're new.
- They're new.

2201
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,840
- We'll include a bonus.
- We'll give more batteries...

2202
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,140
as a bonus.

2203
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,980
We put a lot of effort
into bringing it here.

2204
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:33,280
We'll add that to the price,
so the starting bid is 65 dollars.

2205
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,620
(We'll add that to the price,
so the starting bid is 65 dollars.)

2206
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,150
- It's 65 dollars.
- No way.

2207
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,750
- How much is their salary?
- No way.

2208
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,150
- Are they thugs?
- I don't want it...

2209
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:40,420
even if you pay me 60 dollars.

2210
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,390
- It isn't even new.
- It's vintage.

2211
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:44,060
We discovered this item.

2212
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,060
It just looks cheap.

2213
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,930
- It's a really rare item.
- Yes.

2214
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:47,960
Seriously.

2215
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,430
- Next,
- Ours is much better.

2216
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,030
- Team Jong Kook.
- It's a cup.

2217
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,130
- Shouldn't we do that?
- Jong Kook, go ahead.

2218
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,230
Our item isn't vintage.

2219
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:54,700
- Our item...
- It's new.

2220
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,770
- It's new. There's even a box.
- Here's the most important thing.

2221
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:59,640
When you work on editing,
you're in your own space.

2222
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:02,340
Your own space...

2223
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,280
- needs to be cute.
- That's right.

2224
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,480
- It needs to be cute and pretty.
- It should please the eyes.

2225
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,480
- The items should be eye-catching.
- You don't need an ugly item...

2226
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,420
- like that nonsense.
- "Nonsense?"

2227
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,090
- It'll only collect dust.
- "Nonsense?"

2228
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,890
- It'll make your nails dirty.
- You need a cute item.

2229
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:16,560
I've been to the editing room
for filming.

2230
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,290
Having a cute item like this one...

2231
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,960
- will change the atmosphere.
- It adds to the interior design.

2232
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,160
- That's right.
- But...

2233
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,300
- you have many tumblers at home.
- Be quiet, mister!

2234
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,830
- Mister.
- They must have many.

2235
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:28,470
- You know...
- I'm sorry, but it isn't cute.

2236
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,000
- Isn't it too gruesome?
- How is it gruesome?

2237
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,440
The straw pierced the head.

2238
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,070
- It isn't cute. It's scary.
- You're wrong.

2239
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,540
- It's scary.
- Not at all.

2240
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:38,580
- Watch. This straw...
- Look at that. My goodness.

2241
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,410
- It's scary.
- Is it steel?

2242
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:43,380
- Is it steel?
- The straw went through here.

2243
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,320
You can clean it very easily.

2244
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,160
- So it won't smell bad.
- That's right.

2245
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,190
- That's right.
- It's stainless steel.

2246
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:51,290
- Yes.
- It's good for health.

2247
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,490
Is he a tumbler as well?

2248
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:53,830
- Who?
- Him.

2249
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,000
- Him?
- Yes.

2250
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,960
- Me?
- Shall we stick a straw here?

2251
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,300
- Isn't he a tumbler as well?
- No.

2252
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,300
- Thus,
- That's right.

2253
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,340
- it's very easy to clean.
- That's right.

2254
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:06,710
- It's pretty as an interior item.
- It's pretty.

2255
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,740
- It looks pretty on a desk.
- That's right.

2256
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,080
- It makes you want to drink. And...
- That's right.

2257
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:12,950
- in here...
- All right.

2258
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,480
- In here...
- In here...

2259
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:17,790
- We hid a gem.
- There's a hidden card.

2260
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:18,820
It's this one.

2261
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,520
- Take it and show it to them.
- Take it.

2262
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,790
- Let them see it.
- Yes.

2263
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,260
- This is...
- For this event,

2264
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,760
we prepared this gift.

2265
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,360
We got our photos taken.

2266
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,200
- We got the four-cut photos taken.
- Yes.

2267
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,560
We got our photos taken.

2268
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,230
(I see.)

2269
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,970
- We got them taken.
- So that you'd edit diligently,

2270
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:36,240
we glared at the camera.

2271
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,640
Let's take photos that say,
"We're watching you guys..."

2272
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,410
- and put it in the tumbler.
- Shall we get our photos taken?

2273
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,880
"We're watching you guys."

2274
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,810
"Wake up."
That'll be the meaning. Okay.

2275
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,310
We made it more valuable
with the celebrities' touch.

2276
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,050
I think they'll like it.

2277
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,220
- So...
- The celebrities you cherish...

2278
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:51,390
- Who are those celebrities?
- Us.

2279
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:54,090
So that you'd edit diligently,
we glared at the camera.

2280
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:56,060
"We're watching you guys."

2281
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,060
- "We're watching you guys."
- How is this related to waking up?

2282
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,330
- You know...
- Listen.

2283
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,000
They'll hang it in the editing room.

2284
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,600
These people edit our faces
seven days a week.

2285
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,200
- They're sick and tired of us.
- These photos are useless.

2286
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,140
- They're pretty.
- We'll sign the back.

2287
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,300
Okay.

2288
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,510
- Okay.
- These photos cost money,

2289
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,940
- but we won't charge you guys.
- Look.

2290
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,970
You can sell these photos.

2291
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,780
You can sell these photos
for quick money.

2292
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,840
- You can't sell them.
- Seriously.

2293
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,010
- They won't cost much.
- What?

2294
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,350
- "They won't cost much?"
- "They won't cost much?"

2295
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,580
- Mister.
- Fans will think that they're...

2296
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,650
- valuable.
- We don't sell a broken item.

2297
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:26,520
- It's new.
- We sell an item you can use.

2298
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,790
- There's a box.
- But...

2299
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,560
the two of you are married.

2300
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:30,860
Who?

2301
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,460
- Yes. We got married today.
- The two of us.

2302
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,890
- Why do you ask?
- We got married earlier.

2303
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,730
- No.
- Why? Do you want to see them kiss?

2304
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:37,730
- Hurry up and kiss her, Jong Kook.
- No.

2305
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,270
If you show us a kiss,
we'll admit defeat.

2306
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,500
- That's right.
- Yes.

2307
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,540
- "We'll admit defeat."
- We have a case too.

2308
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,910
- So, how much is it?
- How much is it?

2309
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:47,780
- How much is it?
- Now comes the price.

2310
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,880
- It's 60 dollars.
- It's 60 dollars.

2311
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,850
We won't make any profit.

2312
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,420
- We'll write your names.
- The starting bid is 60 dollars.

2313
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,480
The first item is the calculator.

2314
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,990
- The auction begins now.
- Okay.

2315
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,790
How much are the batteries?

2316
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,020
- We won't charge you for batteries.
- They're 80 cents.

2317
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,730
- They're 2.80 dollars.
- Batteries.

2318
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:07,030
- How much will you bid?
- I'll bid 2.80 dollars.

2319
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,030
He wants to pay
for the batteries only.

2320
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,300
- The batteries only.
- You're unbelievable.

2321
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,470
Get lost.

2322
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,600
- I can't believe that punk.
- He's wise.

2323
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:17,040
- You're good, Myung Jae.
- Myung Jae, you're good.

2324
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,910
- You're good.
- The price of the batteries only.

2325
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:23,180
The batteries are the only things
that can be used.

2326
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,580
- That's right.
- So I think that's the right price.

2327
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,880
That's what you think.

2328
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,680
- Others might think differently.
- All right.

2329
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,080
- Go ahead.
- Please make an offer.

2330
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,550
- My offer is 2.70 dollars.
- Why?

2331
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:34,290
- Why is it 2.70 dollars?
- The batteries are 2.80 dollars.

2332
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:35,720
- Seon Kyung.
- The batteries...

2333
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,090
- Unbelievable.
- She wants to rip us off.

2334
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,090
- Right now...
- I have my reasons.

2335
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:39,360
Do you think this is
an app for used goods?

2336
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,990
Do you think this is a thrift store?

2337
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,300
After I made up my mind
to save up money,

2338
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,800
I bought a calculator at Daiso
for three dollars.

2339
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,000
- Okay.
- That calculator works.

2340
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,540
- That's right.
- Why pay so much for a broken one?

2341
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,340
- She's haughty.
- Moreover,

2342
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,740
the calculator doesn't go,
"Toc, toc."

2343
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,380
I'd rather use a massage ball.

2344
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,080
- You'd rather use something else.
- "I'd rather use..."

2345
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,910
- Nice comment.
- "I'd rather use..."

2346
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:00,080
You know,

2347
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,850
- it seems like...
- It's annoying.

2348
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,880
there's a bit of a misunderstanding.

2349
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,250
- It isn't practical.
- All right.

2350
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,390
Please refrain from making
a hurtful comment.

2351
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:10,190
Please don't say something like,
"I'd rather use..."

2352
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:12,130
- Okay. Hold on.
- All right.

2353
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:13,530
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

2354
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:14,930
- He'll show you.
- When...

2355
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,230
you're tired from working hard...

2356
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:20,100
- It's game over.
- Here.

2357
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,640
You can use it for acupressure.

2358
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,640
- He went overboard.
- What?

2359
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:26,140
- You can use it for acupressure.
- He went overboard.

2360
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,440
- I won't buy it.
- He went overboard.

2361
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,180
- If you do that...
- On an app for used goods,

2362
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,580
- it'll be a rare item.
- That's right.

2363
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,280
- List it on the app then.
- It'll be over 110 dollars.

2364
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,180
- Can you list it on the app now?
- Go ahead.

2365
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,380
- Go ahead and do it.
- What? Now?

2366
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,290
- Go ahead.
- But my ratings are low.

2367
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,560
His ratings are low.

2368
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,920
- Forget it then.
- Many people shun me.

2369
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,060
Forget it then.

2370
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,760
If there are no more offers...

2371
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:48,830
- Isn't it working?
- How much?

2372
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,400
What?

2373
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:51,870
If there are no more offers...

2374
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,870
(Pressing)

2375
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:55,440
(Is it working?)

2376
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,840
(Did the broken calculator come alive?)

2377
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,540
- Is it working? Really?
- It's working!

2378
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,940
- It's because I stepped on it!
- It's working!

2379
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,110
- Is it working?
- It came alive!

2380
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,610
(The calculator that was born
in 1993 woke up.)

2381
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,220
It's because I stepped on it!

2382
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,220
- Stepping on it helped.
- It came alive.

2383
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,050
- It's working.
- Stepping on it helped.

2384
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:14,560
- All right.
- Ask them to bid again.

2385
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,960
- It works now.
- What's 76 minus 3?

2386
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,590
- It works!
- It works!

2387
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,090
- Hey, ask them to bid again.
- Again.

2388
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,600
- Bid again. It works.
- Again.

2389
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,400
- It's...
- It has Shin-chan's voice.

2390
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,700
What is it saying?

2391
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,730
Thirty-two.

2392
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,300
(The calculator suddenly talks
upon waking up.)

2393
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,470
You heard the sound.

2394
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:33,370
The older sister who was born
in 1993...

2395
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,680
- She came back alive.
- Due to anger,

2396
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,180
she woke up.

2397
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,680
- Why would you buy that?
- It works.

2398
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,980
- All right.
- Seon Kyung.

2399
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,280
- Your Honor. That came out wrong.
- Yes?

2400
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:42,580
I'll bid ten dollars.

2401
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:43,750
- Ten dollars.
- Ten dollars.

2402
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,950
- The bid went up.
- Ten dollars.

2403
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,190
- Seon Kyung, won't you save money?
- Finally.

2404
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,290
- This item...
- You're throwing money away.

2405
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:49,960
- You said you'd save money.
- Seon Kyung.

2406
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:51,560
This item is worth having.

2407
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,190
- We bought it for 60 dollars.
- This item is worth having.

2408
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,960
- Ten dollars.
- How much is it? Ten dollars.

2409
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,500
- What? Jong Seo,
- What?

2410
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,370
If Choi Daniel comes
and steps on it...

2411
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,130
if it breaks down again,

2412
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,670
- I'll bid 15 dollars.
- You'll bid 15 dollars.

2413
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:03,100
- Fifteen dollars.
- The price went up.

2414
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,370
- Since it works, the price goes up.
- I'll provide after-sales service.

2415
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:07,670
I'll provide after-sales service
for a year.

2416
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,880
- A year.
- It has been kept...

2417
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,080
- so cleanly.
- Yes.

2418
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,910
- It's worth more.
- The highest bid is 15 dollars.

2419
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:14,250
- Twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars.

2420
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,280
All right.

2421
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,350
(20 dollars!)

2422
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,290
(The bid reaches 20 dollars.)

2423
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:21,590
Finally, the auction became lively.

2424
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:22,960
Twenty dollars.

2425
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,590
- Why would anyone buy that?
- What has gotten into them?

2426
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:26,630
- All right.
- The two of them...

2427
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:27,860
(The countdown begins.)

2428
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,900
Five.

2429
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,260
- Twenty dollars, right?
- Twenty dollars.

2430
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,030
- The auctioneer is being unfair.
- Twenty dollars.

2431
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:33,800
- They're going back and forth.
- Four.

2432
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,340
- Come on. No more bids?
- Three.

2433
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,940
- Two. Seon Kyung.
- No more bids?

2434
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,170
- Sold!
- All right.

2435
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,770
Give it to her.

2436
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:43,740
- You won the item for 20 dollars.
- Today is her lucky day.

2437
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:44,980
Today is your lucky day.

2438
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,310
It's a good item.

2439
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:48,450
- It'll be more popular on the app.
- Twenty dollars.

2440
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,780
They lost so much money.

2441
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:52,850
- All right.
- That might be the main event.

2442
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,350
- Yes.
- In whose heart...

2443
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:56,820
Well, there are photos
of celebrities...

2444
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,360
who have been active
in the industry for many years.

2445
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:00,890
There are photos of celebrities...

2446
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,460
who have been active
in the industry for many years.

2447
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:04,900
Excuse me.

2448
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:07,330
- Are you an auctioneer?
- What's up with that comment?

2449
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,600
- Are you an auctioneer?
- What?

2450
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,300
- You should be fair.
- What kind of a comment is that?

2451
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,070
- Seriously.
- Make a positive comment.

2452
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:14,710
- Make a positive comment.
- Call us the hottest celebrities.

2453
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,640
In any case,
they're popular celebrities...

2454
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,610
who have been active for many years.

2455
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:21,350
- There are photos of them.
- Photos.

2456
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:23,780
- The item is a Shin-chan tumbler.
- Shin-chan.

2457
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,120
- It's so cute.
- It's so cute.

2458
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,520
- It's so cute.
- All right. Myung Jae.

2459
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,120
- Make an offer like the last time.
- Okay.

2460
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,160
It's okay. Go ahead and say it.
We'll listen.

2461
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,220
We'll listen.

2462
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,060
- Promise not to get angry.
- Don't be angry.

2463
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,490
- Why would we get angry?
- You're a customer.

2464
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,130
- Ten...
- Give me a break.

2465
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,730
Are you insane?

2466
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,430
Hey, this is new.

2467
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,230
- You saw the price.
- Are you insane?

2468
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:42,400
You promised not to get angry.

2469
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,640
- Watch what you say.
- I'm sorry.

2470
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,940
- What he said was so annoying.
- We can show the receipt.

2471
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,210
Watch what you say.

2472
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:50,210
- I wasn't done.
- Ten dollars for that?

2473
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,380
Eighteen dollars.

2474
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:54,010
Since it's an auction,
we'll accept that.

2475
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,850
- Eighteen dollars.
- Let's see what happens.

2476
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:56,880
- Five.
- Good.

2477
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,490
- Four.
- Hold on! Mister!

2478
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:00,990
- I can't believe this man.
- What's wrong with you?

2479
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:03,260
- Drag it out for 30 minutes.
- I can't believe this man.

2480
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,060
- Drag it out for 30 minutes.
- What was that?

2481
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,290
- "Five, four?"
- Seriously.

2482
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:07,430
Drag it out for 30 minutes.

2483
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:08,700
- What's wrong with you?
- All right.

2484
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,960
- Promote the item.
- All right.

2485
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,200
You spent over 30 minutes
on the calculator.

2486
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,200
- All right.
- Seriously.

2487
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,730
- "Five, four, three, two, one?"
- I can't believe these people.

2488
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,370
- Who are you to say that?
- You guys are rough.

2489
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:17,440
- All right.
- Please sit down.

2490
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,940
We can't sit down.

2491
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,670
- We need to run out again.
- My goodness.

2492
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,180
We have 18 dollars.

2493
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:23,310
- Come on.
- What?

2494
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:26,380
- Yes?
- Seventeen dollars.

2495
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,080
- My goodness. What?
- Why...

2496
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,320
- Why did the bid go down?
- This is an auction.

2497
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,750
- Don't you know how an auction works?
- Mister, it should go up.

2498
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,990
- Don't you know how an auction works?
- Hold on. Mister.

2499
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,920
- It needs to go up.
- Seon Kyung.

2500
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,060
Why did you lower the price?

2501
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,490
Haven't you tried an auction?

2502
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,360
- All right.
- When you scan the QR code,

2503
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,200
you'll be directed
to a video we filmed.

2504
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,230
There's a video of them kissing.
You'll be able to see it.

2505
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:48,870
It'll be exclusive.

2506
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,400
(Does the auction item come
with a special feature?)

2507
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,610
(Will the kissing video of Jong Kook
and Ji Hyo wake them up?)

2508
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,540
Did you guys kiss or not?

2509
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,380
- Hey, you guys can use it.
- You guys kissed.

2510
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,540
- Seriously.
- It'll be exclusive.

2511
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,910
- Nineteen dollars.
- Nineteen dollars.

2512
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,250
- Nineteen dollars.
- Twenty dollars.

2513
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,950
- That's good.
- Twenty dollars.

2514
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,480
- Hey.
- Twenty dollars.

2515
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,390
- Twenty-two dollars.
- Twenty-two dollars.

2516
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:07,090
- Twenty-three dollars.
- Twenty-three dollars.

2517
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,120
Twenty-five dollars.

2518
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,290
Twenty-five dollars. Good.

2519
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:11,560
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Don't promise what doesn't exist.

2520
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,930
- It exists.
- There's a video.

2521
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:13,990
- Don't lie.
- There's a video.

2522
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,100
- It exists.
- They kissed.

2523
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,200
- Listen.
- Why would you lie?

2524
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,270
- It exists.
- Children watch this show.

2525
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,170
- Five...
- Seon Kyung.

2526
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:21,600
- Yes?
- I bid 25 dollars.

2527
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,600
- Gosh!
- My goodness.
- I bid 25 dollars.
- Gosh!

2528
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,070
(The tumbler and kissing video
lead to the starting bid.)

2529
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:27,940
- Jong Kook, wait.
- Hey, come here.

2530
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,080
- My goodness.
- Hey, why did you suddenly...

2531
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,950
- Hey.
- How is he so bad at auctioning?

2532
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,280
- Hey. The two of them...
- How is he so bad at auctioning?

2533
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,620
(Shuddering)

2534
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:38,620
What?

2535
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:41,150
- Three, two, one.
- That's insane.

2536
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,460
- You won the bid.
- You won the bid.

2537
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:43,920
- You won the bid.
- Hold on.

2538
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:46,960
(Jae Seok closes the bid hurriedly
so that the price doesn't go up.)

2539
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,200
- You counted so quickly.
- You counted so quickly.

2540
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,330
- Seriously.
- You won the bid.

2541
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,130
- Twenty-five dollars.
- They've worked for many years.

2542
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,240
You know, it's really funny.
We bought it for 60 dollars.

2543
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,440
It's expensive.

2544
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,040
- Why are we happy with 25 dollars?
- Why are we happy?

2545
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,970
We took a big loss.

2546
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,840
- This is driving me crazy.
- It's time...

2547
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,250
- for the next team, Team Cameramen.
- Next.

2548
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,310
Team Cameramen.

2549
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,520
We should get an item
that suits Kang Chan Hee.

2550
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,790
- It's this one. He needs it...
- Yes.

2551
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:14,690
- to stay at the center.
- That's right.

2552
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:17,090
- It gives him the cameraman vibe.
- He should wear it.

2553
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:19,330
It's insane.

2554
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,790
"Cut!"

2555
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,600
- Here.
- You might be warm.

2556
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,930
It'll keep the ears
from getting sunburnt.

2557
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,830
(A hat set that puts him anywhere
between 6 months and 60 years)

2558
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:28,540
- My goodness.
- He's the boss.

2559
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,300
- His ears might get sunburnt.
- Perfect.

2560
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,400
- Here.
- My goodness.

2561
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,470
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Twenty-five dollars.

2562
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:33,870
(The item was 32.50 dollars.
He won the bid for 25 dollars.)

2563
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,980
- We did pretty well
- Yes.

2564
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,480
- We focused on the camouflage.
- Camouflage.

2565
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,150
Let's say you need to enter
a forest.

2566
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,720
If you wear this,
you'll become invisible.

2567
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,520
- But...
- A hunter might come and shoot you.

2568
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,990
(It's the pheasant jacket
they had dibs on.)

2569
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:51,020
- It goes well with the hat.
- It goes well with the hat.

2570
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,160
- It's unity.
- My goodness.

2571
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,930
(The human mannequin
pulls off all items.)

2572
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:57,000
- Twenty dollars.
- Twenty dollars.

2573
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,270
- Two...
- Thirty dollars.

2574
01:19:58,270 --> 01:19:59,970
- Hold on.
- Why...

2575
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:02,300
- Why did you raise the bid?
- There was no competition.

2576
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,100
You could buy it for a cheap price.

2577
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,840
Are you fighting against yourself?

2578
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,680
- What was that?
- There was no competition.

2579
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,180
- I like it.
- I mean...

2580
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,010
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty dollars.

2581
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:13,480
(They make profits
for the very first time.)

2582
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,720
- It's too...
- You can take it.

2583
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,980
- It's time for the last team,
- You turned it into a documentary.

2584
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,690
Team Stylists.

2585
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:22,320
- Team Stylists, come on in.
- Team Stylists.

2586
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,990
We're confident about this one.

2587
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,590
Team Stylists.

2588
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,190
Min Hee is coming.

2589
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:28,500
- Is Min Hee coming?
- Min Hee is coming.

2590
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,230
(Seok Jin's stylist,
Min Hee is on the team.)

2591
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,530
- Min Hee is coming.
- We need Min Hee.

2592
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,670
- We need Min Hee.
- Min Gi too.

2593
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,170
- My goodness.
- There's Ji Seon too.

2594
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,240
- There's Ji Seon too.
- All right.

2595
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,900
- Lee Joo Eun.
- Ji Seon.

2596
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,940
Ji Seon has worked...

2597
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,440
- with Jong Kook...
- Yes.

2598
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,580
- They go way back.
- for many years.

2599
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,050
I don't wear fancy clothes,

2600
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,550
- so she wears them...
- Yes.

2601
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,780
- every week.
- I see.

2602
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:49,550
Why did you come this week?

2603
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:51,850
Jong Kook's outfit is the same
as last week.

2604
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:53,950
- She gave me a vest.
- I gave him a vest.

2605
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,290
- A vest.
- Yes.

2606
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,590
Min Hee, thank you...

2607
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,590
- for joining us today.
- Okay.

2608
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:02,260
- You're Seok Jin's stylist.
- Yes.

2609
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:03,800
- Yes, I am.
- We've worked together for years.

2610
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:06,100
His stylist, Min Hee is too ahead...

2611
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,470
(Min Hee is too ahead of her time!)

2612
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,200
(She gives Seok Jin
the style of the 22nd century.)

2613
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,340
(She has been responsible
for 70 percent of the opening.)

2614
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,980
- Min Hee and I go back 20 years.
- Yes.

2615
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,310
It has been a while.

2616
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:20,650
- We parted ways for a while.
- We're really thankful for Min Hee.

2617
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:22,250
- Yes.
- We've talked about it.

2618
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,850
After styling Seok Jin for a while,

2619
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,990
- she quit since she was busy.
- That's right.

2620
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:28,220
- Then she went back to Seok Jin.
- I asked her to help me.

2621
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,520
Many stylists don't travel...

2622
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,860
- for individuals.
- That's right.

2623
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32,660
- That's right.
- Min Hee does it for Seok Jin.

2624
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,690
- Yes.
- She does it for Seok Jin.

2625
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:38,130
What do you focus on the most
when you style Seok Jin?

2626
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,870
I always focus on the trends.

2627
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:41,430
I see.

2628
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,270
- Trends.
- Trends?

2629
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:44,870
- She follows the trends.
- She's sensitive about the trends.

2630
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:46,040
- Trends.
- Trends?

2631
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,740
- Trends.
- Trends.

2632
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,640
Look at my outfit of the day.

2633
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,180
- Okay?
- The pens add a detail.

2634
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,850
- All right.
- She's good.

2635
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:57,020
What's the hardest thing
about styling Seok Jin?

2636
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,850
The hardest thing is...

2637
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:00,150
Does he complain too much?

2638
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:02,090
- Don't cry.
- There must be many hardships.

2639
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:03,920
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

2640
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,390
Don't let them take control.

2641
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:08,800
Even though he's going to wear
the outfit anyway...

2642
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,860
- Does he complain?
- He complains a lot.

2643
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,270
Hey.

2644
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:15,640
I do that when it's too much.
You bring Heung Bu's pants at times.

2645
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,370
Seok Jin, stop fighting.

2646
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,610
All right.

2647
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,840
Lee Joo Eun.

2648
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,740
- She's famous.
- Joo Eun...

2649
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,440
- Questions for Lee Joo Eun.
- What do you have?

2650
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,050
- I have a question.
- Yes.

2651
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:28,950
Does Jae Seok still wear
size XS underwear?

2652
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,050
No.

2653
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,090
- That's...
- Is that true?

2654
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:34,050
- I was just curious.
- What are you talking about?

2655
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,220
I wear size L.

2656
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,620
- Size L.
- You wear a loose one.

2657
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,060
- Size XS.
- It's a comfortable size.

2658
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,460
- Size XS...
- It's a wide-fit underwear.

2659
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,730
- It fits you.
- Yes.

2660
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,900
It fits me well.

2661
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,630
Is there something
you find difficult?

2662
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:47,930
I always have fun in my work.

2663
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,700
- Hold on.
- Of course,

2664
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,100
- she would have fun.
- She answered...

2665
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,240
- before the question ended.
- She can't speak honestly.

2666
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,640
It's natural that Joo Eun
is having fun...

2667
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,340
Tell us something
you get annoyed about.

2668
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,340
Is there anything?
(Mr. Good Deed's hidden side?)

2669
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,950
- I really...
- Talk with the hammer down.

2670
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,180
Talk with the hammer down.

2671
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,320
You're asking while holding...

2672
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:06,620
- the hammer.
- I'm sorry.

2673
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,620
There's a misunderstanding.

2674
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,320
- Goodness.
- That's a misunderstanding.

2675
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,760
- Let's listen to her.
- You may speak.

2676
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,660
He gives me newsprint to read.

2677
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:15,230
- Newsprint?
- Books as well.

2678
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:16,300
- Newsprint?
- Newsprint?

2679
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,460
- You mean newspaper?
- Joo Eun.

2680
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,170
- Newspaper?
- Newspaper?

2681
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,430
- Newspapers, not newsprint, right?
- Newspapers?

2682
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:21,840
- Yes.
- They're newsprint to her.

2683
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,500
- It's not...
- Because she doesn't read them.

2684
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,110
- Yes.
- I often tell her,

2685
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:27,470
"You should read them too, Joo Eun."

2686
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:29,180
- She looks at the newspaper.
- She does.

2687
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:32,080
She looks at it in the folded state.

2688
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,550
(Joo Eun isn't easy to handle.)

2689
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,250
It would be tough for her.

2690
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:38,420
We have four stylists here,

2691
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:40,090
and they had requests.

2692
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,550
- You have it, right?
- What do you have?

2693
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:42,860
It was really tough getting this.

2694
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:44,020
- Seongsu-dong...
- What did you bring?

2695
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,560
We found it at a vintage shop
in Seongsu-dong.

2696
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,500
We found one with vibrant colors.

2697
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,400
- Spring is here.
- If Seok Jin wears this...

2698
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,070
at the opening next week,
it will be a hit.

2699
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,340
- It would be good on Jae Seok too.
- It would be good on Jae Seok too.

2700
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:59,710
If you buy it at a high price,
I'll wear it at the next opening.

2701
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:01,370
I'll wear it at the next opening.

2702
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,740
(The icon of simple outfits
promises to wear it.)

2703
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,810
- Really?
- You'll wear it?

2704
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:05,280
- Of course.
- You wouldn't be able to button up.

2705
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,980
- Show it to us.
- It's pretty.

2706
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,050
It looks pretty.

2707
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:09,520
- We're not trying to be funny.
- It's pretty.

2708
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,820
- Seriously.
- It's pretty.

2709
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:12,120
- It has a colorful print.
- We got it at a vintage shop.

2710
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,020
We got it from Seongsu-dong.
At a vintage shop.

2711
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:15,460
- It's pretty.
- We're not trying to be funny.

2712
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,990
- It's pretty.
- It's pretty.

2713
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,760
(It's a design
that puts them up for a challenge.)

2714
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,990
- Seongsu-dong.
- We got it at a vintage shop.

2715
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:21,230
- At a vintage shop.
- It's a shirt.

2716
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:22,830
- Come on.
- It's a bit...

2717
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,100
It looks normal.

2718
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,970
- It wouldn't fit a bulky person.
- I...

2719
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:29,300
Does this fit Jong Kook?

2720
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,670
- I can fit in it somehow.
- Is it the right size?

2721
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:31,910
He can fit in it.

2722
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:32,910
- But the size...
- It looks nice.

2723
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:35,710
(How will you style that?)

2724
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:39,080
I gained some weight recently.

2725
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,280
- But it has such a great texture...
- Goodness.

2726
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,550
(Haha's stylist)

2727
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:45,020
It just goes in. Does it look bad?

2728
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,250
- It's small.
- Take it off.

2729
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:48,660
- I...
- Don't do it.

2730
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,320
- Give it to Ji Hyo.
- It's really pretty, though.

2731
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,830
- It's pretty.
- Let Ji Hyo wear it.

2732
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:53,260
- Haha.
- I think it would look good...

2733
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,630
- with dark blue jeans.
- Haha.

2734
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:57,460
If Min Ji brings that to you,
will you wear it...

2735
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,470
- Okay.
- without complaining?

2736
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:00,500
- Of course.
- Really?

2737
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,530
I'd be really thankful.

2738
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:02,970
- Yes.
- It's so pretty.

2739
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:05,710
It could look tight on men,

2740
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:06,940
- but on women,
- It's really pretty.

2741
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,710
you could just wear it
on top of a white shirt...

2742
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:10,980
- and go around.
- Hey.

2743
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,110
- It won't work on you, either.
- It won't?

2744
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:15,010
- This...
- It...

2745
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,320
Ji Hyo.

2746
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,750
- It's not bad.
- It makes you look fat.

2747
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,720
- Right. It makes you look fat.
- It makes you look fat.

2748
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,960
- It makes you look fat.
- It makes you look fat.

2749
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,160
- It does make you look fat.
- It makes you look fat.

2750
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,460
- No. It's pretty.
- It makes you look fat.

2751
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,460
Okay. It's pretty.

2752
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,560
- Is this the only one?
- The price would be important.

2753
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,700
- The price.
- The price.

2754
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,460
Vintage clothes
are expensive these days.

2755
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,970
- Yes.
- We asked for a discount...

2756
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,330
- and bought it for 30 dollars.
- The starting price is 30 dollars.

2757
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,630
- We'll start at 30 dollars.
- It's 6.8 dollars.

2758
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,200
- We'll start at 30 dollars.
- Really?

2759
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,440
Thirty dollars?

2760
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,910
It was bought
at a vintage shop in Seongsu-dong.

2761
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:40,270
It was really hard to get it.

2762
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,540
It's really nice.

2763
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:42,940
You can show us.

2764
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,240
- First...
- No.

2765
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,550
- You can start first.
- Right.

2766
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:47,980
You asked for an item
that stands out.

2767
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,720
- Something that stands out.
- Yes.

2768
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,350
(Team Stylists: An item
that makes the star stand out)

2769
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,290
This is the one.

2770
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:55,260
- In my case...
- It stands out.

2771
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,290
It stands out.

2772
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:57,320
(G-Dragon's pink side hair)

2773
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,860
(He's a celebrity!)

2774
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:02,300
- Your celebrity will always...
- It's hard not to see this.

2775
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,460
It looks bad.

2776
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,130
Your celebrity
would always stand out.

2777
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,100
- It's an item for that.
- It makes him stand out.

2778
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,470
- They put in no effort.
- Right. There was no effort.

2779
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,800
They put in no effort.

2780
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,370
- It's undignified.
- And...

2781
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:15,140
- Hold on.
- This is for Min Hee.

2782
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,510
- Seriously.
- It's a critical item.

2783
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:17,510
It's a critical item.

2784
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:18,950
- This...
- This is a critical item.

2785
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:21,050
You can meet Seok Sam
as a boy with this.

2786
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,220
Take a look.

2787
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,480
Seok Sam as a boy.
I'm looking forward to this.

2788
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,550
But why are they using
the oldest member?

2789
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:28,350
They're ruining him.

2790
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,060
Take a look at Seok Sam, the boy.

2791
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,760
It's done.

2792
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:36,760
(Where is the eldest brother?)

2793
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:42,040
(It's a popular item
that captivated...)

2794
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,940
(Seok Jin's stylist
and the production crew.)

2795
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:48,470
Woo Jong! Jo Woo Jong.

2796
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,540
- Yes?
- He's Jo Woo Jong.

2797
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,280
- He's Jo Woo Jong.
- That's amazing.

2798
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,080
This is amazing.

2799
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,480
(Pure and innocent)

2800
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,850
He really looks young.

2801
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:58,920
- Seriously.
- Right.

2802
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,750
He really...

2803
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:01,750
(An amazing change made by a wig!)

2804
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:02,760
Jae Seok.

2805
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:06,630
- It's great.
- I wore it.

2806
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:10,000
- You look good.
- It looks natural, Seok Jin.

2807
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,270
I wasn't impressed
with Jae Seok's item,

2808
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:14,370
- but this one...
- This one is really...

2809
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:17,440
You don't need to do anything else
if you have this item.

2810
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,440
- I mean...
- Seriously.

2811
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,910
- you don't need anything.
- Right.

2812
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,910
- Seriously.
- Even in this outfit.

2813
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:23,540
- It brings youth.
- You can find...

2814
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,450
- your youth back.
- The top of your head...

2815
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:28,280
is right here,
but it still looks good.

2816
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,720
- I mean...
- The crown of the head is here.

2817
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,350
I think I wore it
the other way around.

2818
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:34,120
- In that case...
- That's right.

2819
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,190
Right.

2820
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:38,390
You can put it on top like this
to create a new style.

2821
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:40,160
- Yes.
- The wig is amazing.

2822
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:41,760
This is a new style.

2823
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,030
This looks different.

2824
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:48,070
- There are two styles.
- Seriously.

2825
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:49,500
You have to get this.

2826
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,370
- It looks natural.
- So I...

2827
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:52,840
asked for the business card.

2828
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:57,140
- I'll order one one day...
- You can't tell.

2829
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:58,910
I'll order one
and wear it at the opening.

2830
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:00,850
- Does it have clips?
- That's right.

2831
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,180
I just put it on top.

2832
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,950
- He's Seok Sam, the boy.
- It looks natural.

2833
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:04,980
Seok Sam, the boy.

2834
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,390
From a distance,
he looks like an idol.

2835
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:08,820
- That's right.
- Yes.

2836
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:11,360
- He's a SHINee member.
- Yes. It makes you look...

2837
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,090
- 30 years younger.
- But the clothes...

2838
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:14,190
- If he wore a different outfit...
- Even when...

2839
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:15,260
- I wore this outfit.
- He's a SHINee member.

2840
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,300
Give us the yellow one
we saw earlier.

2841
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,700
- Seriously.
- This...

2842
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,330
It's because of the color
of the clothes he's wearing now.

2843
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:21,330
Yes. It's a bit...

2844
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,700
Are you giving this to me
because you think it's cool?

2845
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,940
- This is the only one we have.
- Do you think it's cool?

2846
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,440
Let's see.

2847
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:29,210
Look.

2848
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:30,640
(Stop there, SHINee!)

2849
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:34,050
Look at him from a distance.
He looks like an idol.

2850
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:35,820
- Look at him from a distance.
- Seriously.

2851
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,350
He looks like an idol.
You wouldn't be able to tell.

2852
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:38,650
You wouldn't be able to tell.

2853
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:39,890
- Try...
- Seok Jin.

2854
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,350
Could you call my name?

2855
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:42,460
- Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin.

2856
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:43,490
Seok Jin.

2857
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,430
(Seok Jin)

2858
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:49,130
(Hello, producers!)

2859
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:52,270
(The national younger brother
who will surely make you a fan)

2860
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:54,830
- Good.
- This is the item.

2861
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,840
- This is so funny.
- You should really buy this.

2862
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,240
- Seriously.
- Do I look different?

2863
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,740
- It doesn't look like a wig.
- It's so funny.

2864
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:03,380
- It's really amazing.
- We discovered a treasure.

2865
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,180
- This is a treasure.
- It is.

2866
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:07,010
- It was meant for Seok Sam.
- It's crazy.

2867
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,450
It really makes no sense.

2868
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:10,820
I rented it.

2869
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,820
(He adds a hairpiece.)

2870
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:14,220
(He automatically
puts on an idol smile.)

2871
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,860
- This is what an idol is.
- Right. This is an idol.

2872
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,120
You two could be friends.

2873
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,130
- I know, right?
- It's not that much.

2874
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:20,760
Seok Jin seems younger.

2875
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,600
- Stop teasing him.
- That's not true.

2876
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,430
- Stop it.
- But he really looks young.

2877
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,870
(Goodness)

2878
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:27,500
It's really fascinating.

2879
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:30,100
- He likes it.
- He likes it.

2880
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,770
- He likes how he looks.
- How is this possible?

2881
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,910
This is actually quite expensive.

2882
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:36,940
- Yes. It's expensive.
- But...

2883
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:37,940
- It's expensive.
- we'll use the rental price.

2884
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:40,080
- We rented it.
- You rented it?

2885
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,010
- It was rented.
- It was rented.

2886
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,150
- We rented it for 50 dollars.
- Yes. Fifty dollars.

2887
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,450
- You can rent it again.
- It was made for Seok Sam.

2888
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:48,390
- It's a custom wig.
- It suits him so well.

2889
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:50,090
- Team Jong Kook.
- Yes.

2890
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:51,620
We'll start with the shirt.

2891
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:54,030
- The starting price is 30 dollars.
- It's 30 dollars.

2892
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:56,060
- We'll begin.
- It's pretty. Ours is genuine.

2893
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:58,030
- We won't say anymore.
- The starting price is 30 dollars.

2894
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,270
We'll begin the auction.

2895
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,440
Take a look at it.

2896
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,300
It's a style that Joo Eun likes.

2897
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:05,640
You know it.

2898
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:07,240
You like this.

2899
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,640
You like it.
Imagine Jae Seok wearing this.

2900
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,180
If you think 30 dollars
isn't a good price,

2901
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,250
- you can suggest the price...
- You can do that.

2902
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,680
you want.

2903
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:17,980
- Ji Seon.
- How much?

2904
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:21,550
Will you really wear it next week
if I buy it?

2905
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:22,860
I will.

2906
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:23,860
(Clenching his teeth)

2907
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,460
- I'll wear it.
- With jeans?

2908
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,860
- What?
- With jeans?

2909
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:28,860
(He even decides to give up
the all-black outfit to sell it.)

2910
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,730
- Ji Seon.
- Five dollars.

2911
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:32,270
Five dollars.

2912
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:33,730
Do you think I'd wear it
for five dollars?

2913
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,740
- Five dollars.
- For that amount of money?

2914
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,400
- Five dollars.
- Five dollars.

2915
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,310
- Right. We'll see.
- Five dollars.

2916
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:40,370
Yes?

2917
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:42,040
I bid 5.5 dollars.

2918
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,140
You bid 5.5 dollars?

2919
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,980
- But...
- Imagine him wearing this...

2920
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:46,450
- She's stingy.
- with that wig.

2921
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:49,250
This shirt would be perfect
with that wig.

2922
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,280
Let's make him wear it with the wig.

2923
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,620
- Wear it with the wig.
- Just once, Min Hee.

2924
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,890
So, we have 5.5 dollars.

2925
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,260
(Raising his hand)

2926
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:57,760
Thirty...

2927
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,660
(Will there be a large offer?)

2928
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,360
dollars is too much.

2929
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,360
Yes. How much do you offer?

2930
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,400
- Six dollars.
- Six dollars?

2931
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,400
Six dollars.

2932
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:06,230
- I could wear this next week.
- Six dollars.

2933
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:08,000
- Right. Haha could wear it.
- I can wear it.

2934
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:10,200
(That moment)

2935
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,940
- Six dollars.
- Right. Haha could wear it.

2936
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,810
(Raising)

2937
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:17,380
(He auctions it,
worried that his stylist would bid.)

2938
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,350
- Hey.
- It just began!

2939
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,750
- What...
- What are you saying?

2940
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,850
- What are you doing?
- Joo Eun was about to bid.

2941
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,650
- Wait...
- Joo Eun...

2942
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:26,750
- This is not right.
- This is too...

2943
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:28,190
- Congratulations.
- This is too...

2944
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:29,260
- Six dollars.
- Congratulations.

2945
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,020
This is a failure.

2946
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:32,660
It looked good on you.

2947
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:34,360
- It looked good on you.
- But...

2948
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,490
- Six dollars.
- It should be at least ten dollars.

2949
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,660
- Right.
- It was a reasonable price.

2950
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,630
Six dollars. Haha has to wear it
next week. Yes.

2951
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:42,640
- Next...
- It was stolen.

2952
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,640
- We'll start with the wig.
- The wig.

2953
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,740
We'll start with 50 dollars.
Fifty dollars!

2954
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:48,210
You can go lower than that.
You can start from five dollars.

2955
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:50,180
You can offer a price you want.

2956
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,450
Five, four, yes.

2957
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:56,720
Do you really like that wig,
Seok Jin?

2958
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,720
Yes.

2959
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,850
I could wear it at the opening.

2960
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:01,050
What's the matter, Min Hee?

2961
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,560
(Seok Sam seriously doesn't want
to lose the youth item.)

2962
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,390
You can style it.

2963
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,530
- Do you think he really likes it?
- You could be a wig model.

2964
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,360
I think he does.

2965
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:11,960
How is this possible?

2966
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:15,270
- You could be a wig model.
- Seriously.

2967
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:17,570
I didn't even clip it.
I just placed it on my head.

2968
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:18,870
Right!

2969
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:20,210
(My star is so excited.)

2970
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:23,840
Okay. Five. Four.

2971
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,180
How much?

2972
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:29,120
- Ten dollars.
- Ten dollars.

2973
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,120
- That's too expensive.
- Ten dollars.

2974
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,650
- Who would buy that?
- That's it.

2975
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,790
Are you going to make me wear that?

2976
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:37,460
- That's nice.
- Take it. Put it on him.

2977
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:38,660
Put it on him! Joo Eun!

2978
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:39,760
- Are you trying to...
- Raise your hand!

2979
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:41,630
- Are you trying to make me wear it?
- Raise your hand!

2980
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:43,900
- Please think about it carefully.
- But I am curious...

2981
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,770
- to see Jae Seok with a fringe.
- Oh, right.

2982
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,970
- All right.
- With his fringe down?

2983
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:49,600
- Five.
- I'll bid...

2984
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,200
- seventeen dollars.
- Seventeen dollars.

2985
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,210
- Why did you raise it so much?
- The price goes up to 17.

2986
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:54,370
I don't get it.

2987
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:57,440
(She just can't forget about
this sight to be able to give up.)

2988
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,550
- I'll bid 21 dollars and...
- That's 21 dollars.

2989
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:01,010
- And?
- And a freebie?

2990
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,820
- A freebie?
- What freebie? This?

2991
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,120
- Do you want free dumplings?
- This is a freebie.

2992
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,290
- This is a freebie.
- A freebie.

2993
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,290
We'll throw this in too.

2994
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,390
- It's three dollars.
- Yes, this one too.

2995
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:11,460
- All right.
- This is a highlight.

2996
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,130
We'll throw in the highlight
as a freebie.

2997
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:14,830
So, 21 dollars.

2998
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,460
No other bids?

2999
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:18,930
- Just bang the gavel.
- Five. Four.

3000
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,100
- Three. Two.
- What's up with you, seriously?

3001
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,640
Sold to Jee Seok Sam!

3002
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,170
(Sold for 21 dollars)

3003
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,040
Thank you.

3004
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:31,140
- Min Hee bought it for 21 dollars.
- Right.

3005
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3006
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:34,380
Yes, I'll see you like this
for next week's opening.

3007
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,720
Thank you so much
to our four stylists.

3008
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,920
- Thank you.
- Okay!

3009
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:40,650
The auction is now over.

3010
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:43,060
The total amount left is...

3011
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:45,730
For Team Jae Seok,
you have 120.7 dollars.

3012
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:47,060
- We have 120.7 dollars?
- Yes.

3013
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,590
What is this?

3014
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:50,230
They had a huge loss over there.

3015
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:53,030
- Team Jong Kook has 95 dollars.
- Gosh, we...

3016
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,670
But there's the price
of the items themselves.

3017
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:57,100
This isn't easy.

3018
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,110
We're ruined.

3019
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,610
Gosh, this is hard.

3020
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:02,210
With your final profits,

3021
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:04,240
you can purchase spaces
on the roulette to decide...

3022
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,810
- between good and bad luck.
- Okay.

3023
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:09,320
There are 12 spaces on the roulette.

3024
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:12,850
You can purchase each space
for 20 dollars.

3025
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:16,320
One representative will shoot
a dart gun on the spinning roulette.

3026
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,520
The team where the dart lands...

3027
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,430
- will be the winner.
- Sounds good.

3028
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:22,460
Team Jae Seok can buy six spaces.

3029
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:26,130
- Team Jong Kook, four spaces.
- Not bad.

3030
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,830
- Nice.
- What are these two?

3031
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:28,930
- They're just empty.
- Just empty?

3032
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:30,470
Let's go for it.
This will be the stroke of brilliance.

3033
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:31,540
Play rock-paper-scissors.

3034
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,270
- We have to shoot our team's name?
- Yes.

3035
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:35,010
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

3036
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:36,180
Okay!

3037
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:37,580
- Do we shoot?
- You can do it.

3038
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:39,610
- Oh, okay. I'll shoot.
- It's you. We're Team Jong Kook.

3039
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:40,610
- Here I go.
- Okay, here it goes.

3040
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:43,120
- If you miss, you'll take turns.
- Oh, okay.

3041
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:45,080
- There you go.
- All right!

3042
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,450
Here it goes!

3043
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,460
It stuck.

3044
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:54,360
(Which team will be
the ultimate winner?)

3045
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,430
- My gosh.
- Hey, bullseye.

3046
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:58,630
- Nice.
- I got ten points.

3047
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,400
- Nice.
- I got ten points.

3048
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,600
- We have to hit ours for the prize.
- Pink.

3049
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,270
(Team Jae Seok takes the gun
right away.)

3050
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,410
(Team Jae Seok has 2 more spaces.)

3051
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:11,510
(Will they be able to win?)

3052
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,410
- It's ours!
- It's our team!

3053
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:17,320
(He hits Team Jong Kook.)

3054
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,750
- It's ours!
- It's our team!

3055
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:20,820
You're right!

3056
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:22,820
(Team Jong Kook ultimately wins
at the hand of Jae Seok.)

3057
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:23,890
Awesome!

3058
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:27,260
- Team Jong Kook wins.
- Okay!

3059
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:37,770
(Team Jae Seok worked hard all day
only to lose at the end.)

3060
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,270
Is that the end?

3061
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:41,540
- Is that really the end?
- This is it?

3062
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,610
- It ends in vain like this?
- This is great!

3063
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:44,840
Running Man!

3064
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,350
- What is this?
- I was trying to hit this.

3065
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:49,720
- I know. This is...
- What is this? This is so futile.

3066
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:52,450
- This is awesome.
- Today's winning prize is...

3067
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:55,350
Onnuri gift certificates
worth 300 dollars.

3068
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,360
Gosh, thank you.

3069
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:58,560
Hey, those are so...

3070
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,060
- Gosh, you didn't have to...
- That's awesome.

3071
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:03,460
And since Team Jae Seok
had bad luck,

3072
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:07,270
you must smash three gourds each
as a penalty before going home.

3073
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:08,930
- Three gourds?
- On their heads like this?

3074
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,100
- That's simple, Jae Seok.
- Bring them in.

3075
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:13,110
Gosh, that really hurts
if you smash it the wrong way.

3076
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:15,440
- You should smash it on the wig.
- No.

3077
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,310
- Do these break easily?
- How do we break them?

3078
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,410
- Just on your head?
- It just breaks if you smash it.

3079
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:21,780
- Does it break if you smash it?
- I haven't done this in a while.

3080
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:23,120
- You have to swing hard.
- This is scary.

3081
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,650
- I've never done this before.
- Don't hesitate.

3082
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:25,820
- You've never done it before?
- No.

3083
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:26,990
You have to do it in one swing.

3084
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:29,520
- That's one.
- One.

3085
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,190
(In pain)

3086
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,860
Here comes the laughter!

3087
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,030
Don't be scared.

3088
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,430
(He fails twice in a row.)

3089
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:42,100
You have to swing harder!

3090
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,800
Go harder!

3091
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:46,410
Use the snap of your wrist.
Don't be scared. You're scared now.

3092
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:47,670
But I wasn't scared.

3093
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:49,140
Do you want me to do it for you?

3094
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:51,740
- You weren't scared, but you are.
- There you go.

3095
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,010
- It's okay when it breaks.
- That's it.

3096
01:36:56,950 --> 01:37:00,290
(The members wait for someone
in a room?)

3097
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:01,690
(KAI, Kim Ah Young)

3098
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,990
(Today, they're having
a couple's race with these guys.)

3099
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:07,190
(Flirting without even taking
a breath to become a couple)

3100
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:08,190
Do you think I'm not here?

3101
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:10,530
We're just suffering.
And we can't even get it right.

3102
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:15,230
(Somehow, a path to suffering
unfolds as they become couples.)

3103
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:16,670
Am I single?

3104
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:20,140
(Today is Black Day,
a day when singletons are the king.)

3105
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,210
(Today, the singleton's word is
the authority and the law!)

3106
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:23,780
Getting slapped in Jongno.

3107
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,010
You can't just get slapped.

3108
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:30,480
(Only singletons get a chance to be
exempted from being Empty Heads.)

3109
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,820
That guy has great spirit.

3110
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:33,190
Please let me be single.

3111
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:35,220
(Single or not,
only flirting addicts are gathered here.)

3112
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:38,590
(Who will survive as a singleton
until the very end?)

3113
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:39,760
(A Good Day To Be Single)
