00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,270
It's sunny today.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,270
The weather is cold.

3
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,009
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello.

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,150
- Hello.

00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,710
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

7
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,080
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

8
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,250
Okay!

9
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Congratulations, Jae Seok!

10
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,619
- Congratulations, Jae Seok!
- Congratulations.

11
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:15,890
- It's the 20th Grand Award.
- Congratulations.

12
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,320
- I knew it.
- Congratulations.

13
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,460
- I'm sorry I wasn't there that day.
- You made it.

14
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:28,129
(The 19th Grand Award
on SBS in 2022)

15
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,100
I've got 19 awards,
so I'll try until the end...

16
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,299
to get one more.

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,840
Yu Jae Seok.

18
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,409
- Yu Jae Seok.
- Yu Jae Seok.

19
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,009
(Yu Grand Award has run
without a break for 20 years.)

20
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:46,950
(Yu Grand Award has run
without a break for 20 years.)

21
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:55,090
(After giving relentless effort
without hesitation in 2024...)

22
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,100
The 2024 SBS Entertainment Awards.

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,899
The Grand Award goes to...

24
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,799
Yu Jae Seok. Congratulations.

25
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,399
(He made history by winning
his 20th Grand Award...)

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,370
(at the SBS Entertainment Awards
this year.)

27
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,170
I made it.

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,510
(I made it.)

29
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,540
- It's the 20th Grand Award.
- Thank you.

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,150
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

31
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,379
- Our Jae Seok did it.
- It's really cool.

32
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,379
Have you won the Grand Award
every year for 20 years?

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,250
I didn't win it every year.

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,250
- It's 20 in total.
- Almost every year.

35
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,689
- In total.
- It's 20 in total.

36
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:27,790
- I've won 20 awards for 20 years.
- You won 20 Grand Awards.

37
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:29,989
- That's great.
- It'll be hard to break the record.

38
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,329
- Right. No one can break it.
- No one can do it.

39
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,170
I don't know how it feels
to win 20 Grand Awards.

40
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,400
Now that you've won 20,

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
you should announce that
you won't receive any more awards.

42
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,739
- Me?
- You should do that.

43
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,609
To the three broadcasting companies.
"I'm happy with 20 awards."

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,209
I don't want to win
any more Grand Awards.

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,510
- Well...
- He'll get it if he's given one.

46
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,680
- Yes.
- Sure.

47
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,420
And the number 21 is quite catchy.

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,579
Twenty-one.

49
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,150
- Number 22 sounds good too.
- It's 22.

50
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,549
- Make it 22 then.
- It's 22.

51
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,120
Anyway, I'm also grateful
that we've been doing...

52
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,819
Running Man for 15 years.

53
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,890
- Right.
- Already?

54
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,390
- It's the oldest variety show ever.
- Right.

55
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,859
Running Man received an award.

56
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,769
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

57
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,099
(It is more meaningful
as it is chosen by the viewers.)

58
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,939
The Most Popular Show Award
chosen by viewers.

59
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,210
(Most Popular Show Award,
Running Man)

60
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,479
(And an award winner
chosen by viewers' votes)

61
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,650
(Scene Stealer Award, Song Ji Hyo)

62
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,759
(The Most Viewed
Short Clip Award...)

63
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,259
(with overwhelming popularity
around the world, Kim Jong Kook)

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,659
The Rising Star Award.

65
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,969
(And the two youngest members
won the Rising Star Award!)

66
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:49,969
Appearing on Running Man
was like a dream to me.

67
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,580
(Hoon gave his sincere speech calmly
though he was a little nervous.)

68
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,150
I won the award.

69
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,710
I love you, Mom.

70
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,550
(After Hoon's acceptance speech...)

71
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,620
I'm so grateful to be here today.

72
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:07,490
(She started giving a speech
with a goat-like voice.)

73
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,960
(Crying)

74
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,729
- Ye Eun.
- You should soothe Ye Eun.

75
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,629
I really wanted to join Running Man.

76
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,669
She really wanted
to join Running Man.

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,110
I'd like to thank Running Man...

78
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,340
- for having me on Running Man.
- Thank you.

79
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,550
I will work harder to become...

80
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,210
the rising star Ji Ye Eun
who makes people laugh.

81
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,520
- What an impressive pronunciation.
- Thank you.

82
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,120
(The cute speech of the youngest
shook the whole country.)

83
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,389
Ye Eun cried.

84
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,789
- She was so cute.
- Ye Eun.

85
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:39,219
Don't people stop doing that
when they turn four?

86
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,889
(Crying)

87
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,830
- Why did you cry?
- Actually, I prepared a speech.

88
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,659
- An acceptance speech.
- You did?

89
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,900
- What was it?
- What were you going to say?

90
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,229
I prepared something cool
for my acceptance speech.

91
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,400
But my mind went blank
when I got on the stage.

92
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,169
You should do it here.
Show us what you prepared.

93
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,539
- What is it?
- I forgot again.

94
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,909
- You forgot?
- Yes.

95
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,110
Did it have some famous saying?

96
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,909
I wanted to show
a different side of me.

97
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,419
But when I got up,
I was really nervous.

98
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,150
- Of course.
- You must've been nervous.

99
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,990
- Ye Eun was wearing a dress.
- Yes.

100
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,789
She couldn't breathe at all.

101
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:12,819
She was like...

102
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,829
The moment she let her guard down,

103
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,029
- her belly stuck out.
- No.

104
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,399
- "Hey, what is this?"
- No.

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,470
"It's nothing!"

106
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,129
In her dress?

107
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,240
She was about to die.

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,970
- She couldn't breathe.
- Really?

109
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,639
It was too tight.

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,339
People said my face was puffy
and I gained weight.

111
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,839
But I skipped meals.

112
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,379
I even skipped meals
on the previous day too. But...

113
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,519
It was so tight that
the fat got pushed up to the face.

114
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,980
- She was like this.
- Because of poor blood circulation,

115
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,620
it was pushed up to the face.

116
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,319
That's when I realized it.

117
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,920
When my waist was cinched up,

118
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,389
- it went all the way up to my face.
- I see.

119
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,829
- We had a cake there,
- She didn't eat.

120
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:51,829
but she didn't eat it.
Only Kang Hoon ate it.

121
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:54,370
- I couldn't. I was feeling dizzy.
- That's not good.

122
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,199
- Right.
- When I saw you and Kang Hoon...

123
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,470
at the awards ceremony,
you two looked good together.

124
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,100
- It looked nice.
- Right. They looked good together.

125
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,939
- Right? I'm serious.
- It wasn't bad.

126
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,110
- They made a cute couple.
- She seemed quite conscious.

127
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,139
(Laughing)

128
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,339
- She was conscious of it.
- You looked great together...

129
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,980
- when you were all dressed up.
- Right.

130
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,649
They make a cute couple.

131
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,980
- They looked cute.
- Be nice to him.

132
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,480
But, in reality,

133
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,420
- Se Chan is just perfect.
- Right.

134
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,589
Be realistic.

135
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,519
She's old enough to realize that.

136
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,290
- Se Chan is...
- Okay.

137
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,290
- We don't know how Se Chan feels.
- We don't.

138
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,389
Se Chan isn't interested in Ye Eun.

139
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,029
- No.
- It's an X.

140
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,060
It's an X.

141
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,069
- We are having two guests today.
- Really?

142
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,899
Please bring in the guests.

143
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,370
- Do we have guests?
- Guests?

144
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,410
- Who are they?
- Really?

145
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,240
- Jong Hyuk.
- What?

146
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,310
- Jong Hyuk.
- Number 95.

147
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,879
- Jong Hyuk.
- The one who resembles Se Chan.

148
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,209
- Right.
- They look alike.

149
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,279
- Si Eun.
- Hello.

150
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,949
- Welcome.
- Hello.

151
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,579
- Hello.
- Hello.

152
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,790
- Hello. Congratulations.
- Hello.

153
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,889
Trickster Kwon Min Woo.

154
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,430
(Se Chan's doppelganger
who showed off his terrible dance moves)

155
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,629
- Short chin.
- I have a short chin.

156
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:57,629
Me too.

157
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,670
- Does your mouth touch a mask?
- Which one?

158
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,430
It's between us. It does.

159
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,769
(Jong Hyun because the new Bucktooth
sharing stories about his mouth.)

160
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,509
(He's playing Kang Gi Ho,
an assistant director in "Trigger.")

161
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,779
(He's being praised
for his good chemistry...)

162
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,209
(with Kim Hye Soo and Jung Sung Il.)

163
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,420
(The rising star on screen,
Joo Jong Hyuk)

164
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,149
(Kim Si Eun, the famous
number 95 of the "Squid Game")

165
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,120
(She became the talk of the town
for her resemblance to Ye Eun.)

166
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,860
(It will be fun if Kim Si Eun
appears on Running Man.)

167
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,490
(What? It wasn't Ji Ye Eun?)

168
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,129
(I thought it was Ji Ye Eun,
but it turned out to be Kim Si Eun.)

169
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,360
- Hello. Congratulations.
- Hello.

170
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,500
Hello.

171
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,769
- You two really look alike.
- She looks like me.

172
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,170
- She looks like Ye Eun.
- Hello.

173
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,839
- Hello.
- It's been a while.

174
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,170
- Hello.
- Number 95.

175
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,209
(Jong Hyuk looks comfortable
since it's his second time here.)

176
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,209
- It's been a while.
- He's really...

177
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,439
- Jong Hyuk, how have you been?
- Hey.

178
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,680
Hey.

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,910
(Welcome,
the handsome version of me.)

180
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,680
- Hi.
- Stand here.

181
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,120
Welcome.

182
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,389
- Hello.
- Hello.

183
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,689
She's Kim Si Eun.

184
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,519
Do they look alike?

185
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,689
People asked...

186
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,029
- if I was on "Squid Game."
- It looked like you.

187
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,500
- Hello.
- My goodness.

188
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
- Hello.
- They look alike.

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,500
- Yes. These two.
- We look alike.

190
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,629
Stand in the middle.

191
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,699
- You look really similar.
- Come here.

192
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,069
- Come here, Jong Hyuk.
- Okay.

193
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,399
- Stand here.
- Stand next to me.

194
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,170
- Stand together.
- Si Eun.

195
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,610
- They look alike.
- She was on "Squid Game 2."

196
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,040
- Right.
- She was number 95.

197
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,139
People said she looked like Ye Eun.

198
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,149
- Right.
- They do look alike.

199
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,079
- They look similar.
- That's true.

200
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,449
- This part looks similar.
- When she appeared on the show...

201
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,689
- People thought it was me.
- That's true.

202
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,759
- They do look alike.
- They really do.

203
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,720
- They look similar.
- It's my first time meeting her.

204
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,529
- But I feel a sense of closeness.
- I know.

205
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,959
- I understand.
- Still,

206
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,500
you can't be like
Se Chan and Jong Hyuk.

207
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,300
(The jaw doppelgangers are
on another level.)

208
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,529
We can't beat them.

209
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,540
They look the same.

210
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,699
- It's surprising.
- You should stand there.

211
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,310
- How can they resemble so much?
- They look the same.

212
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,670
I feel bad for Jong Hyuk.

213
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,110
Wherever he goes to promote his work,
people talk about me.

214
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,149
- I'm sorry.
- Even when I'm on a radio show,

215
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,779
they always talk about you.

216
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:56,810
Jong Hyuk is back after a long time.

217
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,120
- You're doing a new drama, right?
- Yes.

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,149
- It's on the air now.
- Really?

219
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,720
- What is it?
- It's called "Trigger."

220
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,990
- I see. "Trigger."
- "Trigger."

221
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,319
- It features Kim Hye Soo.
- I know that.

222
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,060
- It features Kim Hye Soo.
- Yes.

223
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,800
- The story is quite satisfying.
- Yes.

224
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,300
It's about
an investigative news show.

225
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,329
An investigative news show.

226
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:14,870
- Yes.
- It's fun and satisfying.

227
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,370
- So you are working with Hye Soo.
- Right.

228
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,069
- Oh, dear.
- How was she?

229
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,610
She's really...

230
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,709
There are
only good stories about her.

231
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:26,310
- She's really nice.
- My gosh.

232
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,050
- She's like a magnanimous boss.
- Right.

233
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,779
Hye Soo once came...

234
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,419
to Running Man with her niece.

235
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,720
- Right.
- She did.

236
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,250
- Just to watch?
- She was so sweet.

237
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,990
She came all the way here
because of her niece.

238
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,559
- She came.
- She came to the shoot?

239
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,429
Was she on Running Man before?

240
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,629
- Not even once.
- No.

241
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:47,059
Please join our show.

242
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,070
(He invites her all of a sudden.)

243
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,299
- Why?
- What?

244
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,039
- Why...
- Instead of coming for her niece...

245
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,600
- Why would you say that?
- Don't put pressure on her.

246
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,409
- We'd like to have you here.
- Don't be like that.

247
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,779
We all had
a plastic sheet of her photo.

248
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,779
- Exactly. We all had it.
- Right.

249
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,080
- Right.
- The Taekwondo girl.

250
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,679
Other than "Trigger,"
Jong Hyuk, is there any news...

251
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,649
that you want to tell us?

252
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,750
I'm shooting a new drama now.

253
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,090
(Joo Jong Hyuk and Park Min Young
are cast for "Confidence Man KR.")

254
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,889
- Jong Hyuk.
- It's crazy.

255
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,429
- I'm successful now.
- You're successful.

256
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,730
By the way...

257
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,259
- You are successful.
- I am.

258
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,669
I'm happy
that things are going well for him.

259
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:22,029
He has good energy.

260
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,100
- Right.
- Yes.

261
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,299
After I did the challenge...
After I danced here,

262
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,509
I stopped saying
that I was a good dancer.

263
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,769
- Right.
- It's a good thing.

264
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,480
- My dance looked strange.
- That's good.

265
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,340
Many people became successful
after joining our show.

266
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,250
By the way,
this is your first time here, right?

267
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,750
This is my first time
on a variety show.

268
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,450
- Really?
- I'm serious.

269
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,549
- I see.
- I heard that...

270
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,690
you and Ye Eun had
something in common.

271
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,620
- Really?
- What is it?

272
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,789
- You like to eat.
- I do.

273
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:48,860
Me too.

274
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,889
You like to eat?

275
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,200
(They both like to eat.)

276
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,669
- That's it?
- What?

277
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,299
All people are like that.

278
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,539
You think so?

279
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:00,539
- Then I'm like Ji Ye Eun.
- Me too.

280
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,370
- Who doesn't like to eat?
- There's more.

281
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,179
- You both like Girls' Generation.
- Girls' Generation?

282
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,080
- Girls' Generation?
- Yes.

283
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,549
"Into the New World"
is my favorite song.

284
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,480
(Ddochi proved her love
as a fan with her whole body.)

285
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,820
Try dancing to "Gee" then.

286
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,620
- Show us your dance.
- I can do this.

287
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,460
<i>Gee, gee, gee</i>

288
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,889
<i>Gee, gee, gee</i>

289
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:23,460
(What?)

290
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,429
- I will do it again.
- I knew it.

291
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,100
- You don't have to do it again.
- I don't?

292
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,899
- That was good.
- Ye Eun feels sorry.

293
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,200
- That was enough.
- I wasn't ready.

294
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,110
- What was this?
- It was just...

295
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,840
I've always dreamed
of appearing on Running Man.

296
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
- Really?
- Actually...

297
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
- it was a dream of mine.
- When did you start watching it?

298
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,679
- Since elementary school.
- Of course.

299
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,179
This being a dream of hers is
another thing they have in common.

300
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,950
- Yes, Ye Eun too.
- You're also a Running Man Kid.

301
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,549
- How old are you?
- I was born in 1999.

302
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,590
- I was born in 1999.
- My gosh.

303
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,159
Why? Is that too much of an age gap?

304
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,230
- Hey.
- No, of course not.

305
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,659
- You're five years apart.
- We're...

306
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,259
- We're peers.
- You're like her big sister.

307
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,330
- How are you peers?
- We were both born in the 90s.

308
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,129
- Ye Eun isn't a Running Man Kid.
- She's not.

309
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,600
- She's a Running Man Teen.
- Yes, a teen.

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,870
- No, a Running Man Kid.
- She's slightly older.

311
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,309
Today, we're joined
by Joo Jong Hyuk and Kim Si Eun...

312
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,240
who are like family
in terms of their looks.

313
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,509
- It's Family in Joy and Sorrow.
- In joy and sorrow?

314
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,279
First, I'll announce the families.

315
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,580
- The families?
- The three lookalikes.

316
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,120
Yu Jae Seok, Yang Se Chan,
and Joo Jong Hyuk are one team.

317
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,750
- Because of our mouths?
- Because they stick out.

318
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,059
- You look alike.
- The bucktoothed trio.

319
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,529
- You're our big brother.
- The bucktoothed trio.

320
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,490
- You three do look alike.
- I know.

321
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,330
Those who look like
they've been wronged.

322
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,929
- Haha.
- Me?

323
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,899
(Only he doesn't know
what he looks like.)

324
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,139
Why me?

325
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,009
- That's out of the blue.
- You have that quality.

326
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,409
- You do seem wronged.
- Exactly.

327
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,110
- You seem wronged.
- It's so unfair!

328
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,809
- His face...
- Haha, Ji Ye Eun,

329
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,480
and Kim Si Eun are a team.

330
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,080
- Okay.
- Lastly, we have those...

331
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,379
- who are like a real family.
- Jong Kook and us.

332
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,379
Jee Seok Jin, Kim Jong Kook,

333
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,389
- I'm sorry, but...
- and Song Ji Hyo...

334
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,889
- are a team.
- we're the leftovers.

335
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,460
- That's right.
- The leftovers.

336
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,860
- The leftovers. Got it.
- You're the real family.

337
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,259
- Got it.
- Sure.

338
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,559
- Hey. I forgot to mention this.
- Yes?

339
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,269
We went to Jong Kook's place
on the first day of the holidays.

340
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,429
- Right.
- For the first time in a while.

341
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,500
There's something odd...

342
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,570
- about his place.
- How so?

343
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,039
He's now living among trash.

344
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:15,970
("Unanswered Questions"
A man living among trash?)

345
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,210
- He's the trash man.
- Yes, that's true.

346
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,710
- That's not it.
- SOS. Jong Kook...

347
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,250
He needs our help.

348
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,179
- How can this be?
- His house should be filmed.

349
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,179
- We...
- We should visit.

350
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,190
There's this much trash
piled up on his balcony.

351
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,690
The pile comes up to here.

352
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,360
That's where he places
his recyclables.

353
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,259
Plastic to be exact.

354
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,860
Plastic is collected on his balcony.

355
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:36,889
- Vinegar gochujang in his fridge.
- Seriously.

356
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:39,600
And the room next
to the master bedroom?

357
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,029
It's like Dongmyo Market.

358
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,230
- No way.
- The clothes.

359
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,429
- Yes, I have a lot.
- Dongmyo?

360
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,240
- You'd be surprised.
- You'd be shocked.

361
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
- Right.
- He has piles of freebies...

362
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,539
- lying around at home.
- No way.

363
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:49,539
(The shocking sight
will be revealed next week.)

364
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,580
Hand them out
if you have no use for them.

365
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
I'll hand out what I can,

366
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,080
but know that my house
is in its current state...

367
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,580
because I'm getting ready
for a move.

368
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,080
My house isn't always that messy.

369
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,220
Where would you move...

370
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,350
when you haven't even been
house-hunting?

371
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,289
- You haven't found a place.
- I'll be moving.

372
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,320
I'm looking into it.

373
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,720
The show should air this.
You'll be shocked.

374
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,990
- Really?
- Don't you dare clean up.

375
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,690
- Right.
- My gosh.

376
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,860
People should see this house.

377
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,159
He wouldn't know
even if you stole anything.

378
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,830
Each family...

379
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,730
- will receive a debit card.
- That's right.

380
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,399
The family...

381
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,799
with the most money left
on the debit card...

382
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,610
will win the race
and receive a prize.

383
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,570
The family
with the least amount of money...

384
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,440
- will receive a penalty.
- We need to accumulate money.

385
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,610
We need to accumulate money.

386
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,809
To accumulate money,

387
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,549
you must withdraw money
from an opponent's bank account.

388
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:35,690
Each round,
you will point to a family...

389
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,659
and withdraw as much as you want.

390
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,259
You were notified...

391
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,259
of the starting balance
this morning.

392
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:43,559
- The scratchcard.
- The scratchcard.

393
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

394
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,860
These are scratchcards.

395
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,929
The amount you win
will be your seed money.

396
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,799
Please only choose one.

397
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,870
(The amount they win
will be the team's seed money.)

398
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,470
- Here.
- Bring it when we film the opening.

399
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,039
You can't steal what others have.

400
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,139
Hey.

401
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,179
That should be
a warning for Se Chan.

402
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,279
As for me...

403
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,679
Why should it be me?

404
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,190
I'm not that kind of person.

405
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:11,320
I see that nothing's detectable.

406
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
How meticulous of you.
I give you that.

407
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:16,429
I'll go with this one.

408
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,360
You can't steal from others today.

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,730
I'm not Haha, you know.

410
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,429
(They all chose one scratchcard.)

411
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,870
- Got it.
- The one that speaks out to me.

412
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,669
- I choose this one.
- I shouldn't scratch it yet?

413
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:29,039
- The amount that you win...
- I have mine.

414
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,840
- from your scratchcards combined...
- Here's mine.

415
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,909
- will be the team's seed money.
- All three?

416
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,279
- It shouldn't be public knowledge.
- No.

417
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:35,980
- Can we tell our teammates?
- Okay.

418
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,509
- Of course.
- Your family should know.

419
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,750
- Yes, we should know.
- The family should know.

420
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,350
- Will...
- Make sure to keep it a secret.

421
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,889
Will we not be switching teammates
for this race?

422
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:42,889
- No.
- The way I see it...

423
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,759
- Okay, I'll do my best.
- Seriously.

424
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,519
- Don't betray us.
- Please don't.

425
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,429
- Is it random?
- See how much you won...

426
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,460
and tell only the staff the amount.

427
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,700
We should scratch that part
with a coin.

428
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,029
We should do it right now.

429
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,799
- Let's scratch ours.
- We can do it here.

430
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,070
- With our backs against the wall.
- Give me that.

431
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,600
- I hope...
- What do you mean?

432
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,340
I hope we win a lot.

433
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,940
- Mine's not bad.
- Hold on.

434
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,740
- Really?
- It's not bad. Here.

435
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,679
(Seok Jin wins 70 dollars.)

436
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,220
- Mine's not bad either.
- I won more.

437
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,250
(Ji Hyo wins 30 dollars.)

438
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,620
- Meanwhile, I...
- I see a five.

439
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,990
I didn't win a lot.

440
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:20,159
Why do I never get lucky
with these things?

441
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,529
- Let me see yours.
- A seven.

442
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,990
- My goodness.
- Nice, right?

443
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,299
- We're not off to a bad start.
- Here.

444
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,799
- Let's do it here.
- Come here.

445
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,100
Get behind me.

446
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,500
Let's scratch it here.

447
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,740
- Wait. They'll see it!
- What's wrong?

448
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,970
They could see what you won.

449
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,139
Look at the others.
What if they had their backs turned?

450
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,080
The camera should film
from behind us.

451
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,710
- How much is it?
- How much do you think I won?

452
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,080
- I...
- Hush!

453
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,750
Please lower your voice.

454
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,250
- No, you can't.
- We should see.

455
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:52,720
(Gasping)

456
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,129
- I wasn't done.
- Oh, right.

457
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,830
(Haha won a whopping 150 dollars.)

458
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,929
No way.

459
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:02,129
(He scratches
Si Eun's scratchcard for her.)

460
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,299
No way. I asked
what the highest prize was.

461
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:06,570
Together...

462
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,240
(Haha's family: Haha 150 dollars,)

463
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,940
(Si Eun 50 dollars,
Ye Eun 20 dollars)

464
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,940
(Thanks to the unusually lucky Haha,
they start with 220 dollars!)

465
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,139
- Amazing, right?
- No way.

466
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,139
Hold on.

467
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,980
- Shouldn't we trick the others?
- Maybe...

468
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,049
Maybe...

469
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,919
Let me see.

470
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,549
(What's the balance
for the Bucktooth Family?)

471
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,149
Okay, good.

472
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,720
- Not bad?
- How much?

473
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,820
Nice. That's not bad.

474
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,919
How much?

475
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,889
- How much?
- It's not bad.

476
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,759
(They seem to have won
an adequate amount.)

477
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,799
We're good.

478
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,870
I think we have
the second highest amount.

479
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,830
- At the very least.
- Yes, at the very least.

480
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,200
(The three brothers
seem to have won adequate amounts.)

481
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,639
- Okay.
- Okay.

482
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,169
(How much seed money
does Jae Seok's family have?)

483
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,409
Okay, nice.

484
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,970
- We have more than enough.
- Everyone won decent money.

485
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,409
I'm one to be lucky.

486
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:46,610
We got lucky too.

487
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,639
(Order of withdrawal)

488
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,210
I'm amazed by Si Eun.

489
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,919
- Exactly. She's not shy at all.
- Si Eun, have this.

490
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,480
- I should be doing that.
- No, have this one.

491
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,549
- No.
- What?

492
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,990
- What...
- Why not?

493
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,350
Shouldn't I be getting this for you?

494
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,990
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

495
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,820
- See how Ye Eun is seated?
- Si Eun,

496
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,090
aren't you starstruck?

497
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,730
Ye Eun, I'm older,
but I got you some water.

498
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,829
Thanks.

499
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,130
- That's how the MZ generation is.
- You appreciate it?

500
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,569
Thanks, Mr. Haha.

501
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,140
Mr. Haha?

502
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,410
- Thanks, Mr. Haha.
- Wailing.

503
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,779
Allow me to explain the first game.

504
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,109
- Sure.
- The first game...

505
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,579
- is Triggered Domino.
- What's that?

506
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,250
One from each team
will enter a room...

507
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,220
and set up dominoes
for three minutes per team.

508
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,160
After all three members are done,
the dominoes will be triggered.

509
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,960
You will be ranked according
to the number of dominoes...

510
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,859
- you were able to trigger.
- I'm good at that.

511
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,359
- Really?
- The team that triggered...

512
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,829
the least amount of dominoes...

513
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:41,099
will try to withdraw money first.

514
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,700
The winning team
will be given an additional benefit,

515
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,670
- so it's important to trigger...
- We need to win this.

516
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,440
- the most amount.
- Let's go.

517
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,309
First, Jong Hyuk, Jong Kook,
and Haha...

518
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:52,809
will enter the room.

519
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,109
- Jong Hyuk, let's go.
- Let's go.

520
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,410
- Do well.
- Don't be nervous.

521
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,650
- Am I to set the dominoes?
- Yes.

522
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,180
Those going in next...

523
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,220
will be Jae Seok, Seok Jin,
and Si Eun.

524
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,150
- The last ones to go in are...
- I'll try my best.

525
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,819
- are Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Ye Eun.
- Okay.

526
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,359
- I never did this growing up.
- This is a first for me.

527
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,460
- This...
- Right.

528
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,430
- What's this?
- This looks difficult.

529
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,029
What now? Why are there balloons?

530
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,359
Please take your places.

531
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,630
What is all this? Already?

532
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,869
Where you stand
is just as important.

533
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,640
Our places? I'll go here.

534
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,000
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I'll go here.

535
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,109
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Sure.

536
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,309
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

537
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,039
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

538
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,549
- I won.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

539
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,109
- Okay.
- I'll take this seat.

540
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,250
I'll sit here.

541
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,519
(They grab the seat
that seems the best.)

542
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,920
I don't know what's happening,
but I choose this one.

543
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,420
We need to set them
according to color.

544
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,319
Yes, the dominoes
are under the desk.

545
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,890
(The dominoes must be set
with colors that match the line.)

546
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,359
Hold on. Why...

547
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,059
What on earth is this?

548
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,259
- What's this?
- Why has this been inflated?

549
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,799
- Why?
- They're going to make us jump.

550
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,640
Don't you know I get scared easily?

551
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,839
- Don't you?
- Get ready.

552
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,839
(Who will set the most dominoes
in this suspicious room?)

553
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,670
- Goodness.
- Do a good job.

554
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:00,640
- No way.
- My gosh.

555
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,880
- Is that the setting?
- What on earth?

556
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,579
- They're small.
- I can see it all.

557
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,720
- Are they placing the dominoes?
- Like that?

558
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,220
- Really?
- That's Haha.

559
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,450
He's good at it.

560
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,559
(Focusing with his mouth open)

561
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,829
Hold on. This...

562
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:17,789
(Kaboom)

563
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,500
(The sound of a lightning strike
came out of nowhere.)

564
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,839
- They can't scare us like this.
- Oh, no.

565
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,839
- What was that?
- I'd knock it over.

566
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,099
Who's that in the middle?

567
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,970
- He's doomed.
- That's Haha.

568
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,710
- Why is that?
- Haha's bad at this.

569
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,710
It was to shock them...

570
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,710
- and knock down the pieces.
- That's Haha.

571
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,079
I can't stand things like that.

572
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,150
We need to place dominoes
that are matching colors.

573
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,950
Yes, match the color to the tape.

574
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,349
(Screaming)

575
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,690
That... My gosh.

576
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,390
I almost knocked mine over.

577
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,960
(Just then)

578
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,599
(The vase dropped.)

579
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,029
(The two scaredy-cats
were startled.)

580
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:00,799
(Meanwhile, one of them is unfazed
despite the commotion.)

581
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,839
(He's even having fun with it.)

582
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,369
- I hate those things.
- I can't stand things like that.

583
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,140
I hate it.

584
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,339
We've already won.

585
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,750
Ji Hyo, we won.

586
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,319
- Jong Kook's calm.
- We won this round.

587
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,549
(A cardboard box explodes.)

588
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:16,549
(Screaming!)

589
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,589
What on earth was that?

590
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,490
(They were knocked down.)

591
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,559
I knocked all of mine down.

592
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,490
But I didn't knock any over.

593
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,630
Jong Hyuk's were all knocked down.

594
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,900
- Was Jong Hyuk's knocked down?
- Jong Hyuk.

595
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,099
- Nice job.
- They were all knocked down.

596
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,470
Isn't Jong Kook doing all right?

597
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,539
(His mouth
has now been opened wider.)

598
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,539
But...

599
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,470
They were knocked over by the wind.

600
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,380
How can one...

601
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,049
(Screaming on his own)

602
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,349
(A serious scream)

603
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,089
- They fell down.
- No!

604
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,390
They all fell down.

605
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,430
This is really...

606
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,500
No, if these fall...

607
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,730
There's a breeze.

608
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,130
(Blocking the breeze)

609
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:05,099
I have a fear of balloons!

610
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,569
(The big balloon nearby
is still quiet.)

611
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,839
(It looks like it'll burst soon.)

612
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,849
Hang on. The chair...

613
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,349
- Darn it!
- Can I move my chair?

614
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,390
My muscles stiffened.

615
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,319
- That scaredy-cat.
- Hey.

616
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,519
I swear. My muscles hurt.

617
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:29,460
For real, Hyung In!
Hyo Im! I'm in pain!

618
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,130
Honestly. I'm not lying.

619
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,630
Keep going, Jong Hyuk!

620
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,700
Looking good!

621
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,470
Blue.

622
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,529
(Jong Hyuk and Jong Kook
are advancing smoothly.)

623
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,440
- This is driving me crazy.
- As long as Jong Kook does well.

624
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
- It's all on him.
- He's good at this stuff.

625
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,710
- Haha.
- Gosh.

626
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,910
- He's good at this.
- I have to use my left hand.

627
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,710
- He's pretty good.
- He's doing great.

628
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,240
Oh, my muscles.

629
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,210
Darn you!

630
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,150
(The balloons burst,
and Haha's dominoes collapsed.)

631
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,220
Hey! My sore muscles!

632
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,750
- Saliva...
- I lost...

633
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,750
(Trembling)

634
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,160
- It's too...
- We'll switch players now.

635
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,390
(Round 1 is over.)

636
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,160
- You can leave.
- This is so annoying.

637
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,259
- You got quite a lot standing.
- I did, didn't I?

638
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:06,329
I got...

639
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,230
- I can't turn my head!
- That's a lot.

640
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,329
(Current 1st place: Jong Hyuk)

641
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,170
- Good.
- Weren't you surprised?

642
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,009
If you have lots of testosterone,
you don't get startled.

643
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,369
- Are they done?
- Hang on.

644
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,940
- Haha spilled his.
- No way.

645
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,210
- Si Eun, you need to...
- I'll do my best.

646
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,650
Get them all standing up
with your precise touch.

647
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,950
I'm not precise.

648
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,450
- You are precise?
- I'm not.

649
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,079
- I'm nervous already.
- No, you're precise.

650
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,119
- It's a mess.
- Let's go.

651
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,450
What's a mess?

652
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,849
- What is?
- We can see from here.

653
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,589
- Okay.
- Oh, you saw us?

654
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:35,559
- Haha!
- Oh, you saw us?

655
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,359
- Darn it.
- Don't be afraid.

656
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:39,930
- Seok Jin!
- It's fine.

657
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,200
- I'm nervous.
- Don't be afraid.

658
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,269
There are ghosts.

659
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,430
- For real?
- Yes.

660
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,400
Oh, no. I'm not good at...

661
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,569
I want to do well.

662
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,740
Darn it. It's scary.

663
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,339
- Where's my seat?
- Where do I go?

664
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:52,710
- Is this it?
- Jae Seok is on the left.

665
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,910
Si Eun is in the middle.

666
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,079
- The ones here...
- He did so well.

667
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,109
That's a lot.

668
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,150
Get ready.

669
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,450
- No, wait.
- Wait.

670
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,450
- You have to extend the line.
- Oh, really?

671
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,950
- Okay, got it.
- Slowly.

672
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,190
Get ready.

673
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,990
- How long do we have?
- Three minutes.

674
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,059
What did you mean by "go slow?"

675
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,230
(Falling down)

676
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,259
Hang on.

677
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,329
- That was close.
- Oh, dear.

678
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:19,000
- I'm really bad at this.
- My hands are shaking.

679
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,440
- Hang on.
- Oh, no. This is insane.

680
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,309
- She should take off the scrunchie.
- Why is she wearing that?

681
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,339
- She should take it off.
- That needs to go.

682
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,210
Oh, she's not my team. Keep it on.

683
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,849
- Hang on.
- Si Eun is honestly...

684
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:32,150
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

685
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,450
- She keeps hitting them.
- They keep falling.

686
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,250
- Keep going.
- That has to come off.

687
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,319
- I'm really bad at this.
- My hands are shaking.

688
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,460
- Hang on.
- Oh, no. This is insane.

689
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
(Falling on his own)

690
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,829
I'm terrible at stuff like this.

691
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,299
(The cardboard boxes explode.)

692
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,630
(A piece of cardboard)

693
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,670
This thing...

694
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,400
- This flew into my stack!
- Wait!

695
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,440
(Knee jerk)

696
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,440
(Collapsed dominoes)

697
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,109
What is this?

698
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,549
- Is that ours?
- Jae Seok!

699
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,650
- What happened?
- They all...

700
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,720
- He spilled them all.
- Yes.

701
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,220
Take off the scrunchie.

702
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,819
He must be out of his mind.
I really...

703
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,490
I got them lined up so nicely.

704
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,690
Why is Seok Jin
so close to the table?

705
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,700
That's why they all fell down.

706
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,930
This is nonsense!

707
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,460
What on earth is this game?

708
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,230
- That hit my dominoes.
- Jong Hyuk chose that seat.

709
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,440
This thing fell on me.

710
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,900
A breeze keeps
making the dominoes fall.

711
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,569
- The center seat's the best.
- Darn it.

712
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,710
- This is bad.
- The cardboard fell on it.

713
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,180
What fell? What blew up? Shoot.

714
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,009
- I think something will appear.
- Oh, no.

715
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:36,109
(Screaming)

716
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,150
Don't do that.

717
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,480
It'll take forever
to put these back up.

718
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,990
What is this game?

719
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,220
- Please, come on.
- I don't believe this.

720
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,160
They all fell down.

721
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,890
Not just yours. Mine too.

722
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,759
Not just yours. Mine too.

723
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:55,329
All the ones
that Jong Kook put up...

724
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,430
(A sudden fire show)

725
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,839
I really can't...
What are you doing?

726
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,470
What is this, really?

727
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,470
Will you stop it?

728
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,740
Why are you doing this?

729
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,380
There's no way we won't jump...

730
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,380
(A vase falls!)

731
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,880
There's no way we won't jump...

732
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,049
- Hey, he toppled them again.
- Darn it!

733
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,789
- Darn it! This is infuriating!
- This is driving me crazy.

734
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,730
Darn it!

735
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,930
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok's dominoes
fall in turn.)

736
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,660
Jae Seok!

737
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,829
I think we'll win.

738
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,039
I think she can just stop and wait.

739
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,869
Darn it! Hey, you!

740
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,369
This is driving me crazy.

741
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,539
(Just then)

742
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:38,910
- Wait.
- This...

743
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,839
(She nudged it
with her scrunchie again!)

744
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,150
Wait. Oh, no.

745
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,019
- I...
- Shoot!

746
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,250
- Si Eun!
- Scrunchie Si Eun!

747
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,119
Si Eun, take off the scrunchie!

748
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,960
Take off the scrunchie!
Get rid of it!

749
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,900
You set it up so it's impossible.

750
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,160
How are we to do this?

751
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,200
People watching TV
will wonder what's wrong with us.

752
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,440
Try it yourselves. It's no joke.

753
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
My gosh.

754
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,710
I'm sorry, Ye Eun.

755
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,940
I'm sorry, guys.

756
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,680
Si Eun!

757
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,839
Si Eun's done for.

758
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,849
She stopped.

759
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,349
She'd done so well.

760
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,279
- This is impossible.
- This is...

761
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,220
This just won't work.

762
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,490
(Stacking with his mouth open)

763
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,589
We still have Ji Hyo.

764
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,490
Ji Hyo is somewhat...

765
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,660
- You need someone calm.
- Ji Hyo...

766
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,329
Ji Hyo is calm.

767
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:32,700
(He's already thinking of
leaving it to Ji Hyo.)

768
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,730
- This right now...
- This game...

769
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,299
Darn it!

770
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,640
(Toppling over)

771
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,109
How is anyone to play this?

772
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,740
- Just stop already!
- How are we meant to play?

773
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,509
- Hang on.
- My gosh.

774
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,710
I'm so angry.

775
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,109
- Ye Eun.
- I didn't hit it this time.

776
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,509
- I'm sorry, Ye Eun.
- Darn it.

777
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,420
I'm not making any progress.

778
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,150
(A switch blew up!)

779
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,589
Darn it!

780
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,089
- My gosh.
- Seok Jin got a lot standing.

781
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,730
- Right?
- That's a lot.

782
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,230
- Older people like such games.
- Yes.

783
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,930
Like finding matching hwatu cards.

784
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,859
He's doing better than I thought.

785
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,299
Let me off just this once.

786
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,000
You have one minute left.

787
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,069
- Forget the one minute...
- Shoot.

788
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,440
One minute...

789
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,380
- I haven't stacked any new blocks.
- This is too...

790
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,309
- My gosh.
- Keep still.

791
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:22,750
(Seok Sam survived yet again.)

792
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,619
What on earth is he...

793
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,819
- What...
- Is this a horror game or what?

794
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,450
- What...
- Is this a horror game or what?

795
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,829
Oh, Seok Jin...

796
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:38,960
- They fell again.
- What's wrong with him?

797
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,200
Right? He did that to be funny.

798
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,799
- You can't do it all at once.
- Si Eun.

799
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,839
Seok Jin, honestly...

800
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,440
(The eldest is gaping
while attempting damage control.)

801
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:54,640
(Round 2 is over.)

802
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,980
- The next...
- This is impossible.

803
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:58,579
What the...

804
00:27:58,579 --> 00:27:59,849
(Jae Seok did well
for a scaredy-cat.)

805
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:02,319
This game was impossible.

806
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:04,319
You have the most standing up.

807
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,319
My gosh.

808
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:07,859
Just five. I'm really sorry, guys.

809
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:10,059
- My gosh.
- I'm sorry, Ye Eun.

810
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:13,130
I feel so bad. What should I do?

811
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,170
- Si Eun.
- I'm sorry. But...

812
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,269
- Si Eun. This...
- I tried.

813
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:18,569
- What were you doing?
- Si Eun. This was in the way.

814
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:21,069
- Hey, your scrunchie...
- Is that product placement?

815
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,539
- Were you even thinking?
- No.

816
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,509
You should've taken off
your bag too!

817
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
(Fiery criticism)

818
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,309
It's my first time.

819
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,849
Even so,
there are things you can do!

820
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:32,250
It's my first time
on a variety show.

821
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,250
That's true.

822
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,589
- Seok Jin. Don't try to be funny.
- It's really no joke.

823
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,750
- I wasn't trying to be funny.
- Honestly.

824
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,819
I'm not kidding. See for yourselves.

825
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:42,029
- I already had my turn.
- Ji Hyo.

826
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:45,400
My round
was way more potent than yours.

827
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,529
- Take off your bag.
- Okay.

828
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,730
- Okay.
- Good luck.

829
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,000
Good luck, Ye Eun.

830
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,099
- I'll just protect what's standing.
- Ye Eun, in the middle.

831
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,539
If you keep one down in the middle,

832
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,369
- they might not all fall down.
- Okay.

833
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:57,940
- Ji Hyo!
- Aebong.

834
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,380
- You're our hope.
- Good luck, Aebong!

835
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,609
Good luck!

836
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,849
No way.

837
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:06,579
- I honestly can't do this.
- Can't I forfeit?

838
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,950
I'm scared.

839
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,119
I'm scared.

840
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,119
(Low-frequency waves)

841
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:13,660
The team with the most dominoes
with the longest trail...

842
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,859
when they're toppled wins.

843
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:18,259
- This...
- We'll start the clock.

844
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,259
This is crazy.

845
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,069
- I'm scared. I can't do it.
- Wait.

846
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:24,630
- Did you press it? I'm scared.
- Honestly.

847
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,799
I'm scared.

848
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,539
Will you please
raise the level slowly? Please.

849
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,309
Once I get messed up...

850
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,609
If it goes up at once...

851
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,339
- I'm scared.
- I'm scared.

852
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,950
- I'm scared of this!
- I'm scared.

853
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,309
- I'm scared.
- It hurts.

854
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,720
(Thunder roars)

855
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,950
(Scared out of their wits)

856
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,119
That scared me!

857
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,690
My gosh. That was loud.

858
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:50,230
- My goodness!
- Why was it so loud? I'm scared.

859
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,359
I'm scared.

860
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,460
Me too.

861
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,769
- I'm scared.
- I'm really scared.

862
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,339
My ear hurts.

863
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,009
(Screaming)

864
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,940
My ear hurts!

865
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,339
My muscles turned stiff.

866
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,279
(Collapse)

867
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,250
My muscles turned stiff.

868
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,480
(Se Chan in first place
suddenly becomes last.)

869
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,849
My muscles hurt!

870
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:14,950
I'm scared.

871
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,420
My gosh.

872
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,720
- Come on.
- I'm scared.

873
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:23,160
I have a feeling
the balloons will pop.

874
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,960
Ji Hyo is tenacious,
so she's good at this.

875
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,359
- Yes. She's...
- She's tough.

876
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,930
- Ye Eun, you...
- Theirs all fell over.

877
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,930
Who is it?

878
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,240
(Ji Hyo's dominoes fell too!)

879
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,509
I'm scared.

880
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,980
My gosh.

881
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,609
(Ye Eun goes up to
first place by chance.)

882
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:42,150
- I'm so scared.
- Seriously.

883
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,480
Darn it.

884
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,119
(Double Chin is totally focused.)

885
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,650
Please, Se Chan.

886
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,720
- Don't be nervous.
- My gosh.

887
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,490
(Screaming)

888
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:56,059
(The low frequency device
has been turned on.)

889
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,990
- My fingers won't move.
- Oh, gosh!

890
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,430
- My fingers...
- Oh, gosh.

891
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,859
(Giggling)

892
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,700
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- Oh, gosh.

893
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,369
- Look at this, Ji Hyo.
- Her hands are...

894
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,569
- Her hands are...
- Ye Eun.

895
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,910
- How do I do this?
- How can her hands go like that?

896
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,039
- This is...
- Ye Eun, what are you doing?

897
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,240
This is insane!

898
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,349
(The other players are becoming
healthier as well.)

899
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,279
This is so...

900
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,779
(Yelling)

901
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:21,779
Oh, goodness. What do I do?

902
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:24,250
- There's no way...
- I'm going to stay still now.

903
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,019
- I'm scared.
- I'm scared.

904
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,930
(About to cry)

905
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,089
I'm scared.

906
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:32,759
Gosh, please.

907
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,059
Hey, please don't do this...

908
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,940
(A fresh cream gun salute)

909
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,900
- Ye Bong. My goodness.
- I can't believe...

910
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,509
- You're totally in last place.
- I had to...

911
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,710
You're doing well, Se Chan!

912
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,880
You're doing well, Se Chan!
Let's go!

913
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:50,450
- Se Chan is doing so well.
- What?

914
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,680
- He's doing really well.
- Ssaebssaeb.

915
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,019
- Yes.
- Ssaebssaeb is good at this stuff.

916
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,920
(Sticking the dominoes in place
with the fresh cream)

917
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,119
I can put cream on here.

918
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,660
(He races ahead on his own
with his innovative and dirty play.)

919
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,599
(Right then...)

920
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,829
No!

921
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,500
(All of Se Chan's dominoes
fall over.)

922
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:12,700
Okay!

923
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,769
Nice shot.

924
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,069
(Shocked)

925
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,339
My gosh!

926
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,640
No!

927
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,380
No!

928
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,279
Because of you, my dominoes...

929
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,250
(Ye Eun's dominoes fell over
as well.)

930
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,079
I was just sitting still.

931
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,549
You knocked mine over
because you bumped my table.

932
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:31,289
I'm sorry.

933
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,519
Hurry up and do it over.

934
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,660
But this is...

935
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,890
- The dominoes are so fast.
- This is just too much.

936
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,200
Gosh, seriously. Se Chan!

937
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,369
Ye Bong, seriously!

938
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,430
But this is...

939
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,470
The dominoes are so fast.

940
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,799
- This is just too much.
- You have 30 seconds left.

941
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,970
Gosh, seriously. Se Chan!

942
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,509
Gosh, that scared me!

943
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:53,779
Darn it. What was that?

944
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,250
Gosh, I almost swore out loud.
I'm sorry.

945
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,509
(The final 10 seconds!)

946
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,720
My shoulder muscles are stiff.

947
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,380
- Still, Ji Hyo is doing the best.
- Yes, Ji Hyo.

948
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,150
Ji Hyo is good, indeed.

949
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,089
Ye Eun, you should cheat
or something. Kick the other table.

950
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,359
My shoulder muscles are stiff.

951
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,960
(Time is up.)

952
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,230
All right. Now...

953
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,329
(Blowing a whistle)

954
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:15,430
All right. Now...

955
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:16,829
The mission is over now.

956
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,069
- Let's have everyone come here.
- It's over.

957
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,839
- Look at her!
- We have zero!

958
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,869
Ji Hyo did a lot.

959
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,410
She's great.

960
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,509
- We won!
- I mean...

961
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,880
- Why did you team us up like this?
- We won.

962
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
- It's over.
- Are we in last place?

963
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,279
- Ye Eun.
- Hey, I said to take your bag off.

964
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,880
- Se Chan bumped my table.
- Ye Eun.

965
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,480
- That's why they fell over.
- Ye Eun.

966
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:37,289
- You should've hit his table too.
- Then, shouldn't we say...

967
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,460
- Yes, good job.
- Ji Hyo had the longest dominoes.

968
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,289
So, this family is in 1st place,
you guys are in 2nd,

969
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,599
- and you're in last place.
- Okay!

970
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,230
- Second place isn't too bad.
- Ye Bong.

971
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,130
- Sorry, Ye Eun. It was a strategy.
- You should be sorry.

972
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,269
Your hair.

973
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:53,869
What about my hair?

974
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,170
- There's a lot of cream.
- You have cream in your hair.

975
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,210
Sure.

976
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:58,980
But from what I could see,
Ye Eun made a lot of mistakes.

977
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,609
- Ye Eun, you're a troublemaker.
- I know, right?

978
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,150
You don't even know anything.

979
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,210
No, you're just a knucklehead.

980
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,650
(No, you're just a knucklehead)

981
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,750
- Add "super" to it.
- Gosh, seriously?

982
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,820
Super knucklehead.

983
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,250
Super knuckle!

984
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:12,760
Super knuckle!
Not salute. Super knuckle!

985
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,059
(They start teasing the youngest
without fail.)

986
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:16,030
If you were a soldier,
you'd be in the Knucklehead Corps.

987
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,590
- Ye Eun,
- Super knuckle!

988
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,130
you have a new nickname
called Toadface.

989
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,460
Who said that?

990
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,300
- Haha called you Toadface.
- No.

991
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,769
Toadface, Super knuckle.

992
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:24,929
- Flatfish.
- Flatfish.

993
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,099
No.

994
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,400
That means you look like that too.

995
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,840
- Flatfish was really my nickname...
- Then you look like it too.

996
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,269
- in elementary school.
- Her nickname in elementary school!

997
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,570
- Flatfish was really my nickname...
- Then you look like it too.

998
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,980
- in elementary school.
- Her nickname in elementary school!

999
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,010
- Si Eun.
- For real?

1000
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,050
- For real.
- Seriously?

1001
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,150
- You were Flatfish in school?
- Really?

1002
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,179
- Hey, haven't you made that face?
- Try it. What is it?

1003
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,289
- Going like this.
- What is it?

1004
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,349
I made many friends laugh
with that face.

1005
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,090
- What is it?
- This face.

1006
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,789
- Just going like this.
- Hey, Ye Eun.

1007
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,360
Hey, Si Eun. How can your nickname
in elementary school...

1008
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,889
- be Flatfish?
- But...

1009
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,900
Ye Eun is Flatfish
even without making that face.

1010
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,199
- I seriously can't put up with you.
- You can't put up with him?

1011
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,070
Now is the time when you can
increase your bank balance...

1012
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,809
with someone else's bank balance.

1013
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,809
Choose the card of a family
of your choice,

1014
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:08,139
and you can make a single
wire transfer for an amount you want.

1015
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,179
Ye Eun's card.

1016
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:13,019
The amount you transfer will
build up in your family's account.

1017
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,849
If you try to transfer
an amount larger than the balance,

1018
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,019
you will obviously not get
any money.

1019
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:21,989
We'll only reveal which family
you tried to transfer money from.

1020
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,690
- Oh, really?
- We won't tell you...

1021
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,389
if the transfer went through
or how much you transferred.

1022
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,860
There is a benefit...

1023
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,400
- for the family in first place.
- What is it?

1024
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,000
Regardless of whether you succeed
in transferring money or not,

1025
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,800
you will get one more chance.

1026
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,670
Gosh, that's so nice.

1027
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:35,809
That's awesome.

1028
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,610
- We should try a big amount first.
- A huge amount at first.

1029
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,610
- Yes, let's go for a lot.
- Oh, that's nice.

1030
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,849
According to the results
of the mission from earlier,

1031
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,579
the 3rd place family will go 1st.

1032
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,949
So, once that team's balance
goes up,

1033
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,519
- Will we transfer from that amount?
- are we taking away from that?

1034
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,650
- Yes.
- Oh, really?

1035
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,289
- That's why first place is good.
- You're right.

1036
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:55,960
- That's a huge advantage.
- Right, we could get more.

1037
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,789
You just have to be in first place.

1038
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:58,960
First place is the best for sure.

1039
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,099
- If they don't do it...
- Second place doesn't matter.

1040
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,929
Gosh, this is...
Do you guys have a lot of money?

1041
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,829
- Yes.
- We have a lot.

1042
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,829
- Earlier, we...
- They have a lot.

1043
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,099
- Ye Eun caught us.
- Then we could...

1044
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,539
- I caught a glimpse.
- Oh, really?

1045
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:08,769
- They have a lot.
- They do?

1046
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:09,869
(In the waiting room
before the mission began)

1047
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,610
How much money did you draw?

1048
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,880
I think it was 120 dollars?

1049
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,880
(Laughing)

1050
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,179
Am I not supposed to tell you?

1051
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:17,710
This is awesome.

1052
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,949
She asked me how much money I got,
and I just told her...

1053
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:21,750
- that I drew 120 dollars.
- What?

1054
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,989
I told her that I drew 120 dollars.

1055
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,360
The shoot is over.
Today's shoot is ruined.

1056
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,489
I'll still lose, though.

1057
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,590
We have a lot.

1058
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,860
- Earlier, we... Ye Eun caught us.
- They have a lot.

1059
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,260
- I caught a glimpse.
- Oh, really?

1060
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,760
- They have a lot.
- First off,

1061
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,070
Haha's family in last place...

1062
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,340
- can go first.
- It's us.

1063
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,539
- Who should we choose?
- You know.

1064
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,099
- Let's go for now.
- Let's decide there.

1065
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,110
Super knuckle.

1066
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,610
- Se Chan and Jae Seok. For sure.
- Se Chan and Jae Seok?

1067
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,079
- Because of personal reasons?
- I can't forgive them.

1068
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,820
- They called you Flatfish.
- I'm so mad.

1069
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,719
- I really can't forgive them.
- Super knuckle.

1070
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,019
I'm going to get revenge today.

1071
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:58,320
Flatfish is mad, and that anchovy...

1072
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,889
The anchovy and bucktooth...

1073
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:02,289
- I mean, the Bucktooth Family.
- Yes, Bucktooth.

1074
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:05,190
- You know, the Bucktooth Family.
- Yes, the Bucktooth Family.

1075
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,230
- How much?
- We'll take 80 dollars.

1076
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,699
- Yes, 80.
- Are you sure?

1077
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:09,000
- Yes, 80 is correct.
- Yes, totally.

1078
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,329
That team said
they drew 120 dollars.

1079
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,500
Okay, let's go for it.

1080
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,940
- Eighty.
- Eighty.

1081
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,639
(They trust Jong Hyuk's spoiler
and try to transfer 80 dollars.)

1082
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,869
Hey, how much did you draw?

1083
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,769
- I had 20 dollars.
- Wasn't it 20 dollars?

1084
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,940
Can you move out of the way?

1085
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,340
(Can you move out of the way?)

1086
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:23,150
- You had 50 dollars, right?
- Yes.

1087
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:24,909
Come on.

1088
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:27,179
(She forces her way back in.)

1089
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:29,019
Right now, Haha's team...

1090
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,989
- chose Jae Seok's team.
- Oh, is that so?

1091
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,719
- I knew they would do that.
- Yes.

1092
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,489
Their money? Then theirs...

1093
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
(Jae Seok's family)

1094
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,929
(They try to transfer 80 dollars.)

1095
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:41,159
Please!

1096
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,230
(Will they succeed in transferring
80 dollars?)

1097
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,269
Please.

1098
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:47,800
- Are we using this money on food?
- Oh, are we?

1099
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,610
(They check the result.)

1100
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,940
- The transaction has been denied.
- What?

1101
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,139
(They fail to transfer 80 dollars.)

1102
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,010
- Can they really have so little?
- What?

1103
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,380
That's more than their balance?

1104
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,079
- No way. That can't be.
- Hang on.

1105
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,550
The balance is too low.

1106
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,119
Darn it, Flatfish.

1107
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,590
- No way!
- Seriously?

1108
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
No way.

1109
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,059
That means they lied to me.

1110
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,929
No, but Jong Hyuk told me...

1111
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,130
- That was a lie!
- It was a lie?

1112
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,360
- Why would you fall for that?
- My gosh. Seriously?

1113
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,099
- I didn't know he'd lie right away.
- My goodness.

1114
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,900
Why would you actually believe that?

1115
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,139
I didn't think he'd lie
when he's here for the first time.

1116
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:22,570
Gosh, Flatfish. You're so...

1117
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,869
- Did Flatfish make another mistake?
- I didn't think you'd be like that.

1118
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,010
I didn't think you'd be like that.

1119
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:28,809
(Are you laughing?)

1120
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,449
I didn't take you
for that kind of guy.

1121
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,619
Super knuckle!

1122
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,949
All right. We'll be back.

1123
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:36,349
- Thank you.
- The second place team will go.

1124
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,590
It was actually a lie.

1125
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,460
Joo Jong Hyuk is an actor.

1126
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,690
- They must've thought we had 120.
- I think they did.

1127
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,659
- I'm sure they failed.
- They failed.

1128
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:47,260
- He said he drew 120 dollars?
- Yes.

1129
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,630
- Hey, you must not know...
- How could he have 120?

1130
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,929
because you're a newbie
on Running Man.

1131
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,829
- No, but I'm...
- The highest amount right now...

1132
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,539
- I'm a manager...
- If he had 120...

1133
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:57,210
- or assistant manager level. Yes.
- You?

1134
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,440
- You?
- You're still on probation.

1135
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,179
- You're not even an intern now.
- That's right.

1136
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:01,409
- I'm not an assistant manager?
- No.

1137
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:04,380
- You haven't even been here a year.
- You're a part-timer right now.

1138
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,449
I went past the part-timer phase
after three months.

1139
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,349
Senior Managing Directors,
isn't this too much?

1140
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,889
- What's wrong, Director Ha?
- Is Haha a director now?

1141
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:13,590
Hey, Assistant Manager Jee.
What do you think?

1142
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,960
- What did you say?
- Isn't this infuriating?

1143
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,530
Hey, Assistant Manager Jee.
What do you think?

1144
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:18,860
- What did you say?
- Isn't this infuriating?

1145
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,030
Am I an assistant manager?

1146
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,659
(Assistant Manager Jee,
16 years on Running Man)

1147
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,800
- I mean...
- Am I an assistant manager?

1148
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,099
- Gosh, I'm so angry.
- Why are you angry?

1149
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,539
- We have to take Haha's money.
- Yes.

1150
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,639
But if Jong Kook's team
takes money from us twice,

1151
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,909
our balance would become known.

1152
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:34,639
Then, should we go with Ye Eun's?

1153
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,949
- Ye Eun's team has a lot of money.
- Wait. This is a dilemma.

1154
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:39,079
If we bring some over
from this team,

1155
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,980
- the next team will take it all.
- They will. They will know.

1156
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,019
- That's why 1st place is best.
- That's right.

1157
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,820
They have two chances.

1158
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,989
- Then...
- Should we just take ten dollars?

1159
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:50,289
No, 30. Or 20 dollars.

1160
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:51,760
- Let's try 30 dollars.
- Or 20 dollars.

1161
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,460
- Let's try 30 dollars.
- From Ye Eun's team?

1162
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,000
- Let's take 30 from Ye Eun's.
- Okay.

1163
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,530
- We should still check.
- Because... Yes.

1164
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,400
- If we fail... That's right.
- If we fail, the balance is lower.

1165
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,469
- Okay.
- Okay.

1166
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,300
We'll transfer 30 dollars
from Ye Eun's account.

1167
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,869
Thirty dollars.

1168
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:05,940
(They try to transfer 30 dollars
from Haha's account.)

1169
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,840
The transaction has been completed.

1170
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,250
(They succeed
in transferring money.)

1171
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,650
(They're excited
after taking 30 dollars.)

1172
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,889
- How should we react?
- Hang on.

1173
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:17,820
- Jae Seok, should we just...
- Act like we failed.

1174
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,119
Then should we look dejected?

1175
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:21,789
- Let's do some weird reactions.
- What are weird reactions?

1176
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:23,889
- Just pretend like we failed.
- Darn it.

1177
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,329
(They're putting on an act
after taking only 30 dollars.)

1178
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,460
- What happened?
- Hey, Jae Seok is smiling.

1179
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,000
(Their lips are twitching.)

1180
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
- They withdrew money.
- Hey, Jae Seok...

1181
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,139
Hey, Jae Seok's lips are twitching.
He's smiling.

1182
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,210
- They succeeded.
- They succeeded.

1183
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,070
Hey, Jong Hyuk smiled too.

1184
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,980
- I think they succeeded.
- I know it.

1185
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,280
It won't be easy.

1186
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
I bet they withdrew money.

1187
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,079
Team Jae Seok targeted Team Haha.

1188
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,380
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1189
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,519
- They didn't target us?
- Now it's time...

1190
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,650
for the team in first place.

1191
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,190
We got this. Let's go.

1192
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,219
Jong Kook, go after this team.
They have enough money.

1193
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,519
- I second that.
- Absolutely.

1194
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,989
- Remember I'm family, Seok Jin.
- We were the safe choice.

1195
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,530
- Chungju Ji.
- Chungju Jee.

1196
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,630
- Cross!
- Cross!

1197
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,460
Remember I'm family, Seok Jin.

1198
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,659
(Seok Jin's family gets 2 attempts.
Which account will they go after?)

1199
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,070
We should target
Team Jae Seok, right?

1200
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,929
- Yes.
- They should be our target.

1201
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,699
- We'll aim for 150 dollars first.
- Yes, 100 dollars.

1202
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:08,400
- We'll withdraw 150 dollars.
- How about 170 dollars?

1203
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,670
- We...
- Or maybe 180 dollars.

1204
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,409
- Go for 170 or 180.
- No way.

1205
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:12,840
We get two attempts.

1206
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,110
- Let's go for a simple 150.
- That's already a lot.

1207
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,179
Is 150 dollars a lot?

1208
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:17,650
I got five dollars, remember?

1209
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,780
That was way too low.

1210
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,519
I bet the highest amount
was 100 dollars.

1211
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,380
Let's go for 150, then.

1212
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,320
- Jae Seok's family, 150 dollars?
- Yes, Jae Seok's.

1213
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,519
We'll give it a shot.

1214
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:26,719
Let's see.

1215
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,159
- The transaction has been denied.
- It was maxed out.

1216
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:30,989
- I said 150 dollars was too much.
- They don't even have 150?

1217
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,429
- It's too much.
- Let's only aim for 100.

1218
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,159
- You two got a decent amount.
- Is that so?

1219
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,469
- Was it to throw us off?
- How about 80 dollars?

1220
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,000
What do you say to 80 dollars?

1221
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,469
- We need to succeed this time.
- I only got us five dollars.

1222
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:43,340
- Let's try for 80.
- Let's try 80 dollars.

1223
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
You never know.

1224
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,739
Those three might've all
been unlucky with the scratchcards.

1225
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,280
Still, they must've at least
taken 50 dollars.

1226
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,519
They couldn't have started off
with only 30 dollars.

1227
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,980
- Let's try for 80.
- But...

1228
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,519
- Sure, 80.
- Let's try 80 dollars.

1229
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,550
Yes, without a doubt.

1230
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,159
(Haha's family tried taking
80 dollars from Jae Seok's family.)

1231
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,889
(There wasn't enough money,
and they failed.)

1232
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:08,829
(However, Jae Seok's family stole
30 dollars from Haha's family.)

1233
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:12,769
(Will Jae Seok's family
now have more than 80 dollars?)

1234
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,940
Let's listen to Ji Hyo.

1235
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,599
(They try taking 80 dollars
from Jae Seok's family.)

1236
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,510
- I think they'll have 80 dollars.
- Of course they do.

1237
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:21,239
(Will they be able
to transfer 80 dollars?)

1238
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,250
The transaction has been denied.

1239
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,849
(Transaction was denied.)

1240
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,179
- Don't they even have 80 dollars?
- Not even 80 dollars?

1241
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,280
No way.

1242
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,420
How can they not
even have 80 dollars?

1243
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,449
We were lucky with our scratchcards.

1244
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,260
There won't be any joy
from trying to take our money twice.

1245
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,519
- They targeted you twice.
- Really?

1246
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,630
Okay.

1247
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,130
(Jae Seok's family happily revealed
their scratchcards.)

1248
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,159
Okay.

1249
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,800
- Not bad?
- Hold on.

1250
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,929
Okay, not bad.

1251
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,099
(Ten dollars)

1252
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:47,369
(Jae Seok got 10 dollars.)

1253
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,099
Mine isn't so bad.

1254
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,570
(Five dollars)

1255
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,769
Not bad.

1256
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:54,780
(What about Jong Hyuk
who said he won 120 dollars?)

1257
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,210
(Ten dollars)

1258
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,309
(All he got was ten dollars.)

1259
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,780
We have 25 dollars.

1260
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,150
I think we have
the second highest amount.

1261
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:06,219
(They thought they did all right
after only winning 25 dollars.)

1262
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:09,559
Like that, the first round
of transfer has been completed.

1263
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,489
Now that it's over,

1264
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,699
I'll let each family know
their current balance.

1265
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:15,559
How much do we have?

1266
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:17,300
The last team to transfer money...

1267
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,030
That's right. I'm sure of it.

1268
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,099
Let's check.

1269
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,969
We survived.

1270
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:24,170
We're at a minus.

1271
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,210
(Team Jae Seok: 55 dollars)

1272
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,610
The balance can never go below zero.

1273
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,639
- This isn't it.
- Oh, no.

1274
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:28,780
It's not? Are you sure?

1275
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,980
- But...
- I'll go and ask.

1276
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,820
- Is this a minus sign?
- No.

1277
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,550
- You startled us.
- That startled us.

1278
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,949
- It's not possible.
- We thought we were in debt.

1279
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:38,550
- Exactly.
- Why would you write it like that?

1280
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,789
That's a weird way to write it.

1281
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:42,090
(Seok Jin's family earned nothing
even after winning the game.)

1282
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,590
Okay, fine.

1283
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,530
(Haha's family lost 30 dollars,)

1284
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,730
(but their balance
is still dominating.)

1285
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:52,099
Okay. Gosh, this isn't easy.

1286
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,269
- Okay.
- Right.

1287
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:55,539
You must be hungry right around now.

1288
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:58,070
Today's lunch
will blast away your stress.

1289
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,679
It's the chicken feet combo.

1290
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:00,980
- Nice!
- I love it!

1291
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,679
Since Haha is promoting
a different brand of the same dish,

1292
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,909
- he'll be given something else.
- Why?

1293
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,820
- Which brand?
- Will we not get to eat as well?

1294
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,880
- No, we'll get to eat.
- Got it.

1295
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,420
(What a relief.)

1296
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,860
- That looks delicious.
- That looks amazing!

1297
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,389
(The chicken feet combo
Haha can't eat is delivered.)

1298
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:15,489
It looks incredible.

1299
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,329
Gosh, this is crazy. Unbelievable!

1300
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,059
- I can't believe this.
- No way.

1301
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,000
- I'm gushing over this.
- Have your fill.

1302
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,230
- No way.
- Can you believe this?

1303
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:24,500
- That looks good.
- I'll enjoy this.

1304
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,369
- Is this the chicken neck?
- Yes, the neck.

1305
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:27,469
- No way.
- My gosh.

1306
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,170
We're given it separately.

1307
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,909
(The big brother who works out
has his proteins first.)

1308
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:32,070
Boneless chicken feet.

1309
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,039
Ji Hyo must want soju with that.

1310
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,780
- This calls for drinks.
- I'll have that.

1311
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,480
(The younger sister who loves food
inhales the chicken feet in sauce.)

1312
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,150
- It's incredible.
- It's so good.

1313
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,050
The chicken feet in sauce
is to die for.

1314
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,650
- It's really good.
- No way.

1315
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,219
This is unbelievable.

1316
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,320
- My gosh.
- The smokiness...

1317
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,489
is out of this world.

1318
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:48,989
My gosh.

1319
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,489
It's so good.

1320
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,329
- Seriously.
- I like how it's easy to debone.

1321
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,730
- No way.
- It's not that spicy.

1322
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,599
(Yummy)

1323
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,539
(The flatfish sisters
are in the zone.)

1324
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,809
That looks incredible.

1325
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,710
These days, such meals...

1326
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,179
- They serve incredible meals.
- Tell me about it.

1327
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,050
Is this a boneless option?

1328
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:12,380
(Frowning)

1329
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,619
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

1330
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,420
No way.

1331
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:18,349
- I've been craving this.
- Right?

1332
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,820
This is really good.

1333
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,960
(The flavors add dimension
to the face.)

1334
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,190
This is incredible.

1335
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,590
- You know...
- It's so good.

1336
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,300
- That's the best.
- It's spicy.

1337
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:27,760
- They love to eat.
- I know.

1338
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,269
- Look at them eat.
- We have chicken neck.

1339
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,929
(With eyebrows pinched together,
they cram the food in their mouths.)

1340
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,239
(And here's someone
who has been forgotten.)

1341
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:40,010
(Is the food any good?)

1342
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:42,110
What's he up to
with that packed lunch?

1343
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,480
I can't believe him.

1344
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,409
- It's so good.
- Ye Eun...

1345
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,820
went crazy over food again.

1346
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,449
Chicken feet are best
eaten as wraps.

1347
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,519
I love this.

1348
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,250
No way.

1349
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:52,550
What's going on?

1350
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,860
It's so good. Try this.

1351
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:55,619
- No way.
- It's good.

1352
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,090
Have it as a wrap. A wrap.

1353
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,429
- What?
- As a wrap.

1354
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:05,170
(She's suddenly filming
her own TV commercial.)

1355
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,199
Is it good?

1356
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,199
What are you doing? What was that?

1357
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,639
I had a wrap, that's all.

1358
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,469
- How is it?
- It's good.

1359
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,739
- Did you have it as a wrap?
- Yes.

1360
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,010
It's incredible.

1361
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,409
- It's so good.
- Try this.

1362
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:17,409
- It's sushi.
- Hey.

1363
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,050
- Come here.
- It's so good.

1364
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,679
Bring me your plate.

1365
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:23,090
- It looks so good.
- Go ahead.

1366
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,519
(It's handed to Si Eun,
the new food fighter.)

1367
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,389
- Isn't it good?
- That's what I'm talking about!

1368
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:31,659
Make a rice ball first and then...
You know the drill.

1369
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,900
- That looks good.
- This is incredible.

1370
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,159
(She made another one
and gifted it to herself.)

1371
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,199
- Is it good?
- While you eat,

1372
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,739
- I'll explain the next game.
- Sure.

1373
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:43,340
The next game is called
Find the Doppelgangers.

1374
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:46,309
At the store or marketplace,

1375
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:47,510
you'll find an object...

1376
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,949
that resembles a family member
on an opposing team.

1377
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,449
The family who finds the object...

1378
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:52,750
- that resembles someone the most...
- An object?

1379
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,320
will be given a benefit.

1380
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,349
Jae Seok's family
will look for objects...

1381
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,289
that resemble someone
in Haha's family.

1382
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,619
- We should go to a fish market.
- We only have to buy a flatfish.

1383
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,519
- A flatfish and halibut.
- Yes, a halibut.

1384
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,860
Haha's family
will look for objects...

1385
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,690
that resemble someone
in Seok Jin's family.

1386
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,400
And Seok Jin's family
will look for objects...

1387
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,000
that resemble someone
in Jae Seok's family.

1388
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,099
A webfoot octopus.
That family also...

1389
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,369
An aged seokbakji
will do for that family.

1390
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,610
Or maybe an aged pumpkin.

1391
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,309
An aged pumpkin.

1392
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:21,739
- It'll be easy for us.
- Go to the market and...

1393
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,849
Find anything
with protruding mouths.

1394
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:27,079
Once you're done with your meal,

1395
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:29,920
you'll head to the store
and marketplace.

1396
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,650
The task is too easy for us.

1397
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,559
- It's too easy for us.
- I know.

1398
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:36,019
Even Si Eun
called herself a flatfish.

1399
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,460
By saying it too much,
it won't be much of a shock.

1400
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:41,460
- Right.
- They'll get used to it.

1401
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,969
- Rather than saying it...
- Flatfish.

1402
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,940
It'd be fun to bring the flatfish
if we hadn't said it that much.

1403
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,570
- We said it too much.
- It wouldn't be as fun anymore.

1404
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,739
It would've been better
to target Seok Jin's family.

1405
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,239
- We'd teach them a lesson.
- I have so many ideas...

1406
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,280
- for Seok Jin.
- Exactly.

1407
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:58,179
I could've gotten his lookalike
somewhere nearby.

1408
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,650
- Right.
- Right?

1409
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,280
- The last leaf maybe.
- Exactly.

1410
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,780
- The last leaf?
- The last leaf.

1411
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,019
- That's Seok Jin.
- He could be anything.

1412
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:08,960
Do you know
the withered grass in winter?

1413
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,190
- The withered grass in winter.
- Right.

1414
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,199
- Melted snow.
- Yes, melted snow.

1415
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:15,230
It can be anything.

1416
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,599
- A sign that has fallen.
- A plain stone.

1417
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:19,429
- We can pick up leaves too.
- Right.

1418
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,869
- Seok Jin...
- I have so many ideas for him.

1419
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:23,139
Dissing him
is a default mode for you.

1420
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,010
(Haha's family arrives
at the supermarket.)

1421
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,010
We need to win and then think.

1422
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,039
- We must win.
- Of course.

1423
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,440
It's about time we won.

1424
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,250
- Please.
- Please. I want to win a game.

1425
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,420
Same here.

1426
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:35,880
- Let's win this round.
- Please.

1427
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,019
- Hello.
- Hi!

1428
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:39,760
- Mr. Haha!
- They're adorable.

1429
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,989
They called you Mr. Haha.

1430
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:42,889
Hi, guys.

1431
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:44,659
They're adorable.

1432
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:45,929
- Haha.
- How adorable.

1433
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:48,559
- When I was in elementary school,
- Yes?

1434
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,929
I saw you guys filming Running Man.

1435
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,869
- Really?
- I saw you guys filming.

1436
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:55,539
- It was a window just like this.
- And?

1437
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:57,440
Jong Kook and...

1438
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,369
- you were also there.
- Really?

1439
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,780
- You were resting.
- I see.

1440
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,280
- I went up to you...
- Goodness.

1441
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,280
- and did this.
- And?

1442
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,320
- You waved back so cheerfully.
- Really?

1443
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,289
That's why it became my dream.

1444
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,119
- Nice.
- It became my dream.

1445
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,619
- I wanted to be on the show.
- I love that comment just now.

1446
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,019
Si Eun!

1447
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,090
And now I'm here on the show
I dreamed to be on.

1448
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,500
- My dream came true.
- Did you see that?

1449
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,800
She's sulking.

1450
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,369
Ye Eun!

1451
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,869
(Teasing her until the very end)

1452
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,909
Did you see that?

1453
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,469
That's the kind of thing
one should say.

1454
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,510
I feel the same way.

1455
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,139
- I feel the same way.
- You should make something up...

1456
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,110
- to praise me.
- No, for real.

1457
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,309
I saw you filming Running Man
in Sinchon.

1458
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:39,920
- In Sinchon?
- Yes.

1459
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,619
Right. I remember that giant.

1460
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,489
The little giant.

1461
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,820
(They enter the supermarket
where they can find everything.)

1462
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,760
I already found Seok Jin's item.

1463
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,530
Jong Kook.

1464
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,329
The snow crab looks
kind of like Jong Kook.

1465
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:54,030
- Oh, you're right.
- Hang on.

1466
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,670
(Will they be able to find
the right items?)

1467
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:01,440
Oh, don't you think it'd be funny
to choose this for Jong Kook?

1468
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,909
I thought of you when I saw this.

1469
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,539
You don't have any sunglasses
that fit you.

1470
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:08,840
Will you try this on once?
I think this will fit you.

1471
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,010
- Will you try it on?
- No, but Jong Kook... This is...

1472
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,710
Try it on here and come on out.

1473
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,820
- You too.
- Oh, me?

1474
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:17,590
Where is yours? You two are twins.

1475
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,219
Is this right? Darn it.

1476
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:20,519
Let me see. That fits now, right?

1477
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:23,489
Hey! See? These are sunglasses.

1478
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,360
She is...
Gosh, you should buy this one.

1479
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,860
In 1, 2, 3.

1480
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:30,230
Look. She can't wear any sunglasses
because of her nose.

1481
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,269
But this fits.

1482
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:32,400
Si Eun, you can't find ones
that fit either, right?

1483
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,099
Try this on.

1484
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,369
For real.

1485
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,869
- Gosh, seriously?
- This fits so well on all of us.

1486
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,380
Let me see, Si Eun.

1487
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:42,809
Am I pretty?

1488
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,519
Does it look okay?

1489
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:48,579
- Si Eun, that's yours.
- Hey, you guys should each...

1490
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,449
- That was made for you.
- Should we wear these as we go in?

1491
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,690
- What do you say? I'll buy them.
- Ye Eun.

1492
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:53,920
- No.
- No!

1493
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,619
- No. We have to save money.
- It's only 1.5 dollars.

1494
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,329
- Oh, it's 12 dollars.
- Save money.

1495
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,760
- I'll buy them for you.
- No!

1496
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,929
- They were perfect.
- Come on.

1497
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,630
- Let's go.
- Hey.

1498
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,400
- Gosh, seriously.
- Gosh, seriously.

1499
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,829
We don't wear things like that.

1500
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:06,840
(By the way,
when will they do the mission?)

1501
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,469
- Right. Is there something good?
- Shall we go?

1502
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:11,440
Is there something
that will make everyone laugh?

1503
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,070
Traditional markets have
their own vibe.

1504
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,280
Markets are fun.

1505
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,079
Oh, my. Hello.

1506
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:17,309
(Jae Seok's family's
lookalike assignment)

1507
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:19,309
You know, Jae Seok, for Ye Eun...

1508
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,320
Hey, this is Seok Jin.

1509
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,079
- For sure... Dried radish greens.
- Dried radish greens.

1510
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,119
- I want to take a bit of that.
- Just a bit...

1511
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,389
Excuse me, ma'am.

1512
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,130
We just need one strand of this.

1513
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,289
Is this for sale?

1514
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:32,590
You can just take a strand.

1515
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,400
- Oh, is that okay?
- Yes.

1516
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,059
- Thank you, ma'am. One is enough.
- Sure.

1517
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,599
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1518
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,199
Goodness, Seok Jin.
You must be tired.

1519
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:41,769
- Don't drop him.
- Oh, this is so...

1520
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:43,869
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1521
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,170
- Be careful with this.
- We should be very careful.

1522
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,579
- It's too dry. It's crumbling.
- Yes.

1523
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,909
Goodness,
there are bunches of Seok Jin here.

1524
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:53,280
- Oh, Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin...

1525
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,590
It's a colony of Seok Jins.

1526
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:57,949
- Shouldn't we bow to him?
- Seok Jin...

1527
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,219
Goodness, Seok Jin.

1528
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:01,289
- Seok Jin...
- Why are we bowing?

1529
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:02,519
(The polite younger brothers bow to
their big brother as they meet him.)

1530
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,530
- Goodness, Seok Jin.
- Brother.

1531
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,429
We're here, brother.

1532
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,059
Goodness, brother.

1533
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,630
(Laughing)

1534
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,139
It's a colony of Seok Jins.

1535
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,909
Seok Jin is all over the place.

1536
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:19,570
Hey, this is...

1537
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:22,110
If you spot something
that looks similar,

1538
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,480
- say something.
- Okay.

1539
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,550
(They leave Seok Sam behind for now
and start their real mission.)

1540
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,420
(Exclaiming)

1541
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,489
These aren't all that...
Gosh, these look tasty.

1542
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:34,119
- Hey, we should get chapsal donuts.
- Chapsal donuts?

1543
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,460
Should we buy
a few black rice donuts?

1544
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,860
- Gosh, ma'am...
- You're so handsome!

1545
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,860
- Oh, my.
- Gosh, thank you.

1546
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,960
Thank you.

1547
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,960
- Goodbye.
- Have a good day.

1548
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,099
- Hello.
- Take that off.

1549
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,030
Gosh, how should we eat these?

1550
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,039
(This looks good, doesn't it?)

1551
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,039
It's good.

1552
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:50,340
Oh, it's delicious.

1553
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,309
- So, Ji Ye Eun...
- It's tasty.

1554
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:56,849
How about bean sprouts for Ye Eun?

1555
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:57,909
Jae Seok.

1556
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,079
- How about bean sprouts for Ye Eun?
- Bean sprouts.

1557
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,550
The seaweed stems look good too.

1558
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,719
(Has no strength and is tall)

1559
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:04,949
There are radishes too.

1560
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,489
- Ye Eun does look like a radish.
- Yes, that's right.

1561
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,760
- Anything long looks like her.
- If it's long, it's Ji Ye Eun.

1562
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,329
- Chinese yam.
- Chinese yam?

1563
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,599
- Chinese yam.
- It hurts.

1564
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,670
(It's grubby and tall.)

1565
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:17,699
- But Ye Eun...
- It hurts!

1566
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,940
One that's long.

1567
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,510
(They can't find the right one
among many giants.)

1568
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:26,780
Isn't this Ji Ye Eun?

1569
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,780
- Jae Seok, that one.
- This is Ji Ye Eun!

1570
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,820
- Isn't this Ye Eun? It is, right?
- It is Ye Eun.

1571
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,849
- Should we draw a face on here?
- Yes.

1572
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,550
- We could do that.
- This is Ji Ye Eun.

1573
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,550
How much is this?

1574
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,559
Should we buy a slightly smaller one
for Si Eun?

1575
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,590
- A spoon?
- How about this one, Jae Seok?

1576
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,429
- This one.
- This one.

1577
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,860
- This one is for Si Eun.
- Yes, these two.

1578
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,530
- We'll buy two for now.
- How much is it?

1579
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,929
We bought them too easily.

1580
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,829
- We should look around more.
- Right.

1581
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:52,099
(Jae Seok's family's
lookalike assignment)

1582
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:53,739
- Baby octopus.
- Baby octopus?

1583
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:55,170
- Who is it?
- Haha.

1584
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,570
(They spot Haha
in the stall next door.)

1585
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,739
- Baby octopus. This is so cute.
- It's Haha.

1586
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:02,280
- This is so cute.
- Let's buy a baby octopus for Haha.

1587
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,110
- All right. Let's go.
- Let's take a look.

1588
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:07,949
There will be many items
that look like those guys.

1589
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,519
Our assignment isn't that hard.

1590
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,820
It's easy.
They look unique, to begin with.

1591
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,320
- They look like mugwort rice cakes.
- They do.

1592
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,860
- They're ugly too.
- Mugwort rice cakes? Good idea.

1593
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,659
- Oh, fish.
- There's fish?

1594
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:19,960
- Fish?
- You're right.

1595
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,800
- Hello.
- Hey, over here.

1596
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,800
- Guys, eureka!
- My goodness.

1597
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,800
- Hey, this one.
- We found all of them here.

1598
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,940
- Hello.
- They have squid too.

1599
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,239
- Squid.
- So...

1600
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,969
Oh, the mouth...
Ones with protruding mouths.

1601
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,079
There has to be one that makes us
burst into laughter, right?

1602
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,210
(They search for the ugliest one
among them.)

1603
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,579
One that'll be a big laugh.

1604
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:37,849
(Right then)

1605
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:39,110
Jae Seok!

1606
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,420
- This one?
- Yes, right.

1607
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:43,820
- This is a monkfish.
- Is it a monkfish?

1608
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,119
This is Jae Seok.

1609
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,519
- This is the mouth, right?
- But monkfish is...

1610
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:49,019
That's right.
This one looks like Yu Jae Seok.

1611
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,090
- Right?
- For real, right?

1612
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,960
- Over here! It's Jae Seok!
- It looks like him.

1613
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,800
- Could you hold this up once, sir?
- It does look like him.

1614
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,260
- What's this?
- This is Jae Seok.

1615
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,460
- The face.
- The mouth.

1616
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,469
- Gosh, it looks like him.
- Gosh, this is Jae Seok.

1617
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,269
- Is this Jae Seok?
- My gosh.

1618
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:02,900
- All sorts of fish...
- You're right.

1619
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,809
- look like Jae Seok.
- Yes, right.

1620
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:07,010
- Let's buy one of these too.
- Buy it.

1621
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,110
It smells like herbal medicine.

1622
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,349
Here it is. Seok Jin.

1623
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,019
Seok Jin.

1624
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:16,920
(Dad's underpants)

1625
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,889
I don't know why,
but this pair looks like Seok Jin.

1626
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,019
- Doesn't it look like Seok Jin?
- I detest it so much.

1627
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,230
- You detest it, right?
- I do.

1628
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,489
It's Seok Jin.

1629
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:28,500
- Hang on.
- What about this one? Boxers.

1630
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,369
But this pair kind of looks
like a gentleman.

1631
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:31,530
Look at this.

1632
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,570
Jee Seok Jin.

1633
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,039
But seriously, look.

1634
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,809
- But...
- Seok Jin.

1635
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:39,110
(Boxer briefs)

1636
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,809
(Reminded by a pair of underpants)

1637
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:43,650
It looks just like Seok Jin.
It's so dejected, right?

1638
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,710
(How our dads look from the back)

1639
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,710
This is it.

1640
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,579
- Oh, and...
- What is it?

1641
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:48,920
- Haha.
- What are you looking at?

1642
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,019
Do you keep seeing Seok Jin?

1643
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,719
This is the best.

1644
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:54,719
(As they think of our dads...)

1645
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,489
- This one is...
- Seok Jin!

1646
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,559
- How about this one?
- Hey, should we go there?

1647
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:02,230
- Oh, that sounds good!
- Okay.

1648
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,230
- Let's go.
- Nice.

1649
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,800
Hey, we get along really well.

1650
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,269
- We get along really well.
- We get along.

1651
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:09,369
- We're just shopping. We get along.
- We get along really well.

1652
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:11,969
- We picked them out quickly.
- I know.

1653
00:56:12,409 --> 00:56:15,610
Hey, now that I think of it,
both your names end in Eun.

1654
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,909
- The Eun Sisters.
- The Eun Sisters.

1655
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:20,320
You look the same, but you have
a high nose bridge. Yours is low.

1656
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,679
Hey,
why are you saying it like that?

1657
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,219
Hey, no.

1658
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,159
I just said it like it is. Agreed?

1659
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,019
If that's the case...

1660
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:31,559
Hey, you. Follow me outside.

1661
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:34,599
If that's the case,
I guess my nose is a bit...

1662
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,730
- You know,
- Follow me outside.

1663
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,800
I said she looked like
a baby bulldog. And she said...

1664
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,800
(A bulldog?)

1665
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,769
But you really look like it.

1666
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,340
(On their way back from shopping)

1667
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,110
But if I had my face
and a high nose bridge,

1668
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,780
- it wouldn't look...
- Bulldogs are cute.

1669
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,110
Hey, why? Bulldogs are cute.

1670
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,210
I think
bulldogs are the cutest dogs.

1671
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,579
I'm a Pomeranian.

1672
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:55,519
- What? You?
- I'm a Pomeranian.

1673
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,719
Look at this.
You look exactly like it.

1674
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:58,920
- Look at this.
- They do look alike.

1675
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,489
They look the same!

1676
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,789
- They're the same, right?
- So cute.

1677
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:04,130
- Jong Seo, look.
- I don't look like it!

1678
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,590
They look the same, right?
I told you.

1679
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,300
No, I'm a Pomeranian!

1680
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,829
I'm a Pomeranian!

1681
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,539
I'm a Pomeranian!

1682
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:18,210
You really look alike.
You think so too, right?

1683
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:19,570
That means you look like this too.

1684
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,679
- No, I'm a Bichon Frisé.
- You are...

1685
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,809
- Hey, you are...
- I'm a Bichon Frisé.

1686
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,780
- You look like a Bichon Frisé.
- Look at this.

1687
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:29,780
- You look alike.
- I do too.

1688
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:31,849
You don't have this nose.

1689
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:35,489
- No, but...
- I said I was a Pomeranian!

1690
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,690
A Pomeranian!

1691
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,960
(While the Flatfish Eun Sisters are
having a dogged fight...)

1692
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,159
This is so funny.

1693
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,570
A Pomeranian!
For real, look it up once.

1694
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:46,699
Okay!

1695
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,099
- Hey, Ji Ye Eun.
- Yes?

1696
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:49,239
- Hey.
- Sorry, but the market...

1697
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:50,340
- was full of you.
- Ye Eun.

1698
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:52,809
- There were so many of you.
- You seem so familiar.

1699
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:55,739
Hey, we went to the supermarket,
and there were so many lookalikes.

1700
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,849
There were
so many Yu Jae Seok lookalikes.

1701
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:59,179
We greeted you several times.

1702
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,219
- Jae Seok, why are you everywhere?
- Right.

1703
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:02,380
- Jae Seok.
- We said hi...

1704
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,550
to Jae Seok and Se Chan
several times.

1705
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,719
On our way here,
we bowed to Seok Jin for the new year.

1706
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,559
- We bowed to you.
- For real.

1707
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:10,559
(He gets knocked out
in the initial mind games.)

1708
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,190
- Sorry.
- Don't lie. Darn it.

1709
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,900
- There was a colony of Seok Jins.
- It's true.

1710
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,000
For real.

1711
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
(Who brought
the most shocking lookalike?)

1712
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,840
You each bought items that
resembled the other team members.

1713
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,469
You will now present your items
and the reason for buying them.

1714
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:26,639
- Haha's family will go first.
- Okay.

1715
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:27,840
- Shall we take a look?
- Start.

1716
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,480
- You looked for Seok Jin's family?
- That's right.

1717
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,610
Oh, us?

1718
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,349
Si Eun said she was confident.

1719
00:58:33,449 --> 00:58:34,849
- So, first of all,
- Ye Eun, you can show it.

1720
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,650
we have Ji Hyo's item.

1721
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,989
You found one for Ji Hyo?

1722
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:40,389
- Ji Hyo must've been hard to find.
- Yes.

1723
00:58:40,389 --> 00:58:42,619
As soon as Ye Eun and Si Eun
saw this,

1724
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,030
they said,

1725
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,289
- "This is insane. Ji Hyo!" Me too.
- You found one for Ji Hyo?

1726
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:48,599
- I thought so too.
- Ji Hyo.

1727
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,170
We chose this
because Ji Hyo looks so milky.

1728
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,170
- She's cute too.
- What is that? Isn't it milk?

1729
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,639
- Is it milk?
- It's milk.

1730
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,440
You're so snowy white and clear.

1731
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,809
- And soft. Really.
- You're being nice...

1732
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:00,909
So...

1733
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,679
- It's a carton of soju!
- A carton of soju.

1734
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:05,679
(A carton of soju)

1735
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,119
(Like milk... No, like soju,)

1736
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,289
(she's awfully clear.)

1737
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:14,219
- Hey, that's Ji Hyo!
- A carton of soju.

1738
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,090
- Hey.
- Oh, that's what you're going for.

1739
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,590
- This kind of vibe.
- It's this kind of vibe.

1740
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:18,989
I was going to pick a rock
off the street...

1741
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,000
- for Ji Hyo.
- A pretty big rock.

1742
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,400
- Come on. This is weak.
- Okay.

1743
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,670
- Next, it's Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

1744
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:27,570
- We had so many for Jong Kook.
- Is it me?

1745
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,500
- Yes, there were so many.
- Is it kkakdugi?

1746
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,510
- Just a protein shake.
- Protein.

1747
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,280
This caught our eyes
when we turned the corner.

1748
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:37,210
- Jong Kook is very firm.
- That's right.

1749
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,610
- He's very firm.
- Firm.

1750
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:41,119
- He also carries the spirit...
- Yes.

1751
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,119
and strength of Korea.

1752
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,190
- Seriously.
- What is it?

1753
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,019
- "It's Kim Jong Kook!"
- "It's Kim Jong Kook!"

1754
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:47,789
- What is it?
- A soy sauce dish.

1755
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,960
(A soy sauce dish)

1756
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,289
As soon as we saw it...

1757
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:58,300
(It's well-known that his heart is
as solid as a soy sauce dish.)

1758
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,000
Are you calling him small-minded?

1759
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,139
(He punished Kwang Soo right away.)

1760
01:00:02,469 --> 01:00:05,340
It would've been nice
had you come from the start.

1761
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:07,139
(When he's sullen,)

1762
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:09,940
(he doesn't forgive easily.)

1763
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:11,679
I guess...

1764
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:13,750
there's an intangible resemblance.

1765
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,280
His heart is
as big as a soy sauce dish.

1766
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,289
- It isn't big.
- That's right.

1767
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:20,489
So that's the vibe. How nice.

1768
01:00:20,489 --> 01:00:22,159
- He has a lot of anger.
- All right. He has a point.

1769
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:24,329
- Well done.
- All right.

1770
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,659
To be honest...

1771
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:26,929
- You know, it was weak.
- Let's see the main event.

1772
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:28,860
As for Seok Jin...

1773
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,599
Seok Jin has so many lookalikes.

1774
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:32,300
- The entire Korea is Seok Jin.
- There are so many lookalikes.

1775
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:33,940
- So far, it was sentimental.
- That's right.

1776
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,969
- The resemblance was sentimental.
- Come on.

1777
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:36,440
- It wasn't physical.
- It should be physical.

1778
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,170
The things we showed so far
were one-dimensional...

1779
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,610
and abstract.

1780
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:42,710
- We chose 1 each.
- We chose 1 each.

1781
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,150
- We chose 1 each.
- Are there 3?

1782
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,710
- They're special.
- They come together.

1783
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,820
- They're a set.
- There are too many.

1784
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,719
- They're a set.
- Hey.

1785
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:51,420
You seem very excited.

1786
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,289
- Chungju Ji, you seem very excited.
- Ye Eun is happy.

1787
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:54,360
- They're a set.
- She's happy.

1788
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,860
- They're abstract, okay?
- Okay.

1789
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:57,630
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1790
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,760
Seok Jin.

1791
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:03,530
Look how weak it is.
Do you see how limp it is?

1792
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,570
Seok Jin, he called it weak.

1793
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:07,139
Do you see how limp it is?

1794
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,039
- Seok Jin.
- Doesn't it resemble Seok Jin?

1795
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:10,639
- You know...
- Seok Jin.

1796
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:13,039
Let's bring them together.

1797
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:14,340
Seok Jin.

1798
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:16,380
- Seok Jin.
- All of them are sentimental.

1799
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,409
- Seriously.
- It flaps around.

1800
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:19,380
- The resemblance isn't physical.
- Hey.

1801
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,480
- Weak.
- Let's show the weakest item.

1802
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,050
Let's begin.

1803
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:26,190
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa.

1804
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,119
- She thought of her grandpa...
- No.

1805
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:29,190
and cried.

1806
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:31,960
She saw this and cried
while saying, "Grandpa."

1807
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:35,260
- Grandpa.
- Give him a hug.

1808
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,929
- I hope Seok Jin wears them.
- For goodness' sake.

1809
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:39,829
- They're limp.
- Please wear them.

1810
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,300
I wear Calvin Klein.

1811
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,699
Please put it on.

1812
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,170
Calvin Klein.

1813
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,280
- I wear Calvin Klein and Armani.
- The cap is cute.

1814
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:49,079
- Isn't the cap cute?
- It's cute.

1815
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,079
- Please put it on.
- Please put it on.

1816
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:53,179
- Please put it on.
- For goodness' sake. All right.

1817
01:01:57,019 --> 01:02:00,590
(It suits him well!)

1818
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,019
(He's like the father
who moved to the countryside.)

1819
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,130
- It's perfect.
- It's nice.

1820
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:08,760
Hey, why does it suit him well?

1821
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,769
- Si Eun seems to be excited.
- Give him the items.

1822
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:12,599
- We just met.
- Si Eun likes grandpas.

1823
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:14,199
- My goodness. Okay.
- Their presentation is over.

1824
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:17,340
- Up next is Seok Jin's family.
- Seok Jin's family.

1825
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,909
- It's us.
- We can't wait.

1826
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:19,940
- We...
- I'm really excited.

1827
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,840
- The items that resemble us?
- So many items resembled Jae Seok.

1828
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,139
As for us,

1829
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,610
we chose the items
that bore physical resemblance.

1830
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,119
- This one...
- Are you sure?

1831
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,420
This one fell over.
For goodness' sake.

1832
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,820
- A black plastic bag?
- This one fell over.

1833
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,889
Hold on.

1834
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:33,449
Why are all of our items
in a black plastic bag?

1835
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,289
Haha, why are all of our items
in a black plastic bag?

1836
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:37,429
- Hey.
- It's annoying.

1837
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:39,960
- You know...
- Now, I can smell the sea.

1838
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,300
- He put on gloves.
- Firstly...

1839
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,400
He put on gloves.

1840
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,699
How annoying.

1841
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:48,440
Get me a pair of gloves.

1842
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:50,239
- I have it.
- Do you have them?

1843
01:02:50,869 --> 01:02:52,010
Is it a new pair of gloves?

1844
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,239
- Come on.
- We can't use bare hands.

1845
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:56,039
- Firstly,
- Firstly...

1846
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:57,480
this is a preview.

1847
01:02:58,309 --> 01:03:00,579
- You need to heat things up.
- Okay.

1848
01:03:00,579 --> 01:03:01,949
- This is Jong Hyuk.
- Jong Hyuk.

1849
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,190
- It was hard to find Jong Hyuk.
- It was hard.

1850
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,820
- It was so hard to find Jong Hyuk.
- We did find something.

1851
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,559
- Is it a frog?
- Hey.

1852
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,960
In the end, we found something
that looked exactly like Jong Hyuk.

1853
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,730
The skin tone...

1854
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,400
- and overall vibe...
- The skin tone is the same.

1855
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,369
- What is it?
- It was hard.

1856
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:18,869
(What's the item?)

1857
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:20,369
It was hard.

1858
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:21,940
This is Jong Hyuk.

1859
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:23,800
It has eyes.

1860
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:25,909
- Look. It has eyes.
- It's a bit...

1861
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:27,639
This is Jong Hyuk.

1862
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,639
It has eyes.

1863
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,579
- Isn't it a dried persimmon?
- Look. It has eyes.

1864
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:32,909
- It's a chapsal donut.
- We had it earlier.

1865
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,219
- What is it?
- What is it?

1866
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:36,579
- It's a dried persimmon.
- We had it earlier.

1867
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:37,889
- Look.
- The resemblance is unclear.

1868
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:39,250
No, it isn't.

1869
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,449
Our items were better.

1870
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:42,019
- Look.
- That's...

1871
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:43,619
Show us an item
with a strong resemblance.

1872
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:44,659
Hold on.

1873
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:46,889
- They put it in a shopping bag.
- Now...

1874
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,300
- It's raw.
- We'll start with Se Chan.

1875
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,900
- We'll start with Se Chan.
- Okay.

1876
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,969
(The first main dish, Se Chan)

1877
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:53,170
Hey. What's that?

1878
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,570
- Is it a monkfish?
- Are you excited?

1879
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,440
We knew it was Se Chan
the moment we saw it.

1880
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,210
- I talked to it.
- Okay.

1881
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,469
(Which fish looks like Se Chan
in particular?)

1882
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,110
It's Yang Se Chan.

1883
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:05,949
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

1884
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,179
(My goodness)

1885
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:12,250
(It has big fish eyes
and a protruding mouth.)

1886
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,420
- What?
- I see the resemblance.

1887
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,019
- I talked to it.
- Look.

1888
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:16,559
I knew it was Se Chan
as soon as I saw it.

1889
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,860
- It's opening its mouth.
- It resembles Se Chan.

1890
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,559
- Yang Se Chan.
- My goodness.

1891
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:21,360
- Its face resembles his so much.
- It looks scary.

1892
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,900
- Now comes Jae Seok.
- Yes.

1893
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,269
So many items resembled Jae Seok.

1894
01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:26,630
- So many items resembled Jae Seok.
- What is it?

1895
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,139
- So we picked a special kind.
- Okay.

1896
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:32,469
After much consideration,
we agreed to go with this item.

1897
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:34,809
- We said hello to it.
- We did that.

1898
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:36,239
- It's Jae Seok.
- You know,

1899
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,809
- even the seller said hello to it.
- Yes.

1900
01:04:37,849 --> 01:04:40,349
When we asked for a fish
that resembled Jae Seok,

1901
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:41,980
- he recommended it.
- That's right.

1902
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,250
(Even the seller confuses it
with Jae Seok at times!)

1903
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,820
It's an atka mackerel.

1904
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:46,150
It's an atka mackerel.

1905
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,260
Take a look.

1906
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:48,920
It's perfect.

1907
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,460
- It's perfect.
- It looks exactly like Jae Seok.

1908
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,690
It looks exactly like Jae Seok.

1909
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,559
- It's totally Jae Seok.
- Seriously.

1910
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,130
My goodness.

1911
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,300
- Both of them are fishes.
- It resembles you.

1912
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,130
- Why...
- They look the same.

1913
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,300
- I mean...
- They look the same.

1914
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,070
Look. They look the same.

1915
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:04,139
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you laughing?

1916
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:05,840
- Why are you laughing?
- Why is its mouth twisted?

1917
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,639
- What's wrong with its mouth?
- Seriously.

1918
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:10,039
- Seriously.
- The front and side profiles...

1919
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,380
- Its mouth is twisted.
- Its mouth...

1920
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:13,880
It looks exactly like Jae Seok.

1921
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,119
- Why are they in a plastic bag?
- I mean...

1922
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:18,920
Why are our items in a plastic bag?

1923
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,050
- It's like...
- You know,

1924
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,690
the resemblance used to be greater.
But it melted a bit.

1925
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:22,820
It's so gross.

1926
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,690
- The last one is Jae Seok's family.
- We put a lot of effort into it.

1927
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,860
- We have many items.
- Yes.

1928
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,730
- We...
- We'll show some extras.

1929
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,829
- Okay.
- We'll start with that team.

1930
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:31,400
- Start with the extras.
- All right.

1931
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,000
- Seok Jin.
- Me?

1932
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,239
Did you get one for me?

1933
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,969
It's this, a jujube.

1934
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:38,070
- Why is it me?
- A jujube.

1935
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,309
- It's a wrinkly, dried jujube.
- Next.

1936
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:40,940
- And here's the last leaf.
- The last leaf.

1937
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,539
(The last leaf!)

1938
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,480
- It's sentimental. Okay.
- They took...

1939
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,880
the sentimental route.

1940
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,949
- As for this...
- This friend...

1941
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:52,889
This friend has been left behind
for many years.

1942
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:54,389
Had it been left there
a bit longer...

1943
01:05:54,389 --> 01:05:55,420
It's dried radish green.

1944
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,789
(He saved dried radish green.)

1945
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:58,159
- Dried radish green.
- Dried radish green.

1946
01:05:58,159 --> 01:05:59,389
- This is driving me crazy.
- Seok Jin,

1947
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:00,800
ours is better.

1948
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,900
(Seok Jin, ours is better.)

1949
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:04,630
- Seok Jin.
- There were...

1950
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,800
many other items.

1951
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,570
- Now,
- Shall we begin in earnest?

1952
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:08,940
- let's begin in earnest.
- Okay.

1953
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,340
- Start with Haha.
- As for Haha...

1954
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:13,340
- Haha.
- I can't wait.

1955
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,809
(They start with Haha.)

1956
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:16,010
- As for Haha...
- What is it?

1957
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:17,309
- Let's see it.
- I see that it's small.

1958
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:18,679
It's something small.

1959
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:20,820
A baby octopus.

1960
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:21,949
- A baby octopus.
- A baby octopus.

1961
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:23,550
It looks like him, right?

1962
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:24,650
For goodness' sake.

1963
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,690
(The one that brings shame
to the fish market)

1964
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,190
Is it a baby octopus?

1965
01:06:27,389 --> 01:06:29,289
- Is it a baby octopus?
- A baby octopus.

1966
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:30,889
- Haha!
- That's incredible.

1967
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,659
My goodness, there's Haha.

1968
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:35,199
Don't grab my head!

1969
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,659
It's annoying. I hate it...

1970
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,030
- when people touch my head.
- It's a baby octopus.

1971
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,099
- A baby octopus.
- A baby octopus.

1972
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:40,400
- It's Haha.
- Yes.

1973
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,239
(They're off to a good start
with a baby octopus.)

1974
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:44,869
It looks exactly like Haha.

1975
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:47,340
- A baby octopus is so cute.
- I know. It's cute.

1976
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,010
- How nice.
- As for Si Eun and Ye Eun...

1977
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:52,179
- We'll reveal them together.
- We made them together.

1978
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:54,179
- They're similar.
- Si Eun and Ye Eun.

1979
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,150
- Si Eun has a high nose bridge.
- So...

1980
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:58,820
the big one is Ye Eun
and the small one is Si Eun.

1981
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,659
(Si Eun, Ye Eun)

1982
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:04,789
(Two spoons with different heights)

1983
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:06,230
- You see the resemblance, right?
- Hey.

1984
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,699
- Jae Seok, hold them up.
- Hey.

1985
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:09,559
- They look the same.
- I see the resemblance.

1986
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,369
- Seriously.
- They made them with so much care.

1987
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:13,730
We added details to their hair.

1988
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,469
- Did you make them?
- Is it dried laver?

1989
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:17,070
- Did you make them?
- It's a plastic bag.

1990
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,170
- A plastic bag.
- Yes.

1991
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:20,840
- You made them.
- It's Ye Eun.

1992
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,039
The very last one is...

1993
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,710
- the highlight.
- It's the highlight.

1994
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:25,949
- Is there another one?
- Is there another one?

1995
01:07:25,949 --> 01:07:26,980
- The highlight?
- Yes.

1996
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,349
We found Ye Eun by chance.

1997
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:32,849
(Is there a hidden item
that resembles Ye Eun?)

1998
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,760
- As for this one,
- It's so big.

1999
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,659
I personally think
it'll go down in history.

2000
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:40,460
- Really? It's big.
- I bet you never imagined it.

2001
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,460
- I can't even imagine it.
- Shall I cover it?

2002
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,269
Is it a stand? What is it?

2003
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:46,769
I bet you never imagined it.

2004
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:48,139
- I can't even imagine it.
- I can't wait.

2005
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:50,670
Ye Eun!

2006
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,869
(Ye Eun!)

2007
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:54,139
Ye Eun!

2008
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,179
- Ye Eun!
- It's Ye Eun.

2009
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:00,010
- Can't you see the resemblance?
- There's a mouth.

2010
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,650
- Can't you see the resemblance?
- Seriously.

2011
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,480
- Ye Eun!
- It looks the same.

2012
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,619
I was so startled.

2013
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,550
- At the supermarket...
- We bought it.

2014
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,389
- Jae Seok.
- It has Jae Seok's face.

2015
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:12,059
- It has your face.
- Isn't it Jae Seok?

2016
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:13,260
- It's Jae Seok.
- It's Ye Eun.

2017
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,530
- Call Ye Eun.
- Jae Seok.

2018
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,829
- Ye Eun.
- It's...

2019
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:16,859
- Ye Eun.
- Good.

2020
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:18,300
- Seriously.
- It's Ye Eun.

2021
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,399
Ye Eun.

2022
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:21,399
This is...

2023
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:22,699
It resembles her.

2024
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:24,170
- Yes.
- It's Ye Eun.

2025
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:26,710
- Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun, take it home.

2026
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:27,880
How does it look like that?

2027
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:31,010
- The presentations are over.
- Yes.

2028
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:33,380
Cameraman Kang Chan Hee...

2029
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:37,550
will rank the teams in the order...

2030
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,989
- of the items' resemblance.
- Okay.

2031
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:41,119
- It has to be us.
- No.

2032
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:45,229
- It has to be us.
- Please announce the third place.

2033
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:46,289
It has to be us.

2034
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,600
We put a lot of effort
into the game.

2035
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,359
- The last place?
- I bet we didn't place last.

2036
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,930
- I bet we didn't place last.
- Our items were witty.

2037
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,130
- The third place is...
- Okay.

2038
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,239
The third place?

2039
01:08:55,369 --> 01:08:56,640
Haha's family.

2040
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,140
- Why?
- Only that one item made sense.

2041
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,880
- No way.
- Only that one item made sense.

2042
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:02,810
- Us?
- We did well.

2043
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,180
- It's hard to find such an item.
- That's right.

2044
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:07,210
Good.

2045
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,579
- We're the best.
- Good.

2046
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:10,720
It was hard to pick the winner.

2047
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,390
(The 1st and 2nd places
were neck-and-neck.)

2048
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,489
Shall I announce the first place?

2049
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:14,689
- The 1st place.
- The 1st place.

2050
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:15,720
Okay.

2051
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,760
I could totally see the resemblance.

2052
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,760
- Okay.
- You could see it.

2053
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,300
- I could totally see it.
- Okay.

2054
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:23,060
I'll pick Jae Seok's family.

2055
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,060
(Bucktooth Family placed 1st.)

2056
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,229
- Yes.
- All right.

2057
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:26,800
- Okay. You did well.
- It can't be helped.

2058
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,539
- We admit defeat.
- We admit defeat.

2059
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,369
- This one looks like her.
- You can't beat it.

2060
01:09:30,369 --> 01:09:31,539
- You can't beat it.
- This too.

2061
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:32,869
This one looks exactly like her too.

2062
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,140
You can't beat it.

2063
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,180
- The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.
- You can't beat it.

2064
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,680
Just like the last time,

2065
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,880
- the withdrawals will take place.
- We can do well.

2066
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,350
Haha's family will go 1st
since they placed 3rd.

2067
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:45,420
- Okay.
- Okay.

2068
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,020
Here's what I think.

2069
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,689
(Haha's family
is currently in 1st place.)

2070
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,760
We need to think hard.

2071
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,789
- Okay.
- What is there to think about?

2072
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:54,800
(Will they be able
to stay in 1st place?)

2073
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,829
Listen.

2074
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:59,130
- Let's say we withdraw a lot.
- Okay.

2075
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:00,600
- Right?
- Yes.

2076
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,439
Seok Jin's family has some money.

2077
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:03,770
- We know that.
- Yes.

2078
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:08,079
(Seok Jin's family had 2 chances
during the 1st withdrawal.)

2079
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,550
(They predict that Seok Jin's family
has become rich.)

2080
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,279
Let's take 100 dollars
from Seok Jin's family.

2081
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:15,350
Okay.

2082
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:18,750
- Then Jae Seok will pick us.
- Yes.

2083
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,619
If we take a lot of money
from the rich team,

2084
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:23,119
- we'll lose more.
- That's right.

2085
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,689
If we chose Jae Seok's family...

2086
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:27,430
- and withdraw 20 to 30 dollars...
- Okay.

2087
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:30,159
We can take second place
if we get rid of our greed.

2088
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,229
Then it'll be our strategy
to avoid placing last.

2089
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:35,640
Since we're playing a game anyway,
we should aim to win.

2090
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,970
(Number 95 wants to win
unlike how it was in "Squid Game.")

2091
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,439
- It's okay. We can't...
- It's okay.

2092
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:43,210
We won't win.

2093
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:44,550
I don't think that we'll win.

2094
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:47,109
But Si Eun has a point.

2095
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,579
It'll be impossible to win.

2096
01:10:48,579 --> 01:10:50,119
I think you're right, to be honest.

2097
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:51,289
- No.
- It'll be impossible to win.

2098
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,819
I'm here to win.

2099
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:54,689
- Do it next time.
- Visit the show again.

2100
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,090
- You met the wrong team.
- You met the wrong team.

2101
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,689
You met the wrong team.

2102
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:00,359
- In that case...
- Gosh.

2103
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:01,359
(They won't place 1st today.)

2104
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,460
- We should pick Jae Seok's family.
- Okay.

2105
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,729
- Let's avoid placing last.
- Okay.

2106
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,600
We'll pick Jae Seok's family.

2107
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,039
(They attempt to withdraw money
from Jae Seok's family.)

2108
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:10,340
- Thirty dollars?
- Forty dollars.

2109
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,069
- They won't have that much.
- They won't have that much.

2110
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:13,869
- We'll go with 30 dollars.
- We'll go with 30 dollars.

2111
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,909
- Thirty dollars.
- They'll have that much, right?

2112
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:17,109
- Thirty dollars.
- Thirty dollars.

2113
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:18,210
(They attempt to withdraw 30 dollars
Jae Seok's family took.)

2114
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,850
Okay. Let's go.

2115
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,420
- Let's go!
- All right!

2116
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,319
(They make a big fuss
to keep the result hidden.)

2117
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,920
Go!

2118
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,760
It's necessary to make noise.

2119
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,619
The device makes a sound
when the paper comes out.

2120
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,029
(Working hard)

2121
01:11:34,029 --> 01:11:36,500
Please!

2122
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,130
The transaction has been completed.

2123
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,199
(The transaction is a success.)

2124
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:41,039
(Oh, yes!)

2125
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:44,539
(They succeeded in taking back
the stolen money!)

2126
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:48,640
(They school their faces.)

2127
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:50,840
I can't believe it.

2128
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:54,680
(They begin acting
to avoid being the target.)

2129
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,350
Are they that poor?

2130
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:58,149
(Baiting)

2131
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,449
"Are they that poor?"

2132
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,390
- No. We need to see.
- Well...

2133
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,260
- Let's see Ye Eun's face.
- Haha's family...

2134
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:05,390
targeted Jae Seok's family.

2135
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,930
- They took money.
- Okay.

2136
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:08,829
The second place,
Seok Jin's family will go.

2137
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:09,899
- Let's see Ye Eun's face.
- Okay. Seok Jin.

2138
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:11,270
Ye Eun, are you in a good mood
or a bad mood?

2139
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,529
I'm in a bad mood.

2140
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:14,369
Let me see if you look sad.

2141
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:15,439
(Smiling)

2142
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:16,439
You're in a good mood.

2143
01:12:16,569 --> 01:12:18,270
- No, I'm not.
- You're trying to hide it.

2144
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,510
- I'm in a bad mood.
- Seriously.

2145
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,710
That's funny.

2146
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:23,479
Whether or not it was a success...

2147
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:26,079
- Haha's family. Fifty dollars?
- Haha's family.

2148
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:30,619
(They used their 2 chances
on Jae Seok's family earlier.)

2149
01:12:30,619 --> 01:12:34,090
(They failed both times.)

2150
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:39,630
(Seok Jin's family found out that
Jae Seok's family had no money.)

2151
01:12:40,229 --> 01:12:42,800
- Let's do it even if we fail.
- Seventy dollars.

2152
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,130
- Okay.
- No. One hundred dollars.

2153
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:47,399
- We can't do that.
- Don't do that.

2154
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:49,039
- What's wrong with you?
- We can't do that.

2155
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:50,539
- How about 70 dollars?
- Take it easy.

2156
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:52,069
- Okay?
- Okay. It's simple.

2157
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:55,180
No. That won't change anything.

2158
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,609
What's up with you?

2159
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:57,880
- One hundred dollars.
- Suddenly...

2160
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,779
- One hundred dollars? Really?
- Go ahead.

2161
01:12:59,779 --> 01:13:01,149
- Okay.
- All right.

2162
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,350
- Haha's family. One hundred.
- Haha's family.

2163
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,489
(If they steal 100 dollars,
they'll take 1st place.)

2164
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:06,619
- Are you confident?
- It'll get denied.

2165
01:13:06,789 --> 01:13:07,890
- It's your decision.
- Really? Will it get denied?

2166
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,390
All right then.

2167
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:10,960
- Seventy.
- Seventy?

2168
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,560
Okay. Let's play it safe.

2169
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,359
Seok Jin's family...

2170
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,829
chose to target Haha's family.

2171
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:20,470
(Haha's family:
220 dollars in total)

2172
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:22,840
(Haha's family will lose
a 3rd of the money.)

2173
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,270
They couldn't have picked
a big amount.

2174
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,039
They couldn't have picked
a big amount.

2175
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,710
I bet Haha's family succeeded in it.

2176
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:30,239
- Okay.
- They succeeded in it.

2177
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,750
We need to check out
Jae Seok's family's results as well.

2178
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:33,779
That's right.

2179
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:35,319
This makes me think.

2180
01:13:35,649 --> 01:13:38,050
(The transaction is a success.)

2181
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,689
(Satisfied)

2182
01:13:40,789 --> 01:13:42,390
- All right.
- Good.

2183
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,989
- We should've gone with 100.
- Good.

2184
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:47,029
Let's pick one team at a time.

2185
01:13:47,029 --> 01:13:48,199
(Jae Seok's family has 2 chances.)

2186
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:49,859
- One team at a time.
- Yes.

2187
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,369
We have two chances, right?

2188
01:13:52,069 --> 01:13:56,300
Let's bring 40 dollars
from Haha's family.

2189
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,470
How about 30 dollars?

2190
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:00,140
Shall we go with 30 dollars?

2191
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,210
- Thirty dollars?
- Okay.

2192
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,510
- Seok Jin's family too.
- For now...

2193
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,279
Thirty dollars
from Seok Jin's family?

2194
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:06,479
- Shall we bring more at once?
- Shall we do it?

2195
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:08,350
They might have 100 dollars.

2196
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,180
- Seok Jin's family...
- Okay.

2197
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,819
didn't take our money
to keep their amount a secret.

2198
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,159
I see.

2199
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,420
They have a lot of money.

2200
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:18,189
Let's be daring.

2201
01:14:18,489 --> 01:14:19,630
In that case...

2202
01:14:19,829 --> 01:14:21,329
- Shall we go with 90 dollars?
- Did you say 90 dollars?

2203
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:23,529
- Okay.
- Seok Jin's family.

2204
01:14:24,199 --> 01:14:25,229
Ninety dollars.

2205
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:29,840
(Bucktooth Family
finally stopped being small-minded!)

2206
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:31,909
(Seok Jin's family:
90 dollars taken)

2207
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:34,109
(The transaction is a success.)

2208
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:36,010
- I guess our total was too small.
- I guess it was the smallest.

2209
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,949
- I guess it was too small.
- I guess we started off too small.

2210
01:14:37,949 --> 01:14:40,810
- Haha's family had a good reaction.
- Yes.

2211
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:42,119
Shall we get more money from them?

2212
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:43,180
Haha's family.

2213
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,949
One more time.

2214
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:49,289
(How much will they withdraw
from Haha's family?)

2215
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:50,689
One hundred dollars.

2216
01:14:50,689 --> 01:14:51,930
(Haha's family:
150 dollars in total)

2217
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:54,430
If this works,

2218
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:57,199
that means both teams had
a lot of money.

2219
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,399
(Haha's family: 100 dollars taken)

2220
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:01,569
(The second transaction is
a success.)

2221
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,270
(They finally learned
that only they were poor!)

2222
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,810
(Jae Seok's family:
215 dollars in total)

2223
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:10,380
I told you not to do that.

2224
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,449
(The first place and last place
are switched.)

2225
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:14,350
You're grinning so widely.

2226
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,520
- I'm annoyed.
- I mean...

2227
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,020
(Haha's family plummeted
to the bottom from the 1st place.)

2228
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,649
We should pick them next time.

2229
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:20,189
- They...
- They're the richest.

2230
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:21,920
- They're the richest.
- They must be happy.

2231
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,590
Their facial expressions
show happiness.

2232
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,090
- No. It was denied.
- Just you wait.

2233
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:28,800
You'll get the current total.

2234
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,960
(They check the current total
after the 2nd withdrawal.)

2235
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,600
- Let's check it.
- Let's see it.

2236
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:34,470
What's our total?

2237
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,369
(Their total has multiplied by 10.)

2238
01:15:37,369 --> 01:15:39,470
They had a lot of money.

2239
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:41,479
Let's see.

2240
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:42,840
(Seok Jin's family's total
hasn't changed much.)

2241
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,109
(Seok Jin's family:
85 dollars in total)

2242
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,449
No way.

2243
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,250
What? I can't see it.

2244
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,819
For goodness' sake.

2245
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:49,850
(Haha's family became poor.)

2246
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,289
(Which family will laugh
in the end?)

2247
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:53,550
They took a lot of money.

2248
01:15:54,289 --> 01:15:55,619
Is there another game?

2249
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:57,689
Please prepare the last mission.

2250
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,329
I'll explain the last mission.

2251
01:16:00,329 --> 01:16:02,800
The last mission is
the No Communication Quiz.

2252
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,970
You'll listen to a question
and write down your answer.

2253
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:07,300
All three answers must be identical
for it to be a success.

2254
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,739
- Is that so?
- It's impossible.

2255
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,909
- I see. Okay.
- I see.

2256
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,979
The family with the highest number
of successes will get the benefit.

2257
01:16:14,979 --> 01:16:16,439
If it's a tie,

2258
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:19,180
the family with the higher number
of two identical answers...

2259
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,579
will win.

2260
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:22,720
Jae Seok's family will go first.

2261
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,050
All answers must be identical.

2262
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:26,090
So we need to answer correctly.

2263
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:28,960
Among Yu Jae Seok, Yang Se Chan,
and Joo Jong Hyuk,

2264
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,489
write down the name of the person
whose mouth protrudes the most.

2265
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,689
- It's hard.
- My goodness.

2266
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:34,159
(Among Yu Jae Seok, Yang Se Chan,
and Joo Jong Hyuk,)

2267
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:35,460
(write down the name of the person
whose mouth protrudes the most.)

2268
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,569
(He writes his answer
without hesitation.)

2269
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:39,970
The answers must be identical.

2270
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:42,399
- Hold on.
- It isn't easy.

2271
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,039
- Make sure they don't cheat.
- Okay.

2272
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,710
So we get such questions.

2273
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,609
- Let's judge objectively.
- We can't predict the result.

2274
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:52,010
It's hard.

2275
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,250
- So we get such questions.
- It's hard.

2276
01:16:53,449 --> 01:16:55,350
- Seriously, it's...
- What's your answer?

2277
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:57,479
- Jae Seok.
- Really?

2278
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:59,319
- How about you?
- Se Chan.

2279
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:00,720
- Really?
- Yes.

2280
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,390
(Even among the onlookers,
the opinions are divided.)

2281
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:06,189
(Will it be the protruded mouth
with no chin...)

2282
01:17:06,189 --> 01:17:08,159
(or the protruded mouth
that's twisted?)

2283
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,100
I'm sure they'll write down the name
of the ugliest person.

2284
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:14,600
- The ugliest person.
- Just look at the vibe.

2285
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,600
- No discussions.
- No discussions.

2286
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,710
(They need three identical answers.)

2287
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:22,079
- Don't send signals.
- All right.

2288
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,380
- He...
- Did you write down your answer?

2289
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,380
- Yes.
- You had braces, right?

2290
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,180
- They must be identical.
- I had braces.

2291
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:28,479
- Still...
- You had braces.

2292
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:29,479
One, two, three.

2293
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,350
I think they'll be identical.

2294
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,520
One, two, three.

2295
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,220
- I think they'll be identical.
- They're identical, right?

2296
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,960
- Let's see. No?
- No?

2297
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,189
(Aren't the answers identical?)

2298
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,489
(Yang Se Chan)

2299
01:17:38,489 --> 01:17:39,489
Me.

2300
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,829
- No. For goodness' sake.
- It's Jae Seok.

2301
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:43,699
- Jae Seok.
- You're too modest.

2302
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,029
- I mean...
- You're modest.

2303
01:17:45,329 --> 01:17:47,130
(Jong Hyuk wrote Jae Seok's name.)

2304
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:50,600
(He throws it to the ground
so that Jae Seok doesn't see it.)

2305
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,810
- You're too modest.
- Jae Seok.

2306
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,210
- I mean...
- You're modest.

2307
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,909
- I mean...
- You're modest.

2308
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:56,340
- Look at my mouth.
- Hey!

2309
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:58,050
You're more handsome than Jae Seok.

2310
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,109
I mean...

2311
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:00,810
- Jae Seok?
- Why...

2312
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,720
- I'm sorry.
- Do you know why he chose you?

2313
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,789
He didn't want to pick me
because he resembled me.

2314
01:18:04,789 --> 01:18:06,819
You should've just written down
my name.

2315
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:08,489
You should've written down
Jae Seok's name.

2316
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:10,090
Gosh, it's me.

2317
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:11,789
- You're my pick too.
- Right?

2318
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:13,159
Same here.

2319
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:14,390
We were close.

2320
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,630
The answers must be identical
this time as well.

2321
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:17,630
- Okay.
- Such questions are hard.

2322
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:18,670
This is hard.

2323
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:21,970
Your options are Yu Jae Seok,
Yang Se Chan, and Joo Jong Hyuk.

2324
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:24,140
Consider
their physical appearances...

2325
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,939
and write the 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd ranks in order.

2326
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:29,979
Write the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ranks
in order.

2327
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:30,979
But this...

2328
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:32,680
- Jae Seok.
- This...

2329
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:34,050
In order?

2330
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,920
This is difficult.

2331
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:39,420
Hold on. This is difficult.

2332
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,789
- One person has to let go.
- Let go.

2333
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:43,319
- Give up what you have to.
- Hey.

2334
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:45,060
The 2nd and 3rd are difficult.

2335
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,630
- The 2nd and 3rd are so difficult.
- This will last forever.

2336
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:49,199
You're admitting it.

2337
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,270
(It's the battle of pride
between the fish.)

2338
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,130
- The 2nd and 3rd...
- It's so difficult.

2339
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,640
Jong Hyuk,
don't write it so confidently.

2340
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:00,170
- People here have high self-esteem.
- Okay.

2341
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:02,710
The members of Running Man
all think they look the best.

2342
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:04,779
Se Chan doesn't look bad.

2343
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:06,109
(Is it the young protruding mouth
or the handsome man made by society?)

2344
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:08,350
Se Chan looks good
when he dresses up.

2345
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:10,020
- Are you all done?
- Yes.

2346
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,619
One, two, three.

2347
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,119
Joo Jong Hyuk, Yang Se Chan.

2348
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:17,619
(Jae Seok ranked last
by both of them.)

2349
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,590
(Will Jae Seok rank himself
last too?)

2350
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,630
(1. Joo Jong Hyuk, 2. Yu Jae Seok,
3. Yang Se Chan)

2351
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:26,199
- Goodness.
- Why?

2352
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:27,399
What are you doing?

2353
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:28,399
(The baby octopuses
claim they're better.)

2354
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:29,699
- Goodness.
- Why?

2355
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:32,210
(He puts it down so Jae Seok
doesn't see it.)

2356
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,439
- Why is it you?
- Give up what you can.

2357
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:35,510
What is that?

2358
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:36,609
- Give up what you can.
- You're important.

2359
01:19:36,609 --> 01:19:37,680
- Who was it?
- Who did you write?

2360
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,449
- I...
- Who did you write?

2361
01:19:39,449 --> 01:19:40,779
Goodness.

2362
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:41,880
(You look the ugliest.)

2363
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,079
(It was confirmed.)

2364
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:44,420
- What are you doing?
- I told you to give up.

2365
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,720
You should have thought about it.

2366
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,590
- Why would you do that?
- He came because they look similar.

2367
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:48,960
He wouldn't want to be third.

2368
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:51,630
- I didn't think about that.
- You should have thought about it.

2369
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,060
I should have thought about it.

2370
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,090
This is it.

2371
01:19:54,729 --> 01:19:57,760
- As soon as I saw him.
- Your answers never matched,

2372
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,600
- so you get zero points.
- Okay!

2373
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,930
Okay!

2374
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:03,000
Next is Team Haha.

2375
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,199
We two had many matching answers.

2376
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,609
- Yes. Many of ours matched.
- Yes.

2377
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:06,670
We got them all.

2378
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:08,510
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2379
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:10,579
Let's just think simply.

2380
01:20:10,609 --> 01:20:11,750
As simple as possible.

2381
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:13,810
(The first question for Team Haha)

2382
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,720
Rank Haha, Ji Ye Eun,
and Kim Si Eun...

2383
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,220
(Rank Haha, Ji Ye Eun,
and Kim Si Eun...)

2384
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,789
- in the order of height.
- Their height.

2385
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:25,729
(Rank Haha, Ji Ye Eun,
and Kim Si Eun in the order of height.)

2386
01:20:25,729 --> 01:20:27,090
Wait.

2387
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,460
(Rank Haha, Ji Ye Eun,
and Kim Si Eun in the order of height.)

2388
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,560
This is a battle of pride, Haha.

2389
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:32,529
It's a battle of pride.

2390
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,569
But this...

2391
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:35,770
Isn't it too easy?

2392
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:36,869
- It's easy.
- It's easy.

2393
01:20:36,869 --> 01:20:39,609
- Why are you hesitating? It's easy.
- Hey!

2394
01:20:39,609 --> 01:20:41,340
- Wait. You...
- Seriously.

2395
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,210
Did you group us like this
to give us this question?

2396
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:45,449
- This is too easy.
- They grouped us like this...

2397
01:20:45,449 --> 01:20:46,579
- for this question.
- Right.

2398
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:49,319
It may hurt your pride,
but the question is easy.

2399
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:50,319
It's easy.

2400
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:51,619
You have to get it correct.

2401
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:54,119
This one is easy.

2402
01:20:54,189 --> 01:20:58,020
You're trying to hurt my pride.
She's shorter than me.

2403
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:59,789
The question is easy.

2404
01:20:59,789 --> 01:21:02,199
(The bold Ddochi
writes her name first.)

2405
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,630
Si Eun doesn't even need
to think about it.

2406
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,500
- The tallest person.
- That's easy.

2407
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:11,770
This was brilliant.

2408
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:15,180
- Si Eun...
- You basically gave us free points.

2409
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:19,210
Let's first get it correct.

2410
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:20,779
One, two, three.

2411
01:21:20,779 --> 01:21:22,420
- I was serious.
- Seriously.

2412
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:24,079
"Ji Ye Eun, Haha, Kim Si Eun."

2413
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,220
(Ji Ye Eun, Haha, Kim Si Eun)

2414
01:21:25,819 --> 01:21:27,390
What?

2415
01:21:27,619 --> 01:21:30,020
- One, two, three.
- I was serious.

2416
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:33,430
(She put down her pride
and wrote Ye Eun's name first.)

2417
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:35,359
- I was serious.
- Seriously.

2418
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:40,170
(1. Ji Ye Eun, 2. Kim Si Eun,
3. Haha)

2419
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,170
(Si Eun's answer)

2420
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:43,239
(Si Eun seriously thought
Haha was shorter than her.)

2421
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:45,810
- I'm sorry.
- Si Eun.

2422
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:47,409
Really.

2423
01:21:47,409 --> 01:21:50,539
Are you kidding? How tall are you?

2424
01:21:50,779 --> 01:21:52,479
You're shorter than me.

2425
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:54,710
I'm taller than 170cm.

2426
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:56,920
This is unbelievable. Seriously.

2427
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,619
I asked her. She said she was 166cm.

2428
01:21:59,619 --> 01:22:01,250
- Si Eun.
- Haha.

2429
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,189
- You shorty.
- I'm really sorry.

2430
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:05,430
"You shorty."

2431
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:06,960
Si Eun.

2432
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,630
- This is so funny.
- I thought the question was easy.

2433
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,930
But you wrote Ye Eun as the tallest.

2434
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,600
I did that to win.

2435
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,600
- I did that to win.
- Do you know what Haha did?

2436
01:22:19,569 --> 01:22:20,810
Are you 174cm tall?

2437
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,510
- I'm 171cm.
- No. You're 173cm.

2438
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:24,779
- I'm 171cm.
- You're 173cm, okay?

2439
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,710
Tell people you're 173cm.

2440
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:28,649
You really thought that way.

2441
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:31,420
- Si Eun was serious.
- This is funny.

2442
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,890
We failed to get this?

2443
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,720
- We have to get it now.
- We have to win.

2444
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,890
- Let's go simple. Seriously.
- We really have to win.

2445
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,159
- It's so funny.
- I won't use my brain.

2446
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,060
- I'll go by the facts.
- I won't use my brain.

2447
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,699
Here is the second question.

2448
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:46,399
Please write the common point
of the three words.

2449
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:47,699
This is easy.

2450
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:49,000
- They're just giving it to you.
- It's easy?

2451
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:53,409
King Sejong, Yi Sun Sin,
and Shin Saimdang.

2452
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:56,180
Okay. Three, two...

2453
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,409
This is easy.

2454
01:22:57,939 --> 01:22:59,109
One.

2455
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:00,310
Raise your answers.

2456
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:01,510
(Great people in history)

2457
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:04,420
(Their answers don't match.)

2458
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,119
(Jong Hyuk bursts into laughter
after seeing something.)

2459
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:08,250
What are we going to do?

2460
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,189
He wrote "Korea."
They all wrote different answers.

2461
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:12,189
Raise your answers.

2462
01:23:12,729 --> 01:23:15,460
- She wrote "The best."
- What are we going to do?

2463
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:18,130
They all wrote different answers.

2464
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:20,229
(Great people in history,
Korea, the best!)

2465
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:22,170
Great people in the history
of Korea are the best!

2466
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:24,199
- Korea.
- This...

2467
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:25,670
Korea.

2468
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:30,079
- Hey. Korea!
- Great people in history.

2469
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,180
The best!

2470
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,710
Si Eun is the best.

2471
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:34,180
- "The best?"
- Korea.

2472
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:36,420
Since answers did not match
for the last question,

2473
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,949
you are in last place.

2474
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:39,319
- What's wrong with us?
- It's so funny.

2475
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:42,319
When these three are together,
you're the best.

2476
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,819
Ye Eun.
Ye Eun is the most outstanding.

2477
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:46,829
They might not be able
to get anything matching.

2478
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:48,529
- Yes.
- That's possible.

2479
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,659
- We're going to stay.
- That's amazing.

2480
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,600
Let's drop our pride
and get it correct.

2481
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,970
- Okay.
- Drop your pride.

2482
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:57,970
Definitely.

2483
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,210
You all need to write...

2484
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,439
- the same answer.
- Okay.

2485
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:02,779
Write Ji Seok Jin's age.

2486
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:07,449
(Write Seok Jin's age.)

2487
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:10,119
(The question caught them
off guard.)

2488
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:12,149
Okay.

2489
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:14,920
You know it, right?

2490
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:15,960
- Your name is on the list...
- Right.

2491
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,090
- of people who turned 60 this year.
- Your name was there.

2492
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:20,529
No. That's not true.
I'm 58 years old.

2493
01:24:20,529 --> 01:24:21,800
We should go with the global age.

2494
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,229
Your birthday is in February.

2495
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:24,960
- What are you talking about?
- It hasn't passed yet.

2496
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,100
Okay.

2497
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,600
(It's a custom question for Seok Jin
who likes the global age.)

2498
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:32,270
- You know it, right?
- Three, two, one.

2499
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:33,439
Raise your answers.

2500
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:35,710
(Seok Jin wrote 58,
the age he's been talking about.)

2501
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,039
(Jong Kook also wrote 58.)

2502
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:38,579
- Let's see.
- Fifty-eight.

2503
01:24:38,909 --> 01:24:43,079
- Sixty.
- What's wrong with you?

2504
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:45,319
(She wrote 60
without subtracting anything.)

2505
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:46,590
- Hey.
- You should have gotten it right.

2506
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,720
I talked about it on the show.
You should have gotten it.

2507
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,189
- Sixty...
- There's an age I'm claiming to be.

2508
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:52,460
What's that?

2509
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,159
- How did you get that?
- What's that?

2510
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,800
- What's that?
- What's that?

2511
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,430
- The year...
- Does my age change?

2512
01:24:58,430 --> 01:25:00,930
But you're 60.

2513
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,140
Okay.

2514
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,670
- This was an easy question.
- It was an easy one.

2515
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:06,609
- Good.
- This is funny.

2516
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:10,210
This time, you'll see a part
of the lyrics of a song...

2517
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,710
and write the lyrics
that will follow that part.

2518
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,279
- Okay. I'm in trouble.
- That's hard.

2519
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:16,319
- We...
- We should meet halfway.

2520
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:18,619
- Let's meet halfway.
- Don't write something too old.

2521
01:25:18,819 --> 01:25:19,949
Half way.

2522
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,020
One, two, three.

2523
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,989
- Five, four...
- Hold on.

2524
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:27,329
(Songs that have "Dear"
in the lyrics)

2525
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:29,930
("If Like Me" by Kim Jang Hoon)

2526
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:33,399
("Adult Ceremony" by Park Ji Yoon)

2527
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:37,770
("Cherry Blossom Ending"
by Busker Busker)

2528
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:39,770
There are so many.

2529
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,609
There are many songs with "Dear."

2530
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:43,640
They're in a similar age group.

2531
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:46,779
- Hold on.
- Seok Jin.

2532
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:49,779
But first, this...

2533
01:25:49,819 --> 01:25:52,020
This might be a song
that only I know.

2534
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:54,890
No, Seok Jin.
You shouldn't go that far.

2535
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:55,989
But this is the only song
I can think of.

2536
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:57,560
One, two, three.

2537
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,260
- Raise them.
<i>- Dear</i>

2538
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,430
("With You" by The Blue)

2539
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:05,699
(Dear, look at my eyes)

2540
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,170
- Look.
<i>- Dear</i>

2541
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:08,500
<i>Dear!</i>

2542
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,239
<i>Don't change</i>

2543
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:12,140
<i>Dear!</i>

2544
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:15,210
(They're confused by the song
they're hearing for the first time.)

2545
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:17,409
(Don't you know this song?)

2546
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:19,649
("You" by Lee Jung Hee)

2547
01:26:19,649 --> 01:26:22,220
<i>Look at me</i>

2548
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,449
(Seok Sam has gone
way back in time.)

2549
01:26:24,449 --> 01:26:26,619
- Seok Sam's songs...
- Yes.

2550
01:26:26,619 --> 01:26:28,220
are really from the 80s.

2551
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,060
- When was it released?
- I've never heard it before.

2552
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,260
(It was released in 1980.)

2553
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:36,760
- Seok Jin. That's too old.
<i>- Love is sad</i>

2554
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,369
- I've never heard it before.
- Me too.

2555
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:42,800
The results of the quiz puts
Team Jae Seok in first place.

2556
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:45,609
- Stay.
- We won.

2557
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:46,869
Team Haha is in second place.

2558
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:49,779
- Okay!
- Okay!

2559
01:26:49,779 --> 01:26:53,909
Seok Jin's family
will make the transfer first.

2560
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:56,279
- It's the final transfer.
- This one was weak.

2561
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:58,819
For the last transfer,
the team that is targeted...

2562
01:26:58,819 --> 01:27:00,420
will not be revealed.

2563
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,420
We can't lose here.

2564
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:04,659
We can't.

2565
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:07,659
(Jae Seok's family had two chances
in the previous transfer.)

2566
01:27:07,659 --> 01:27:08,729
(Jae Seok's family:
25 dollars in total)

2567
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:11,229
(Seok Jin's family:
90 dollars taken)

2568
01:27:11,229 --> 01:27:13,699
(Haha's family: 100 dollars taken)

2569
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:17,500
(They succeeded both times
and took the lead.)

2570
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,840
(Haha's family:
220 dollars in total)

2571
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,909
(Haha's family: 50 dollars in total)

2572
01:27:20,909 --> 01:27:24,340
(They became last
after both families' attack.)

2573
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:27,750
Since we don't have money,
we can go bold.

2574
01:27:28,649 --> 01:27:31,250
- Should we go bold?
- Bold.

2575
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:34,819
They took ours.

2576
01:27:34,819 --> 01:27:35,989
- That's clear.
- Right.

2577
01:27:35,989 --> 01:27:37,319
- They have it.
- They do.

2578
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,659
We should go higher than that then.

2579
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:40,729
If they want to win,

2580
01:27:40,729 --> 01:27:42,859
they'll bet on an amount higher
than what they lost.

2581
01:27:42,859 --> 01:27:44,229
That's right.

2582
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:45,569
(Will Jae Seok's family be able
to maintain their position?)

2583
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:48,699
How much did we bet at first
when we lost?

2584
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:50,340
- At first...
- How much did we bet?

2585
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,970
We bet 80 dollars, and we lost it.

2586
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:54,010
- We bet 80 and it didn't work.
- Then we can bet on...

2587
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:55,380
- a smaller amount.
- No.

2588
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,180
- They took this much of ours.
- Seok Jin.

2589
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,850
- This...
- They took this much.

2590
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:00,279
- No. It's this, not that.
- No.

2591
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:02,720
We used to have 175 dollars.

2592
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,649
- We had 175 dollars earlier.
- We had 175 dollars...

2593
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:06,649
- Was it 175 dollars?
- It was 175 dollars.

2594
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:08,189
- Did they take this?
- They took this.

2595
01:28:08,189 --> 01:28:09,859
- They took this.
- Right.

2596
01:28:09,859 --> 01:28:13,289
So, 9 plus 3.
They'd definitely have at least 12.

2597
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:15,159
- That's right. They'd have that.
- Right?

2598
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:16,560
- They'd have at least that amount.
- Twelve.

2599
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,000
- At least.
- Even if they don't have much.

2600
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,430
- The least amount.
- That's the safe amount.

2601
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:23,439
- The minimum.
- How is it?

2602
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:25,739
- Don't put too much.
- Let's go.

2603
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:26,869
Let's do that.

2604
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:27,909
Let's make it 120 dollars.

2605
01:28:27,909 --> 01:28:28,939
Who would you take money from?

2606
01:28:28,939 --> 01:28:30,140
- Jae Seok.
- Jae Seok's family.

2607
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,180
(They make it safe and take
120 dollars from Jae Seok's family.)

2608
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,180
(Seok Jin's family:
85 dollars in total)

2609
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,850
(Jae Seok's family:
120 dollars taken)

2610
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,479
(Transfer success)

2611
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:38,350
It worked, right?

2612
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,090
- Yes.
- All right then.

2613
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:42,390
- Okay. It's done.
- Done.

2614
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,689
(Seok Jin's family:
205 dollars in total)

2615
01:28:43,689 --> 01:28:45,119
We might take first place.

2616
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,430
- We might win.
- Yes.

2617
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:47,789
- We don't know it yet.
- We did really well.

2618
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:49,000
- It's good.
- Yes.

2619
01:28:49,859 --> 01:28:51,899
(Haha's family: 50 dollars in total)

2620
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:53,300
- How about 150?
- Are you ready?

2621
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,670
- Did you say 150?
- What?

2622
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:56,739
- That's too little.
- Okay.

2623
01:28:56,739 --> 01:28:58,739
(Haha's family: 50 dollars in total)

2624
01:28:58,739 --> 01:28:59,770
Let's make it 230.

2625
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:01,369
- That's too big.
- Why?

2626
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:05,710
- It's too big. What if we fail?
- But they took a lot from us.

2627
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:08,550
But they took a lot from us.

2628
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,850
- Make it bigger?
- Bigger?

2629
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,949
What about 240?

2630
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:14,920
(The final amount is decided
with the two tiger moths.)

2631
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,859
- I'm so nervous.
- It has to work.

2632
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,689
We don't know how it will turn out.

2633
01:29:18,689 --> 01:29:20,460
(How much money did they take
from whose account?)

2634
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:22,500
(Haha's family is done
transferring the money.)

2635
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,699
We have two chances.

2636
01:29:24,829 --> 01:29:26,930
Si Eun can't keep a straight face.

2637
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:28,270
(Si Eun can't keep a straight face.)

2638
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:30,770
(Did Haha's family succeed
in transferring the money?)

2639
01:29:31,569 --> 01:29:32,640
We got busted.

2640
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:34,539
Should we take all the money
from Haha's family?

2641
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:36,109
- We should do that.
- Let's do that.

2642
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:37,609
Haha's family?

2643
01:29:37,609 --> 01:29:39,210
I think we should take Haha's money.

2644
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,979
I think they just took
a lot of money from us.

2645
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,479
I think they took... Earlier,

2646
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,720
- did we take 90 dollars from them?
- It was 100 dollars.

2647
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:48,220
- We got 100 dollars?
- From Haha's family...

2648
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,119
We took 100 dollars
from Haha's family.

2649
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:51,520
I think they took...

2650
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,489
- more than that.
- I think so.

2651
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:55,930
- What about 150?
- Let's go with 140.

2652
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,100
Is it 140?

2653
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,329
(If Haha's family took as much money
as they got on the 2nd attempt...)

2654
01:29:58,329 --> 01:30:00,100
Jae Seok, it's okay to fail once.

2655
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:01,800
- Right. It's okay.
- It doesn't matter.

2656
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:03,369
- Haha's family.
- How much?

2657
01:30:03,369 --> 01:30:04,439
We will take 140 dollars.

2658
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,210
Please. It has to work.

2659
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:08,239
(Trying to take 140 dollars
from Haha's family)

2660
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:09,409
Why am I feeling so nervous?

2661
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:11,539
If it fails,
things will get complicated.

2662
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:12,850
It will be complicated.

2663
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:18,279
(Does Haha's family have
more than 140 dollars?)

2664
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:21,149
Please.

2665
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,989
The transaction has been denied.

2666
01:30:22,989 --> 01:30:25,020
(Transfer failed)

2667
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:26,159
Please.

2668
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:29,229
(Haha's family has
less than 140 dollars?)

2669
01:30:29,229 --> 01:30:32,529
(Now they have
only one chance left.)

2670
01:30:32,529 --> 01:30:33,630
It failed.

2671
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:36,170
(If they fail again,
they might end up in last place.)

2672
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:40,140
The Family in Joy and Sorrow Race
is over now.

2673
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:43,279
The family with the most money
will get the prize.

2674
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:44,380
- Okay.
- Prize?

2675
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:47,279
The family with the least money
will get the penalty.

2676
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:49,449
The family with the most money is...

2677
01:30:49,949 --> 01:30:52,350
- The difference is overwhelming.
- Overwhelming?

2678
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:53,720
(The family
with a huge amount of money?)

2679
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:56,289
The amount is 245 dollars.

2680
01:30:56,289 --> 01:30:59,390
(The 1st place: 245 dollars)

2681
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:01,760
- It's Jae Seok's family.
- Yes!

2682
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,199
- Is it 245 dollars?
- How is it possible?

2683
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:06,300
- That's a lot.
- It's 245 dollars in total.

2684
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,529
- Why is it so big?
- No one took our money?

2685
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:10,840
We just failed to take 140 dollars
from Haha's family.

2686
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:13,140
I think Jong Kook's family
took their money.

2687
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,270
- How much should it be?
- What about 150?

2688
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:17,640
Okay.

2689
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,909
(They found out where the money went
and took 150 dollars from Seok Jin.)

2690
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:22,449
(Jae Seok's family:
95 dollars in total)

2691
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:25,350
(Seok Jin's family:
150 dollars taken)

2692
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:28,649
(From last place to first!
A success story of a poor family.)

2693
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:30,159
Do they get the prize?

2694
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,020
Here's the prize.

2695
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:35,930
You can use the 245 dollars
in your account...

2696
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:38,100
- to buy a prize you want.
- Really?

2697
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,100
(They can use 245 dollars
to buy a prize.)

2698
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:41,729
- This is amazing.
- Look at this.

2699
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:43,100
- It's great.
- It's Royal Salute.

2700
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,439
- How much is it?
- It's Royal Salute.

2701
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,710
- Gosh, this is...
- It's genuine.

2702
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,939
- It's great.
- How much is this?

2703
01:31:48,939 --> 01:31:50,239
(They have more than 200 dollars,
so they can buy the whisky.)

2704
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,279
- It's here.
- Is it Royal Salute?

2705
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:52,510
- This is...
- You like to drink, right?

2706
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:54,180
- What? I like it, but...
- It's Royal Salute.

2707
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:55,579
- You should take it.
- Take it.

2708
01:31:55,579 --> 01:31:57,420
- Come on.
- Just take it.

2709
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:01,619
All right then.
You will buy one whisky then.

2710
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,789
How much do you think we have?

2711
01:32:03,789 --> 01:32:08,189
All right. Now I will announce
the team to get the penalty.

2712
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,460
- I get the penalty again?
- It might be them.

2713
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:10,899
No... I know. That's what I mean.

2714
01:32:10,899 --> 01:32:12,800
Because Jae Seok's family
took their money.

2715
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,470
It was so close.

2716
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:16,170
- The difference is five dollars.
- What?

2717
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:17,239
- Only five dollars?
- Really?

2718
01:32:17,239 --> 01:32:18,470
(The difference between 2nd and 3rd
is only 5 dollars.)

2719
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:19,510
- Only five dollars?
- Really?

2720
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:21,170
I guess
you can transfer five dollars.

2721
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:23,039
- The difference is five dollars.
- Really?

2722
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,140
- My gosh.
- Unbelievable.

2723
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,649
The team to get the penalty is...

2724
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:28,380
They have 50 dollars.

2725
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,579
- It's Haha's family.
- Yes!

2726
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:32,319
- It's only 5 dollars.
- They don't transfer 5 dollars.

2727
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:34,149
- Right.
- We won with five dollars.

2728
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:35,819
- Five dollars saved you.
- Seok Jin's family is the second...

2729
01:32:35,819 --> 01:32:38,319
- with 55 dollars.
- Yes!

2730
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:40,829
We should've taken 100 dollars.

2731
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,229
We won if we took 100 dollars.

2732
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:44,329
- Make it 250?
- No, 200.

2733
01:32:44,329 --> 01:32:45,829
- No, 220. Or 200?
- Should we go with 200?

2734
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,869
- Who?
- Jae Seok's.

2735
01:32:47,869 --> 01:32:49,340
(They tried to take 200 dollars
from Jae Seok's after Seok Jin's.)

2736
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:52,000
It has to work.

2737
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,840
The transaction has been denied.

2738
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:55,739
- What?
- This is crazy.

2739
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:59,010
- Make it 140.
- Yes. Please.

2740
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:00,310
Please. It has to work.

2741
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:02,579
- We had 220 dollars at first.
- They had 220 dollars at first.

2742
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:04,479
- They had 220 dollars?
- Gosh, that's a lot.

2743
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:06,220
- They were rich.
- They were rich.

2744
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,819
- We were rich.
- And...

2745
01:33:07,819 --> 01:33:09,920
Jae Seok's family had
only 25 dollars.

2746
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:13,659
- From 25 dollars to 245 dollars.
- You had 25 dollars?

2747
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,930
Today's penalty is...

2748
01:33:15,930 --> 01:33:17,529
the fresh cream bomb.

2749
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:19,500
Only two of you
will get fresh cream.

2750
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,899
One of you will pass.

2751
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,170
I choose number one.

2752
01:33:22,939 --> 01:33:24,439
I want to be number one.

2753
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:25,909
- No. You can take number one.
- Okay.

2754
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:27,939
- I'm unlucky.
- You are?

2755
01:33:27,939 --> 01:33:29,239
- I lose every time.
- Really?

2756
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:31,180
- I pick number three.
- I don't know.

2757
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:33,279
- My gosh.
- Please.

2758
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:36,479
Ye Eun has
never avoided the penalty.

2759
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:38,180
- That's true.
- The penalty.

2760
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:39,489
(Ye Eun, the penalty collector)

2761
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:41,520
- Avoid it today.
- This is driving me crazy.

2762
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:44,119
All right. It will go off
on the count of three.

2763
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:45,829
Gosh, hang on.

2764
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:47,029
Hang on. Do it right away.

2765
01:33:47,029 --> 01:33:48,229
- Just do it.
- My heart.

2766
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:52,899
One, two, three.

2767
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,100
Three.

2768
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,640
(Haha and Si Eun got the penalty.)

2769
01:34:01,739 --> 01:34:03,439
(Unlucky Ye Eun
avoided the penalty today!)

2770
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:04,680
- Finally!
- Good.

2771
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:07,680
(Screaming)

2772
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:09,649
- This is your first time.
- You were the only one?

2773
01:34:09,649 --> 01:34:10,750
- This is my first time.
- Just one?

2774
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,180
- Only one survives.
- One.

2775
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,220
Two with the cream?

2776
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:16,920
(The unluckiness moved to Si Eun.)

2777
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:18,859
Ji Ye Eun!

2778
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,930
She's really scary.

2779
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:23,229
(This is how the one that came
to win first place ended up.)

2780
01:34:23,229 --> 01:34:24,829
Where are her eyes?

2781
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,399
- She's really...
- I should've chosen number one.

2782
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,739
Hey. There's only one survivor,
and it's Ye Eun?

2783
01:34:32,609 --> 01:34:33,670
(We'd like to thank
Joo Jong Hyuk and Kim Si Eun.)

2784
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:36,180
- How did you know, Ye Eun?
- Si Eun is funny.

2785
01:34:36,439 --> 01:34:39,350
(The production crew headed to
Jong Kook's house after a tip-off.)

2786
01:34:39,609 --> 01:34:43,819
(A flood of testimonies
from the colleagues)

2787
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:45,550
- He has this much...
- Plastic bags.

2788
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:47,090
plastic bags on the balcony.

2789
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,520
The house should be
on "Incredible Moment."

2790
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,060
- That's not a lie.
- It's true.

2791
01:34:50,659 --> 01:34:56,329
(What about Jong Kook's house
worries people around him?)

2792
01:34:56,329 --> 01:34:57,659
- This is interesting.
- He cleaned up... No.

2793
01:34:57,659 --> 01:34:58,930
- It's the same.
- He didn't clean up.

2794
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:01,130
(What on earth happened
to Jong Kook's house?)

2795
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:02,600
I cleaned up the whole thing.

2796
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,170
- How could you live like this?
- Look at that.

2797
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:09,579
(Items piled up so high
shock everyone.)

2798
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,510
- This is crazy.
- "Crazy?"

2799
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:13,310
The pancake has become a fossil.

2800
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:18,579
(He finally decides
to clean up the mess.)

2801
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:21,789
(Cleaning with a man obsessed
with his stuff is not easy.)

2802
01:35:21,789 --> 01:35:23,890
I'm keeping this!

2803
01:35:23,989 --> 01:35:25,659
- Please.
- You still have a lot over there.

2804
01:35:25,659 --> 01:35:27,329
- Please get rid of it.
- No.

2805
01:35:27,329 --> 01:35:28,460
Jong Kook,
why did you not throw this away?

2806
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,500
This is Dongmyo.

2807
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,829
(Luxury items found
in the mini Dongmyo?)

2808
01:35:31,899 --> 01:35:33,329
I have Dior shoes. Do you want them?

2809
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:36,939
(The members get excited
to see the treasures pouring out.)

2810
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:43,640
(Who will get the treasure
at the chaotic Jong Kook House?)

2811
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:44,680
(SOS Heavy Cleaning Zone)
