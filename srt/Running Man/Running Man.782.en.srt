1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:01,603
- Hello. - Okay!

2
00:00:01,578 --> 00:00:04,508
(The weather has become a cold early winter.)

3
00:00:01,603 --> 00:00:02,863
The weather is nice.

4
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:04,233
This is perfect for me.

5
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:06,233
- It's amazing. - Hello.

6
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:08,118
(They enter energetically, as always.)

7
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,573
- It feels cool. - Just cold enough to see my breath.

8
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,743
- Hello. - It's chilly.

9
00:00:10,603 --> 00:00:12,473
- It's cold. - Are you putting it on here?

10
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:14,688
(It suddenly became a beauty show?)

11
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,613
- Why is he doing it there? - What is he doing?

12
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:15,613
I guess it's an advertisement.

13
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,043
- Is it an advertisement? - Is it an advertisement?

14
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:18,213
- It's a gift. - I got this from Hyung In.

15
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:20,113
It's a gift from Hyung In.

16
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,198
(Producer Hyung In gave out gifts before the opening.)

17
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:21,683
- Hyung In gave it to you? - She did?

18
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,423
- It's not an advertisement. - Hyung In.

19
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,153
Hyung In is going on maternity leave.

20
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:26,623
- That's right. - Yes.

21
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:28,993
- Today is her last day. - It is.

22
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:30,738
(It turned out to be a farewell gift.)

23
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:30,023
How sad.

24
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:31,993
Hyung In has been with us for five years.

25
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:33,993
- She was the assistant director. - Right.

26
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,533
- She was in charge of me. - True.

27
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:38,678
(They will run with a new producer starting next week!)

28
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,933
- You went through a lot, Hyung In. - She really did.

29
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:39,833
- You gave her a hard time. - Right.

30
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,873
It must've been hard for you to follow me around.

31
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:45,043
By the way, Ye Eun said something...

32
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:47,113
- as soon as she got here today. - What?

33
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:49,218
(What did she say early in the morning?)

34
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,413
She suddenly said this to Daniel and me.

35
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:53,683
- "Don't I look pretty today?" - What?

36
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:52,758
(Said Ye Eun)

37
00:00:53,683 --> 00:00:54,753
- All of a sudden... - All of a sudden?

38
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:55,783
- Why did you say that? - What was with you?

39
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:59,898
(Somehow, she was quite startled by her beauty.)

40
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:57,323
- Why... - I thought I looked today.

41
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,253
- You did? - That's how she felt.

42
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,623
- That happens. - My skin is glowing.

43
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:03,423
- I see. - So, this is...

44
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:06,893
what I said. I'm happy as long as you're happy.

45
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,903
When I said that, Daniel...

46
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,433
- Daniel said, - What did he say?

47
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,603
"All right. It's nice to see you smiling."

48
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:18,118
(He didn't necessarily agree, but he just said it was nice.)

49
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,043
He just answered indirectly.

50
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,643
- It was so... - He sidestepped the question.

51
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:19,613
- She kept smiling, so... - Indirectly.

52
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,013
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

53
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:22,788
(She showed self-love this morning.)

54
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:24,913
I have some sad news today.

55
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:26,258
(Another sad news)

56
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:27,053
- What is it? - This is the last day...

57
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,583
for our second rented member, Daniel.

58
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,023
- I see. - Oh, no.

59
00:01:30,753 --> 00:01:32,793
Why Daniel?

60
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:34,153
- So Bal. - Hello.

61
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:38,108
(The tall, decent-looking guy So Bal brought last winter)

62
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:36,663
- Hello. - Daniel, it's been a while.

63
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,663
Hello.

64
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:39,893
It's funny when tall people do slapstick comedy.

65
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:43,238
(He left a strong impression with his unexpected clumsiness.)

66
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:40,893
He's the best.

67
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,733
Why is he being like that?

68
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,233
- It's funny. - Why is he being like that?

69
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:47,478
(The pleasant guest, Flimsy showed up.)

70
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,003
- He's like Kwang Soo. - Hello.

71
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:50,373
Hello.

72
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:54,843
New rented member, Choi Daniel.

73
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:56,318
(That's how he joined as the 2nd rented member in April, 2025.)

74
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:56,343
- Welcome. - Welcome.

75
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:59,828
(He was born to be unique, which is rare in variety shows.)

76
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:02,423
Why are they here all of a sudden?

77
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:03,198
(He showed off his armpit hair without hesitance.)

78
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:04,793
Hey!

79
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:07,298
(A passionate member who doesn't spare himself)

80
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,093
Pouch.

81
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:11,093
- A pouch of laughter. - Thank you.

82
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,533
One, two, three.

83
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,738
(Daniel is graduating now!)

84
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,233
Why Daniel?

85
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,233
Daniel has been through a lot.

86
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:21,108
(The rental period was fixed to be until December.)

87
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,233
- Right. - We've grown very attached.

88
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,903
- Daniel. - You can come again anytime.

89
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:23,903
- Sure. - Of course.

90
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:26,943
You realized here that you were not good at anything, right?

91
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,243
Seriously, I didn't know before coming here.

92
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:31,953
I just thought...

93
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:35,328
(At first, Daniel said he was good at everything.)

94
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,053
He's clumsy.

95
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:37,683
- You are... - Don't say you're good at things.

96
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:40,193
Jong Kook said, "I think you are slow-witted."

97
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,563
And I thought it was a joke.

98
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,533
He doesn't know world history.

99
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:45,708
(Frustrated)

100
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,693
- So, that's how it's spelled? - What's wrong with him?

101
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:47,708
(So, that's how it's spelled?)

102
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:49,103
- He's in trouble. - This is embarrassing.

103
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:53,778
(Mr. Big Eyes worried about him every time for a reason.)

104
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,433
- He didn't understand the game. - He didn't understand.

105
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:54,333
- He keeps asking. - Daniel keeps asking.

106
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,543
I thought it was a joke.

107
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:58,313
But one day, I thought he could be serious.

108
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:02,088
(One gained knowledge)

109
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:00,613
He doesn't say things that aren't true.

110
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,613
- He doesn't lie. - Because we got close.

111
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:04,283
- That means we've become close. - He...

112
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:07,783
When Ye Eun always told me that I couldn't pick up on a hint,

113
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:10,053
- I thought it was a joke at first. - She meant it.

114
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:13,998
(Two gained knowledge)

115
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:11,053
You didn't know?

116
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:13,123
- Why didn't you realize it sooner? - We were being serious.

117
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:14,623
- I thought... - He just realized it now.

118
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:15,863
He realized it after all this time.

119
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,093
- You only realized it now? - I didn't know for 40 years.

120
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:19,538
(Looking back at himself)

121
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,363
- Everything we said is true. - I had no idea for 40 years.

122
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:22,233
You look cool when you act.

123
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,263
- Right. You're good at acting. - You're a good actor.

124
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:26,678
(He's the best when it comes to playing a smart man.)

125
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:25,173
- You're a talented actor. - You're an acting master.

126
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:27,273
- You're good at acting. - You're a good actor.

127
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,603
- You're an acting master. - This show...

128
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:32,013
- is the most valuable in my life. - Right.

129
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,713
- You can come again. - Sure.

130
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,013
- You are always welcome. - You can visit us.

131
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:37,613
- You're our family now. - You're our rented member.

132
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:39,913
Come again. There's that brat who's not coming back.

133
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:41,583
- Who? - There's a guy.

134
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,423
He's not coming back after becoming famous.

135
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:46,093
- The one who's as tall as he is. - Kang Hoon.

136
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:49,538
("He" was the 1st rented member.)

137
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,623
- You're better than him. - Right.

138
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:48,623
You can come back.

139
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,723
- Yes. - Ye Eun's crush.

140
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:51,733
No!

141
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,433
- Ye Eun likes him. - I don't like him.

142
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,103
- You don't like him? - I don't.

143
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:56,833
- What if he asks you out? - I'll go out with him.

144
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,578
(She does want to date him.)

145
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,973
What's that?

146
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,943
- You don't like him, - Hey.

147
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:06,248
(It's her own mind game the other person doesn't realize.)

148
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,643
but you'll go out with him if he asks you out?

149
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,713
- That's how I feel. - It's funny.

150
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,813
- It's unique, but I understand. - I understand how she feels.

151
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,483
- I know what it's like. - I understand.

152
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:09,783
- I'll help you. - Help me.

153
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,913
- "Help me." - She's really unique.

154
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:14,113
We have a pleasant guest today.

155
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:17,098
(The guest will appear now?)

156
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:15,123
- Really? - Who?

157
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:17,123
Yes. Please bring in the guest.

158
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,523
- What? Who's that? - Kang Hoon!

159
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:19,623
- It's Kang Hoon. - What?

160
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:20,823
- It's... - That brat...

161
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:26,238
(Kang Hoon, who's being talked about, is here?)

162
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:21,993
- He... - Is it Kang Hoon?

163
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:23,093
- My goodness. - Unbelievable.

164
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,323
- Kang Hoon? - I'm getting goosebumps.

165
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,163
- I had no idea. - It's him.

166
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,433
- I had no idea. - Hello.

167
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:30,238
("He" is here.)

168
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,603
- What? - He's the one who we made famous.

169
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,233
- Hey. - I had no idea.

170
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,048
(Frozen)

171
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,733
- You didn't know? - What's with the leather jacket?

172
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:33,933
- What? - What's with the leather jacket?

173
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,603
- They're wearing matching jackets. - The leather jackets.

174
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:38,643
- What? - What's with the leather jacket?

175
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:39,488
(He's wearing a leather jacket that matches Ye Eun's.)

176
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:39,673
- What? - Look at Ye Eun.

177
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:40,973
- Hey. - I didn't know.

178
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:42,513
Why did you not say hello to Ye Eun, you brat?

179
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,513
- Say hello to Ye Eun. - I did.

180
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,028
(He is forced by the members to say hello to her.)

181
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:45,613
You look pretty today.

182
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:46,913
- You look pretty today. - Ye Eun.

183
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,123
Give him a hug.

184
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,898
(Swish)

185
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:52,423
- Hello. - Ye Eun.

186
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:54,528
(She can't even say hello when he's actually here.)

187
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:54,053
- He left. - Ye Eun.

188
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:56,093
- You know what? - Hey.

189
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:59,593
Ye Eun, it's good that he's here when you look pretty.

190
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:00,763
I look pretty today.

191
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,233
Hoon, stand in the middle.

192
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,263
- This is hilarious. - You can stay there.

193
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:06,448
(Swish)

194
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,073
- What? - You...

195
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,373
Did you see that?

196
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,373
- Move over. - You...

197
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:13,518
(She abandons her fake crush right away.)

198
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:11,143
Did you see that? She pushed me over.

199
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:13,673
She pushed me away like this.

200
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:14,843
You two look like a couple.

201
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:16,683
- Right. - You're wearing matching outfits.

202
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,513
- Right. Matching jackets. - What?

203
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:22,598
(They are thrilled to have someone to tease.)

204
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,483
- What do you mean? - What do you think?

205
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:24,623
"What?"

206
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,823
- I had no idea. - This is funny.

207
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:27,253
- "This is funny." - This is surprising.

208
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:29,063
- You two... - The puppy-like faces look good.

209
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,963
Is there an invisible person here?

210
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,193
Get closer.

211
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:35,133
I just mentioned him.

212
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:37,578
(No one knew that Kang Hoon would be coming!)

213
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,133
Did you know he was coming?
- No. I didn't know. - We said...

214
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,733
he left us after becoming a star.

215
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,403
Kang Hoon, you should've told us...

216
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:43,703
- you would come. - Right. Why did you not tell us?

217
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:45,673
- Why did you not call us? - I just...

218
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:46,713
The thing is,

219
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,583
I thought I'd get calls from too many people, so...

220
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,183
- Many people? Like who? - Like who?

221
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,513
Do you think...

222
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:54,713
You guys are very famous, so...

223
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:55,298
(You guys)

224
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,123
- Hey. - What is he talking about?

225
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,223
Pull yourself together.

226
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,323
- You should stay here longer. - I know.

227
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:00,523
You need to learn to see yourself objectively.

228
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:02,093
I didn't say I was famous. Why...

229
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:04,198
(Retorting)

230
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,663
- You mean, we're famous? - Yes. You guys are famous.

231
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,663
- I see. - That's true.

232
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,133
Jong Kook has nothing to say.

233
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,303
I'm stressed out.

234
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:12,703
- He's stressed out. - He's upset.

235
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:14,573
He's stressed out by the guest.

236
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,943
- They are enemies. - Jong Kook can't intimidate Hoon.

237
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,143
He's just annoyed by Kang Hoon.

238
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,688
(Retorter is Jong Kook's nemesis.)

239
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:19,573
- Right. - He's really strange.

240
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:21,343
He talks back to him every time.

241
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,643
Ye Eun, did you see Kang Hoon reciting an acrostic poem...

242
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:26,388
(Abruptly)

243
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,353
with Taeyeon on another show?

244
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,383
Where he said, "How about dating a younger man?"

245
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:30,058
(Kang Hoon's acrostic poem went viral around this time last year.)

246
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:28,383
Wasn't it a long time ago?

247
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:29,553
Tae.

248
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,053
Taeyeon.

249
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:33,523
Yeon.

250
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:34,753
How about dating a younger man?

251
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:38,768
(The acrostic poem that shook the whole neighborhood)

252
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:37,663
How about dating a younger man?

253
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,063
- I watched it. - You did?

254
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:41,063
- How did you feel? - Wasn't it a long time ago?

255
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,133
- It was a long time ago. - It's been a while.

256
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,203
He could do that.

257
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:45,478
(Then...)

258
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,573
- Make an acrostic poem with Ye Eun. - An acrostic poem with Ye Eun.

259
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,973
- Ye Eun? - Yes.

260
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:54,248
(How romantic will his acrostic poem be this time?)

261
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:50,573
Ye.

262
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,383
- I can't do this. Hang on. - Why not?

263
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,313
- I can't do this. Hang on. - Why not?

264
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:59,458
(He gives up.)

265
00:06:58,313 --> 00:06:59,383
He can't even start.

266
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,753
Hey.

267
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:01,528
(Glaring)

268
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,823
- Hey. - No.

269
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:03,283
- Ye Eun. - That's not what I meant.

270
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:04,553
- Ye Eun. - Why not?

271
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:06,223
He can't even start.

272
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:08,498
(He gave up before even trying.)

273
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:07,323
- What's wrong with him? - Just do it.

274
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:08,393
- He can't even start. - Seriously...

275
00:07:08,523 --> 00:07:10,023
- I don't like you either. - No.

276
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,063
- Well... - Say something like "Secretly."

277
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,333
You should say her name first.

278
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,863
- Right. - "Ye Eun."

279
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:16,633
- Try it again. - Say her name.

280
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:17,878
(He gives another try at making the acrostic poem.)

281
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:18,063
He's trying to come up with something.

282
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:20,178
(Brain in full gear)

283
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,033
- Let's do this. - He's thinking.

284
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,233
- Ye. - Okay.

285
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:23,143
- Ye Eun. - Good.

286
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:24,913
- Eun. - Gosh.

287
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:25,548
(Huffing)

288
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:26,873
There he goes.

289
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,883
It's like a drama.

290
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,413
Eun.

291
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:31,583
I can't do this.

292
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:35,398
(He gives up again.)

293
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:39,728
(An unfinished acrostic poem that will never be completed)

294
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,653
- "I can't do this." - Just come up with anything.

295
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:40,793
This is no fun.

296
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,863
I really don't want to hear it.

297
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,193
- I don't want to hear it. - You don't like it? You refuse it?

298
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:46,293
- Daniel will do it. - Daniel.

299
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,793
- Why? - Ye.

300
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:49,463
- Did something happen between them? - No.

301
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:50,663
- He likes me. - He likes her.

302
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:51,733
He has a crush on her.

303
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:53,948
(An acrostic poem confession from a man with unrequited love)

304
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,633
- He likes me. - He likes her.

305
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:54,673
- Ye. - Ye.

306
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:56,373
- Ye Eun. - Eun.

307
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,203
You look like Ngannou.

308
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,743
You look like Ngannou.

309
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:04,043
- Ngannou? - Ngannou!

310
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:07,828
(Ngannou: A heavyweight fighter with an overwhelming physique)

311
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,913
Nice. That was a good one.

312
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,153
- Because she's tall. - Ye Eun.

313
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:11,523
- She's tall. - Ngannou.

314
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:13,623
- Because of her height. - Ngannou was a good one.

315
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,663
- Ngannou. - What's Ngannou?

316
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,423
It's something pretty like silver powder.

317
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:18,808
(A white lie)

318
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:18,963
- Ngannou. - You look like it.

319
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:20,733
Ngannou is a good fighter.

320
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,203
Ngannou is good at fighting.

321
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:23,933
- Good one. - He's a champion.

322
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,808
(She likes that he's a good fighter.)

323
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:24,973
- He's really good. - Good.

324
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:26,503
- Kang Hoon, did you think? - Yes.

325
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:27,903
- You did? - Yes.

326
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:30,048
(His 3rd try at making the acrostic poem)

327
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,303
Say something romantic. Ye.

328
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,873
- Ye Eun. - Eun.

329
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,513
- Ye Eun. - Eun.

330
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,213
You really look like Ngannou.

331
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:40,558
(In the end, he showed his desire to make people laugh.)

332
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:42,498
(Sulky)

333
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:44,798
(This is hilarious!)

334
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:46,223
You brat.

335
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,838
(The original poet is satisfied.)

336
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:51,493
- I did well, right? - Yes. You did well.

337
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:52,633
I don't like Kang Hoon.

338
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,863
She doesn't know who Ngannou is.

339
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:55,763
- She doesn't know. - She doesn't know Ngannou.

340
00:08:55,763 --> 00:08:56,933
- So, she doesn't care. - Do you want to see Ngannou?

341
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:58,678
(Teasing)

342
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,133
- Do you not know Ngannou? - He's really cool.

343
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,703
- He's a great fighter. - He's really different.

344
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,108
(Teasing)

345
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:01,703
- He's so cool. - Ngannou.

346
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:02,903
- He's the world's best. - He's the best.

347
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:05,718
(The poem time ends with Ji-gannou getting a new nickname.)

348
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:04,543
- I'm a big fan. - Well,

349
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:06,173
today, we have all the new members...

350
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:07,943
raised by Running Man.

351
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:09,458
(Today's race is for the younger members.)

352
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:09,213
So, we prepared this race...

353
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,053
- called Problematic New Members. - That sounds nice.

354
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,213
At the end of the race, the senior members of Running Man...

355
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:14,158
(The younger members' fates are in the hands of the older ones.)

356
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:15,683
- Flimsy Choi Daniel. - Header.

357
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,293
- Darn it. - Come on.

358
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:22,823
Retorter Kang Hoon.

359
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,463
Kick the ball when it comes in.

360
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:27,093
Kick the ball when it comes in. You should pass it like this.

361
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,863
Is this a good pass?

362
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:28,738
(Retorting)

363
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:30,463
You ate jjajang when you wanted to get in shape?

364
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,278
(Retorting)

365
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:32,403
Does jjamppong have anything to do with getting in shape?

366
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:33,973
Kang Hoon is a rising star.

367
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,303
I'm not a rising star. I'm the ace player.

368
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:35,818
(Retorting)

369
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,603
And Crybaby Ji Ye Eun.

370
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,073
This is expensive. Hey.

371
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:42,813
- It hurts. - It hurts!

372
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:48,213
You will vote for the new member you think is the most problematic.

373
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,553
- I see. - The problematic member.

374
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,023
The new member...

375
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,793
with the most votes will receive a penalty.

376
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:56,523
The 1st and 2nd place members...

377
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,993
who voted for the problematic member will receive a prize.

378
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,833
And the nice new member with the fewest votes...

379
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,663
- will also receive a prize. - They also get a prize.

380
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,673
But the new members...

381
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,843
are given a reflection ticket.

382
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:09,873
What?

383
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,788
(Problematic member candidate, voter)

384
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:13,243
- If they think they'll win... - They can use it if they think...

385
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,813
they'll win the most votes.

386
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:15,558
(Reflection ticket)

387
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:16,943
If they succeed, they receive a prize,

388
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:16,788
(If the nominee uses the reflection ticket and succeeds,)

389
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:17,918
(they will get the prize, and the voters will all get the penalty.)

390
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:19,253
and all the members who voted for them...

391
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:19,188
(Prize)

392
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,028
(Penalty)

393
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,813
- receive a penalty. - Oh, no.

394
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,823
- We have to think carefully. - All the members?

395
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,528
(So, if they are expected to get the most votes,)

396
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:23,853
- Oh, no. -Gosh, this is...

397
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:25,598
(they can use the reflection ticket to fight back.)

398
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:25,523
- Good. - If I get the most votes...

399
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:27,853
If they use the reflection ticket...

400
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:33,508
(Reflection ticket)

401
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,393
- What if they fail? - and it turns out...

402
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:31,663
they're not the member with the most votes,

403
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:33,163
it's considered a failure,

404
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:35,133
- and they'll receive a penalty. - I see.

405
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,208
(Penalty)

406
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:37,333
- They'll receive a penalty alone. - They'll receive a penalty alone.

407
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:38,648
(If used incorrectly, they can get a penalty that wasn't meant to be.)

408
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,673
- They should use it well. - It's not easy.

409
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:40,373
And each member is...

410
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,703
- given one basic vote. - One vote.

411
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:46,443
Additional votes will be given to the new members,

412
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:48,113
who are the team leaders,

413
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,743
based on the mission results.

414
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:52,253
Now, let's move on to the first mission.

415
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:53,688
(They move for the first mission.)

416
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:53,653
- Okay. - Let's do that.

417
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:56,253
Hoon, I can't believe you showed up right after we talked about you.

418
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:57,398
(Pleased to see him)

419
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:57,723
- Have you been doing well? - Yes. I've been well.

420
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:01,668
(They all take their seats.)

421
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:00,693
Go sit in the middle.

422
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:02,793
Kang Hoon, do you want to sit here?

423
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:04,323
- Sure. Anything works for me. - Okay.

424
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:05,838
(Father Jee's spontaneous support)

425
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,038
(Frozen)

426
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,033
- This is... - You're wearing white pants again.

427
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:10,708
(Laughing)

428
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:10,063
Ye Eun.

429
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:13,648
(Smiling)

430
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:13,703
Ye Eun.

431
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,973
Why are you looking straight ahead? Are you taking a family photo?

432
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,173
Ngannou, what are you doing?

433
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,473
It was a joke.

434
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,043
- I know it was a joke. - This is a lot better.

435
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:26,013
Let's begin the first mission where you can earn the votes.

436
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,313
It's called Is It Because I Can't Express the Taste?

437
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:29,158
(Mission 1, Is It Because I Can't Express the Taste?)

438
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,353
What is it?

439
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:31,893
The first player should describe...

440
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,693
the scene of eating the given keyword,

441
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,493
using only facial expressions and gestures.

442
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:37,523
- What? - Oh, no.

443
00:11:37,593 --> 00:11:39,993
For example, if the keyword is "ramyeon,"

444
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,338
(Keyword: Ramyeon)

445
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,933
you cannot describe ramyeon.

446
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:43,138
(Not allowed)

447
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,863
You can only describe the scene of eating it.

448
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,133
- The scene of eating it? - Yes.

449
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,373
The next player should guess what the food is.

450
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:49,378
(Ramyeon)

451
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:52,413
You cannot describe things like chicken or pork.

452
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:56,043
You can only describe the scene of eating the food.

453
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:58,218
(If you do this, it's a failure.)

454
00:11:58,413 --> 00:11:59,953
You'll be divided into teams of three...

455
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,023
- and play the game in a relay. - Okay.

456
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:05,453
The team that guesses the most words within the given time...

457
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:07,153
- will be given the most votes. - That's nice.

458
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:08,963
- Based on the results. - We should describe it well.

459
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:12,233
The three new members will be the team leaders.

460
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:14,068
(The youngest three will be the team leaders today.)

461
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,263
You can divide the teams...

462
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,293
- as you see fit. - As we want?

463
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:16,803
Ye Eun would want to be on the same team with Kang Hoon.

464
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,263
- No. - Do you not mind?

465
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,333
She said no.

466
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:20,448
(False)

467
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:20,973
- All right. - Pick your members.

468
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,343
Okay. Pick your members. How will you pick them?

469
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:25,888
(They play rock-paper-scissors for the order.)

470
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,873
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

471
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,273
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

472
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,473
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

473
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:27,318
(Ye Eun lost alone.)

474
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:27,513
Okay.

475
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,813
- Ye Eun lost. - Rock-paper-scissors.

476
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:30,418
(Daniel won.)

477
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:30,113
- Okay. - Pick two members.

478
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,183
Who... No, pick one at a time.

479
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,788
(Picking order)

480
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,283
- One at a time. - One at a time.

481
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,783
- You can take turns and pick one. - Good.

482
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:35,783
I pick Yang Se Chan.

483
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:36,953
- I see. - Se Chan.

484
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:37,983
Se Chan is good.

485
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:40,668
(He pick Se Chan first, who is good at portraying.)

486
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:39,423
- He's good at skits. - He's the most wanted member.

487
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:40,723
I bet he's good.

488
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:42,463
- Will Kang Hoon pick Jong Kook? - Kang Hoon.

489
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:44,163
I pick...

490
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:44,738
(Glancing)

491
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,008
(Expectant)

492
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:46,593
I pick...

493
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,833
- I pick Haha. - Okay.

494
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,303
- Jong Kook... - I didn't expect to get picked.

495
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,973
- I didn't expect it. - He cares about him a lot.

496
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,343
Jong Kook pretends to be fine, but he seems very annoyed.

497
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,443
- He's upset. - I didn't expect it.

498
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:59,988
(Sulky)

499
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,543
I had no expectation at all.

500
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,873
I pick Jae Seok.

501
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:05,058
(Ye Eun chose Jae Seok.)

502
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,413
- I can see that. - Ye Eun.

503
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:06,413
- Can I pick again? - Play rock-paper-scissors.

504
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:07,713
Rock-paper-scissors.

505
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,488
(Last again)

506
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:08,983
- Darn it. - Rock-paper-scissors.

507
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,628
(Win, lose)

508
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,228
(It is Kang Hoon's turn.)

509
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,383
- Kang Hoon. - Hey.

510
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:13,498
(Blinking)

511
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,523
- Kang Hoon. - Hey.

512
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:15,663
Do you feel uncomfortable around Jong Kook?

513
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:15,668
(Purposely)

514
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,123
- Yes. - Really?

515
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:17,498
(Letting him hear)

516
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,163
- No. - I don't like him either.

517
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:21,663
- Do you not like him? - I don't like his team.

518
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:22,863
- I pick Jong Kook. - Okay.

519
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,663
- My brother. - Kang Hoon.

520
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:25,833
- I don't like his team. - I pick Jong Kook.

521
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:27,878
(Kang Hoon succeeeded in playing hard to get.)

522
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,773
- He picked him reluctantly. - He picked you.

523
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:28,878
(Sulky)

524
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,173
- Okay. - Jong Kook is relieved now.

525
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:31,048
(Excited)

526
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:32,613
- I didn't expect you to pick me. - Then, I...

527
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:32,818
(False)

528
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:34,473
He seems happy.

529
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:34,618
(Laughing)

530
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:37,018
(The first team selection is complete.)

531
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,383
- Me? - Then, I pick Ji Hyo.

532
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,258
(Team Kang Hoon, Team Ye Eun, Team Daniel)

533
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,483
I eat food in an unusual way.

534
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:40,553
We can't describe cooking.

535
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,883
- This is about how we eat. - How you eat.

536
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:43,023
Exactly.

537
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,053
- Let's say it's kalguksu. - We can only describe eating.

538
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,593
You eat it like this.

539
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,423
- And there's a clam. - I see.

540
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:51,568
(Chuckling)

541
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,523
You can't describe the ingredients.

542
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:52,693
I'll do it as I want.

543
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,608
(Retorting)

544
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,103
- I'm good at things like this. - Good.

545
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,403
- I'm good at this. - Go ahead.

546
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,003
How much time are we given?

547
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,673
It's three minutes, and you can pass.

548
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,143
You get ten keywords.

549
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:04,273
- Okay. Good. - Let's do this.

550
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,818
(Team Kang Hoon goes first.)

551
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,643
Let's show them.

552
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,583
The member sitting on the right will be the one to guess.

553
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,388
(Only the one sitting here can say the answer.)

554
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:11,943
We should take turns.

555
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,253
Let's chant together.

556
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,553
- I'm the team leader. - Let's do that.

557
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:16,683
- Why should we chant? - "I'm the team leader."

558
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:17,428
(He does it.)

559
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,423
- Up or down? - Down.

560
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:19,523
- One, two, three. Go! - One, two, three. Go!

561
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,893
- Say, "Go, Kang Hoon!" - What?

562
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:23,223
Say, "Go, Team Kang Hoon!"

563
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,863
Go, Team Kang Hoon!

564
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:27,563
Go, Team Kang Hoon!

565
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:31,778
(The problematic member starts acting up.)

566
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:28,863
This little...

567
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,433
- He's trying to shake up the game. - He's really...

568
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,433
- Okay. I got it. - What are you doing?

569
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:33,048
(Proud)

570
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,873
I think you're most likely to become the problematic member.

571
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,203
Pick me.

572
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:37,403
- You... - I'll use the reflection ticket.

573
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:38,178
(Retorting)

574
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:38,773
I should guess your keyword.

575
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,618
(The retorter gives as good as he gets.)

576
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,573
That problematic one.

577
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:43,343
- All right. Ready. - Let's do this.

578
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:45,488
(Start)

579
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,783
This is difficult.

580
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:47,753
This is difficult.

581
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,228
(Slurping)

582
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:50,853
- Let's go, 40. Young Four! - My gosh.

583
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:51,923
Espresso.

584
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,228
(Correct)

585
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:52,923
That's it.

586
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:54,953
- Espresso. - That's it.

587
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,298
(He got it only in 3 seconds.)

588
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,223
That was so easy.

589
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:57,638
(Retorter is off to a good start.)

590
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:57,323
He described it well.

591
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:00,438
(Is he good at describing as well?)

592
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,863
Okay.

593
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,508
(Shabu-shabu)

594
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,063
He's a great actor.

595
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,003
- Go ahead and eat. - What?

596
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:05,373
Hot pot?

597
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:06,533
- My goodness. - Fish cake!

598
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,873
Hot pot.

599
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,903
- Similar... - Shabu-shabu.

600
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:09,903
- Correct. - Okay.

601
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:11,343
- Shabu-shabu. - Correct.

602
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:13,088
(They got it quickly with brazen ventriloquism.)

603
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,513
Good.

604
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,643
How did he guess it?

605
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:15,713
What?

606
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:16,958
(Frozen pork belly)

607
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:17,713
What's that?

608
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:21,228
(Disturbing)

609
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:20,713
Chicken breast. He's grilling chicken breast.

610
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,223
- Chicken breast. - Grilled duck.

611
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,798
(Sear it on the grill.)

612
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,253
It's chicken.

613
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,728
(Place it on the lettuce wrap.)

614
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:25,283
- Chicken breast. - He's eating chicken.

615
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:26,323
Ssamjang...

616
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:27,593
Pork belly?

617
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,268
(Yes.)

618
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,163
Pork belly.

619
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:31,093
- A lettuce wrap? - Pork belly with water parsley.

620
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:31,268
(He got the pork belly right.)

621
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:35,708
(Now he should add "frozen.")

622
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,933
Pork belly with water parsley.

623
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:35,463
What kind of pork belly is that?

624
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:36,633
What kind of pork belly is that?

625
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,908
(Gosh, it's cold.)

626
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,003
You're cold?

627
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:41,608
(Frozen pork belly)

628
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,373
You're cold?

629
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,473
- Pork belly. - You can't do that.

630
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,348
(Glancing)

631
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:43,503
I get it. I know what it is.

632
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:46,018
(Frozen pork belly)

633
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,013
I get it. I know what it is.

634
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,013
- It can be anything. - Give me a second. Just say it.

635
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:48,888
(Only the one in this seat can answer.)

636
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,243
Only you can guess it, Haha.

637
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:50,383
Are you cold?

638
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:55,358
(The K barbecue partners aren't on the same page.)

639
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:53,453
Don't you get it?

640
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,483
- Pointing. - Don't you get it?

641
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:55,523
Only you can guess it, Haha.

642
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,998
(Frozen pork belly)

643
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,383
What is that? A perilla leaf?

644
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,723
Is it pork neck or something?

645
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,268
(Gosh...)

646
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:00,153
Is it pork neck?

647
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:01,353
- Is it pork galbi? - He doesn't know.

648
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:02,723
- Blade-end fatback. - Blade-end fatback.

649
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:03,823
- Blade-end fatback. - It's over for them.

650
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:04,993
I mean...

651
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:05,468
(It seems like he will list out all the meat...)

652
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:06,163
- Come on. - Short ribs.

653
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:07,038
(except frozen pork belly.)

654
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,833
- I already said he was right. - Flower pork belly.

655
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,403
- The back. - Grilled pork belly.

656
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,463
The back and neck.

657
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:11,938
(Frozen!)

658
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,133
- This. - Flower pork belly.

659
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:15,203
What the heck is it?

660
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:16,678
(Super annoyed)

661
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:21,088
(They pass after wasting a lot of time.)

662
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:21,273
- Frozen pork belly, you idiot! - What?

663
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:23,543
- Frozen pork belly. - Frozen pork belly.

664
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,943
- Frozen pork belly. - Unbelievable.

665
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,583
- He named everything except that. - They swore at each other.

666
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,158
(Frozen pork belly)

667
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:30,498
(CEO Ha doesn't care about what isn't on his menu.)

668
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:28,783
I can't believe him.

669
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:30,523
They swore at each other.

670
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:32,753
There was no other way to say it was cold.

671
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,493
- It's a corn dog. - A car?

672
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:37,893
- It's a corn dog. - A car?

673
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:37,768
(Rolling)

674
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:38,933
- You got it. - Lamb skewers.

675
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:39,993
Yes!

676
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:40,068
(Correct)

677
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,263
- Lamb skewers. - Yes!

678
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,638
(Once again, Kang Hoon quickly gives the correct answer.)

679
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:42,833
- There. - He's really good at this.

680
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,263
I'm good at describing it.

681
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:45,138
(How will he explain this time?)

682
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,873
- What is it? Hurry up. - Is it chocolate?

683
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:50,178
(Acorn jelly)

684
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,973
- Eat it already. - Kalguksu? What is it?

685
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,043
- Is this not allowed? - Cup noodles?

686
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,713
- Cup noodles. - You can't describe the shape.

687
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:53,843
- Not the shape? - Poison.

688
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:54,873
How do you eat it?

689
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:55,913
- Poison. - Go on.

690
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:59,228
(Having acorn jelly with chopsticks?)

691
00:16:57,713 --> 00:16:58,983
Did you just cut it? Is it naengmyeon?

692
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:00,483
Did you just cut it? Is it naengmyeon?

693
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,483
- Pyongyang naengmyeon. - Pass. I can't do it.

694
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:03,783
- What is it? - Kudzu naengmyeon.

695
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:06,568
(Since there's not much time, he passes to avoid getting scolded.)

696
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,423
- It was a tough one. - What was it?

697
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:07,653
Acorn jelly. I didn't know how to express eating it.

698
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:08,893
Ours are tough.

699
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:09,198
(Making a fuss)

700
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:14,808
(Green onion kimchi)

701
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:11,823
- Darn. - What is it?

702
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,393
Jong Kook's really bad with chopsticks.

703
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:18,238
(Ripping and eating)

704
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:16,763
- A live octopus! - I get it.

705
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:18,903
It's kimchi.

706
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:21,133
- It's kimchi, right? - Cheese kimchi.

707
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,208
(Yes.)

708
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,133
Geotjeori?

709
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:27,048
(Mr. Kim keeps ripping the green onion kimchi.)

710
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:27,043
- Is it napa cabbage kimchi? - Silbi kimchi.

711
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,513
Geotjeori?

712
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:30,543
- Is it napa cabbage kimchi? - Silbi kimchi.

713
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:34,288
(The two business partners can't seem to communicate.)

714
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:32,213
Is it napa cabbage kimchi?

715
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:34,383
- Silbi kimchi. - Cheese kimchi.

716
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:35,553
Just name every kind of kimchi.

717
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:36,783
- Napa cabbage kimchi? - Cheese kimchi.

718
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:38,253
- Silbi kimchi. - Cheese kimchi.

719
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,093
- Banana kimchi. - Ripe kimchi.

720
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,853
- Geotjeori? - Silbi kimchi.

721
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:45,538
(Without passing, he keeps ripping the green onion kimchi.)

722
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:44,023
- Napa cabbage kimchi? - Cheese kimchi.

723
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:45,323
- Silbi kimchi. - Banana kimchi.

724
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:48,138
(Their 3 minutes is up.)

725
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:46,833
What the...

726
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,203
Why is it so difficult?

727
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,678
(Team Kang Hoon got 3 points.)

728
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,603
Should it be this tough? Green onion kimchi?

729
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,533
Frozen pork belly was an easy one.

730
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:53,573
Yes, that was easy.

731
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,673
- Frozen pork belly was an easy one. - Why couldn't you get that?

732
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:57,673
He said he was cold, remember?

733
00:17:57,673 --> 00:18:00,013
Exactly, I shuddered like this, which is something I shouldn't do.

734
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:01,613
- I risked getting told off. - Jong Kook's angry.

735
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:03,383
It's only morning, and Jong Kook's angry again.

736
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:06,358
(Team Hoon didn't score much, despite sounding confident.)

737
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,943
Frozen pork belly was an easy one.

738
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,688
(Next is Team Daniel.)

739
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:08,783
Can we only express eating the food?

740
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,323
Of course. You can't cook it.

741
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:12,293
Daniel, you get the rules, right?

742
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,393
- Are you sure you've got this? - Haha, I'm the team leader.

743
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,723
- Okay, got it. - I'm the team leader.

744
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:20,408
(Even the others can't trust Captain Choi.)

745
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,023
- Okay. - Daniel, you go first.

746
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:19,493
- This won't be easy. - Me first? Got it.

747
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,193
I doubt the keywords will be easy.

748
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,903
Daniel, try to get the drift.

749
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,978
(But this team has Se Chan.)

750
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,063
Sure, got it.

751
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:26,348
(Keyword: Cultivator)

752
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:26,973
Handcart!

753
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:29,618
(Years in comedy made him an expert in describing objects.)

754
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:29,473
- He's so good at this. - A cultivator!

755
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:30,878
(Keyword: A drunk fashion model)

756
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,473
- Singing... - A drunk fashion model.

757
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:34,088
(Se Chan is the boss at charades.)

758
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:34,043
- Okay. - A drunk fashion model!

759
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:36,043
- I'll be witty about it. - We get ten keywords.

760
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,788
(Will it surpass the barrier of the Empty Head Siblings?)

761
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:37,943
- Get ready. - We get ten keywords.

762
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:39,413
I know what I'm good and bad at.

763
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,228
(Start)

764
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,313
I know what I'm good and bad at.

765
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,398
(Hamburger)

766
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:44,398
(A big bite)

767
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:45,998
(Answering right away)

768
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,693
- A hamburger. - Okay.

769
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:47,223
- A hamburger. - Okay.

770
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:49,068
(A smooth start.)

771
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:48,963
That was an easy one.

772
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,763
- That was easy. - That's how it's going to be.

773
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,238
(The next one to explain is Daniel.)

774
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,363
- Where is it? - That was easy.

775
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:55,508
(Dalgona)

776
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,693
Where's the keyword?

777
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,478
(Stirring)

778
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:59,203
Ppobgi.

779
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,478
(He starts to make dalgona.)

780
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,633
A pancake.

781
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:02,343
Don't describe how it's made.

782
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:04,773
- Just describe eating it. - Just eat it.

783
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:06,643
He's terrible at this.

784
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,988
(Laughing)

785
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:13,528
(Dalgona)

786
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,043
- Eating it? - Describe how you eat it.

787
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:11,783
- He's terrible at this. - I think you should pass.

788
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:13,253
That stings.

789
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:14,813
That stings.

790
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,823
- You can't say that either. - Did you hear that?

791
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,093
- Just eat it. - Just describe how it's eaten.

792
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:20,798
(Captain Choi is overly eager.)

793
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:21,123
- You said you understood. - Are you kidding me?

794
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:23,163
Please! Just hurry up.

795
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,323
- Pass. - Incorrect.

796
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:26,593
- Ji Hyo, go. - Okay, I get it now.

797
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:28,208
(He passes without even getting to eat it.)

798
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:28,833
- Just stick to eating it. - Just eat it.

799
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,863
- Can't I say it stings? - Just describe eating it.

800
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,608
(Chicken feet)

801
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:34,648
(Spitting out!)

802
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:35,573
- What's that? - What?

803
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,578
(She seems quite experienced at deboning.)

804
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:37,903
- Oh, okay. - I get it.

805
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:38,973
Chicken feet.

806
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:41,273
- Exactly. She spit it out. - Yes, that.

807
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,248
(Thanks to her real-life acting, they get the answer quickly.)

808
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:42,783
She made the shape.

809
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:44,418
(Old-fashioned tonkatsu)

810
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:44,643
- Daniel, watch. - Okay, go ahead.

811
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,258
(Cheating)

812
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:47,753
- You can't hum. - Why are you humming?

813
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,053
Just stick to eating it.

814
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:55,798
(Old-fashioned tonkatsu)

815
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:53,393
A steak.

816
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:54,623
Pork cutlet!

817
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:56,163
- Old-fashioned tonkatsu. - That's the one!

818
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,698
(Correct)

819
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:57,593
- Okay. - Nice.

820
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,063
- Old-fashioned tonkatsu. - That's the one!

821
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:01,908
(Thanks to Ssaebssaeb, Team Daniel already has 3 points.)

822
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,533
Okay!

823
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,263
Unbelievable.

824
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,478
(Buckwheat noodles on a plate)

825
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:03,533
Like this.

826
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:05,003
- Buckwheat noodles on a plate. - Okay.

827
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:05,978
(Correct)

828
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,803
- Okay, he's got it. - Ji Hyo's great at this.

829
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:08,073
- She's great. - This team is good at this.

830
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,273
Ji Hyo seems to be in great form.

831
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:14,588
(Sparkling water)

832
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:10,303
- Go ahead. - Ji Hyo seems to be in great form.

833
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,373
- It's a beverage. - Soju.

834
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:14,573
- I get it. - Sparkling water.

835
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,918
(Correct)

836
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:15,783
Right, sparkling water.

837
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:18,718
(With this momentum...)

838
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:17,943
What's that?

839
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,213
Don't act like you're good at this.

840
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:24,358
(Young radish kimchi)

841
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,423
- It's kimchi. - I know what this is.

842
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:23,483
- Napa cabbage kimchi. - It's not that.

843
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,183
- The ends of it. - Yes, that's the one.

844
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,098
(Crunching)

845
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,293
Young radish kimchi.

846
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:27,328
(Correct)

847
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,423
Okay!

848
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:29,493
- Young radish kimchi. - Okay!

849
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:30,538
(They get one right after another.)

850
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:30,693
They're really good at this.

851
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:32,838
(The 3 minutes is up.)

852
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:32,963
This team's good at this.

853
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:34,293
You got a total...

854
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:36,008
(With amazing teamwork, Team Daniel got 6 points.)

855
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:35,833
- of six correct answers. - We did a good job.

856
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,933
- That wasn't bad. - We got six.

857
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:37,278
(Current score: Team Daniel 6 points, Team Kang Hoon 3 points)

858
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,003
- Nice. - Ji Hyo, we did great.

859
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,548
(The Empty Heads found their thing.)

860
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,203
That team did great.

861
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,433
- Ye Eun, you go first. - Okay, I'll go first.

862
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:41,908
(First place has 6 points.)

863
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:43,973
- Seok Sam, go ahead. - Should I guess first?

864
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:45,648
(Lastly, it is Team Ye Eun's turn.)

865
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:45,743
- Seok Jin, you can get it, right? - Okay.

866
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:47,718
(This is the seat that will answer.)

867
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:46,773
- Do your best. - Got it.

868
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:48,773
- Let's do this. - We've got this!

869
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,013
- Let's go. - Go, team.

870
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,213
- How many did you get again? - Six.

871
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:54,458
(Will they be able to succeed with 7 answers?)

872
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:52,343
We'll get seven.

873
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:53,613
- Seven. - All right.

874
00:20:53,613 --> 00:20:55,013
- Get ready. - That team did great.

875
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:56,898
(Start)

876
00:20:55,883 --> 00:20:56,953
You have to describe it well.

877
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:00,628
(Shuddering)

878
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,623
- A lemon. - Yes!

879
00:21:02,623 --> 00:21:04,093
- Nice. - That was easy.

880
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,268
(Correct)

881
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:05,093
Nicely done.

882
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:06,638
(Food Fighter is in her element.)

883
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,408
(Laughing)

884
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:09,733
Hurry up.

885
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:11,063
A banana!

886
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,403
- Wait, what's that? - What is he having?

887
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:16,203
Wait, what's that?

888
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,248
(Peeling something off)

889
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:17,803
- Eat it. - Why won't you eat it?

890
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,873
- What is it? A sausage? - Express the taste.

891
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:19,518
(Eating)

892
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:21,543
A sausage.

893
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:22,983
- What's that? - A sausage.

894
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,888
(What is eaten like that?)

895
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,783
- What is that? - What is he having?

896
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,053
- What is that? - What is it?

897
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,053
What's that?

898
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:28,453
That must be noodles.

899
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,358
(The thing that he is peeling vigorously is...)

900
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:29,883
What's that?

901
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:30,828
(Grilled prawn)

902
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:33,628
(How is this a grilled prawn?)

903
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:32,753
What's that?

904
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:36,623
What's that?

905
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,233
- With a good view... - What's that?

906
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:42,678
(The view he has in mind)

907
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:41,933
- What's that? - You can't talk.

908
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,063
What's with him?

909
00:21:43,063 --> 00:21:44,233
He says the view is splendid.

910
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:45,138
(But...)

911
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:45,733
What's that?

912
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:48,008
(He just looks like a monkey peeling a banana.)

913
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,873
- What's that? - What's with him?

914
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:52,218
(He's been peeling the shell for 40 seconds.)

915
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,903
- What's that? - He says the view is splendid.

916
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:53,513
- What is that? - Pass!

917
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:55,048
(He passes.)

918
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,443
- It's a tough one. - What was it?

919
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:57,018
(They only got 1 answer.)

920
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:56,743
- What was it? - How was that enough?

921
00:21:57,018 --> 00:22:00,188
(Lollipop)

922
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:00,953
- A lollipop. - Nice.

923
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:04,298
(It only took Ye Eun 3 seconds.)

924
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,353
- There you go. - Good job.

925
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:06,093
- Nice. We got two. - Good job.

926
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:07,893
- Let's get seven. - Hurry up.

927
00:22:08,023 --> 00:22:09,263
Hurry up.

928
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:09,268
(Cheese stick)

929
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:11,038
(A cheese pull)

930
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:12,863
- That's cheese. - No, it's not.

931
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:15,233
- Pizza. Isn't it pizza? - No.

932
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:16,603
Isn't it pizza?

933
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:20,048
(Legendary acting from a theater major)

934
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,633
How can you not know this?

935
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,073
- That's a bun. - Taffy!

936
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:21,373
- I get it. - Isn't it pizza?

937
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:22,943
I think I know what it is.

938
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:24,573
- Don't tell them. - What is it?

939
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:25,943
- It's pizza. - They'll finish last.

940
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,443
- What's that? Taffy? - Come on.

941
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,258
(Frustrated)

942
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:30,043
- Taffy. - It's not that.

943
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,143
Then... Is it gum?

944
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:32,758
(Cheese)

945
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:33,783
Bubblegum.

946
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:35,383
- Jjondeugi. - Right.

947
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:37,253
This...

948
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:40,468
(He keeps naming snacks from corner shops back in the day.)

949
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:40,923
What could that be?

950
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:42,193
- What's this? - Pass.

951
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:42,638
(Frustrated)

952
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:44,463
- Think Italy. - What on earth is that?

953
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:45,168
(He passes after wasting time.)

954
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,233
- A cheese stick. - What was that?

955
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,633
- Why do you keep giving me those? - Hurry up.

956
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:51,108
(There's 1 minute left, and he got another grilled seafood.)

957
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:50,733
Faster!

958
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:54,473
- Raw fish? - What's that?

959
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:54,048
(Slurping)

960
00:22:56,148 --> 00:22:57,578
(Oh, no!)

961
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,743
- What is that? - I get it.

962
00:22:57,678 --> 00:23:01,048
(Frustrated)

963
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:01,113
- Do better, will you? - I get it.

964
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,243
- Octopus. - There you go.

965
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,413
- Look at him using his left hand. - Hey.

966
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,888
(ASMR for opening clams)

967
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:07,053
You can't speak.

968
00:23:07,028 --> 00:23:10,498
(Pop!)

969
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,653
- Pop! - Skewered octopus.

970
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:11,053
- Look at him using his left hand. - You can't speak.

971
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:12,668
(Grunting)

972
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,393
Garaetteok.

973
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:15,753
- No way. - Garaetteok.

974
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:17,093
What a nice view we have.

975
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:18,663
What a nice view we have.

976
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,338
(Enjoying the view again)

977
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,233
- A great view? - Come on!

978
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:21,663
What's with him and great views?

979
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:26,008
(Grilled clams)

980
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:23,963
I get it.

981
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:25,703
And then it goes, pop!

982
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,203
- Seriously? - Grilled clams.

983
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,248
(Pop!)

984
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:28,633
- Okay! - That's cheating.

985
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:28,678
(Correct)

986
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,243
- How else could I have done it? - I got it right away.

987
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:31,348
(He wasted 2 minutes with the shrimp and clams.)

988
00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:31,303
He got another one.

989
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:32,543
All right.

990
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:36,088
(Corn)

991
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:36,943
- This... - What's that? Corn.

992
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:39,728
(For 3 times straight, it took Food Fighter 3 seconds.)

993
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:38,343
Great job.

994
00:23:38,343 --> 00:23:39,453
- Nice. - There you go.

995
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:41,583
- Here we go. - They aren't that difficult.

996
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:40,958
(Hoppang)

997
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,658
(Blowing)

998
00:23:42,783 --> 00:23:43,783
- Hoppang! - I get it.

999
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:45,383
- Nice. Go. - Nicely done.

1000
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:44,898
(Correct)

1001
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:47,898
(Food Fighter quickly gets the team to its 5th correct answer.)

1002
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:46,823
- Hoppang! - I get it.

1003
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:47,853
- Nice. - Nicely done.

1004
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:50,123
- Go. - Let's do this.

1005
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,738
(They'll tie with Team Daniel if they get one more.)

1006
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:51,723
- Let's do this. - Yes.

1007
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:53,108
(It had to be Seok Jin of all people.)

1008
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:54,508
(Corn dog)

1009
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:54,893
What's that?

1010
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,163
He's terrible at this.

1011
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,738
(Laughing)

1012
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,373
- What's that? - Okay, good.

1013
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:00,208
(The 3 minutes is up.)

1014
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,103
- Okay, good. - What was that?

1015
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:03,918
(Unfortunately, Team Ye Eun got 5 points.)

1016
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:03,143
- You only got five. - What was that?

1017
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:04,403
Is that the best you could do?

1018
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,373
Grilled prawn and grilled clams?

1019
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:09,918
(Because Seok Sam wasted all the time, they are 2nd place.)

1020
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:09,113
- Tell me about it. - How can you describe...

1021
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:10,443
eating grilled prawns and grilled clams?

1022
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:11,913
Team Daniel ends in first place.

1023
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:15,288
(Team Daniel finishes 1st with 6 points.)

1024
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:15,183
- Yes! - Okay!

1025
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,123
You're a master at expressing things.

1026
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,423
- But Jong Kook... - You still did great.

1027
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:18,928
(Cutting the retorting)

1028
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,053
- We got the tougher ones. - I agree.

1029
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:22,198
(Team Kang Hoon finishes last with 3 points.)

1030
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:21,223
- It was tough. - The team in first place...

1031
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:22,723
The team in first place...

1032
00:24:22,723 --> 00:24:25,563
will receive two additional votes.

1033
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:27,168
(Team Daniel, who is 1st place, gets 2 votes.)

1034
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:30,033
You can hand them out to anyone you want.

1035
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:30,538
(The captain can give them out as he wants.)

1036
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,933
- Sure. - We should get one each.

1037
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,073
That way, you'll get fewer votes.

1038
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:36,948
(He gives them to his teammates, believing they won't vote for him.)

1039
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:35,233
The team in last place...

1040
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:36,603
- It'd be weird to vote for Ye Eun. - I'll be voting for you.

1041
00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:39,673
The team in second place will receive one additional vote.

1042
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:40,218
(Team Ye Eun, who is 2nd place, gets 1 vote.)

1043
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:41,043
Is this real fur?

1044
00:24:40,218 --> 00:24:42,388
(Not paying attention)

1045
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:43,313
- No, it's faux fur. - It looks real.

1046
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:45,088
(Give it to me.)

1047
00:24:43,613 --> 00:24:45,113
The team leaders...

1048
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:47,983
- Ye Eun gave hers to Jae Seok. - Yes, she gave hers to me.

1049
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:51,153
Why? How is that allowed?

1050
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:51,628
(After seeing it...)

1051
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:53,593
- I got it from the team leader. - That's not fair.

1052
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,253
The team leader gave it to me.

1053
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:58,698
(He didn't focus and got a sudden blow.)

1054
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:57,163
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Ye Eun gave it to me.

1055
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,123
- I got it from the team leader. - Did you give it to him?

1056
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,433
- Yes, I did. - How could you?

1057
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:01,508
(Ye Eun answers him immediately.)

1058
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,633
Okay, fine. I'll vote for you.

1059
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,203
- I'm voting for you. - Use the reflection ticket.

1060
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:10,478
(Enraged Papa Jee declares revenge after his daughter's betrayal.)

1061
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,733
If I get a vote, I'll vote for you.

1062
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,473
- I got it from the team leader. - Fine.

1063
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,403
- I got it from the team leader. - Guys, I'm voting for Ye Eun.

1064
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,973
The team in last place didn't win any additional votes.

1065
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:12,918
(Current number of votes)

1066
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:15,088
(The team in the last place doesn't have extra votes.)

1067
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,113
- Okay, fine. - It's okay.

1068
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,213
What can we do, right?

1069
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,543
You'll be moving to another location shortly...

1070
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,383
- for lunch. - Sure.

1071
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:22,753
The three youngest members will divide you all into teams again.

1072
00:25:19,528 --> 00:25:23,698
(The team leaders will decide who they'll have lunch with.)

1073
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:26,153
Ye Eun and Hoon can't team up today.

1074
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:28,293
- They can't enjoy a meal together. - Serves you right.

1075
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:32,038
(Daniel chooses first since he won the last game.)

1076
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:29,993
We could be playing another game.

1077
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:30,993
Of course.

1078
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:33,968
(Clucking tongue)

1079
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:36,738
(Signaling to him as if he were a baby)

1080
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:36,663
- Hold on. - What?

1081
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:39,063
- Why were you clucking your tongue? - What's the matter with you?

1082
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:40,833
I choose Haha.

1083
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:43,878
(Daniel chooses Haha after receiving the signal.)

1084
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:44,573
- Why... Come on. - Why are you exchanging signals?

1085
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:47,013
- Jae Seok. - Okay. Good.

1086
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:46,918
(Ye Eun chooses Jae Seok again.)

1087
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:48,088
(Pick me now!)

1088
00:25:47,043 --> 00:25:48,043
I'm next.

1089
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,718
(High hopes)

1090
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:50,843
Seok Jin!

1091
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:52,883
- For real? - Okay.

1092
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:56,258
(Mumbling)

1093
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:56,453
Okay. That's fine. I didn't expect much anyway.

1094
00:25:56,753 --> 00:25:59,183
- Okay. - You're too unpopular.

1095
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:01,028
(Laughing)

1096
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:00,923
That's not true.

1097
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:02,428
(Team Kang Hoon, Team Ye Eun, Team Daniel)

1098
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,253
I choose Jong Kook.

1099
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:04,463
- Okay! - I won't vote for you, Ye Eun.

1100
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:06,138
(They finished picking their teams.)

1101
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,263
- Okay. - Let's go!

1102
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:08,533
What's this? Why are you filming us here?

1103
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:10,863
- The car... - Why are you filming us?

1104
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,033
- How interesting. - What's going on?

1105
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,273
- What's the matter? - Why are you filming?

1106
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:14,473
- What's this? - Are we splitting up?

1107
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,803
We move in teams.

1108
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:18,548
(Instead of riding the bus together, they'll split into 3 cars?)

1109
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:17,073
We split by team?

1110
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:19,303
You will move in teams separately...

1111
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:21,413
- to get lunch. - What?

1112
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,743
There are two locations to choose from.

1113
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,513
A buffet or a barbecue restaurant.

1114
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:28,653
I like both.

1115
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,783
- The team leader gets to pick. - Is that so?

1116
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:33,523
The team leader decides the menu.

1117
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:34,553
- Really? - Okay.

1118
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:37,093
- Where do you want to go? - What the leader wants...

1119
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:38,763
- Go where you want. - could differ from our choice.

1120
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,363
- Then I'll just... - You decide.

1121
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:42,033
- I've decided. - We must go together.

1122
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,803
Go where you want.

1123
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,308
(Ears perked up)

1124
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,303
- Then I'll just... - You decide.

1125
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,503
I have an upset stomach and can't eat.

1126
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,878
(He has indigestion.)

1127
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:50,803
- Then a buffet's better. - Yes. There could be porridge.

1128
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:52,248
(Right)

1129
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:52,573
- Porridge... - You're right.

1130
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,343
- Ye Eun, are you... - To eat porridge.

1131
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:56,113
choosing the buffet because you heard Kang Hoon will go?

1132
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,043
- No. Why are you copying me? - That was our decision all along.

1133
00:26:58,043 --> 00:26:59,953
- We agreed on the buffet. - I love buffets.

1134
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:02,213
We haven't decided, but we might pick the buffet.

1135
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:04,228
(Coincidentally, the two leaders want to go to the same place.)

1136
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:03,953
- You know I like buffets, right? - We chose the buffet too.

1137
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:06,423
Everything's up to the young leaders today.

1138
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:08,268
(Today, the troublemakers can go anywhere they want.)

1139
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:07,423
- Really? - Yes.

1140
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:08,593
- Buffet. - Kang Hoon, whatever you want.

1141
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,623
- Team Ye Eun, buffet. - Yes.

1142
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:12,293
- We'll go to the buffet. - Buffet.

1143
00:27:12,393 --> 00:27:14,193
- Barbecue restaurant. - Barbecue restaurant.

1144
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:17,963
We can't give you a meal for free.

1145
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,273
There's a simple lunch mission.

1146
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,708
(A meal challenge with voting rights at stake)

1147
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,603
- What is it? - The three teammates...

1148
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:25,473
must hold hands as you eat.

1149
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:27,613
Hold hands as you eat.

1150
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:28,813
My gosh.

1151
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,413
- A buffet's the worst for that. - The buffet's the worst.

1152
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:31,713
Yes, Haha. You're right.

1153
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:33,783
- Good pick. - A barbecue restaurant's better.

1154
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:35,388
(At a buffet, just getting the food onto their plates is a challenge.)

1155
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:36,183
A barbecue restaurant's much better.

1156
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:37,653
This will be tough.

1157
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,123
- Yes. One person... - One person...

1158
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:40,423
Do we feed the one person?

1159
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:42,753
- The one in the middle... - They'll have no extra hands.

1160
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:44,093
- Yes. - We'll be like this.

1161
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:45,238
(It'd be the most unconfortable for him.)

1162
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:45,263
We must do this.

1163
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,963
You'll head to your destinations in a car,

1164
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:48,593
and the moment you get out,

1165
00:27:48,593 --> 00:27:51,403
- you must hold hands right away. - Holding hands...

1166
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,873
- We'll then time you. - Okay.

1167
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,873
What will we time?

1168
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:58,703
You need to get a member of the public to comment,

1169
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:02,518
(They'll measure how long it takes to hear "You look happy.")

1170
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:00,213
"You look happy."

1171
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:02,213
- I'm happy. - Yes.

1172
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,583
We must keep smiling.

1173
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:04,713
Yes.

1174
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:09,153
In the order you get someone to say that,

1175
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:11,523
the first team gets 150 points, the second gets 100,

1176
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,793
- the third gets 50 points. - Okay.

1177
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:16,993
You must hold hands and try to look as happy as possible.

1178
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:19,693
- You bet. - That's the mission.

1179
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:21,693
And feed each other.

1180
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:24,633
However, if you let go of someone's hand,

1181
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:27,203
you lose a point for every second you're apart.

1182
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:29,073
- Okay. - Even if someone says...

1183
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:30,843
"you look happy" to you early on,

1184
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,703
- It's of no help. - you could lose points...

1185
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:35,348
(If they lose a lot of points, their rankings might change.)

1186
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:33,813
- and flip the score. - Of course.

1187
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,713
Also, if you ask "How do we look?"

1188
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:38,713
or say the word "happy" to get someone...

1189
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:40,653
- to say the sentence, - We can't even say the word.

1190
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:42,883
that chance will be voided, and we'll deduct points.

1191
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:43,883
Understood.

1192
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:46,753
We'll deduct the points you lost from the points you gained,

1193
00:28:46,753 --> 00:28:50,563
and give you a number of votes depending on your rank.

1194
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:52,723
You can go to your restaurants now.

1195
00:28:52,723 --> 00:28:54,493
- Okay! - Let's go.

1196
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:56,933
If someone says we look happy...

1197
00:28:55,538 --> 00:28:58,478
(Team Ye Eun is going to the buffet.)

1198
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,303
I get that a lot these days.

1199
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,103
Which buffet are we going to?

1200
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:03,073
The one in Yeouido we went to before.

1201
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:04,103
- There? - That place?

1202
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,973
- That place? - The food there is amazing.

1203
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:10,288
(Ye Eun loved that place on Miracle Breakfast Morning.)

1204
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,143
- The food there is amazing. - The quality there...

1205
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:12,883
makes it a high-class buffet.

1206
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:14,988
(Is she sad?)

1207
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:16,253
- You must avoid heavy seasoning. - Yes.

1208
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:20,198
(She can't eat heavily seasoned food due to health issues.)

1209
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:17,953
For how long?

1210
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,523
For three more weeks.

1211
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:20,993
- For three weeks? - Yes.

1212
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,893
- I have butterflies. - Why?

1213
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:25,763
- Because of the buffet? - I loved that buffet a lot.

1214
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:26,863
You're in no condition to...

1215
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:29,838
(The buffet will have nothing she can eat.)

1216
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:29,033
Didn't you say you wouldn't eat much?

1217
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,503
There's not much I can eat right now.

1218
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,303
- Really? - But I like to watch.

1219
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:34,473
- Watch what? - To me,

1220
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,903
- that's happiness. - Watching others eat?

1221
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:39,103
Some people feel a dopamine rush when they buy...

1222
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:39,818
(Food Fighter becomes happy just by looking at food.)

1223
00:29:39,103 --> 00:29:41,473
- something really nice. - Yes.

1224
00:29:41,473 --> 00:29:44,013
But even something small can make you happy.

1225
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:45,583
I think I'm like that.

1226
00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:47,658
(Feeling happy over small things)

1227
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,413
- Your whole life... - The quality goes way up.

1228
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:49,053
That's a really good attitude.

1229
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,583
When I bought a tube of toothpaste that had a good rating online.

1230
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:54,328
(Jong Kook's small but definite happiness)

1231
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,993
I see...

1232
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,153
And others even gave me some.

1233
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:57,263
And now, I have a lot of toothpaste and soap.

1234
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:58,493
That makes me happy.

1235
00:29:58,493 --> 00:29:59,793
Tell me what you bought.

1236
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:01,008
(Tell me which toothpaste is good.)

1237
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:04,433
Stop talking nonsense and brush your own teeth regularly.

1238
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,833
- You rarely brush your teeth... - I brush them often.

1239
00:30:05,438 --> 00:30:08,608
(Rumor has it that she rarely brushes her teeth on set.)

1240
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,603
Just brush often with any toothpaste and you'll be fine.

1241
00:30:10,103 --> 00:30:11,703
You savor the aftertaste, don't you?

1242
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,813
What? How do you know that?

1243
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,413
- The taste disappears... - If you brush...

1244
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,643
- if you brush right away. - Exactly.

1245
00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:20,253
So what if you use nice toothpaste if you don't brush your teeth often?

1246
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,753
The taste of the food disappears if you brush your teeth.

1247
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:23,528
(Disgusted)

1248
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,753
- Yes. - I want to enjoy the taste.

1249
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:23,923
- You want to savor that. - Yes. I want to savor it.

1250
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,123
I know what you mean.

1251
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,153
My gosh, Ye Eun.

1252
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,228
(Troublemaker Ye Eun's ridiculous tooth-brushing philosophy)

1253
00:30:26,153 --> 00:30:27,953
But you should brush after a little while.

1254
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:30,393
Where did that rumor start?

1255
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:33,263
I heard you use coffee as a mouthwash.

1256
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:35,293
What?

1257
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:37,678
(The report is pretty detailed.)

1258
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:38,033
- Where did that rumor come from? - Only close people would know that.

1259
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,773
How come...

1260
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,448
(She doesn't refute.)

1261
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,373
- Who said that? - Who said that?

1262
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,103
You're so funny, Ye Eun.

1263
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:47,313
- Kang Hoon joined us today. - Yes.

1264
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,573
You're not interested, right?

1265
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:49,843
- I'm not interested. - Right.

1266
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:51,143
- It shows, doesn't it? - Okay.

1267
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,283
What if he asked you out?

1268
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:56,053
What? Then I might date him.

1269
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:57,758
(Love Ddochi hasn't changed.)

1270
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:57,053
You might?

1271
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:58,723
But I'm not interested.

1272
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,528
(Acting cool)

1273
00:30:58,723 --> 00:30:59,923
- You're not. - You're not interested.

1274
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:01,893
- We get it. - But you'd date him...

1275
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,493
- if he asked. - If he pursued me.

1276
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,538
(Her only crush she's not interested in is...)

1277
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:05,423
- It depends on what he says? - Yes.

1278
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:09,363
Kang Hoon, you like smaller girls, don't you?

1279
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:10,463
The cute ones.

1280
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:11,503
- Women? - Yes.

1281
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,003
- Yes, you're right. - Right?

1282
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,303
- Small girls? - Yes.

1283
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:17,348
(A small and cute girl?)

1284
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:16,473
- Small, cute girls. - Yes.

1285
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:18,103
- Cute women. - Someone cute.

1286
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:20,413
What if she's tall but cute?

1287
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,773
I don't really like tall women.

1288
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:27,058
(Ji-gannou is defeated.)

1289
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:29,213
What height range would you consider small?

1290
00:31:27,358 --> 00:31:29,998
(Perplexed)

1291
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:31,953
- Who would you consider tall? - She can't reach my shoulder.

1292
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:33,023
I see.

1293
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:36,098
(Ye Eun is a full head above his shoulders.)

1294
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:35,623
- That's about 163cm. - Ye Eun...

1295
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,763
- Later on, Ye Eun... - She's 172cm tall.

1296
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:39,393
- That's... - You weren't that serious.

1297
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:42,133
It's fine. Everyone has an ideal type.

1298
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,903
Has it ever changed drastically?

1299
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,378
(Has your ideal type ever changed drastically?)

1300
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,103
How do you mean?

1301
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,203
- The style? - Yes.

1302
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:47,933
I don't think so. Not until now.

1303
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:50,103
- It's rare for men. - The people I was attracted to...

1304
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:51,578
(His preferences are always the same.)

1305
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:51,643
were almost always like that.

1306
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,713
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1307
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:54,448
(I feel bad for Ye Eun.)

1308
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:55,113
What about you, Ji Hyo?

1309
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,413
- Me? - Yes.

1310
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:58,413
When did you break up with your last boyfriend?

1311
00:32:00,513 --> 00:32:03,123
Four to five years ago? I think it was about that time.

1312
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:04,683
You dated someone 4 to 5 years ago?

1313
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,423
How long were you together?

1314
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:08,323
A pretty long time.

1315
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:10,763
For about...

1316
00:32:11,823 --> 00:32:12,923
eight years?

1317
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:13,933
What?

1318
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:19,408
(Shocking admission: Ji Hyo dated for 8 years.)

1319
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,803
- Eight years? - What?

1320
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:19,133
- For how long? 8 years? - She said 8 years.

1321
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,473
Eight years?

1322
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,048
(Surprised)

1323
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,603
- Can this go on TV? - Yes.

1324
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:24,673
Why can't it?

1325
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:25,873
Is it the guy we know?

1326
00:32:25,873 --> 00:32:27,613
- It's not him. - We don't know the guy.

1327
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:31,018
(None of the members know who she dated for 8 years.)

1328
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,413
You dated a guy we don't know for eight years?

1329
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:30,683
You don't know him.

1330
00:32:31,543 --> 00:32:33,613
- You were on Running Man then. - Yes.

1331
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:33,958
(If she dated for 8 years)

1332
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:34,813
Pass me my coffee.

1333
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:37,328
(She's the only one who is calm after revealing the shocking truth.)

1334
00:32:34,813 --> 00:32:36,113
You were dating 4 to 5 years ago.

1335
00:32:36,313 --> 00:32:37,523
Yes, I was.

1336
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,623
What was his job? I had no idea about him.

1337
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,523
We don't ask each other about that.

1338
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:43,823
I didn't tell because no one asked.

1339
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:44,968
(So cool)

1340
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,963
Gosh. You had a boyfriend until 4 to 5 years ago.

1341
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:48,408
(Bewildered)

1342
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,303
- Gosh. - No way...

1343
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,873
I really had no idea. You dated him behind our backs?

1344
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,043
I didn't tell because you didn't ask.

1345
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:59,148
(It seems Seok Sam is quite shocked.)

1346
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:58,103
Yes, we didn't ask.

1347
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:00,243
I didn't feel the need to tell.

1348
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:04,688
(She was dating when we filmed this?)

1349
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:05,113
That's impressive. No one knew.

1350
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,713
- I'm impressed. - I didn't tell.

1351
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:10,858
(He seems more shocked than when he heard about Jong Kook's marriage.)

1352
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,013
- Telling that... - I kept it quiet.

1353
00:33:09,013 --> 00:33:11,253
It's okay to tell the viewers you dated for eight years?

1354
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,383
Yes, it's fine.

1355
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:15,168
(He's losing it.)

1356
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:15,353
It must've been a tough break-up if you dated for that long.

1357
00:33:15,353 --> 00:33:16,393
An eight-year relationship...

1358
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:18,823
- Shared memories everywhere... - Yes.

1359
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:21,663
You met for an incredibly long time.

1360
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:23,633
That's so shocking.

1361
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:25,708
(Repeating it again)

1362
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:26,103
None of you knew about that?

1363
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:28,103
No. We don't ask about such things.

1364
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:29,303
No one asked.

1365
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:31,118
(But she's calm.)

1366
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:31,343
- You dated him for eight years? - Yes.

1367
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,373
This is like a first-ever confession.

1368
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:38,318
(While his colleague of 15 years put him in a deep shock...)

1369
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,143
That's amazing. I'm in shock.

1370
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:41,513
Did it take you seven months to realize you were clueless?

1371
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,858
(Someone is shocked to find out how clueless he is.)

1372
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:44,853
Well, to be exact...

1373
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:46,823
I got it after five months.

1374
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:51,968
(He hasn't noticed for quite a while.)

1375
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:50,293
- That was so funny. - After five months...

1376
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:51,893
I wasn't sure if you were serious.

1377
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:54,293
For five months, I wondered if she was being serious.

1378
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,663
- You know when we played games? - Yes.

1379
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,103
I didn't get it. I just couldn't understand.

1380
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:04,143
Why are you telling us that now?

1381
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,703
You pretended to be used to it.

1382
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:08,188
(He finally confesses that he's not good at understanding the rules.)

1383
00:34:05,703 --> 00:34:06,743
You pretended to understand.

1384
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:07,913
You pretended to be relaxed.

1385
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,983
Look at me. I'm at rock bottom.

1386
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:12,883
If I get just one thing right,

1387
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:14,613
- What about me? - they praise me.

1388
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,423
- I score 20 percent at dictation. - Right.

1389
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,823
But I'm the Yu Jae Seok of the empty heads.

1390
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:21,993
- I don't think that's right. - That description...

1391
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,123
- What? - You're not...

1392
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:24,593
- Do you know why I feel betrayed? - Why?

1393
00:34:24,593 --> 00:34:27,493
I don't know when, but you stopped wanting to be one of us.

1394
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:30,763
He tries to stay away in case we expose what he's really like.

1395
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:32,203
- No, that's not true. - He doesn't participate in quizzes.

1396
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,133
No. Come on.

1397
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,303
- Please. - I'm Ha Dong Hoon.

1398
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:39,203
- I know, but... - K-I-T-C-H-E-N, kitchen.

1399
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,913
I know that word. C-H-E-N.

1400
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,413
Yes. Can you spell "Christmas?"

1401
00:34:43,643 --> 00:34:45,683
- Oh, please. Come on, Haha. - Spell it.

1402
00:34:44,658 --> 00:34:46,358
(They suddenly start competing to see who's more foolish.)

1403
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:46,953
- Haha. - Can you spell it?

1404
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:53,728
(How do you spell Christmas?)

1405
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:48,253
Christmas is coming up.

1406
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,883
"Christmas" isn't spelled exactly how it sounds.

1407
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,323
- Okay. Spell it out. - Spell it.

1408
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,023
- C-H... - C-H...

1409
00:34:54,023 --> 00:34:55,253
- Yes. - What's next?

1410
00:34:55,253 --> 00:34:57,463
- R-I... - R-I...

1411
00:34:57,723 --> 00:34:59,563
- S... - S...

1412
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:01,133
- And then... "Christmas." - Yes.

1413
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,193
- We're almost there. - Yes. So what's next?

1414
00:35:03,193 --> 00:35:04,863
- There's another letter. - What is it?

1415
00:35:04,863 --> 00:35:07,133
- Say it. - There's a hidden secret.

1416
00:35:10,278 --> 00:35:13,518
(Not everyone knows that there's "T.")

1417
00:35:10,643 --> 00:35:12,373
- It's a secret? - It's a secret.

1418
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:14,273
This is where many people mess up.

1419
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:16,643
- Don't try to laugh it off. - This is where they get it wrong.

1420
00:35:16,643 --> 00:35:18,313
This is where people get it wrong.

1421
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:20,288
(Daniel has a chance.)

1422
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:19,913
They mess up after C-H-R-I.

1423
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:23,483
- C-H-R-I-S... - Yes.

1424
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,953
- What's next? - It's a secret.

1425
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:27,293
After that...

1426
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:30,723
Some could even think there's a silent letter.

1427
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:32,968
(Making a long excuse)

1428
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:32,263
- Yes. - That's right.

1429
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,263
- Yes. - It's a secret.

1430
00:35:33,263 --> 00:35:36,233
- We don't have to expose a secret. - No.

1431
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:38,503
That's why we say "X-mas" when we're confused.

1432
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,733
- X-mas. - Right?

1433
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:42,333
- Gosh. How funny. - Gosh.

1434
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:43,248
(While their lack of knowledge is kept a secret...)

1435
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:44,473
We've arrived at the restaurant.

1436
00:35:43,378 --> 00:35:46,078
(Team Ye Eun arrives at a hotel in Yeouido.)

1437
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:46,543
- We're here again. - I love this place so much.

1438
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:47,673
If we want to look happy,

1439
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:49,918
(The mission began the moment they got off.)

1440
00:35:47,673 --> 00:35:49,013
- shouldn't we skip like this? - Right.

1441
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,843
- Well, we should keep smiling. - Keep smiling.

1442
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:52,318
(They have to hear people say, "You look happy.")

1443
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:53,043
- Even when we get our food... - Yes?

1444
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,428
(Every time they let go of each other's hand,)

1445
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:54,353
- So, Jae Seok, - Right.

1446
00:35:53,428 --> 00:35:54,528
(1 point is lost per second.)

1447
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:55,813
you should carry the food tray.

1448
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:57,183
- I'll get the food with the tongs. - Okay.

1449
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:59,153
That's good. Cooperation is good.

1450
00:35:58,598 --> 00:36:01,768
(Ye Eun thinks about how to eat.)

1451
00:35:59,153 --> 00:36:00,623
- Also, - We must do that, no matter what.

1452
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:02,853
even when we're getting our food, we have to keep going like...

1453
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:05,798
(Jae Seok worries about the mission.)

1454
00:36:04,293 --> 00:36:05,863
- This is so nice. - It is.

1455
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,593
We should go like, "Oh, this!"

1456
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:09,368
(A happy smile)

1457
00:36:07,593 --> 00:36:09,533
- We need to give off that vibe. - I'm excited.

1458
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,733
I'm so glad.

1459
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,733
We're already starting now.

1460
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:13,933
- Hi! - Hi!

1461
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,003
Hello.

1462
00:36:15,003 --> 00:36:17,003
- Hi! - Hi! Hello.

1463
00:36:17,043 --> 00:36:19,303
Hello.

1464
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:21,773
- Oh, boy. - We can't ask how we look, right?

1465
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:22,813
- No, we can't. - That's right.

1466
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:25,583
- Hello. - Hi.

1467
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:27,228
(Expressing happiness with their whole bodies)

1468
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:28,713
- Gosh, this is so nice. - But we kind of...

1469
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,858
(Laughing)

1470
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:29,983
look like we're out of our minds.

1471
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:31,398
(Embarrassed)

1472
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:31,723
- This is so nice. - Oh, from last time...

1473
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,553
- Hello. - Hi.

1474
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:35,253
- Hi. - We met last time and again today.

1475
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:39,268
(The mission isn't as easy as they thought.)

1476
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:38,493
People who are working wouldn't say stuff like that.

1477
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:39,523
- No, they wouldn't. - Right.

1478
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:40,593
It's really hard to hear something like that.

1479
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:41,693
- It's hard. People don't say it. - Yes.

1480
00:36:41,008 --> 00:36:44,008
(They're heading to the floor where the buffet is.)

1481
00:36:41,693 --> 00:36:43,163
They don't say it even between close friends.

1482
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:44,803
- Look at this. - Gosh, the smell.

1483
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:46,303
The smell is insane.

1484
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:47,503
Gosh, that smell.

1485
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,343
- This is so nice, isn't it? - Yes, I'm glad.

1486
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:50,978
(The buffet is bustling...)

1487
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:54,488
(even during lunch on a weekday.)

1488
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:54,173
- I'm hungry. - How nice.

1489
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,273
Let's do this.

1490
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:57,918
(Will they be able to hear people say, "You look happy?")

1491
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:56,813
- What will we do? - I love this place so much.

1492
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,343
- To people... - Just being here...

1493
00:36:58,343 --> 00:36:59,583
What should we do? Should we smile?

1494
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,053
- Hello. - Gosh, let's smile.

1495
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:06,023
- Oh, my. Hello! - Hello. It's been a while.

1496
00:37:02,228 --> 00:37:05,598
(Suddenly smiling brightly)

1497
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:08,628
(Really getting into mission mode as soon as they enter the buffet)

1498
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,053
We meet again.

1499
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:08,053
- Hello. - Welcome.

1500
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:09,823
Gosh, it's so nice.

1501
00:37:09,823 --> 00:37:11,093
- I love it so much. - Just seeing this makes me hap...

1502
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:12,363
I'm so glad.

1503
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,563
- Just seeing this makes me hap... - I'm so glad.

1504
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:14,738
(Glaring)

1505
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:14,833
I'm so glad.

1506
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,663
Gosh, yes.

1507
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:18,308
(It doesn't count if they actually say the word "happy.")

1508
00:37:17,003 --> 00:37:18,533
- I'm so glad. - Yes.

1509
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:21,978
(Their first try ended as just an attempt.)

1510
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:20,803
Gosh, seriously.

1511
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,533
- I don't think anyone will say it. - Hearing that we look happy...

1512
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:23,673
Honestly, it's hard to hear...

1513
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:25,343
- that we look happy here. - It is, to be honest.

1514
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,543
Also, it's like...

1515
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:30,158
(They need a clever way to get people to say it.)

1516
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,173
- People don't say that very much. - Right.

1517
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:31,513
- Well, that is true. - I think they were looking at us.

1518
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,488
(Spotting their target)

1519
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:37,028
(Kook spotted them.)

1520
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:34,783
- Hello. - Go.

1521
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:36,013
- Oh, yes. - Hello.

1522
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:38,783
My goodness. Enjoy your meal.

1523
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:41,423
- The food looks good. - You got a lot of good food.

1524
00:37:41,423 --> 00:37:43,763
Indeed, eating good food makes you the most...

1525
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,938
(Indeed, eating good food makes you the most "happy.")

1526
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,593
- You have lots of protein. So nice. - Delicious food.

1527
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:46,338
(You have lots of protein. It'd make you "happy.")

1528
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:47,193
You got a lot of good food.

1529
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:48,608
(Due to their half-hearted happiness gaslighting,)

1530
00:37:47,193 --> 00:37:49,193
Indeed, eating good food makes you the most...

1531
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:51,538
(they didn't notice anything at all.)

1532
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:51,963
- You have lots of protein. So nice. - Delicious food.

1533
00:37:52,463 --> 00:37:54,273
- See? This is going to be hard. - Darn it.

1534
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:56,648
(Their second attempt failed as well.)

1535
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,673
- It's hard. - Yes, it is.

1536
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,503
- It won't be easy. - Where are the plates?

1537
00:37:56,678 --> 00:37:59,148
(Laughing)

1538
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,043
- Hello. - Hello.

1539
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,748
(Right then, Team Kang Hoon arrives at the buffet.)

1540
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:02,673
- Hello. - Hello.

1541
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:07,228
(They're laughing like they've lost their minds.)

1542
00:38:04,613 --> 00:38:06,013
Hello.

1543
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:07,783
- Hello. - Hello.

1544
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,053
Have a good day.

1545
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:10,958
(This won't work.)

1546
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:10,983
- Hello. Have a good day. - It's nice to meet you.

1547
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:12,353
We are...

1548
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:13,723
We are holding hands like this.

1549
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:16,153
We walk around in such a friendly atmosphere. Pardon?

1550
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:16,228
(Team Leader Hoon makes it more obvious.)

1551
00:38:16,153 --> 00:38:18,363
- Is this a mission? - Right.

1552
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,438
(A staff member asks them.)

1553
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:19,723
- That could be the case... - Oh, but...

1554
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:20,138
(Responding right away)

1555
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:20,863
What, Ye Eun?

1556
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:23,538
(They spot Team Ye Eun that was here first.)

1557
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,063
I should have some udon.

1558
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:24,678
(Tapping)

1559
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:24,833
I should have some udon.

1560
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,638
(Laughing awkwardly)

1561
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:29,748
(The Korean Joker's only skill is laughing.)

1562
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:30,943
You seriously look so grim.

1563
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:32,043
Gosh, thank you.

1564
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:33,943
- Let's get food too. - Hang on.

1565
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:36,688
(They're going to get food first.)

1566
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,013
- Let's get food too. - Let's get some too.

1567
00:38:35,643 --> 00:38:36,843
Here, hold this.

1568
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:38,583
- Ji Hyo, you can't hold it. - Oh, you can't do this.

1569
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,913
Here, you hold this.

1570
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:42,788
(Ji Hyo can't use her hands.)

1571
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:43,113
- We should put it down and scoop. - Yes, put it down, then scoop.

1572
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:45,123
- I want to eat this. - Right?

1573
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,893
- I want the crispy pork belly. - Oh, crispy?

1574
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:51,038
(They head to the meat section because Ji Hyo wants to.)

1575
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,053
Hey, isn't this kind of greasy?

1576
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:51,063
- No, I want to eat it. - Oh, crispy pork belly.

1577
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:52,123
Yes, that one.

1578
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:54,468
(Gulping)

1579
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:55,433
- Hey, that looks delicious. - Hey, this is pork neck.

1580
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:57,038
(Now that they see it, they want to eat it.)

1581
00:38:56,803 --> 00:38:58,233
Gosh, that looks amazing. Oh, my.

1582
00:38:58,563 --> 00:38:59,933
That looks so delicious.

1583
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:02,308
(Laughing awkwardly)

1584
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:04,848
(Blasting the worker with his rotten smile)

1585
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:06,643
We're walking around as we hold hands like this.

1586
00:39:04,878 --> 00:39:07,518
(Forcing himself to look happy)

1587
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:08,873
- Oh, okay. - Yes.

1588
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:09,818
(So what?)

1589
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:11,283
- Have a good day. - Have a good day.

1590
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:15,183
- Have a beautiful day. - Okay.

1591
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:15,288
(He doesn't give up and spreads happiness.)

1592
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:18,123
- I'll prepare the pork neck too. - Okay.

1593
00:39:19,228 --> 00:39:21,828
(The worker stays focused on his duty.)

1594
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,838
(He failed to spread happiness.)

1595
00:39:23,723 --> 00:39:24,763
- Yes. - Okay.

1596
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:25,793
Thank you.

1597
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:27,033
Seok Jin, they have sushi over there.

1598
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,533
We're at such a nice place. Why do we have to...

1599
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:30,438
(His strategy to spread happiness isn't working.)

1600
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,163
- walk around holding hands? - Seok Jin...

1601
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:31,663
By the way,

1602
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,703
I'm the only one who can eat this on our team.

1603
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:35,703
- No, we can eat this. - Is that so?

1604
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:38,418
(She can't eat heavily seasoned food, and he has indigestion.)

1605
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:37,243
- You and Ye Eun can eat this. - I...

1606
00:39:37,243 --> 00:39:38,603
- I can't eat this. - Why not?

1607
00:39:38,448 --> 00:39:40,548
(Since Ye Eun and Jong Kook aren't feeling well,)

1608
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:40,173
- Oh, you can't have sauce. - Right now, she...

1609
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:41,273
Right now, Ye Eun...

1610
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:42,648
(they get what Jae Seok wants onto the plate.)

1611
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,043
- Ye Eun, please hold this. - Okay.

1612
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:45,513
- She can't have any sauce. - I can't eat any sauce.

1613
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,853
Oh, we should have some stir-fried vegetables.

1614
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:49,053
- My gosh. - Yes.

1615
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,483
We don't have much space, but you're getting vegetables?

1616
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:51,783
But we have to eat some.

1617
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:54,423
- You need to eat some together. - It looks good.

1618
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,998
(Jae Seok goes for stir-fried vegetables first at a buffet.)

1619
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,023
This is so tasty.

1620
00:39:56,023 --> 00:39:57,893
Can you get a couple of kimchi jeon for me?

1621
00:39:59,298 --> 00:40:03,108
(He usually picks foods that aren't cost-effective at buffets.)

1622
00:39:59,823 --> 00:40:00,833
A couple of kimchi jeon.

1623
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,993
- Who eats kimchi jeon at a buffet? - That's good.

1624
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:04,203
Can you get some eggplant for me?

1625
00:40:04,203 --> 00:40:05,663
Why are you getting eggplant at a buffet?

1626
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,903
- You need to eat some together. - It looks good.

1627
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:09,508
(Today, he picked stir-fried vegetables.)

1628
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:09,473
This is so tasty.

1629
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:11,903
It's not like you're Popeye or something.

1630
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:13,913
- Okay. - Gosh, I'm so stressed out.

1631
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:13,478
(Putting down)

1632
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:14,973
Let's go.

1633
00:40:14,973 --> 00:40:16,473
- Okay. - Gosh, I'm so stressed out.

1634
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:17,883
Let's go.

1635
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:21,288
(He can't stand it even when other's plates that aren't cost-effective.)

1636
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:20,183
What's this?

1637
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:22,183
- Hang on. What? - Fried chicken?

1638
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:24,253
- Fried rice? What about fried rice? - Gosh, fried rice.

1639
00:40:24,253 --> 00:40:25,523
Don't fill up on fried rice.

1640
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,093
Please don't fill up on stuff like fried rice or gimbap...

1641
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,428
(Shutting his eyes tight)

1642
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,493
- at a place like this. - But I want some.

1643
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,893
No, eat better food.

1644
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:32,993
I should take a few pieces of cucumber kimchi.

1645
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,368
(Cucumber kimchi)

1646
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:34,133
Gosh, well...

1647
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:36,333
- What about mashed potato? - Oh, mashed potato.

1648
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:36,408
(Mashed potato)

1649
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,103
I'll get some grilled vegetables.

1650
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:37,808
(Grilled vegetables)

1651
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:39,833
Since Jong Kook can't eat today,

1652
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:43,008
(While they're bickering about choosing cheap dishes,)

1653
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:41,233
- it's so nice. - I know. What did you say?

1654
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,303
Nothing.

1655
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,278
(Team Daniel arrives at the barbecue restaurant.)

1656
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:45,643
- Haha. - Okay.

1657
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:50,148
(Laughing awkwardly)

1658
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:47,743
Hello.

1659
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,443
- Hello. - Hello.

1660
00:40:51,913 --> 00:40:54,053
- You can take photos. - Go ahead.

1661
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,628
(The restaurant is crowded because it's lunchtime.)

1662
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:55,453
- Yes, go ahead. - Of course, you can.

1663
00:40:57,328 --> 00:41:01,068
(As they're Team Ssaebssaeb, they try the mission right away.)

1664
00:40:58,883 --> 00:40:59,953
Is that good?

1665
00:40:59,953 --> 00:41:01,153
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal.

1666
00:41:01,098 --> 00:41:03,068
(What is going on?)

1667
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:03,323
- We like it too. It's so nice. - We're so...

1668
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:07,263
Oh, happy day

1669
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:10,608
(Anyone can tell they're doing a mission.)

1670
00:41:07,893 --> 00:41:09,593
Oh, happy day

1671
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,333
There must be something going on. Hurry up and do the mission.

1672
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:15,748
(Noticing)

1673
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:15,833
Oh, is there a mission?

1674
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,918
(The quick-witted woman noticed that they were doing a mission.)

1675
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:18,043
- Pardon? - What did you say?

1676
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,943
- What did you say? - What did you just say?

1677
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:22,088
(What mission is it?)

1678
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:25,518
(Laughing)

1679
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,588
(We're happy.)

1680
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:28,553
- Is that right? - What is it?

1681
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,023
- You look so... - Pardon?

1682
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:32,283
You look so harmonious.

1683
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:35,668
(One person said something close to the correct answer.)

1684
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:36,893
You look gleeful.

1685
00:41:35,728 --> 00:41:37,198
(Is this the right answer?)

1686
00:41:37,338 --> 00:41:38,398
(She's so close!)

1687
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:39,223
You look gleeful.

1688
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:39,438
(More!)

1689
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:42,893
You look happy.

1690
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:46,978
(Team Daniel succeeds!)

1691
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,603
You've succeeded in the mission.

1692
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:52,878
(Being the Ssaebssaebs they are, they succeed in 2 minutes.)

1693
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,703
Nice one.

1694
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:50,703
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1695
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:52,703
- How did she say, "You look happy?" - My goodness.

1696
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:54,013
- Enjoy your meal! - Thank you so much.

1697
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:57,718
(They earned 150 points.)

1698
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:55,843
- Thank you so much. - You're the best.

1699
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:58,013
- It's over! Let's eat comfortably! - Gosh, that was awesome.

1700
00:41:58,013 --> 00:41:59,283
Hey, am I going to get first place?

1701
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,283
- Let's hurry up and eat! - Seriously?

1702
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:03,758
(While Team Daniel became the 1st team to succeed,)

1703
00:42:00,283 --> 00:42:02,053
- Let's eat comfortably! - Hey, this way.

1704
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,583
- That was insane. - Awesome.

1705
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:06,728
(Team Ye Eun has lost their minds at the buffet.)

1706
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,093
Just now, Team Daniel...

1707
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,493
heard the exact phrase and has succeeded in the mission.

1708
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:12,023
- What? - How does that make sense?

1709
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:16,608
(They must hurry up and succeed to get 2nd place, at least.)

1710
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:14,763
- And has succeeded in the mission. - How does that make sense?

1711
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:15,763
How does that make sense?

1712
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:18,363
Well, that team has members who are like Ssaebssaeb.

1713
00:42:18,363 --> 00:42:19,903
- Is this totally unseasoned? - Yes.

1714
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:21,473
- Oh, awesome. - Kang Hoon is here.

1715
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:22,773
- Let's try going over there. - Jae Seok.

1716
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:23,548
(Ddochi found meat she can eat in the meantime.)

1717
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,773
- It's not here. - It is.

1718
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:25,743
- Jae Seok, wait. I'll get a plate. - Kang Hoon is here.

1719
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,043
- I'll go and grab a plate. - Ye Eun.

1720
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:31,058
(She found happiness, forgetting about the mission for a moment.)

1721
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:28,043
Hey, Ye Eun.

1722
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:30,013
How do we hold this? Let me give it to you.

1723
00:42:30,273 --> 00:42:31,983
- Right. Hurry up. - Thank you.

1724
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,113
- Here. - Yes, get it.

1725
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:34,713
- I can eat this. - I saw Kang Hoon.

1726
00:42:34,713 --> 00:42:36,453
- Could you give me more? - Yes, of course.

1727
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,553
- Could you give me all of it? - Yes, sure.

1728
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:40,158
(While the unseasoned chunks of meat...)

1729
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:44,668
(have become more important than the mission...)

1730
00:42:40,323 --> 00:42:42,453
- Meat. - Yes, it's...

1731
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:45,093
- Hello, chef. - Hello.

1732
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:46,723
- It's such a nice day. - Hello.

1733
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:48,208
(Team Kang Hoon met the chef.)

1734
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:48,393
We're holding hands like this.

1735
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:50,633
We're holding hands like this.

1736
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,808
(Appealing)

1737
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:51,763
Hello.

1738
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,848
(The chef responds.)

1739
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:53,003
You look so great together.

1740
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,133
- Hello. - Oh, right.

1741
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:55,203
Hello.

1742
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,773
We're a family, you see.

1743
00:42:57,773 --> 00:42:59,543
Yes, we're like a real family.

1744
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:01,788
(Hoon leads him on as they put on a family-like vibe.)

1745
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:03,373
- It's nice to see. - Oh, yes.

1746
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,883
I think he might say it if we keep going.

1747
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:06,713
- It's nice to see. - Oh, yes.

1748
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:08,313
I think he might say it if we keep going.

1749
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:10,253
This must be beef tartare.

1750
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:11,828
(Even when Seok Sam is distracted by beef tartare,)

1751
00:43:11,828 --> 00:43:15,168
(Kang Fox doesn't miss this chance.)

1752
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:13,993
- Oh, this... - Didn't we get...

1753
00:43:13,993 --> 00:43:15,223
Didn't we get any zucchini?

1754
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:16,453
Do I have to say something...

1755
00:43:16,453 --> 00:43:18,093
- No. - No.

1756
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:20,438
(The chef is quick-witted.)

1757
00:43:18,093 --> 00:43:19,323
- Please say whatever you feel. - Yes.

1758
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:20,593
Yes.

1759
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:22,363
Yes.

1760
00:43:21,508 --> 00:43:25,608
(Will the chef be able to receive Hoon's telepathic message?)

1761
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:26,133
- Do you feel anything? - The sushi...

1762
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:27,503
You look happy.

1763
00:43:28,303 --> 00:43:29,703
- The sushi... - You look happy.

1764
00:43:31,248 --> 00:43:34,148
(Thanks to the quick-witted chef, they made it in 6 minutes.)

1765
00:43:31,603 --> 00:43:32,703
You've succeeded.

1766
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:34,643
No way.

1767
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:37,088
(By coming in 2nd place, they earned 100 points,)

1768
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:36,813
Thank you, chef!

1769
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:39,013
- Thank you. I knew you'd say it. - No way.

1770
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:39,358
(all thanks to their leader.)

1771
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:40,553
- I knew he'd say it. - That was awesome. How did...

1772
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:41,758
(Feeling proud)

1773
00:43:40,553 --> 00:43:42,483
- We did it. - He was so sensible.

1774
00:43:42,483 --> 00:43:44,283
- I'm glad. - Let me eat now too.

1775
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:45,723
We can just eat on our own now, right?

1776
00:43:45,628 --> 00:43:49,228
(Team Ye Eun doesn't know they're in last place yet.)

1777
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:47,593
- Oh, right. - Yes.

1778
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:48,923
Well, I...

1779
00:43:49,428 --> 00:43:52,168
(Laughing awkwardly)

1780
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:54,468
(They try to look happy in earnest.)

1781
00:43:53,093 --> 00:43:54,663
- Are you going to eat more... - He doesn't know.

1782
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:56,638
(Failed)

1783
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:56,663
- I don't think so either. - He doesn't know. I can tell.

1784
00:43:56,938 --> 00:44:00,078
(Laughing awkwardly)

1785
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:02,008
(They failed again.)

1786
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:01,533
This is fun.

1787
00:44:02,008 --> 00:44:04,848
(Laughing half-heartedly)

1788
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:05,103
There's a lot of protein.

1789
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:07,218
(They laugh until the muscles around their mouths start to spasm.)

1790
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:09,118
(Stepping backward)

1791
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:08,543
- Well... - Oh, you're so...

1792
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:10,243
It's so fun at this buffet.

1793
00:44:09,218 --> 00:44:11,818
(They just look like the type who laughs a lot.)

1794
00:44:10,243 --> 00:44:11,283
- Gosh, seriously... - Enjoy your food.

1795
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:12,643
All of you look great.

1796
00:44:12,643 --> 00:44:14,913
- At the buffet... You look great. - You look great.

1797
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:15,688
(Running away)

1798
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:15,983
You look great.

1799
00:44:15,983 --> 00:44:17,053
Why are we...

1800
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:18,723
- You look like you're good friends. - Pardon?

1801
00:44:19,098 --> 00:44:21,828
(Right then, someone starts speaking to them for the first time.)

1802
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,653
- You look like you're good friends. - Pardon?

1803
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:22,693
You look so friendly with each other.

1804
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,998
(He says they look so friendly with each other.)

1805
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,363
- Oh, we look like good friends? - I know, right?

1806
00:44:24,363 --> 00:44:25,463
Also,

1807
00:44:25,823 --> 00:44:27,363
- since we have delicious food... - Which part...

1808
00:44:28,593 --> 00:44:29,633
You look like you're enjoying yourselves.

1809
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,463
- You look happy. - What?

1810
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,503
You look like you're enjoying yourselves.

1811
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,303
- You look happy. - What?

1812
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:35,633
- Sorry? - You look happy.

1813
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:39,078
(The Happiness Squad finally succeeded in the mission.)

1814
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,373
- You accomplished your mission. - Okay.

1815
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:40,513
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

1816
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,388
(Team Ye Eun hears it last, so they get only 50 points.)

1817
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:42,413
- Nice. - Thank you.

1818
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:43,943
- That was so witty of you. - Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

1819
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:46,788
(Team Ddochi is overjoyed, not realizing they're in last place.)

1820
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:45,213
How did you know?

1821
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:46,843
- Bye. - Thank you.

1822
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:50,088
(You look happy.)

1823
00:44:46,943 --> 00:44:48,683
- Bye. - See how she's looking at us.

1824
00:44:48,683 --> 00:44:50,153
- Good. - Bye.

1825
00:44:50,128 --> 00:44:54,068
(1st place: 150 points, 2nd place: 100 points, 3rd place: 50 points)

1826
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:51,523
We're good now.

1827
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,053
Nice, this is insane.

1828
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:54,293
- I should go eat. - Aren't you having anything?

1829
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:55,823
You may enjoy your meals now.

1830
00:44:55,168 --> 00:44:57,438
(If they let go of each other's hand while eating,)

1831
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:58,323
Points will be deducted if you let go of your hands,

1832
00:44:57,438 --> 00:44:59,698
(they'll lose a point.)

1833
00:44:58,323 --> 00:44:59,963
- Really? - so be careful.

1834
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,733
This is what I'm talking about.

1835
00:45:01,308 --> 00:45:05,338
(Lefty Hoon eats comfortably.)

1836
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:02,893
This looks good.

1837
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:07,973
What's this? Is this fish?

1838
00:45:06,778 --> 00:45:10,408
(Seok Sam begins to eat as well.)

1839
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:09,033
It's grilled toothfish.

1840
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:12,203
There are so many delicious things.

1841
00:45:11,148 --> 00:45:13,748
(Staring)

1842
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:13,743
We should get another plate after this one.

1843
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:15,513
- Really? - I'll grab my fork.

1844
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,243
I'd like to grab my fork.

1845
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:19,988
(Sticking a fork in her right hand)

1846
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:19,683
Thanks.

1847
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:21,783
Seok Jin, don't let go of my hand.

1848
00:45:21,783 --> 00:45:22,853
Got it.

1849
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:25,683
- Don't let go. - These are all delicious.

1850
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:26,883
Really?

1851
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:30,923
Seok Jin, sorry. I'm right-handed, so I can't help it.

1852
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,363
- This is really uncomfortable. - I know.

1853
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:37,578
(Dropping food)

1854
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:37,363
- Seok Jin, spread your arm a bit. - What?

1855
00:45:37,363 --> 00:45:39,003
Let me move your hand this way. I want to eat this.

1856
00:45:39,563 --> 00:45:41,273
- Stop pulling your hand back. - This is really uncomfortable.

1857
00:45:41,273 --> 00:45:42,373
I'm getting a cramp in my hand.

1858
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,373
Seok Jin, I can't help it.

1859
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:46,348
(The two eat like they're in a tug of war.)

1860
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:48,143
This isn't easy.

1861
00:45:47,388 --> 00:45:49,648
(Peaceful)

1862
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,383
Seok Jin, don't let go of my hand.

1863
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:55,988
(Lefty Hoon is enjoying a peaceful meal alone.)

1864
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:54,913
Seok Jin, don't let go of my hand.

1865
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:57,923
I guess holding hands does make us seem happy.

1866
00:45:57,428 --> 00:45:58,828
(Yummy!)

1867
00:45:58,828 --> 00:46:01,028
(He casually opens a can of Coke.)

1868
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,093
I need my right hand. Can you...

1869
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:04,138
(The youngest one is filling his stomach by himself.)

1870
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:02,923
Can we... Ji Hyo, hold on.

1871
00:46:02,923 --> 00:46:04,193
I see you can't hold this.

1872
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:06,223
Jong Kook, I feel bad you can't eat.

1873
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:09,063
- Exactly. - You really didn't get much.

1874
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:09,068
(Jong Kook in the center can't eat because he has indigestion.)

1875
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:12,303
Is it good?

1876
00:46:11,238 --> 00:46:14,378
(Thanks to that, Jae Seok easily tackles the noodles first.)

1877
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:16,773
- I'll enjoy. - Okay.

1878
00:46:16,348 --> 00:46:20,548
(Ddochi savors the unseasoned meat she grabbed in a frenzy.)

1879
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:22,043
Is it good?

1880
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:23,588
(Happy)

1881
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:23,713
Is it tasty? Is the quality of the meat good?

1882
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:28,428
(It doesn't seem like Team Ye Eun will be letting go of their hands.)

1883
00:46:27,013 --> 00:46:28,513
I feel bad you can't eat.

1884
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:30,623
Locust, are you a lefty?

1885
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:31,823
- No. - You're not.

1886
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:33,383
- But you're eating just fine. - It's not that hard.

1887
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:33,628
(By the way, they're eating just fine.)

1888
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:35,493
Hey, why don't you ask Ye Eun...

1889
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:38,163
- to join you for lunch? - If a loved one...

1890
00:46:38,968 --> 00:46:42,308
(Team Kang Hoon is trying to lure Ddochi with a big piece of bait.)

1891
00:46:39,323 --> 00:46:40,423
Ask her to join you here.

1892
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:43,963
- Give it a try. - If a loved one...

1893
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:45,678
(Will the Hoon admirer take the bait?)

1894
00:46:44,203 --> 00:46:45,363
Let's see how she reacts.

1895
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:46,663
- Ye Eun. - Ye Eun.

1896
00:46:46,663 --> 00:46:48,373
- Hoon has something to say. - Hoon has something to say.

1897
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:50,403
Ye Eun, join me over here.

1898
00:46:54,088 --> 00:46:56,388
(Smiling bashfully)

1899
00:46:57,013 --> 00:46:59,043
- They're trying to bait you. - Let go of his hand.

1900
00:46:59,043 --> 00:47:01,013
I can't believe you giggled at his suggestion.

1901
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:02,453
You should have given him the stink eye.

1902
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:03,653
Are you kidding me?

1903
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:05,283
You should have given him the stink eye, Ye Eun.

1904
00:47:03,998 --> 00:47:06,598
(The big fish is loving it.)

1905
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:06,323
That was funny.

1906
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,253
- Give him the stink eye. - How could you accept that?

1907
00:47:08,353 --> 00:47:09,423
What's with him?

1908
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,063
He was trying to get you to let go of my hand.

1909
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:12,193
- I know that. - Do you?

1910
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:13,563
- That's not it. - That wasn't it.

1911
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:15,768
(Ddochi barely managed to stay rational.)

1912
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:15,593
- That wasn't it. - He just wanted to eat with you.

1913
00:47:15,593 --> 00:47:16,963
- He... - I have something to say.

1914
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,308
(What do I do?)

1915
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:20,933
- Tell him to come to you instead. - Don't.

1916
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:22,873
- But... - Ye Eun, your plate's empty.

1917
00:47:21,878 --> 00:47:25,218
(Fox Hoon keeps trying to lure her.)

1918
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,673
There's nothing on your plate, so move your chair this way.

1919
00:47:24,673 --> 00:47:26,643
It sure isn't easy to eat with my left hand.

1920
00:47:25,348 --> 00:47:27,918
(Thinking)

1921
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,343
Eat with your right hand then.

1922
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:30,013
- How can I? - Just grab your fork.

1923
00:47:28,748 --> 00:47:31,688
(They're bickering in the meantime.)

1924
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:32,043
- It won't take long. - See? There you go.

1925
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:34,053
- You can eat now. - Just let go of his hand.

1926
00:47:32,288 --> 00:47:35,058
(The guy she's into has something to say to her.)

1927
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:35,183
Seok Jin.

1928
00:47:35,128 --> 00:47:37,898
(My messy teammates)

1929
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:37,983
There.

1930
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:40,353
- You try it. - Eat with your right hand.

1931
00:47:40,723 --> 00:47:41,853
- You try it. - Just eat.

1932
00:47:41,798 --> 00:47:43,568
(Standing up)

1933
00:47:42,323 --> 00:47:43,323
- How was that any good? - Just eat.

1934
00:47:43,323 --> 00:47:44,723
Where are you going?

1935
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:46,493
- Get a grip on yourself. - What's your deal?

1936
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:48,938
(Ye Eun took the bait in the end.)

1937
00:47:46,493 --> 00:47:48,293
Wake up, Ye Eun.

1938
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:50,933
Get a grip on yourself. What do you think you're doing?

1939
00:47:50,933 --> 00:47:52,663
He talked about you a lot on the way here.

1940
00:47:51,808 --> 00:47:55,078
(Being at the bottom, letting go of hands would be a big problem.)

1941
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:54,073
- Stop that nonsense. - Hoon knew all about...

1942
00:47:54,073 --> 00:47:55,303
- what happened to you. - Ye Eun, sit back down.

1943
00:47:55,303 --> 00:47:56,573
He knows everything about you.

1944
00:47:56,108 --> 00:47:58,818
(Standing awkwardly)

1945
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,943
- Don't be absurd. - It'll take less than a second.

1946
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:00,918
(Holding tightly)

1947
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,373
Letting go is easy.

1948
00:48:00,373 --> 00:48:02,413
- Shake him off. - Why does it matter...

1949
00:48:00,988 --> 00:48:04,018
(Kim Muscles won't let go.)

1950
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,913
- that he knows about you? - Exactly.

1951
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:06,213
He just looked you up because he had nothing better to do.

1952
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:06,858
(Unfortunately, his plan failed.)

1953
00:48:06,643 --> 00:48:07,813
Seok Jin, I'm sorry,

1954
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:10,213
- but can we get some spaghetti? - He flirted with Taeyeon...

1955
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:12,123
on another show.

1956
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:12,158
(Sighing)

1957
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,723
- I'd like some spaghetti. - Can't you just...

1958
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:16,953
- Can we please get some? - I'd like something...

1959
00:48:15,628 --> 00:48:18,538
(They stand up together in the end.)

1960
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:18,093
- to drink. - Like what?

1961
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:20,493
- Coke. - He wants to go. Come on.

1962
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:21,338
(Let's get a Coke too!)

1963
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:21,893
Jae Seok's going back out there too.

1964
00:48:21,893 --> 00:48:23,533
- Hoon, the spaghetti... - Let's go.

1965
00:48:23,993 --> 00:48:25,433
Ask Ye Eun to go get spaghetti with you.

1966
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:28,848
(The second bait)

1967
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:27,903
- Ye Eun. - Ye Eun,

1968
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,073
Hoon has something to say.

1969
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,603
Don't listen to him.

1970
00:48:30,703 --> 00:48:32,043
- Hold on. - What do you think you're doing?

1971
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:34,918
(An automatic reflex)

1972
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,513
- Hold on. - What do you think you're doing?

1973
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:36,713
What on earth do you think you're doing? Seriously?

1974
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,343
- I can't believe her. - Ye Eun, come on.

1975
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:41,428
(Troublemaker Ye Eun gets distracted the moment she lets her guard down.)

1976
00:48:38,643 --> 00:48:39,883
- Get a grip on yourself. - He's right.

1977
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,613
- Pull yourself together. Hold on. - Get a grip on yourself.

1978
00:48:41,883 --> 00:48:43,253
I'm sweating now.

1979
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,953
Ye Eun, Hoon won't take his eyes off you.

1980
00:48:46,153 --> 00:48:48,623
Don't look over there. Just don't.

1981
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:50,693
I can't believe Hoon.

1982
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:51,898
(Sad)

1983
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:51,823
It's fine. This isn't so bad.

1984
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:53,423
Hey, that looks tasty.

1985
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:56,208
(They get to the pasta zone Ji Hyo wanted to go to.)

1986
00:48:53,423 --> 00:48:55,293
- You'll need to place the order. - Sure.

1987
00:48:55,993 --> 00:48:57,963
- Is this good? - Can you sprinkle pepper on this?

1988
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,433
- Pepper? - Sprinkle pepper on top.

1989
00:49:00,433 --> 00:49:01,433
Is this aglio...

1990
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:02,903
- Yes, that. - Hold on.

1991
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,373
- How... - Put the plate down and grind.

1992
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:08,973
Are you sure that's what you should turn?

1993
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:11,758
(Her two helpers grind the pepper at Lady Song's command.)

1994
00:49:08,973 --> 00:49:10,613
- Is something actually coming out? - We're doing it right.

1995
00:49:11,813 --> 00:49:13,243
More. Give me more.

1996
00:49:14,113 --> 00:49:15,713
- More. - I don't feel it grinding.

1997
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:19,098
(It takes forever to sprinkle pepper.)

1998
00:49:15,713 --> 00:49:17,153
- No, a lot came out. - A lot of pepper came out.

1999
00:49:17,153 --> 00:49:19,353
- We're good. - That's a whole lot.

2000
00:49:19,353 --> 00:49:20,453
Would you like to order lobster?

2001
00:49:19,898 --> 00:49:22,498
(They order lobsters as well.)

2002
00:49:20,453 --> 00:49:22,123
- Sure. - Can we get some lobster?

2003
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:23,493
- What should we do? - Should I put it on your plate?

2004
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,693
- Then... Why don't we put it here? - What should we do?

2005
00:49:25,693 --> 00:49:27,023
Yes, let's put it here. Can you put it here?

2006
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:28,893
- Should I put it here? - Yes, two pieces, please.

2007
00:49:28,893 --> 00:49:30,393
- Are you good? - I'm good.

2008
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:33,238
(Shaking)

2009
00:49:30,693 --> 00:49:32,163
- You can place it on top. - Hoon...

2010
00:49:32,163 --> 00:49:34,333
never passes up something that's good for him.

2011
00:49:34,378 --> 00:49:37,648
(Exhausted, they return to their seats.)

2012
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:35,503
We're good.

2013
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,703
- Are you good? So what now? - How can we eat the lobster?

2014
00:49:38,578 --> 00:49:40,948
(Sliding)

2015
00:49:40,203 --> 00:49:42,113
Let's push the tables together. We'll head over there.

2016
00:49:41,718 --> 00:49:44,988
(Team Hoon pushes the two tables together.)

2017
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:46,043
What are they doing?

2018
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:47,988
(Laughing)

2019
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:47,883
- Unbelievable. - What's going on?

2020
00:49:47,883 --> 00:49:48,953
Are they trying...

2021
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,213
- to take advantage of Ye Eun? - He must like me.

2022
00:49:50,213 --> 00:49:51,483
He must like you, right?

2023
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:54,023
- What's with him? - I can't believe them.

2024
00:49:53,398 --> 00:49:56,868
(Ddochi reads into it as she sees fit.)

2025
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:55,493
- He's so cunning. - Can I have some, Seok Jin?

2026
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:58,063
Here.

2027
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:02,293
Why is he this close to me?

2028
00:50:04,738 --> 00:50:05,978
(Quietly)

2029
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:06,703
Ye Eun, hold it together.

2030
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:09,178
(He shells the lobster and gives it to her.)

2031
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:11,143
- Ye Eun can't eat that. - I can't eat that.

2032
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:12,403
- You can't? - Why not?

2033
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,773
- Why not? - She can't eat seasoned food.

2034
00:50:15,243 --> 00:50:16,313
Are you not feeling well?

2035
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,843
- I can't... - What is this, a drama series?

2036
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:19,983
"Why not? Are you not feeling well?"

2037
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:22,653
- I bet that excited you. - What's that look in his eyes?

2038
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,358
(She doesn't really mind.)

2039
00:50:23,683 --> 00:50:24,853
He seems to care about you.

2040
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:26,523
It doesn't seem like he's pretending anymore.

2041
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:28,498
(Fox Hoon is enjoying it now.)

2042
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:30,693
Wait, I should have some seaweed soup too.

2043
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:34,093
- You should have it. - Let's go get some.

2044
00:50:34,093 --> 00:50:35,293
- You should have some. - I've been wanting that.

2045
00:50:34,538 --> 00:50:37,708
(The middle-aged man ruins the mood.)

2046
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:37,233
- The seaweed soup is really good. - I need to have that.

2047
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:40,708
(He wants to have seaweed soup at a fancy buffet.)

2048
00:50:38,003 --> 00:50:40,603
Let's get some seaweed soup. I need it for my stomach.

2049
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:42,533
Ye Eun, it must be disappointing to leave his side.

2050
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:44,243
- Still... - Would you like to come with me?

2051
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:45,643
Not really.

2052
00:50:45,718 --> 00:50:47,448
(Laughing bashfully)

2053
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:47,613
Let's go get some seaweed soup.

2054
00:50:47,613 --> 00:50:49,043
- Let's get some seaweed soup. - That was cold.

2055
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:50,113
- Shall we? - Let's get some seaweed soup.

2056
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,213
- Do you want to? - Why don't we go with them?

2057
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:52,343
I'd like some pasta.

2058
00:50:51,658 --> 00:50:54,588
(Team Fox plays along.)

2059
00:50:52,343 --> 00:50:53,683
Sure, let's go together.

2060
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:54,683
Isn't this good?

2061
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:56,413
Why don't we all hold hands this time?

2062
00:50:56,413 --> 00:50:58,253
- Hoon, come on. - Sure, let's all hold hands.

2063
00:50:57,328 --> 00:50:59,428
(We're all going together?)

2064
00:50:58,253 --> 00:50:59,553
- Hoon? - Let's look like one happy bunch.

2065
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:01,053
She's acting awkward about holding...

2066
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:02,723
- Ho Jun's hand! - What's wrong with you?

2067
00:51:02,723 --> 00:51:04,263
- What's your problem? - Come on.

2068
00:51:04,263 --> 00:51:05,423
- What with her? - Don't be like that.

2069
00:51:05,238 --> 00:51:06,898
(She's a conservative girl who couldn't hold hands,)

2070
00:51:05,423 --> 00:51:07,063
- I'm pretty conservative. - What do you mean...

2071
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:08,568
(even for a game.)

2072
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,533
- you're conservative? - You're conservative?

2073
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:10,693
Why don't we all hold hands this time?

2074
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:12,738
(Holding out her hand)

2075
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,763
- Hoon, come on. - Sure, let's all hold hands.

2076
00:51:12,763 --> 00:51:14,033
- Hoon? - Let's look like one happy bunch.

2077
00:51:14,178 --> 00:51:16,808
(He took her hand!)

2078
00:51:16,233 --> 00:51:17,573
Why is your hand this cold?

2079
00:51:17,518 --> 00:51:20,678
(You said you couldn't hold hands with a guy!)

2080
00:51:19,603 --> 00:51:20,843
Your hand is freezing.

2081
00:51:21,443 --> 00:51:22,973
Why did you interlace your fingers?

2082
00:51:21,818 --> 00:51:23,788
(Laughing)

2083
00:51:22,973 --> 00:51:24,883
- I can't believe you. - She's blushing like crazy.

2084
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:26,118
(Intertwining her fingers without asking)

2085
00:51:24,883 --> 00:51:27,383
- She can't stand still. - All along, you've been saying...

2086
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:29,053
Why do you keep acting...

2087
00:51:28,558 --> 00:51:31,358
(Swaying)

2088
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:30,383
- like this? - Why are your fingers interlocked?

2089
00:51:30,383 --> 00:51:31,623
My gosh. No way.

2090
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:32,923
She can't stand still.

2091
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,623
- Meanwhile, Hoon's staying still. - Look at his hand.

2092
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:36,053
His hand is so big.

2093
00:51:35,568 --> 00:51:36,928
(They separate in the end.)

2094
00:51:36,523 --> 00:51:37,963
My palms are a bit sweaty.

2095
00:51:37,963 --> 00:51:39,493
- His palm is sweaty. - I have very sweaty palms.

2096
00:51:39,493 --> 00:51:40,863
- He's nervous. - He must be nervous.

2097
00:51:40,863 --> 00:51:42,033
- He's nervous. - He's nervous, that's all.

2098
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,533
Ye Eun, your face is as red as your sweater.

2099
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:45,838
(Octopus Girl can't compose herself.)

2100
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,333
- He's nervous. - He's nervous about holding hands.

2101
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,833
- Ye Eun, he's just nervous. - He...

2102
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:49,833
- Ye Eun, he must really like you. - He's nervous.

2103
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:51,603
- My hand was cold. - Exactly.

2104
00:51:51,803 --> 00:51:54,103
It'll be easy for you to use your chopsticks.

2105
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:55,618
(While Troublemaker Ye Eun is getting a year's worth of dopamine,)

2106
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:55,943
- Exactly. - Yes, of course.

2107
00:51:55,943 --> 00:51:57,983
Are you okay using your left hand? Are you good at it?

2108
00:51:56,588 --> 00:51:59,958
(Team Daniel starts eating calmly since they're in 1st place.)

2109
00:51:57,983 --> 00:51:59,043
- My left hand? - Yes.

2110
00:51:59,043 --> 00:52:00,443
I'm sure I'll be better at it than you.

2111
00:52:00,888 --> 00:52:04,398
(They're having beef brisket, which is easier to grill.)

2112
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:03,453
Beef brisket is the best.

2113
00:52:04,483 --> 00:52:05,953
- That looks good. - Dip it in the oil.

2114
00:52:04,598 --> 00:52:07,358
(It turns golden-brown instantly.)

2115
00:52:07,253 --> 00:52:08,393
You should eat it right away.

2116
00:52:08,723 --> 00:52:09,853
- Straight from the griddle? - Yes.

2117
00:52:10,553 --> 00:52:11,893
- Straight from the griddle? - Yes.

2118
00:52:12,438 --> 00:52:14,238
(Panting)

2119
00:52:15,463 --> 00:52:16,493
It's so hot.

2120
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:20,908
(Unlike Ji Hyo, Daniel doesn't think to use his hands.)

2121
00:52:16,993 --> 00:52:18,733
- Thank you. - That's delicious.

2122
00:52:21,003 --> 00:52:22,333
- Haha, this. - Yes?

2123
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,973
Haha, can't you make me a wrap?

2124
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:25,143
Don't be ridiculous.

2125
00:52:26,473 --> 00:52:28,343
- But Haha... - Haha.

2126
00:52:28,343 --> 00:52:29,843
- I can't eat just the meat. - You and I...

2127
00:52:28,418 --> 00:52:31,018
(Determined)

2128
00:52:29,843 --> 00:52:30,943
Can't I have some of the seasoned green onions?

2129
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:32,543
We can do it if we work together.

2130
00:52:32,543 --> 00:52:33,983
- Okay, hold on. - Here.

2131
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:35,213
I'll grab the lettuce.

2132
00:52:35,213 --> 00:52:36,513
I'd like a wrap with seasoned green onions.

2133
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:39,458
(He makes a wrap as he ordered.)

2134
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,153
Give me that. I'll hold it.

2135
00:52:38,483 --> 00:52:40,283
- There. - Did you wash your hand?

2136
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:41,353
No.

2137
00:52:41,353 --> 00:52:44,053
- I didn't have the time for that. - There's one.

2138
00:52:44,763 --> 00:52:45,993
Just take it as it is, Daniel.

2139
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:48,463
It's not even a big deal.

2140
00:52:47,138 --> 00:52:49,738
(It tastes the same in the mouth.)

2141
00:52:48,463 --> 00:52:51,333
- Earlier, when you changed... - Don't you trust us?

2142
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:53,108
(Flavor gets added from his hand.)

2143
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:54,263
Two.

2144
00:52:54,373 --> 00:52:55,703
Yes, and some garlic.

2145
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:58,318
(But he added everything needed.)

2146
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,503
Okay, good.

2147
00:52:58,173 --> 00:52:59,203
Feed him.

2148
00:52:59,403 --> 00:53:01,343
Hold on. I'll close it on this side.

2149
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:03,543
- This... - Okay, we're good.

2150
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,618
(It takes 2 people to feed him 1 wrap.)

2151
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,213
- There you go. I love it. - Nice.

2152
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:10,658
(Yummy!)

2153
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:08,613
Is it good?

2154
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,483
Haha, no way. That's so good.

2155
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:15,268
(The youngest member is being pampered in the middle.)

2156
00:53:14,053 --> 00:53:15,193
- Is it good? - Yes.

2157
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:17,823
This reminds me of when I fed my kids.

2158
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:21,238
(He's going to have a bite now.)

2159
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:20,423
This is exactly how I did it.

2160
00:53:20,423 --> 00:53:22,193
Haha, can I have the bibim naengmyeon?

2161
00:53:22,268 --> 00:53:25,378
(The younger ones ask for naengmyeon.)

2162
00:53:22,763 --> 00:53:23,893
I'd like the mul naengmyeon.

2163
00:53:23,893 --> 00:53:25,733
How about this? The mul naengmyeon...

2164
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,873
- Just cut the noodles into pieces. - Why?

2165
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:28,903
Then I can drink it up.

2166
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,573
- Here. - Okay, that's great.

2167
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:33,278
(He chops the noodles as if it were for a baby.)

2168
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:32,703
- How's that? - We're good.

2169
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:35,288
(Mixing it to make it easier to eat)

2170
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:37,688
(Taking care of the 2m-tall baby is a lot of work.)

2171
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:36,773
Can I have some?

2172
00:53:38,518 --> 00:53:40,788
(Slurping)

2173
00:53:39,043 --> 00:53:40,143
Are you good?

2174
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:41,983
Why does it hurt...

2175
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,988
(Glancing)

2176
00:53:41,983 --> 00:53:43,483
- to see you eat like this? - This is good.

2177
00:53:45,053 --> 00:53:46,353
Are you done? Can we go to the restroom now?

2178
00:53:46,353 --> 00:53:47,693
Seriously?

2179
00:53:47,693 --> 00:53:48,823
Are you done? Can we go to the restroom now?

2180
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:51,398
(Nature suddenly calls for Ssaebssaeb.)

2181
00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:50,523
Seriously?

2182
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:51,893
- The restroom? - Nature always calls...

2183
00:53:51,893 --> 00:53:53,263
when I eat pork.

2184
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,063
- I'm sorry to do this to you. - I can't believe you.

2185
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:56,968
(Pale)

2186
00:53:55,193 --> 00:53:56,463
I'm sorry.

2187
00:53:56,893 --> 00:53:58,503
I haven't had anything to eat so far.

2188
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:00,563
- You can eat after we get back. - Just hold it in.

2189
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:02,403
- Have some when we get back. - Hold it in for a few minutes.

2190
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:04,133
- Do you really have to go? - Yes.

2191
00:54:02,808 --> 00:54:04,948
(Shaking)

2192
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:05,803
- I really have to go. - Let me feed him a bit more...

2193
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:09,418
(They have to either let go of each other's hands or go together.)

2194
00:54:05,803 --> 00:54:07,373
and have some myself.

2195
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:09,013
- You should eat first, Haha. - Have some after we get back.

2196
00:54:09,473 --> 00:54:10,773
- Okay, let's go. - Hold on a second.

2197
00:54:09,948 --> 00:54:11,988
(Springing up)

2198
00:54:10,773 --> 00:54:12,413
- Come on. Up, everyone. Hurry up. - Wait.

2199
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:13,943
- Just this once, okay? - Hold on.

2200
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:15,053
Do we all have to go?

2201
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:16,183
What other choice do we have?

2202
00:54:16,558 --> 00:54:20,498
(If they let go, points will be deducted each second.)

2203
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:20,053
He's right, Haha. Let's make it fast.

2204
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,293
Do you need to go badly?

2205
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:23,023
It's because I had my gallbladder removed.

2206
00:54:23,868 --> 00:54:27,098
(They leave to take care of his business together in the end.)

2207
00:54:24,393 --> 00:54:26,463
- It must hurt a lot. - It doesn't actually hurt.

2208
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,893
- No, I meant... - Sorry about this.

2209
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:30,908
(They can go to the restroom together since they're all men.)

2210
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:29,233
We'll be back to finish eating.

2211
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:30,993
- It won't take long. - Hold on.

2212
00:54:30,993 --> 00:54:32,033
Sorry about this.

2213
00:54:31,078 --> 00:54:35,348
(But can they use the restroom while holding hands?)

2214
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:33,033
- Oh, hello. - Come on.

2215
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:34,533
- Oh, my. - We need to feel happy.

2216
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:35,933
I don't think this is it.

2217
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,843
My goodness.

2218
00:54:37,843 --> 00:54:38,873
Hey, this is...

2219
00:54:38,873 --> 00:54:40,903
- How can we do this together? - How can we do this?

2220
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,173
This makes no sense.

2221
00:54:42,273 --> 00:54:44,243
- Come on, man! For real? - How can we go in there?

2222
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:45,243
It's enough, Haha.

2223
00:54:45,243 --> 00:54:46,283
- How will you go, though? - Come inside.

2224
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,483
All of us, in there?

2225
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,053
- Gosh, this is... - What else can we do?

2226
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:52,253
- How can we go in there? - Hang on. There must be a way.

2227
00:54:52,453 --> 00:54:53,783
- Or hold hands under the door? - I'm sure.

2228
00:54:53,783 --> 00:54:54,823
Should we hold hands under the door?

2229
00:54:54,823 --> 00:54:56,093
- Hold hands under the door? - Yes!

2230
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:57,453
- Close it. - Hang on.

2231
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:59,263
- I'll close it. - You should sit.

2232
00:54:57,468 --> 00:55:00,538
(They're determined to hold hands until the end.)

2233
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,793
Well... Se Chan, you'll have to sit the opposite way.

2234
00:55:01,993 --> 00:55:03,163
The opposite way. So, face the toilet.

2235
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:05,063
- Face the toilet. - Yes, like that.

2236
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:06,503
That's right. As if you're riding a motorcycle.

2237
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,433
- That's it. - And then, close the door, Haha.

2238
00:55:08,603 --> 00:55:10,503
- Hang on. Slowly. - Let's see.

2239
00:55:10,503 --> 00:55:13,003
- There. - It worked. I didn't let go.

2240
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:13,748
(They closed the door successfully for now.)

2241
00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:14,203
- The door won't close. - I'm holding his hand.

2242
00:55:14,203 --> 00:55:16,813
Hang on, Haha. Open the door. You have to pull my pants down.

2243
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,413
- One second. - Open up.

2244
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:19,413
- Wait. - You need us to pull them down?

2245
00:55:19,018 --> 00:55:22,328
(One problem after another)

2246
00:55:19,413 --> 00:55:21,613
- I can't do it. - Wait, don't open it. Okay.

2247
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:22,713
Come here. I'll pull your pants down.

2248
00:55:22,713 --> 00:55:25,053
Can't you just go like this? Your pants...

2249
00:55:25,053 --> 00:55:27,023
- Hey, should we just let go? - Gosh, seriously.

2250
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:27,098
(Struggling)

2251
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,353
Hey, this is really... My gosh.

2252
00:55:28,353 --> 00:55:29,353
- Haha, should we just let go? - Hey.

2253
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:30,523
Let's just let go. This won't do.

2254
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:32,063
- Hey, just let go. - I think we have to let go.

2255
00:55:32,063 --> 00:55:34,093
- Let go. My gosh. - Gosh, this won't do.

2256
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:35,008
(They separate in the end.)

2257
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:36,793
- Thanks, Haha. - I touched his butt. Darn it.

2258
00:55:35,768 --> 00:55:39,438
(He needs to get it done in 50 seconds to stay in 1st place.)

2259
00:55:36,993 --> 00:55:38,803
- Gosh, this just won't work. - Shoot.

2260
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:40,563
Sorry, guys. Hey, can you turn the water on?

2261
00:55:39,608 --> 00:55:43,478
(Will Se Chan's sphincter cooperate?)

2262
00:55:40,563 --> 00:55:42,973
- Hurry up. - I don't take long anyway.

2263
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,703
There. How many seconds was that?

2264
00:55:43,478 --> 00:55:45,778
(They let go of each other's hands...)

2265
00:55:45,403 --> 00:55:46,743
- It was 43 seconds. - Hey, 43 seconds.

2266
00:55:45,778 --> 00:55:48,248
(for 43 seconds.)

2267
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,173
- Okay! - All right, 43 seconds.

2268
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:51,518
(Ssaebssaeb cut it short from feeling pressured.)

2269
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,913
- What a relief. - Hey, but really...

2270
00:55:51,818 --> 00:55:55,288
(1st place: 107 points after losing 43 points)

2271
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:53,443
- Sorry. I was quick, though. - You're down to 107 points.

2272
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:54,983
I'm sorry.

2273
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:58,323
Hey, why are you eating the seaweed soup so well?

2274
00:55:55,828 --> 00:55:58,628
(Team Hoon in 2nd place in the meantime)

2275
00:55:58,323 --> 00:56:00,123
I like seaweed soup. I normally do.

2276
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:01,898
(Anxious)

2277
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,193
You're almost like...

2278
00:56:02,353 --> 00:56:03,593
- I want to go to the restroom. - It's almost...

2279
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,693
- What? The restroom? - The restroom...

2280
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:06,893
But how can we go in like this?

2281
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:09,093
- How do we go to the restroom? - Do we have to go in like this?

2282
00:56:08,568 --> 00:56:12,638
(Being a mixed team, they can't go to the restroom together.)

2283
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:11,733
- If you let go, you'll lose points. - You'll let go and lose points.

2284
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:13,103
- You'll count the seconds? - You have to make it quick.

2285
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,903
I don't think I can be that quick.

2286
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:16,103
- Is it number 2 or number 1? - Do you have to go number 2?

2287
00:56:16,103 --> 00:56:17,333
- No, it's number 1. - Oh, number 1.

2288
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:18,078
(Fortunately, it's number one.)

2289
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,503
- The restroom? - The restroom.

2290
00:56:18,148 --> 00:56:20,748
(Currently 100 points, currently 50 points)

2291
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:20,603
- Hey, man. The restroom? - Good grief.

2292
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:23,913
You have to go to the restroom. You'll get a bladder infection.

2293
00:56:23,973 --> 00:56:25,683
- Go on. - Go. Don't hold it.

2294
00:56:26,343 --> 00:56:27,813
Hey, the restroom is close.

2295
00:56:27,813 --> 00:56:30,013
- Where is it? - Then, I'll go quickly.

2296
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:32,158
(Team Kang Hoon, the 2nd-place team, has to answer nature's call.)

2297
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:31,553
- We'll count the seconds. - The time?

2298
00:56:31,553 --> 00:56:34,023
- Hey, just go later. - Then...

2299
00:56:32,328 --> 00:56:35,968
(Their ranks might get switched with a 50-point difference.)

2300
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,053
For real?

2301
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:36,053
Hey, just go later.

2302
00:56:36,053 --> 00:56:38,363
Then, we'll be out front.

2303
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:40,063
We'll go that far with you. Get back quickly.

2304
00:56:38,598 --> 00:56:41,368
(We'll go together until we reach the restroom.)

2305
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,593
But I was eating!

2306
00:56:41,593 --> 00:56:43,993
- When will I get to eat? - Our score is important.

2307
00:56:42,308 --> 00:56:47,078
(Will Hoon be able to get it done in 50 seconds?)

2308
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:46,703
Kang Hoon, you must have a bad prostate,

2309
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,233
seeing how you're going so often.

2310
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:51,373
Is it the same if 1 of us lets go versus 2? Then, will you hold this?

2311
00:56:51,473 --> 00:56:52,803
- But I... - Can I let go now?

2312
00:56:52,803 --> 00:56:54,273
- Let's just go together. - No, I'm not going.

2313
00:56:54,273 --> 00:56:56,213
- In 1, 2, 3. - Ready, go. Okay.

2314
00:56:56,273 --> 00:56:58,583
- Okay, go. Hey, it's... - Wait a minute! This is...

2315
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,843
- Hey, go by yourself. - Hold hands again!

2316
00:57:00,058 --> 00:57:02,228
(There's only one room.)

2317
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:03,053
No, you can go. I don't really need to go.

2318
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:04,413
- What are they doing? - They let go.

2319
00:57:03,328 --> 00:57:06,428
(Hoon, who urgently needs to use the restroom, enters.)

2320
00:57:04,413 --> 00:57:06,453
Hey, anyway... Ji Hyo!

2321
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:09,353
We can't both go at the same time.

2322
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:11,668
(They wasted time trying to go together.)

2323
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,493
But can they just walk around like that without holding hands?

2324
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:13,823
- They're losing points right now. - But it's...

2325
00:57:12,738 --> 00:57:16,808
(They're losing points while he's in the restroom.)

2326
00:57:14,593 --> 00:57:17,333
- Hurry up! - It's taking him so long.

2327
00:57:19,363 --> 00:57:20,963
Gosh, hang on.

2328
00:57:19,878 --> 00:57:22,678
(He returns in a hurry.)

2329
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:22,703
- Hurry up. - My hands...

2330
00:57:22,703 --> 00:57:24,333
- Gosh, that's too bad. - Hurry up.

2331
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:26,543
Ji Hyo, this isn't anything bad. I washed my hands.

2332
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:26,178
(His hands are wet.)

2333
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,013
Okay. Seok Jin, you should go now.

2334
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:29,918
(If it took over 50 seconds,)

2335
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,213
- I'm fine. - Goodness, this is...

2336
00:57:29,918 --> 00:57:31,358
(they would've swapped places with Team Ye Eun.)

2337
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,813
Anyway, it won't be easy.

2338
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:35,428
(How many points did they lose?)

2339
00:57:33,113 --> 00:57:35,213
- We could do this. - Yes, we could.

2340
00:57:35,413 --> 00:57:38,583
You seem to be finished eating,

2341
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:41,323
- so we'll end the lunch mission. - Okay.

2342
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:43,993
- After calculating the points... - We didn't let go.

2343
00:57:41,468 --> 00:57:44,468
(Original scores, Team Daniel: 150 points)

2344
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,523
taken away for letting go of each other's hands...

2345
00:57:44,468 --> 00:57:47,638
(Team Kang Hoon: 100 points, Team Ye Eun: 50 points)

2346
00:57:45,523 --> 00:57:47,363
- or breaking the rules... - Oh, there was rule-breaking too.

2347
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:50,368
(What are the final rankings?)

2348
00:57:47,963 --> 00:57:49,263
In first place...

2349
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,933
In first place...

2350
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:55,303
- It's Team Ye Eun. - Okay.
Darn it.

2351
00:57:56,303 --> 00:57:58,743
- Then, can we let go now? - Yes, you can let go now.

2352
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:00,648
(Team Ye Eun, who was in last place for the mission, came in 1st?)

2353
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:00,373
- My gosh. - Darn it.

2354
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,343
Yes, you can let go now.

2355
00:58:00,948 --> 00:58:04,388
(Team Ye Eun, who was in last place for the mission, came in 1st?)

2356
00:58:02,543 --> 00:58:03,573
In second place...

2357
00:58:03,573 --> 00:58:06,313
Team Kang Hoon originally had 100 points,

2358
00:58:06,313 --> 00:58:08,313
- I had to go to the restroom. - but it took you 69 seconds...

2359
00:58:08,313 --> 00:58:09,313
to go to the restroom.

2360
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:11,553
- So, your total score was 31, - What?

2361
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:13,353
- and you came in at 2nd place. - We got 2nd place?

2362
00:58:13,353 --> 00:58:15,323
We still got second place? What happened with the other guys?

2363
00:58:15,553 --> 00:58:17,853
For Team Daniel, Haha...

2364
00:58:17,853 --> 00:58:19,423
kept saying that his stomach hurt.

2365
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:20,993
He went to the restroom.

2366
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:22,638
(The result after deducting points)

2367
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,663
- My gosh. - They had minus 143 points.

2368
00:58:23,663 --> 00:58:26,003
- Oh, my. - He did that in 143 seconds?

2369
00:58:25,678 --> 00:58:28,548
(What on earth happened to Team Daniel?)

2370
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,533
- Right. - Yes, that's what he did.

2371
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:30,073
- I'm really sorry, - Yes?

2372
00:58:31,033 --> 00:58:32,773
but could I eat this after I use the restroom?

2373
00:58:33,103 --> 00:58:34,713
That would be better, right? We would feel more at ease.

2374
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:37,918
(Haha, with the weakest stomach, felt a big signal.)

2375
00:58:34,713 --> 00:58:35,843
- Yes, we would. - Then, let's go.

2376
00:58:35,843 --> 00:58:37,013
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2377
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,013
I'm really sorry.
- Sorry. - Let's go.

2378
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:41,013
- In 1, 2, 3. - Close the door.

2379
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:42,458
(In the end, they went to the restroom a 2nd time.)

2380
00:58:42,453 --> 00:58:45,953
- Oh, man. Hurry up, Haha! - Okay, I'm almost done.

2381
00:58:42,558 --> 00:58:45,998
(Like so, Haha lost 250 seconds by himself.)

2382
00:58:46,553 --> 00:58:48,423
I feel really bad about going to the restroom.

2383
00:58:48,853 --> 00:58:51,993
I actually picked people who were good at playing games,

2384
00:58:52,223 --> 00:58:55,093
but I think I'm with the two people who are the least trustworthy.

2385
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:58,833
Don't say that. Really, don't say that to me.

2386
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:59,138
(They fell from 1st place to last because he chose 2 poopers.)

2387
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:00,003
- So, - Nice, we won at least once.

2388
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,203
- we'll give you your votes. - Yes, this is my first time.

2389
00:59:02,203 --> 00:59:04,203
The winning team will get five votes.

2390
00:59:02,378 --> 00:59:05,218
(Team Ye Eun: 5 votes, Team Kang Hoon: 4 votes)

2391
00:59:04,203 --> 00:59:07,343
The 2nd-place team will get 4 votes.

2392
00:59:05,218 --> 00:59:07,378
(Team Daniel: 3 votes)

2393
00:59:07,403 --> 00:59:10,043
Since Jae Seok got some earlier, I'll give you three, Jong Kook.

2394
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:09,518
(5 votes in total)

2395
00:59:09,518 --> 00:59:11,018
(Jong Kook: 3 votes)

2396
00:59:10,043 --> 00:59:11,413
- Okay. - And two for you, Jae Seok.

2397
00:59:11,018 --> 00:59:14,858
(Jae Seok: 2 votes)

2398
00:59:11,413 --> 00:59:12,543
- Okay. - Ye Eun got on my bad side.

2399
00:59:12,543 --> 00:59:13,713
- This is good. - I'm going to vote for Ye Eun.

2400
00:59:13,943 --> 00:59:17,653
Ye Eun, don't worry. I'm voting for Kang Hoon, no matter what.

2401
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:21,393
Just know that you're guaranteed three votes already.

2402
00:59:21,953 --> 00:59:24,253
- I'm going to give them right back. - Fine, go ahead.

2403
00:59:24,253 --> 00:59:26,163
- I'll do that, no matter what. - Go ahead.

2404
00:59:24,268 --> 00:59:27,138
(Their bromance hits a rough patch.)

2405
00:59:26,323 --> 00:59:29,233
Really, just watch. Jong Kook will vote for you.

2406
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:30,468
(Hoon has 4 votes.)

2407
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:30,663
I'm going to vote for Ye Eun.

2408
00:59:30,663 --> 00:59:32,133
- In that case... - I'm totally voting for Ye Eun.

2409
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:34,563
But the thing is, he betrays people really easily.

2410
00:59:34,563 --> 00:59:37,403
You said so earlier, didn't you? "Let's wait and see." What?

2411
00:59:36,808 --> 00:59:40,678
(Then, he holds his hand out to Jong Kook?)

2412
00:59:37,403 --> 00:59:40,103
"Let's wait and see." What?

2413
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:41,473
- Are you giving it to Jong Kook? - Come on.

2414
00:59:41,473 --> 00:59:43,043
- Maybe Daniel. - But...

2415
00:59:43,043 --> 00:59:44,943
- It's fine, kid. - All my life...

2416
00:59:44,943 --> 00:59:46,413
- Kang Hoon. - He's my life savior.

2417
00:59:46,558 --> 00:59:50,058
(Hoon Fox chooses the easy path by teaming up with Jong Kook.)

2418
00:59:46,613 --> 00:59:47,643
- Kang Hoon. - He'll vote for you.

2419
00:59:47,643 --> 00:59:48,853
- He's my life savior. - Then, you should give it to him.

2420
00:59:48,853 --> 00:59:50,653
- Nice. - Every morning I wake up,

2421
00:59:50,058 --> 00:59:57,128
(Jong Kook: 1 vote)

2422
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,323
I bow in the direction that Jong Kook is in.

2423
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:53,953
- Really? - Then, you have to give it to him.

2424
00:59:53,953 --> 00:59:56,023
- Then, shouldn't you give him 2? - You have to give me 1.

2425
00:59:56,023 --> 00:59:57,253
But why are you giving one to Grasshopper?

2426
00:59:57,253 --> 00:59:59,823
You have to do a half-bow to me too. A half-bow for Grasshopper.

2427
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:02,608
(Grasshopper tries to convince him.)

2428
00:59:59,823 --> 01:00:02,193
- That's true. - Grasshopper might vote for you.

2429
01:00:02,393 --> 01:00:04,233
- I won't vote for Kang Hoon. - But then... Hang on.

2430
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,833
Hey, what in the world is going on?

2431
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:07,033
- What is all this? - Hey.

2432
01:00:06,538 --> 01:00:09,608
(He might be left behined while staying still.)

2433
01:00:07,033 --> 01:00:08,233
- This... - Wait. Let me talk to them.

2434
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:09,333
- What is this situation? - Kang Hoon.

2435
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:10,633
- I wouldn't vote for you. - Oh, you won't?

2436
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:12,573
You have to give it to someone who wouldn't vote for you.

2437
01:00:12,803 --> 01:00:14,743
Tell me who you'll vote for.

2438
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:15,843
Daniel, of course.

2439
01:00:16,573 --> 01:00:18,113
That's right. We'll vote for Daniel.

2440
01:00:17,188 --> 01:00:19,558
(He trains Hoon with an unbeatable logic.)

2441
01:00:18,383 --> 01:00:20,283
- Who will you vote for, Seok Jin? - I'm voting for Ye Eun.

2442
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,413
- They're all different. - There are so many.

2443
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:22,413
Ji Hyo, you should take one too.

2444
01:00:22,188 --> 01:00:23,358
(You should take one too for now.)

2445
01:00:22,413 --> 01:00:25,583
I'm going to vote for Niel now.

2446
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:27,198
(Only one vote is left.)

2447
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:27,253
- Because it's the last one... - I'm going to vote for Ye Eun.

2448
01:00:27,198 --> 01:00:30,028
(Jong Kook: 1 vote, Jae Seok: 1 vote, Ji Hyo: 1 vote)

2449
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:28,993
- I'm really voting for Ye Eun. - But...

2450
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:30,953
Seok Jin, do you have any votes?

2451
01:00:30,953 --> 01:00:32,863
- I don't. - You get one vote to begin with.

2452
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:34,663
- We each get 1 vote? - Oh, I have 1 vote.

2453
01:00:34,723 --> 01:00:36,233
- Well, you just need 1. - Yes, 1 is enough.

2454
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,263
- Of course. - If you don't give me that,

2455
01:00:36,908 --> 01:00:38,938
(Playing his strongest card)

2456
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:38,263
I'm going to vote for you.

2457
01:00:38,403 --> 01:00:41,573
Well, it's just one vote.

2458
01:00:41,573 --> 01:00:43,033
- It's just one. It doesn't matter. - Of course not.

2459
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:45,373
- Hey. - Ji Hyo, you get two.

2460
01:00:44,048 --> 01:00:46,348
(He gives Ji Hyo the last vote.)

2461
01:00:45,373 --> 01:00:47,243
- You had to hold my sweaty hand. - Hey, Kang Hoon.

2462
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:50,688
(Seok Sam didn't get anything from the leader who had 4 votes.)

2463
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,273
Ye Eun, you should be happy. I switched my vote to Kang Hoon.

2464
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:52,313
- Seok Sam got none. - Hey, I...

2465
01:00:51,218 --> 01:00:55,258
(Mr. Seok Sam is very upset.)

2466
01:00:52,313 --> 01:00:53,943
Way back when we played volleyball or something.

2467
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:55,583
We didn't get along since then.

2468
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:58,253
If the team leaders talk and end Seok Jin with one vote...

2469
01:00:56,388 --> 01:01:00,128
(Could it turn into a battle between him and the troublemakers?)

2470
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:00,283
- That's right. Good idea. - Right?

2471
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:04,798
(Current number of votes)

2472
01:01:00,283 --> 01:01:01,423
Today, you...

2473
01:01:01,423 --> 01:01:03,723
- It's only one vote anyway. - Right.

2474
01:01:03,753 --> 01:01:06,063
- We still ate everything, though. - I'm full.

2475
01:01:05,468 --> 01:01:07,568
(After finishing the meal)

2476
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:08,833
For Ye Eun and Kang Hoon,

2477
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:09,933
how about the four of us ride in the car together...

2478
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:10,993
and let Ye Eun and Kang Hoon...

2479
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:13,133
Okay, got it. All right, then, what?

2480
01:01:12,408 --> 01:01:17,548
(Ji Hyo suggests putting Kang-Ji Couple in a separate car.)

2481
01:01:13,663 --> 01:01:15,303
Well, if that's what it is, okay.

2482
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:17,573
- Yes, Kang Hoon, ride in that car. - Kang Hoon, you go over there.

2483
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:18,643
Well, you need a chance...

2484
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:19,643
- to get to know each other. - Go on. See you later.

2485
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,373
- Kang Hoon must feel so awkward. - My goodness.

2486
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:22,988
(Ji Hyo is the only one who's helping Ye Eun out.)

2487
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,443
- Sister. - Gosh, what...

2488
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:26,658
(She called Jae Seok "sister.")

2489
01:01:24,543 --> 01:01:26,243
- I called you "Sister." - Did you just call me "Sister?"

2490
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,653
That's what they said I should do. I mean,

2491
01:01:26,758 --> 01:01:30,228
(Ye Eun lost her mind.)

2492
01:01:28,653 --> 01:01:30,353
- Ji Hyo told me to do that. - Gosh, I'm going crazy.

2493
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,923
Will there ever be another day like this?

2494
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:33,053
- Help me. - Just once.

2495
01:01:33,053 --> 01:01:35,223
- No, you two can ride alone. - Come on, Jae Seok.

2496
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:37,398
(They were discussing it among themselves like that.)

2497
01:01:35,223 --> 01:01:36,453
- You two can ride alone. - Just once.

2498
01:01:36,453 --> 01:01:38,163
- One second. - No, you two can ride alone.

2499
01:01:38,223 --> 01:01:39,223
- Just the two of us? - Yes, you can ride alone.

2500
01:01:38,398 --> 01:01:41,568
(They got to get in a separate car.)

2501
01:01:39,223 --> 01:01:41,023
I don't think I'll be able to say a word. What do I do?

2502
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:44,193
Gosh, I feel giddy. How awkward would they feel?

2503
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:46,303
- Totally awkward. - I know, right?

2504
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:48,478
(It really is awkward.)

2505
01:01:49,033 --> 01:01:51,843
What do I do? Seriously.

2506
01:01:51,978 --> 01:01:55,588
(The air feels romantic.)

2507
01:01:52,173 --> 01:01:53,243
- Are we really riding alone? - I can't believe...

2508
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:55,673
Really, I can't do anything if you set things up like this.

2509
01:01:56,418 --> 01:01:58,818
(Leaning forward)

2510
01:01:58,543 --> 01:02:00,013
It's close, though.

2511
01:01:58,888 --> 01:02:01,188
(Checking the navigation system)

2512
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:03,953
- Well, I... - Don't get the wrong idea.
- I know. - I don't like you either.

2513
01:02:04,953 --> 01:02:06,923
I know.

2514
01:02:06,928 --> 01:02:11,568
(Ye Eun, who absolutely doesn't like Hoon, sets off.)

2515
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:10,253
Gosh, seriously. This is fun.

2516
01:02:10,323 --> 01:02:12,923
But everyone around me... Your popularity... They love you.

2517
01:02:12,923 --> 01:02:15,193
Oh, really? Who?

2518
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:17,833
Just the people around me. They ask me what you're like.

2519
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:21,103
So, I said you were a good person.

2520
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:22,133
Tell them that I'm a good person.

2521
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:23,473
Yes, you're a good person.

2522
01:02:23,733 --> 01:02:25,203
Well, you are a good person.

2523
01:02:25,203 --> 01:02:27,173
I am a good person.

2524
01:02:27,548 --> 01:02:31,518
(Being called a good person, she immediately softens up.)

2525
01:02:28,943 --> 01:02:30,843
- You seem so shy. - No.

2526
01:02:30,843 --> 01:02:32,183
If you act so shy...

2527
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:34,183
No, right. I'm making weird...

2528
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,583
- Yes, you seem rather weird. - I'm making you look weird...

2529
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:37,983
- Am I the weird one? - No.

2530
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:41,253
- Why are you acting so awkward? - No, I...

2531
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:42,753
- You seem so antsy. - Well...

2532
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:47,198
(Reporter can't say anything when it's just the two of them.)

2533
01:02:42,753 --> 01:02:44,693
- Why... Are you embarrassed? - Well, on Running Man...

2534
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:46,463
No, it's not like that.

2535
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:48,293
- Are you embarrassed? - You've been doing this a while.

2536
01:02:48,293 --> 01:02:50,233
If you take the lead, I will...

2537
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,633
Hoon, I'm also a girl who wants to be led.

2538
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:55,678
(They're talking about entirely different things.)

2539
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,833
I'm also a girl who wants to be led.

2540
01:02:55,678 --> 01:02:57,248
(Talking about the conversation, talking about love)

2541
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:57,103
Oh, really? Okay.

2542
01:02:57,303 --> 01:02:59,043
By the way, it's been quite a while since we met.

2543
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:00,903
- That's true. - Yes, right.

2544
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,143
- Be comfortable around me. - Yes, I'm comfortable.

2545
01:03:03,143 --> 01:03:04,373
- Just be comfortable. - Yes, I'm comfortable.

2546
01:03:04,373 --> 01:03:05,483
And don't get the wrong idea and think that I like you.

2547
01:03:04,818 --> 01:03:07,058
(Emphasizing once again)

2548
01:03:05,483 --> 01:03:08,213
- Oh, I would never. You said so. - Right.

2549
01:03:07,058 --> 01:03:09,258
(I wouldn't get the wrong idea.)

2550
01:03:08,213 --> 01:03:09,853
- What did I say? - So...

2551
01:03:09,388 --> 01:03:11,658
(The day she made it clear that she didn't like him)

2552
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,553
- I really don't like you. - Don't get the wrong idea.

2553
01:03:11,683 --> 01:03:13,923
- Don't get the wrong idea. - I really won't. Never.

2554
01:03:14,283 --> 01:03:16,193
- I would never... - You seem a bit full of yourself.

2555
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:18,423
No, I'm really not.

2556
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:19,923
- I... - But I'll date you if you ask.

2557
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:24,708
(She can't play hard to get anymore.)

2558
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:23,163
Oh, I saw that video clip. That's also...

2559
01:03:23,163 --> 01:03:24,663
I am willing to date you if you ask me out.

2560
01:03:24,663 --> 01:03:25,663
Oh, really?

2561
01:03:26,033 --> 01:03:27,533
- But don't get the wrong idea. - Got it.

2562
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:29,003
I get what you're saying.

2563
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:30,478
(She's practically begging him to get the wrong idea at this point.)

2564
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:31,773
I'm not the type to confess my feelings first.

2565
01:03:32,043 --> 01:03:33,173
- You're the type to wait. - Yes.

2566
01:03:33,173 --> 01:03:34,373
Me too.

2567
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:35,573
- Really? - Yes.

2568
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:38,288
(1 day until Ye Eun attacks him with love confession)

2569
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:40,643
Your face looks much better.

2570
01:03:40,643 --> 01:03:41,713
Really?

2571
01:03:41,713 --> 01:03:43,313
- It has always looked good. - I know that,

2572
01:03:43,313 --> 01:03:45,653
- but back then... - What about it?

2573
01:03:45,653 --> 01:03:46,853
You looked happy.

2574
01:03:46,983 --> 01:03:48,223
You looked happy.

2575
01:03:48,728 --> 01:03:52,398
(She was blessed by carbohydrates back then.)

2576
01:03:51,493 --> 01:03:53,223
- You used to be... - So you can't read the room, right?

2577
01:03:53,223 --> 01:03:54,363
It isn't like that.

2578
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,533
So...

2579
01:03:55,663 --> 01:03:57,133
- You used to be... - I used to be...

2580
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,703
- cute, right? - Sure.

2581
01:03:57,308 --> 01:03:59,078
(She concludes it for him.)

2582
01:03:58,703 --> 01:04:00,503
You used to be round.

2583
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,233
- But you've lost weight. - I've lost weight.

2584
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:03,473
- I've become skinny, right? - Yes.

2585
01:04:05,148 --> 01:04:08,648
(The atmosphere turns awkward again.)

2586
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,973
- Why do you feel so uncomfortable? - No.

2587
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:09,643
I enjoy all of your works.

2588
01:04:09,643 --> 01:04:11,413
I enjoy "Office Workers."

2589
01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:12,713
- You must be my fan. - Yes.

2590
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,683
I'm your fan.

2591
01:04:14,683 --> 01:04:16,853
You can tell people that you're close to me.

2592
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,883
We aren't that close.

2593
01:04:19,983 --> 01:04:21,723
We haven't exchanged numbers.

2594
01:04:21,853 --> 01:04:23,223
Are you asking for my number?

2595
01:04:23,723 --> 01:04:25,723
He's asking for my number, right?

2596
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:27,338
(She interprets his words as she wants.)

2597
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,433
Give me your phone.

2598
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:30,093
We can exchange numbers.

2599
01:04:29,608 --> 01:04:34,838
(Could something finally happen between them?)

2600
01:04:30,093 --> 01:04:31,633
Hold on.

2601
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:34,033
We can exchange numbers, right?

2602
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:35,903
I won't actually use it.

2603
01:04:35,903 --> 01:04:37,373
Of course not.

2604
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:38,673
In any case...

2605
01:04:38,148 --> 01:04:39,918
(Halting)

2606
01:04:39,903 --> 01:04:41,473
We should contact each other...

2607
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:43,418
(Speaking nonsense)

2608
01:04:41,473 --> 01:04:43,173
if something good or bad happens.

2609
01:04:43,173 --> 01:04:44,543
Would you come to my wedding?

2610
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,383
Of course. Why wouldn't I go?

2611
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:47,743
Do you want me to stop the wedding?

2612
01:04:47,818 --> 01:04:49,428
(Taking his hand out of his pocket)

2613
01:04:48,913 --> 01:04:50,253
Do you want me to say that I'm against the wedding?

2614
01:04:50,483 --> 01:04:51,753
Why aren't you giving me your phone?

2615
01:04:51,753 --> 01:04:52,783
Hold on.

2616
01:04:52,783 --> 01:04:54,553
- Don't you want my number? - It isn't like that.

2617
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:56,768
(Ye Eun has never been this smart before.)

2618
01:04:54,553 --> 01:04:57,093
Hoon, I'm popular too.

2619
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,423
I know that you're very popular because people tell me so.

2620
01:04:57,398 --> 01:04:59,998
(He takes out his phone in the end.)

2621
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:03,433
What are you hiding?

2622
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:04,693
I'm not hiding anything.

2623
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,133
I just don't know how to add...

2624
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,263
a new contact...

2625
01:05:08,203 --> 01:05:10,403
I can just type it out on the keypad.

2626
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,303
I wanted to keep the font small so that it wouldn't be exposed.

2627
01:05:11,148 --> 01:05:14,448
(She practically forces him to give him his number.)

2628
01:05:14,603 --> 01:05:15,673
Are you cold?

2629
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:18,013
- No, the weather... No. - Shall I give you my vest?

2630
01:05:19,183 --> 01:05:20,983
- Don't think that I like you. - I never will.

2631
01:05:21,043 --> 01:05:22,553
But I'll say yes if you ask me to be your girlfriend.

2632
01:05:22,553 --> 01:05:23,553
You're so...

2633
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:24,583
- Hoon. - It isn't like that.

2634
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:26,953
- Don't think that I like you. - I won't.

2635
01:05:26,953 --> 01:05:28,053
I'll root for you.

2636
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:30,228
(The woman who asked for his number goes all out.)

2637
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:31,693
- Is this the place? - Can we just go there?

2638
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:32,968
(Kang-Ji got there first.)

2639
01:05:31,693 --> 01:05:32,723
We can just go there.

2640
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,538
(Looking back)

2641
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:39,208
(Looking back)

2642
01:05:38,803 --> 01:05:41,033
- Hoon, do you feel uncomfortable? - No, I don't feel uncomfortable.

2643
01:05:41,163 --> 01:05:42,503
- Let's go. - Why do you...

2644
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:44,033
- Do you like me? - No.

2645
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:46,848
(She asks and answers by herself, completely out of control.)

2646
01:05:45,073 --> 01:05:46,303
- No. - Please wait here...

2647
01:05:46,303 --> 01:05:47,803
- for a second. - Okay.

2648
01:05:47,803 --> 01:05:48,943
Well...

2649
01:05:51,913 --> 01:05:53,213
By the way, it's cold.

2650
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:54,343
It's cold, right?

2651
01:05:57,088 --> 01:05:58,828
(Suddenly intertwining her fingers with his)

2652
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,483
Did something happen?

2653
01:05:58,653 --> 01:05:59,783
Did something happen?

2654
01:05:59,783 --> 01:06:02,623
Did someone dump her here...

2655
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:03,953
in a cruel manner?

2656
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,723
What's taking them so long?

2657
01:06:07,723 --> 01:06:08,733
They're here.

2658
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:11,778
(At that moment, the older members' cars arrive.)

2659
01:06:10,763 --> 01:06:12,503
Shall we hold hands?

2660
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:16,733
I'll say that today is our first day as a couple.

2661
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:21,478
(Sensing that this is her day, Ye Eun goes all out.)

2662
01:06:20,673 --> 01:06:21,943
- What are you doing? - What?

2663
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:23,773
Why are you guys holding hands?

2664
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,043
What's this?

2665
01:06:24,618 --> 01:06:27,018
(The two of them are holding hands.)

2666
01:06:26,713 --> 01:06:27,983
Hoon, is it your penalty?

2667
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:29,283
It must be your penalty.

2668
01:06:29,558 --> 01:06:34,228
(They think it's a penalty, unlike what she intended.)

2669
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,653
- But... - It's a mission.

2670
01:06:32,023 --> 01:06:34,153
you guys aren't on the same team.

2671
01:06:34,153 --> 01:06:35,423
- What's going on? - It's a mission.

2672
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:36,993
Why are you guys holding hands in a strange way?

2673
01:06:37,268 --> 01:06:40,968
(Only one person wants to hold hands.)

2674
01:06:38,293 --> 01:06:40,023
- What's up with the two of you? - Is it a mission?

2675
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:41,763
Why do only the two of you have a mission?

2676
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:43,563
- It's a mission. - Why are you wearing gloves?

2677
01:06:43,593 --> 01:06:44,893
I thought that I might sweat.

2678
01:06:44,933 --> 01:06:46,503
- Hoon sweats a lot. - Really?

2679
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,163
- Hoon, why do you look so down? - It isn't like that.

2680
01:06:48,163 --> 01:06:49,173
- Suddenly... - You feel uncomfortable, right?

2681
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:50,973
- I... - Do you feel uncomfortable?

2682
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,803
Today is our first day as a couple.

2683
01:06:52,973 --> 01:06:54,343
- What? - Our first day as a couple.

2684
01:06:53,118 --> 01:06:55,788
(Jipley is becoming more brazen.)

2685
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,473
Did you guys decide to date?

2686
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:56,543
Daniel is very surprised.

2687
01:06:56,543 --> 01:06:58,013
He's thinking, "I tried so hard to get her."

2688
01:06:58,543 --> 01:07:00,013
I mean...

2689
01:06:58,988 --> 01:07:02,328
(A romance that is supposed to be discarded comes to life.)

2690
01:07:00,013 --> 01:07:01,583
- Your first day as a couple? - What's going on?

2691
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,913
How is Hoon different? Right?

2692
01:07:03,013 --> 01:07:05,253
You know, seriously...

2693
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:07,328
(Daniel who has a crush on her confesses his feelings.)

2694
01:07:05,253 --> 01:07:07,383
I'm saying this because today is my last day.

2695
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:09,293
When I saw Ye Eun for the first time...

2696
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:11,223
for the shoot,

2697
01:07:11,223 --> 01:07:12,323
- it was winter. - Yes.

2698
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:14,363
- Then I joined the show in spring. - Yes.

2699
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,493
I was so happy to see her again.

2700
01:07:14,568 --> 01:07:16,138
(I was happy to see her again.)

2701
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:17,293
It was very nice to see Ye Eun at every shoot.

2702
01:07:17,463 --> 01:07:18,533
What are you doing?

2703
01:07:18,408 --> 01:07:23,308
(He finally confesses his true feelings during the final shoot.)

2704
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:19,733
Seriously.

2705
01:07:19,733 --> 01:07:22,003
- You're good. - This is driving me crazy.

2706
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:23,473
"Do you like me?"

2707
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:25,903
What... What's wrong with you?

2708
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:26,878
(Clapping)

2709
01:07:25,903 --> 01:07:27,943
- That was sudden. - Hoon is clapping.

2710
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:29,043
Why are you clapping?

2711
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:30,473
Daniel suddenly said...

2712
01:07:30,473 --> 01:07:31,473
- What? - Come on.

2713
01:07:31,473 --> 01:07:33,743
- I'm about to cry. - Really?

2714
01:07:33,858 --> 01:07:35,118
(Emotional)

2715
01:07:34,243 --> 01:07:35,313
It was a love confession.

2716
01:07:35,228 --> 01:07:38,628
(Crying)

2717
01:07:35,913 --> 01:07:37,883
It was a love confession.

2718
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:40,523
- Why are you crying? - Why are you crying?

2719
01:07:39,328 --> 01:07:45,238
(Even a low-quality soap opera wouldn't have a scene like this.)

2720
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,653
Come on.

2721
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:43,453
- I mean... - Ye Eun.

2722
01:07:43,453 --> 01:07:44,993
- Why is she crying? - Why are you crying?

2723
01:07:45,363 --> 01:07:47,363
- They're such fools. - She's crying for real.

2724
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,033
They're ridiculous.

2725
01:07:49,263 --> 01:07:50,663
- Seriously. - Did you become sad?

2726
01:07:50,663 --> 01:07:52,003
- Listen. - Did you become sad, Ye Eun?

2727
01:07:50,938 --> 01:07:55,208
(Her shifting hormones made her cry again today.)

2728
01:07:52,003 --> 01:07:54,263
You didn't have any feelings for him.

2729
01:07:54,463 --> 01:07:56,633
Ye Eun didn't know that he enjoyed seeing her...

2730
01:07:56,633 --> 01:07:58,103
every time.

2731
01:07:58,103 --> 01:07:59,273
What's wrong with you?

2732
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,443
That's right.

2733
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,213
You had noticed it, right?

2734
01:08:02,373 --> 01:08:04,013
I had noticed his attraction.

2735
01:08:04,743 --> 01:08:06,243
I had noticed his attraction.

2736
01:08:05,858 --> 01:08:10,188
(An unimaginable development)

2737
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:12,853
- "I had noticed his attraction." - "I had noticed his attraction."

2738
01:08:12,998 --> 01:08:14,798
(I kind of knew it.)

2739
01:08:13,053 --> 01:08:15,053
- She had noticed it. - She had noticed it.

2740
01:08:15,123 --> 01:08:16,493
You should have a meal with her outside of work.

2741
01:08:15,428 --> 01:08:16,828
(You should have a meal with Ye Eun outside of work.)

2742
01:08:16,523 --> 01:08:17,753
A meal? Outside of work?

2743
01:08:16,828 --> 01:08:19,398
(Why would I?)

2744
01:08:17,753 --> 01:08:19,993
- You should have a meal in private. - Talk on the phone.

2745
01:08:19,498 --> 01:08:24,208
(Leaving the musty love triangle behind,)

2746
01:08:19,993 --> 01:08:21,793
- You even made her cry. - No meals?

2747
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:23,593
- Let's move. - Okay.

2748
01:08:24,293 --> 01:08:26,333
It's so funny when Ye Eun cries.

2749
01:08:26,733 --> 01:08:27,863
It's an autumn field day.

2750
01:08:27,408 --> 01:08:29,908
(they enter the track-lined playground.)

2751
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:28,973
- It'll be fun. - It's so spacious.

2752
01:08:28,973 --> 01:08:30,373
- What's this? - There are hurdles.

2753
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:31,703
We don't need to crawl under them, do we?

2754
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:33,918
(Handmade obstacles have been set up.)

2755
01:08:32,373 --> 01:08:33,973
We'll make a round.

2756
01:08:33,973 --> 01:08:36,313
- Obstacles. - The three youngest members...

2757
01:08:36,313 --> 01:08:37,643
should choose their teams wisely...

2758
01:08:37,643 --> 01:08:38,713
- this time. - Yes.

2759
01:08:38,713 --> 01:08:41,043
- Ye Eun's team will place last. - That's right.

2760
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:42,413
That's no way to talk.

2761
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:44,258
(Flippant)

2762
01:08:42,413 --> 01:08:43,453
What's the right way to talk?

2763
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,453
Don't pick me.

2764
01:08:45,113 --> 01:08:46,983
Ye Eun, don't pick me.

2765
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:48,968
(Don't worry.)

2766
01:08:46,983 --> 01:08:48,483
- I won't. - You won't?

2767
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:49,923
- Don't pick me. - Seok Jin, I'm sorry,

2768
01:08:49,923 --> 01:08:51,553
- but I'll never pick you. - I don't like you either.

2769
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:52,338
(Childish)

2770
01:08:51,623 --> 01:08:52,723
I'll never pick you.

2771
01:08:52,338 --> 01:08:55,038
(They enter the playground while bickering.)

2772
01:08:52,793 --> 01:08:53,793
- Don't worry. - Don't pick me.

2773
01:08:53,793 --> 01:08:54,863
- Don't pick me. - Now,

2774
01:08:54,863 --> 01:08:57,093
- only the last mission remains. - Okay.

2775
01:08:57,093 --> 01:08:59,903
The last mission to earn more votes is...

2776
01:08:57,138 --> 01:09:00,038
(The last chance to earn more votes)

2777
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:02,633
- Smelly Race. - What is it?

2778
01:09:00,438 --> 01:09:03,408
(Mission 2: Smelly Race)

2779
01:09:02,633 --> 01:09:04,033
You'll get divided into three teams...

2780
01:09:03,548 --> 01:09:05,518
(They'll get divided into three teams...)

2781
01:09:04,033 --> 01:09:06,903
and have a relay race with obstacles.

2782
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:07,518
(and have a relay race with obstacles.)

2783
01:09:06,903 --> 01:09:08,743
The rankings that are based on your record...

2784
01:09:07,678 --> 01:09:09,818
(The rankings based on their record...)

2785
01:09:08,743 --> 01:09:11,273
will determine the number of votes you earn.

2786
01:09:09,818 --> 01:09:11,918
(will determine the number of votes they earn.)

2787
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:12,983
Instead of holding a baton,

2788
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,953
you'll run with a tennis ball over your head.

2789
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:17,013
- It's complicated. - So...

2790
01:09:17,013 --> 01:09:19,123
the first runner will run with the ball...

2791
01:09:19,123 --> 01:09:20,823
and deliver it to the basin...

2792
01:09:19,298 --> 01:09:22,898
(They must pass the ball head-to-head without using hands.)

2793
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,793
- of the next runner. - He or she needs to deliver it.

2794
01:09:22,853 --> 01:09:25,123
If the ball drops to the floor,

2795
01:09:25,123 --> 01:09:27,663
you need to go back to the place where it dropped,

2796
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,093
- put the ball back inside, and run. - Oh, my goodness.

2797
01:09:30,193 --> 01:09:33,503
- The mission name is Smelly Race. - Yes.

2798
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:36,303
- You've done this once in the past. - This mission?

2799
01:09:36,303 --> 01:09:38,473
- Do you remember Smelly Dodge Ball? - Smelly?

2800
01:09:38,473 --> 01:09:39,743
- What was it? - We spoke casually, right?

2801
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,503
No. In front of your nose,

2802
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,613
you had a random smelly item.

2803
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:47,243
- You remember, right? - There were my sock and durian.

2804
01:09:45,818 --> 01:09:48,318
(I remember.)

2805
01:09:47,243 --> 01:09:48,313
That's right.

2806
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:51,128
(Summer 4 years ago)

2807
01:09:51,128 --> 01:09:53,358
(Aged cheese, fermented skate, and...)

2808
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:57,198
(Se Chan's sock that's known for its sour smell)

2809
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:57,123
Seok Jin, it touched your mouth.

2810
01:09:57,123 --> 01:09:58,793
Gosh, this is annoying.

2811
01:09:59,068 --> 01:10:01,468
(They played dodge ball as the smelly items dangled...)

2812
01:09:59,993 --> 01:10:01,863
- Hurry up! - Hurry up!

2813
01:10:01,468 --> 01:10:03,908
(in front of their faces.)

2814
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:03,933
Se Chan's sock touched my mouth!

2815
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,163
One item was Se Chan's sock.

2816
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:07,133
- My sock was the worst. - So...

2817
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,933
we need a sock from Se Chan.

2818
01:10:10,508 --> 01:10:14,848
(Se Chan's sock will make an appearance today as well.)

2819
01:10:13,103 --> 01:10:14,573
- Please bring it over here. - Now?

2820
01:10:14,573 --> 01:10:15,843
- Should he take it off now? - Se Chan, how is your condition?

2821
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:17,373
- No way. - Take it off right before the race.

2822
01:10:17,373 --> 01:10:18,543
- You know, - I'll get it ready.

2823
01:10:18,418 --> 01:10:23,028
(His socks are already stinky, and he's making it even worse.)

2824
01:10:18,543 --> 01:10:20,613
it touches your face at times when you run.

2825
01:10:20,613 --> 01:10:21,843
- That's right. - I hate it the most.

2826
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:23,053
- Mine is the worst. - It's so annoying.

2827
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:24,053
I don't know who'll get it.

2828
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,183
Why? Is Se Chan very smelly?

2829
01:10:24,228 --> 01:10:26,658
(He's never experienced it.)

2830
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:26,623
You'll experience it soon.

2831
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:27,753
It smells sour.

2832
01:10:27,883 --> 01:10:29,023
- Oh, no. - It smells like tom yum goong.

2833
01:10:29,023 --> 01:10:31,323
Let me tell you what the smelly items will be.

2834
01:10:31,323 --> 01:10:33,563
- There are two durians. - I can't stand the smell of durian.

2835
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,123
- I hate it so much. - I can't stand the smell of durian.

2836
01:10:35,123 --> 01:10:37,233
- I'll throw up. - And...

2837
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,933
- there are two skates. - What?

2838
01:10:38,933 --> 01:10:40,203
- Skate? - And...

2839
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:41,303
For goodness' sake.

2840
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:43,633
Last time, cheese was the worst.

2841
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:45,003
- Cheese. - And...

2842
01:10:45,073 --> 01:10:46,573
- there are two cheeses. - Cheese is no joke.

2843
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:47,943
- Cheeses are the best. - Cheese?

2844
01:10:47,973 --> 01:10:49,213
- And... - Are they bad?

2845
01:10:49,213 --> 01:10:50,473
there's one cheonggukjang.

2846
01:10:50,473 --> 01:10:51,773
- Cheonggukjang is okay. - Cheeses are okay.

2847
01:10:51,773 --> 01:10:53,643
There's a set of onions and garlic.

2848
01:10:53,643 --> 01:10:55,013
- Onions and garlic are okay. - That's the best option.

2849
01:10:55,013 --> 01:10:56,313
- Onions and garlic? - Onions and garlic are okay.

2850
01:10:56,313 --> 01:10:58,213
- The last one is Se Chan's sock. - I can't stand it.

2851
01:10:58,213 --> 01:11:00,053
- That's better. - That's better.

2852
01:11:00,053 --> 01:11:01,823
- That's better. - Se Chan's sock is the worst.

2853
01:11:01,823 --> 01:11:02,893
It feels a bit icky.

2854
01:11:02,893 --> 01:11:05,023
- Se Chan's sock feels a bit icky. - You're right.

2855
01:11:05,153 --> 01:11:06,763
Now, the three leaders...

2856
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:08,908
(The leaders will devide the teams again.)

2857
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,393
will divide the members into teams.

2858
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:11,033
But each team needs one woman.

2859
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:13,863
Seok Jin, Ji Hyo, and Ye Eun...

2860
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:15,773
- Excuse me. - will be divided up.

2861
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,003
Listen.

2862
01:11:15,948 --> 01:11:20,618
(As always, Seok Jin will count as a woman!)

2863
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:20,003
- That's the right thing to do. - That's the right thing to do.

2864
01:11:20,003 --> 01:11:21,973
- It's for the balance. - That's the right thing to do.

2865
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:23,473
- That's right. - My physical abilities...

2866
01:11:23,473 --> 01:11:25,413
are at their height.

2867
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,618
(That's impossible.)

2868
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:26,813
- That's the right thing to do. - Woman.

2869
01:11:26,813 --> 01:11:29,183
The team that picks me...

2870
01:11:29,183 --> 01:11:30,383
- will do well. - Woman.

2871
01:11:30,383 --> 01:11:32,123
The two of you should take...

2872
01:11:32,028 --> 01:11:35,128
(Kang Hoon and Daniel will team up with Seok Soon and Ji Hyo each.)

2873
01:11:32,123 --> 01:11:33,323
- either Ji Hyo or Seok Jin. - Take one.

2874
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:35,183
- Take one. - In that case...

2875
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,323
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2876
01:11:37,328 --> 01:11:38,668
(Daniel wins.)

2877
01:11:38,668 --> 01:11:41,938
(Between Seok Soon and Ji Hyo, whom will Daniel pick?)

2878
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:41,923
Pick me!

2879
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,293
He won't give me any votes.

2880
01:11:44,663 --> 01:11:45,863
Pick me!

2881
01:11:45,863 --> 01:11:47,303
- Okay. - That's the right choice.

2882
01:11:47,138 --> 01:11:49,178
(Team Daniel: Seok Jin)

2883
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,603
- Okay. Seok Jin. - Okay.

2884
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:50,603
- Ji Hyo. - I'll join Hoon's team.

2885
01:11:49,178 --> 01:11:51,478
(Team Kang Hoon: Ji Hyo)

2886
01:11:50,903 --> 01:11:52,503
- I'll pick Jae Seok. - Okay.

2887
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:54,178
(Team Ye Eun: Jae Seok)

2888
01:11:52,503 --> 01:11:54,203
- Okay. - She likes Jae Seok so much.

2889
01:11:54,278 --> 01:11:59,458
(Relay teams)

2890
01:11:54,373 --> 01:11:55,473
Jong Kook.

2891
01:11:55,913 --> 01:11:57,313
- Se Chan. - Okay.

2892
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,313
- Haha is with Hoon. - We'll win.

2893
01:11:58,313 --> 01:11:59,583
Good. This team is perfect.

2894
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:00,843
- We're evenly matched. - We're set.

2895
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:01,418
(Team Kang Hoon: Ji Hyo, Haha)

2896
01:12:00,843 --> 01:12:02,453
- We're evenly matched. - This is great.

2897
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:02,928
(Team Daniel: Seok Sam, Se Chan)

2898
01:12:02,453 --> 01:12:03,753
- We're set. - There's a nice balance.

2899
01:12:02,928 --> 01:12:04,358
(Team Ye Eun: Jae Seok, Jong Kook)

2900
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,683
I'll beat women...

2901
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:07,398
(Determined)

2902
01:12:05,683 --> 01:12:06,983
with my speed.

2903
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,823
- You'll pick your item. - My item?

2904
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:12,298
(It's time to draw a smelly item.)

2905
01:12:09,823 --> 01:12:11,223
- Will we pick our items? - I'll pick my item.

2906
01:12:11,223 --> 01:12:12,323
- We'll pick our items. - I see.

2907
01:12:12,323 --> 01:12:13,393
- We'll pick our items. - You'll pick...

2908
01:12:12,338 --> 01:12:13,998
(2 durians, 2 fermented skates, cheonggukjang, 2 pieces of cheese)

2909
01:12:13,393 --> 01:12:14,663
- your item. - Will we pick our items?

2910
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:15,638
(Onions and garlic, Se Chan's sock)

2911
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,833
Hoon, just hand them out.

2912
01:12:15,638 --> 01:12:18,778
(Kang Hoon will hand out the items randomly.)

2913
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,063
- I'll hand them out. - Hand them out.

2914
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,303
- Give everyone an item. - That's right. You should pick.

2915
01:12:19,733 --> 01:12:22,033
Please don't let it be a durian.

2916
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:24,873
- Onions will be the best. - Se Chan's sock is the worst.

2917
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:26,103
- Now, - I don't know who it'll be,

2918
01:12:26,103 --> 01:12:27,743
- but I'm sorry. - Jae Seok will check first.

2919
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,313
- Onions and garlic. - That's a good one.

2920
01:12:29,313 --> 01:12:30,413
- I'm jealous. - That isn't half bad.

2921
01:12:30,413 --> 01:12:32,383
- This is better. - That's better.

2922
01:12:32,383 --> 01:12:34,113
It's like a kimchi-making day.

2923
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:36,953
- Durian. - Durian? I'm saved.

2924
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:38,153
- Durian? I'm saved. - Durian is a hard one.

2925
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,323
I'm saved. Someone else got it.

2926
01:12:39,323 --> 01:12:40,683
- Durian is a hard one. - I'm saved. Someone else got it.

2927
01:12:40,683 --> 01:12:43,293
- Cheese. - I like cheese.

2928
01:12:43,293 --> 01:12:44,893
- Durian. - Okay.

2929
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:45,993
- Please. - Cheonggukjang.

2930
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:47,123
Cheonggukjang.

2931
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:48,963
- Cheese. - Cheonggukjang is a good one.

2932
01:12:48,963 --> 01:12:50,093
- It isn't bad. - Next.

2933
01:12:50,093 --> 01:12:51,693
- Skate. - Skate.

2934
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:53,103
- I got cheese. - Skate is a hard one.

2935
01:12:53,103 --> 01:12:54,363
- Ji Hyo got cheese. - Cheese is a good one.

2936
01:12:54,433 --> 01:12:55,673
- I got cheese. - Skate is a hard one.

2937
01:12:55,648 --> 01:12:57,508
(That means...)

2938
01:12:55,673 --> 01:12:56,903
- Hold on. - Cheese is a good one.

2939
01:12:57,548 --> 01:13:01,018
(One of them will get Se Chan's sock!)

2940
01:12:57,633 --> 01:13:00,303
- All right. - One of them will get the sock.

2941
01:13:00,903 --> 01:13:02,643
- Who will get Se Chan's sock? - Haha.

2942
01:13:01,178 --> 01:13:04,848
(Who will be the lucky winner?)

2943
01:13:03,373 --> 01:13:05,113
- Who will get Se Chan's sock? - Haha.

2944
01:13:07,013 --> 01:13:08,143
Okay.

2945
01:13:07,158 --> 01:13:08,458
(Se Chan's sock, fermented skate)

2946
01:13:08,758 --> 01:13:11,388
(Retorter Kang Hoon gets the sock.)

2947
01:13:08,813 --> 01:13:09,883
Okay.

2948
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:13,553
- Se Chan's sock. - Se Chan's sock is the worst.

2949
01:13:13,553 --> 01:13:14,723
Is it a bit wet?

2950
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,323
- Yes. - Wet it.

2951
01:13:16,323 --> 01:13:18,393
- Wet it. You need to wet it. - Okay.

2952
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:19,138
(Sad)

2953
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:20,523
Now, your item will be attached to you.

2954
01:13:20,523 --> 01:13:23,033
We'll get everything set up.

2955
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:24,233
You need to wet it.

2956
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,803
- Right now... - Se Chan, give us a sock.

2957
01:13:25,803 --> 01:13:27,303
- I'll do that. - Durian.

2958
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:28,833
Seriously, on the spot...

2959
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:32,148
(Se Chan's socks get extracted.)

2960
01:13:29,503 --> 01:13:30,933
- It's the worst. - Do you want both or one?

2961
01:13:32,603 --> 01:13:33,903
Gosh, this is...

2962
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:33,948
(Giggling)

2963
01:13:34,773 --> 01:13:36,573
Why did you grimace on your way here?

2964
01:13:37,843 --> 01:13:39,013
Will he take them off now?

2965
01:13:38,488 --> 01:13:41,118
(Hoon becomes anxious.)

2966
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:42,913
- Se Chan, your socks are wet. - What?

2967
01:13:42,913 --> 01:13:44,283
- These are new. - Are these new?

2968
01:13:43,528 --> 01:13:45,188
(This is a new sock.)

2969
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:46,223
- I gave them my wet socks. - This is no joke.

2970
01:13:47,683 --> 01:13:49,623
- Do they smell a lot? - No.

2971
01:13:48,128 --> 01:13:51,368
(While special items are being created)

2972
01:13:49,623 --> 01:13:50,823
Se Chan's socks.

2973
01:13:50,823 --> 01:13:52,263
Se Chan's socks are the worst.

2974
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:53,363
Gosh, it smells.

2975
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:55,268
(Putting on normal items)

2976
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:54,823
- Gosh. - The smell is no joke.

2977
01:13:55,323 --> 01:13:56,563
This...

2978
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:57,908
(Onions and garlic)

2979
01:13:56,563 --> 01:13:58,233
This is no joke.

2980
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,063
- It's so intense. - Skate.

2981
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:04,208
(Fermented skate)

2982
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,763
- Gosh, this is... - I bet skate smells really bad.

2983
01:14:01,863 --> 01:14:03,403
- Skate. - Cheese smells good, right?

2984
01:14:03,503 --> 01:14:05,033
No, cheese smells bad.

2985
01:14:05,473 --> 01:14:06,943
The smell is insane.

2986
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:10,288
(Aged cheese)

2987
01:14:08,303 --> 01:14:09,713
- Gosh, it smells. - I thought cheese would smell good.

2988
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:10,873
The smell is no joke.

2989
01:14:10,873 --> 01:14:11,913
My goodness.

2990
01:14:11,888 --> 01:14:16,088
(Durian)

2991
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:14,883
Gosh, this is...

2992
01:14:15,653 --> 01:14:17,583
- Look at Hoon. - Gosh, it touched me.

2993
01:14:16,088 --> 01:14:18,758
(Jong Kook)

2994
01:14:17,813 --> 01:14:18,883
Gosh.

2995
01:14:19,528 --> 01:14:21,998
(Crying)

2996
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:21,753
It touched me.

2997
01:14:21,983 --> 01:14:24,553
- This cheese smells so bad. - It smells.

2998
01:14:22,668 --> 01:14:23,728
(Seok Jin)

2999
01:14:23,728 --> 01:14:25,698
(They put on the ready-made items...)

3000
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:27,293
- Cheonggukjang began to stink. - It's the worst.

3001
01:14:25,698 --> 01:14:27,638
(including Seok Sam with cheonggukjang.)

3002
01:14:27,693 --> 01:14:30,593
- It's the worst. - Cheonggukjang is better.

3003
01:14:27,698 --> 01:14:30,608
(The made-to-order item appears.)

3004
01:14:30,993 --> 01:14:33,333
- Gosh, onions are no joke. - Cheonggukjang smells good, right?

3005
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:34,663
Look at Hoon.

3006
01:14:33,638 --> 01:14:35,778
(He bravely smells it.)

3007
01:14:34,663 --> 01:14:35,703
Gosh, it touched me.

3008
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:40,373
Se Chan, it smells horrible.

3009
01:14:40,473 --> 01:14:41,843
What's this smell?

3010
01:14:40,718 --> 01:14:42,848
(It's an unfamiliar smell.)

3011
01:14:42,888 --> 01:14:46,988
(It smells like sewage.)

3012
01:14:45,913 --> 01:14:47,183
It smells.

3013
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:50,883
That's better. Hoon, socks are better.

3014
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:51,558
(Compared to cheese)

3015
01:14:50,883 --> 01:14:52,623
This is... I mean...

3016
01:14:52,558 --> 01:14:55,128
(Maybe not?)

3017
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:54,883
Why does this smell like it came from the depths?

3018
01:14:54,883 --> 01:14:56,753
- Hey, it's okay. - It's a bit...

3019
01:14:56,598 --> 01:14:58,628
(It's okay.)

3020
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:58,123
It's a human smell.

3021
01:14:59,063 --> 01:15:01,523
Please decide on the order.

3022
01:14:59,698 --> 01:15:02,568
(It's time to decide the order.)

3023
01:15:01,523 --> 01:15:04,133
The first runners will be from the women's division.

3024
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,803
The 1st and 2nd runners will run half a circuit...

3025
01:15:05,803 --> 01:15:07,703
and the last runners will run a full circuit.

3026
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,533
- Really? - Jong Kook, go last.

3027
01:15:09,533 --> 01:15:11,003
- Daniel should go last. - Then...

3028
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:12,303
- Right. It'll be the ending. - Okay.

3029
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:13,403
I'm tearing up.

3030
01:15:13,403 --> 01:15:15,173
Ye Eun, let's show them.

3031
01:15:13,678 --> 01:15:15,748
(Ji Hyo: Cheese, Seok Soon: Cheonggukjang,)

3032
01:15:15,173 --> 01:15:17,273
- Okay. I want to do that. - Let's do this.

3033
01:15:15,748 --> 01:15:17,488
(Ye Eun: Cheese)

3034
01:15:17,273 --> 01:15:18,543
People can't run fast anyway.

3035
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:19,858
(The tennis balls act as batons.)

3036
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:19,643
- Good luck. - Good luck.

3037
01:15:19,643 --> 01:15:21,313
- Ji Hyo, good luck. - Good luck.

3038
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:22,828
(The last chance to win the votes.)

3039
01:15:21,443 --> 01:15:22,613
Get ready.

3040
01:15:23,513 --> 01:15:24,613
Good luck.

3041
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:26,398
(They set off.)

3042
01:15:25,613 --> 01:15:26,723
Good luck.

3043
01:15:27,053 --> 01:15:28,583
The ball isn't falling.

3044
01:15:27,698 --> 01:15:30,368
(Jee Seok Soon, the cheonggukjang lady gets ahead.)

3045
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:29,853
Seok Jin, let's go.

3046
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:32,363
Gosh, it stinks.

3047
01:15:32,468 --> 01:15:34,698
(They begin to go over the hurdles.)

3048
01:15:33,423 --> 01:15:35,163
That's... My goodness.

3049
01:15:35,693 --> 01:15:36,863
The smell is so...

3050
01:15:36,993 --> 01:15:38,363
- It dropped! - It dropped.

3051
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:39,733
The smell is so...

3052
01:15:39,308 --> 01:15:41,308
(Seok Sam drops the baton.)

3053
01:15:39,733 --> 01:15:41,203
- It touched my nose! - It dropped!

3054
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,903
It touched my nose.

3055
01:15:42,508 --> 01:15:44,708
(The cheese girls advance.)

3056
01:15:45,233 --> 01:15:46,573
Gosh, my nose!

3057
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,513
Gosh, my nose!

3058
01:15:48,318 --> 01:15:52,658
(As they run, they get the moldy smell of cheese.)

3059
01:15:49,513 --> 01:15:50,743
It smells.

3060
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:53,813
- It smells. - I thought cheese would smell good.

3061
01:15:53,813 --> 01:15:55,143
The smell is so strong.

3062
01:15:55,613 --> 01:15:57,013
- It's the women's division. - My ball is there, right?

3063
01:15:55,888 --> 01:15:57,658
(The cheese girls...)

3064
01:15:57,013 --> 01:15:59,223
Gosh, my nose! It keeps touching my nose!

3065
01:15:57,658 --> 01:15:59,428
(arrive at the scooter zone first.)

3066
01:16:02,353 --> 01:16:03,793
Hurry up, Ye Eun!

3067
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:05,923
- Seok Jin, what are you doing? - Seok Jin is last.

3068
01:16:05,923 --> 01:16:07,223
For goodness' sake.

3069
01:16:07,223 --> 01:16:08,893
- Seok Jin, hurry up. - His ball fell.

3070
01:16:08,368 --> 01:16:10,408
(Dropping the ball again)

3071
01:16:08,893 --> 01:16:10,293
For goodness' sake.

3072
01:16:10,293 --> 01:16:11,533
Why does it keep falling?

3073
01:16:12,093 --> 01:16:15,203
I'll beat women with my speed.

3074
01:16:13,078 --> 01:16:15,678
(His confident remark was in vain.)

3075
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,373
It smells.

3076
01:16:15,778 --> 01:16:18,648
(He's getting defeated.)

3077
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,043
Seok Jin!

3078
01:16:19,043 --> 01:16:20,443
- Hurry up, Ye Eun! - My nose!

3079
01:16:20,518 --> 01:16:23,688
(The leading runners enter the balloon course.)

3080
01:16:23,513 --> 01:16:25,243
Pop them with your feet.

3081
01:16:25,243 --> 01:16:27,713
- What? - The ball keeps falling.

3082
01:16:26,818 --> 01:16:29,428
(The old raccoon joins them belatedly.)

3083
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:29,453
Seok Jin!

3084
01:16:30,013 --> 01:16:32,583
- That's it. Hurry up. - One balloon remains.

3085
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:33,583
Did I leave one behind?

3086
01:16:32,598 --> 01:16:35,768
(Right then, Ji Hyo forgets the balloon.)

3087
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:35,923
Ji Hyo, you were doing so well.

3088
01:16:36,528 --> 01:16:39,238
(Team Leader Ji advances in the meantime.)

3089
01:16:36,823 --> 01:16:39,063
Ye Eun, you're doing well.

3090
01:16:39,063 --> 01:16:41,623
- Ye Eun is good. - You're good.

3091
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:44,133
- Is Ye Eun in 1st place? - Is Ye Eun in 1st place?

3092
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:45,508
(Same team)

3093
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:45,493
It makes no sense.

3094
01:16:45,493 --> 01:16:48,103
- Hurry up. - Come this way.

3095
01:16:45,508 --> 01:16:49,378
(Se Chan: Durian, Haha: Skate, Jae Seok: Onions and garlic)

3096
01:16:49,408 --> 01:16:51,908
(She passes the ball.)

3097
01:16:49,503 --> 01:16:51,303
Transfer it from above.

3098
01:16:51,303 --> 01:16:53,303
- From above. - From above.

3099
01:16:53,573 --> 01:16:55,373
- From above. - Start over, Ye Eun.

3100
01:16:54,248 --> 01:16:55,518
(They dropped it!)

3101
01:16:55,578 --> 01:16:59,188
(Seok Soon and Ji Hyo caught up in no time.)

3102
01:16:56,013 --> 01:16:57,143
- Again. - My ball is here, right?

3103
01:16:57,143 --> 01:16:58,973
- Yes. - Run faster. It's okay.

3104
01:16:58,973 --> 01:17:00,143
- Here. - Hold on.

3105
01:17:00,143 --> 01:17:01,513
- Okay. Run fast. - Do it.

3106
01:17:01,513 --> 01:17:02,753
Do it.

3107
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:04,188
(Ye Eun tries docking once more.)

3108
01:17:03,913 --> 01:17:05,513
Is it in my basin?

3109
01:17:06,023 --> 01:17:08,423
- Is it in my basin? - It's in your basin, producer.

3110
01:17:08,623 --> 01:17:10,393
- It's in your basin, producer. - Is it in my basin?

3111
01:17:10,723 --> 01:17:11,953
Go.

3112
01:17:10,868 --> 01:17:13,468
(The onions and garlic rider sets off first!)

3113
01:17:12,893 --> 01:17:14,193
It smells so much.

3114
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:18,363
- It's in the basin. Go. - It's in the basin. Go.

3115
01:17:16,568 --> 01:17:18,808
(The two teams succeeded right away.)

3116
01:17:18,808 --> 01:17:20,938
(They start chasing right away.)

3117
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:20,563
It stinks.

3118
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,003
It stinks.

3119
01:17:23,378 --> 01:17:25,348
(Durian)

3120
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:27,003
It stinks.

3121
01:17:26,218 --> 01:17:27,948
(Skate)

3122
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:32,618
(Jae Seok enters the hurdle course first.)

3123
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:32,913
That's good.

3124
01:17:32,913 --> 01:17:34,843
It stinks.

3125
01:17:36,488 --> 01:17:38,928
(Jae Seok dropped the ball.)

3126
01:17:36,913 --> 01:17:38,913
- Jae Seok, it fell. - His ball fell.

3127
01:17:38,913 --> 01:17:40,523
- Jae Seok, it fell. - Jae Seok, go back.

3128
01:17:40,298 --> 01:17:43,198
(He goes back to the spot where he dropped it.)

3129
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:47,338
(He drops it again!)

3130
01:17:47,493 --> 01:17:48,793
Jae Seok, it fell.

3131
01:17:48,468 --> 01:17:51,238
(While Jae Seok is being clumsy)

3132
01:17:49,863 --> 01:17:51,033
You have the ball, right?

3133
01:17:51,368 --> 01:17:53,478
(Haha advances with skate.)

3134
01:17:51,893 --> 01:17:53,063
Haha, go.

3135
01:17:53,063 --> 01:17:54,133
It smells so bad.

3136
01:17:53,478 --> 01:17:55,438
(Retching)

3137
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:58,708
(Durian Boy is in 2nd place!)

3138
01:17:58,003 --> 01:18:00,873
- The smell is no joke. - He's throwing up.

3139
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:04,318
(Haha enters the balloon course.)

3140
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:09,228
(Right then)

3141
01:18:08,013 --> 01:18:09,213
Jae Seok!

3142
01:18:09,513 --> 01:18:11,013
Jae Seok!

3143
01:18:09,988 --> 01:18:12,958
(Workout Grasshopper uses the outer lane to get ahead.)

3144
01:18:11,913 --> 01:18:13,823
Se Chan, hurry up.

3145
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:16,428
(The gap is narrowed!)

3146
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:15,893
Good.

3147
01:18:16,553 --> 01:18:17,893
Haha, it fell.

3148
01:18:17,928 --> 01:18:20,238
(Haha even dropped the ball.)

3149
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:19,763
Haha, your ball fell.

3150
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:22,663
- Get ahead. - Good.

3151
01:18:21,338 --> 01:18:22,938
(He doesn't know that he dropped the ball.)

3152
01:18:22,893 --> 01:18:24,793
- Haha, your ball fell. - Haha! Your ball!

3153
01:18:24,793 --> 01:18:25,933
Haha! Your ball!

3154
01:18:25,933 --> 01:18:27,063
Where is it?

3155
01:18:27,908 --> 01:18:30,048
(While Haha picks up the ball,)

3156
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:31,103
Jae Seok!

3157
01:18:30,048 --> 01:18:32,408
(the rankings change.)

3158
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,403
- Se Chan. - Jong Kook, go.

3159
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:35,178
(The last baton pass.)

3160
01:18:33,403 --> 01:18:35,173
- Is it inside? - The last runners run...

3161
01:18:35,173 --> 01:18:36,913
- a full circuit. - Daniel, go.

3162
01:18:35,278 --> 01:18:41,318
(Hoon: Se Chan's socks, Jong Kook: Durian, Daniel: Skate)

3163
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,713
Go, Hoon.

3164
01:18:39,913 --> 01:18:41,513
- Jong Kook. - Gosh.

3165
01:18:41,558 --> 01:18:46,058
(The last runners need to run a full circuit.)

3166
01:18:43,413 --> 01:18:44,453
Daniel!

3167
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,823
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

3168
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:49,753
Hey, it keeps touching my face.

3169
01:18:50,823 --> 01:18:52,093
Hoon, show us.

3170
01:18:52,198 --> 01:18:55,368
(Despite the heavy burden, the last runners look happy.)

3171
01:18:52,453 --> 01:18:53,963
Hoon, you're doing well.

3172
01:18:54,993 --> 01:18:56,833
- Jong Kook! - What?

3173
01:18:57,263 --> 01:18:58,363
Gosh.

3174
01:18:58,338 --> 01:19:01,078
(He even enjoys a durian mask.)

3175
01:18:58,763 --> 01:19:00,063
It keeps touching my face.

3176
01:19:02,608 --> 01:19:04,778
(At that moment, Jong Kook drops the ball.)

3177
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:05,303
It fell.

3178
01:19:05,303 --> 01:19:07,043
- Haha's ball fell. - Hoon, come on.

3179
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:08,203
I'm here.

3180
01:19:08,303 --> 01:19:10,643
What? I thought he was Haha.

3181
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,683
Let's go, Hoon. That's good.

3182
01:19:11,888 --> 01:19:13,688
(Meanwhile, Se Chan's socks and durian...)

3183
01:19:12,683 --> 01:19:13,943
Hoon, you're doing well.

3184
01:19:13,688 --> 01:19:15,488
(are fighting for the 1st place.)

3185
01:19:13,943 --> 01:19:15,413
Daniel.

3186
01:19:15,413 --> 01:19:17,153
Hold on. The hurdles are too high.

3187
01:19:19,723 --> 01:19:22,153
- Jong Kook, that's good. - Okay.

3188
01:19:22,153 --> 01:19:23,393
Keep going.

3189
01:19:22,898 --> 01:19:25,498
(There's a bit of distance between them.)

3190
01:19:24,423 --> 01:19:25,493
All right.

3191
01:19:26,193 --> 01:19:27,393
Good.

3192
01:19:26,398 --> 01:19:29,438
(Maintaining 1st place even with the mask)

3193
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,163
Jong Kook is in first place.

3194
01:19:29,163 --> 01:19:30,463
- Let's go. - Kim Jong Kook.

3195
01:19:29,608 --> 01:19:33,108
(They'll be the winners if they cross the finish line.)

3196
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:32,703
- Jong Kook, hurry up. - What's Daniel doing?

3197
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:34,163
Jong Kook, hurry up.

3198
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,333
He's right behind you.

3199
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:38,233
He's right behind you.

3200
01:19:37,378 --> 01:19:40,318
(Mr. Se Chan's sock is chasing after him.)

3201
01:19:39,343 --> 01:19:40,773
Jong Kook.

3202
01:19:40,773 --> 01:19:42,743
- Let's go, Hoon. That's good. - That's good.

3203
01:19:42,743 --> 01:19:44,313
- Pop them. - Jong Kook.

3204
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:46,083
- Let's go, Hoon. That's good. - That's good.

3205
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:48,013
- Pop them. - Jong Kook.

3206
01:19:46,418 --> 01:19:48,558
(The man with young blood catches up quickly!)

3207
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:50,128
(Will Hoon catch up?)

3208
01:19:48,843 --> 01:19:50,853
- Behind you. - Hoon, you're doing well.

3209
01:19:50,128 --> 01:19:51,888
(Will Jong Kook get caught up?)

3210
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:51,883
- Okay. - Let's go.

3211
01:19:51,883 --> 01:19:53,023
Okay.

3212
01:19:51,928 --> 01:19:53,698
(Who is the final winner?)

3213
01:19:53,023 --> 01:19:54,553
- Daniel, what are you doing? - He's slow.

3214
01:19:54,553 --> 01:19:56,223
Jong Kook is in first place.

3215
01:19:54,558 --> 01:19:57,328
(Kim Jong Kook)

3216
01:19:56,223 --> 01:19:58,293
- First place. - For goodness' sake.

3217
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,863
It keeps touching my face!

3218
01:19:58,598 --> 01:20:00,368
(Complaining)

3219
01:20:00,398 --> 01:20:03,438
(Tenacious Durian Kim won 1st place in this state.)

3220
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:03,433
- It got on your face. - So much got on my face.

3221
01:20:03,863 --> 01:20:05,633
- Okay. - Durian.

3222
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:09,038
(Hoon, who suffered with Se Chan's socks, wins 2nd place.)

3223
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:07,333
Okay. Second place.

3224
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,403
- Be careful. They'll fall. - Hoon, I'm sorry.

3225
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:10,908
(And..)

3226
01:20:09,403 --> 01:20:10,433
Hold on.

3227
01:20:10,433 --> 01:20:13,043
- What's Daniel doing? - Daniel, do what you want.

3228
01:20:13,418 --> 01:20:16,718
(Daniel is fighting a battle on his own.)

3229
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,543
I can't believe him.

3230
01:20:15,543 --> 01:20:17,113
He's still like that.

3231
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:18,473
All right. Do what you want.

3232
01:20:18,473 --> 01:20:19,843
He's like Mr. Bean.

3233
01:20:19,843 --> 01:20:21,783
- I wanted to win. - Seriously.

3234
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:23,688
(Still, he manages to finish the race.)

3235
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,413
Seriously.

3236
01:20:23,413 --> 01:20:25,453
- Seriously. - He's terribly bad at it.

3237
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:28,923
- I wanted you to look cool. - He can get the penalty.

3238
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:30,868
(Flimsy finished the race last until the end.)

3239
01:20:28,923 --> 01:20:31,653
If you lie down like that, skate will touch your face.

3240
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:33,698
(With Daniel's skate facewash)

3241
01:20:32,223 --> 01:20:34,393
The last mission is over.

3242
01:20:33,698 --> 01:20:35,368
(The race ends.)

3243
01:20:34,393 --> 01:20:35,993
For the last mission,

3244
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:38,333
first place will get five votes.

3245
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:41,178
(The leader of the 1st-place team, Ye Eun, gets 5 votes.)

3246
01:20:39,563 --> 01:20:40,733
I won't get a single vote.

3247
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:43,203
- Second place will get three votes. - I'm sorry.

3248
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:44,278
(Kang Hoon in 2nd place gets 3 votes.)

3249
01:20:43,703 --> 01:20:46,203
- Last place will get one vote. - One vote?

3250
01:20:44,478 --> 01:20:47,648
(Daniel in last place gets 1 vote.)

3251
01:20:46,203 --> 01:20:47,203
That's mine.

3252
01:20:47,203 --> 01:20:48,903
You'll now vote for the problematic member.

3253
01:20:47,748 --> 01:20:50,218
(Explaining the rules again before the final vote)

3254
01:20:48,903 --> 01:20:50,643
The youngest one who gets chosen as the final problematic member...

3255
01:20:50,643 --> 01:20:52,013
will get a penalty.

3256
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:54,318
(1st place, penalty)

3257
01:20:52,343 --> 01:20:55,043
The top two members who gave him or her...

3258
01:20:54,388 --> 01:20:58,388
(Top 2 members who gave the most votes will get a prize.)

3259
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:57,153
the most votes will get a prize.

3260
01:20:58,513 --> 01:21:00,253
What happens if they use a reflection ticket?

3261
01:21:00,683 --> 01:21:02,283
If the first place uses a reflection ticket,

3262
01:21:02,283 --> 01:21:04,553
everyone who voted for him or her will get a penalty.

3263
01:21:03,128 --> 01:21:04,428
(Reflection ticket, 1st place)

3264
01:21:04,428 --> 01:21:06,898
(Everyone gets the penalty.)

3265
01:21:04,923 --> 01:21:06,923
- It's only for the first place. - If you use...

3266
01:21:06,923 --> 01:21:08,563
a reflection ticket when you haven't placed first,

3267
01:21:07,638 --> 01:21:09,708
(Reflection ticket, 2nd place, reflection ticket, 3rd place)

3268
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,993
- you'll get a penalty. - Yes.

3269
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:11,238
(Penalty)

3270
01:21:09,993 --> 01:21:11,133
If you use it...

3271
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:12,733
without placing first, you'll make a fool out of yourself.

3272
01:21:11,238 --> 01:21:13,578
(But if they use the ticket wrong, they could be affected.)

3273
01:21:12,963 --> 01:21:16,103
Distribute the last votes.

3274
01:21:14,308 --> 01:21:17,348
(Time to distribute the votes they just got)

3275
01:21:16,533 --> 01:21:17,733
- Hey. - How many votes do you have?

3276
01:21:17,733 --> 01:21:20,003
I have one. It's what I had from the start.

3277
01:21:20,003 --> 01:21:21,303
- What should I do? - Give it to me.

3278
01:21:20,648 --> 01:21:23,118
(He has 6 tickets.)

3279
01:21:21,303 --> 01:21:22,373
How many votes do you have?

3280
01:21:23,173 --> 01:21:25,543
I won't vote for you. I'll vote for Hoon.

3281
01:21:26,683 --> 01:21:28,713
- Seok Jin, here you go. - I bought coffee for everyone.

3282
01:21:28,288 --> 01:21:31,758
(Daniel gives 1 to Seok Sam.)

3283
01:21:28,713 --> 01:21:29,753
Okay. I won't vote for you.

3284
01:21:29,753 --> 01:21:31,553
- I'll vote for Hoon. - All right.

3285
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:33,723
You need to vote for the problematic member.

3286
01:21:31,758 --> 01:21:34,398
(Not me)

3287
01:21:34,683 --> 01:21:36,323
- You won't vote for me, right? - Seriously.

3288
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:39,768
(Ye Eun gives 2 each to Jae Seok and Jong Kook.)

3289
01:21:36,323 --> 01:21:37,753
- I won't vote for you. - I won't vote for you.

3290
01:21:37,753 --> 01:21:39,123
- This is... - Why would I vote for you...

3291
01:21:39,123 --> 01:21:40,493
when I'd continue seeing you?

3292
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:42,808
(Who will get the last vote?)

3293
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:44,133
Does everyone have a reflection ticket?

3294
01:21:44,563 --> 01:21:46,303
- I'll give it to you. - Thanks.

3295
01:21:46,303 --> 01:21:47,903
- Be serious. - I won't vote for you.

3296
01:21:46,878 --> 01:21:50,108
(Giving it to Se Chan who has a lot of votes)

3297
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,673
- I'll give it to you. Be loyal. - Okay. I won't vote for you.

3298
01:21:49,673 --> 01:21:51,933
Of course. Hey, we both had a thyroid problem.

3299
01:21:50,808 --> 01:21:53,578
(Feeling the same struggle with the thyroid issue)

3300
01:21:52,473 --> 01:21:53,743
A thyroid problem.

3301
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:54,743
- Thyroid. - Problem.

3302
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,773
Cross!

3303
01:21:55,773 --> 01:21:57,113
- I won't vote for you. - I won't vote for anyone...

3304
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:58,173
who gives me a vote.

3305
01:21:58,173 --> 01:21:59,583
Let's see who gives me a vote.

3306
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:01,843
Currently, I'm thinking about voting for Hoon.

3307
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,413
It's okay because he only has one vote.

3308
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:04,528
(He means Seok Jin.)

3309
01:22:03,413 --> 01:22:04,453
Currently, I'm thinking about voting for Hoon.

3310
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:06,353
If Hoon gives me a vote. I won't do that.

3311
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:08,928
(Who will Hoon give his 3 votes to?)

3312
01:22:06,823 --> 01:22:08,823
- Seok Jin, it's... - Ji Hyo.

3313
01:22:08,928 --> 01:22:10,198
(Whispering)

3314
01:22:08,953 --> 01:22:10,153
Ji Hyo.

3315
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:11,623
Really? Okay.

3316
01:22:11,728 --> 01:22:15,368
(He invests all 3 votes on Ji Hyo.)

3317
01:22:12,323 --> 01:22:13,563
Okay.

3318
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:14,923
Did you give out the votes?

3319
01:22:14,923 --> 01:22:16,833
You were having a meeting.

3320
01:22:15,438 --> 01:22:19,008
(Passing on Scammer Ha, trusting loyal Ji Hyo)

3321
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:18,593
- I gave them to Ji Hyo. - All of them?

3322
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:19,603
Yes.

3323
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:20,903
Okay.

3324
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,273
Then I won't need to rack my brain.

3325
01:22:23,403 --> 01:22:26,903
The number of votes you have is...

3326
01:22:23,648 --> 01:22:26,878
(Revealing the total number of votes)

3327
01:22:26,978 --> 01:22:32,218
(1 vote is given to everyone.)

3328
01:22:27,403 --> 01:22:29,643
- I have five. - He has a lot.

3329
01:22:29,813 --> 01:22:31,213
- I have six. - Six.

3330
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:32,213
I also have six.

3331
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,413
- I also have six. - Six.

3332
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:34,018
(Number of votes)

3333
01:22:33,413 --> 01:22:35,383
I have the original one vote.

3334
01:22:34,018 --> 01:22:35,958
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Jong Kook: 7)

3335
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,913
- The original 1 vote. - I have 1.

3336
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:39,628
(Se Chan: 6, Seok Jin: 2, Haha: 1)

3337
01:22:37,713 --> 01:22:39,313
- There are three options. - I think...

3338
01:22:39,313 --> 01:22:42,023
we should rack our brains together.

3339
01:22:42,183 --> 01:22:43,323
I don't think they'll vote for you.

3340
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:45,998
(The voters and the problematic youngest discuss separately.)

3341
01:22:43,323 --> 01:22:45,293
Haha's vote and my vote are meaningless.

3342
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:47,623
It'll be me or Ye Eun.

3343
01:22:47,623 --> 01:22:48,893
I think they'll vote for me.

3344
01:22:49,023 --> 01:22:50,133
- No. - I think they'll vote for me.

3345
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:51,993
It's Daniel's last shoot.

3346
01:22:51,993 --> 01:22:53,863
- No. - No, they'll vote for me.

3347
01:22:53,863 --> 01:22:55,263
They'll twist it once more.

3348
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:56,873
Please tell us...

3349
01:22:56,873 --> 01:22:58,103
if you're going to use a reflection ticket.

3350
01:22:58,103 --> 01:22:59,473
I'm going to use a reflection ticket no matter what.

3351
01:22:59,473 --> 01:23:00,673
- I'll definitely use it. - I'll definitely use it.

3352
01:23:00,673 --> 01:23:02,143
I'll just hand in my reflection ticket.

3353
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,913
- I'll definitely use it. - Vote for me.

3354
01:23:03,218 --> 01:23:06,788
(The youngest members threaten them.)

3355
01:23:03,913 --> 01:23:04,943
- I'll just hand it in. - Really?

3356
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:06,243
- Vote for me. - Really?

3357
01:23:06,243 --> 01:23:07,243
Okay.

3358
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:08,913
- Okay. It looks like... - I'll get the penalty.

3359
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:11,758
(Rule for the problematic youngest)

3360
01:23:08,913 --> 01:23:10,353
- everyone will get a penalty... - I'll use it.

3361
01:23:10,353 --> 01:23:12,383
- due to the reflection tickets. - I won't use it.

3362
01:23:11,758 --> 01:23:14,128
(If they use reflection tickets when they're not voted,)

3363
01:23:12,713 --> 01:23:14,283
- Everyone except for one... - I won't use it.

3364
01:23:14,128 --> 01:23:16,598
(they get the penalty.)

3365
01:23:14,283 --> 01:23:16,153
will receive the penalty.

3366
01:23:16,553 --> 01:23:18,493
- It's confusing. - I'll go with my hunch.

3367
01:23:16,628 --> 01:23:19,128
(Rule for the voters)

3368
01:23:18,723 --> 01:23:20,663
- Listen. - I'll vote for the one I want.

3369
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:22,338
(The 1st and 2nd placers who used the most votes get the prize.)

3370
01:23:20,923 --> 01:23:22,163
- We don't have many votes. - Right.

3371
01:23:22,323 --> 01:23:23,363
We don't have many votes.

3372
01:23:22,338 --> 01:23:26,508
(If they get the reflection ticket, they get the penalty.)

3373
01:23:23,363 --> 01:23:24,493
- Just write a name. - Okay.

3374
01:23:24,493 --> 01:23:25,993
- We'll go 1st. - I'll go 1st.

3375
01:23:25,993 --> 01:23:27,633
- You can go now. - I'll go with him.

3376
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:29,278
(They begin the final vote.)

3377
01:23:27,733 --> 01:23:29,033
My vote is meaningless.

3378
01:23:29,203 --> 01:23:30,973
I can't eat chilled cucumber soup.

3379
01:23:29,648 --> 01:23:31,548
(First candidate)

3380
01:23:31,503 --> 01:23:33,373
- Why can't you eat it? - I really can't eat it.

3381
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,648
(Picky with his lines, picky with his food!)

3382
01:23:33,373 --> 01:23:36,343
- Go on. - Don't be picky with your food.

3383
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:36,688
(Flimsy Daniel who takes a lot of care)

3384
01:23:36,343 --> 01:23:38,213
- What are you talking about? - It's okay.

3385
01:23:37,188 --> 01:23:39,918
(Second candidate)

3386
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:39,913
You should stay here for a longer time.

3387
01:23:39,913 --> 01:23:41,943
- Right. - You need to be more self-aware.

3388
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:42,828
(An expert at messing with the older guys)

3389
01:23:41,943 --> 01:23:43,313
But I didn't say I was famous.

3390
01:23:42,828 --> 01:23:45,758
(The retorter who talks back)

3391
01:23:43,313 --> 01:23:45,653
- You mean, we're famous? - Yes. You're famous.

3392
01:23:45,713 --> 01:23:48,353
Why are you doing that? I think I might cry.

3393
01:23:46,128 --> 01:23:48,298
(Last candidate)

3394
01:23:48,298 --> 01:23:53,238
(Crybaby Ye Eun, the queen of tears)

3395
01:23:48,353 --> 01:23:49,893
- Really? - This...

3396
01:23:49,893 --> 01:23:53,263
- Why are you crying? - Why are you crying?

3397
01:23:53,463 --> 01:23:56,993
- It's not... - I don't know who to vote for.

3398
01:23:53,498 --> 01:23:55,398
(Candidates for golden problem child:)

3399
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,238
(Flimsy, Retorter, Crybaby)

3400
01:23:57,668 --> 01:24:04,478
(Seok Sam: 2 votes)

3401
01:23:58,893 --> 01:24:01,103
I'll just...

3402
01:24:01,663 --> 01:24:04,333
It's stressful to think hard.

3403
01:24:04,673 --> 01:24:06,073
So, whether he uses the reflection ticket or not...

3404
01:24:05,078 --> 01:24:07,518
(Kang Hoon)

3405
01:24:07,518 --> 01:24:10,818
(He uses his 2 votes on Kang Hoon.)

3406
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:08,673
Kang Hoon.

3407
01:24:10,873 --> 01:24:12,043
Two votes for Kang Hoon.

3408
01:24:12,043 --> 01:24:13,243
Why did you write his name?

3409
01:24:13,713 --> 01:24:17,283
The second time we received the votes, he didn't give me one.

3410
01:24:17,483 --> 01:24:19,383
I started holding a bit of a grudge then.

3411
01:24:19,498 --> 01:24:23,128
(Haha: 1 vote)

3412
01:24:19,553 --> 01:24:21,153
It's Daniel's last day.

3413
01:24:21,553 --> 01:24:24,553
I don't care if Daniel gets the penalty.

3414
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:26,338
(Giving his vote to Daniel)

3415
01:24:24,553 --> 01:24:27,693
I wanted to let him end it with a good memory.

3416
01:24:27,838 --> 01:24:31,808
(The voters with mere votes are done voting.)

3417
01:24:27,893 --> 01:24:29,693
I wrote Daniel's name.

3418
01:24:29,693 --> 01:24:31,333
It's only one vote, anyway.

3419
01:24:31,838 --> 01:24:37,278
(Jong Kook: 7 votes)

3420
01:24:32,493 --> 01:24:35,163
It would be stupid to write all their names.

3421
01:24:35,163 --> 01:24:37,173
I think they're definitely going to use the reflection ticket.

3422
01:24:37,278 --> 01:24:39,308
(Voting for multiple people increases the chances...)

3423
01:24:39,308 --> 01:24:41,348
(of getting hit by the reflection ticket.)

3424
01:24:39,473 --> 01:24:41,843
I don't think many people will write Ye Eun's name.

3425
01:24:41,518 --> 01:24:47,058
(Jong Kook wants to focus his votes on one person.)

3426
01:24:42,403 --> 01:24:45,243
Honestly, I think Niel will get the most votes.

3427
01:24:46,683 --> 01:24:47,783
Goodness.

3428
01:24:47,118 --> 01:24:50,128
(What will he do?)

3429
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:51,513
Should I write Hoon? Niel...

3430
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:52,653
Let's go with Kang Hoon.

3431
01:24:53,383 --> 01:24:55,183
He'll get many votes.

3432
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:56,668
(Jong Kook will focus his votes on Hoon.)

3433
01:24:56,668 --> 01:25:01,668
(Jae Seok: 7 votes)

3434
01:24:56,993 --> 01:24:59,353
Hold on. This is...

3435
01:25:01,738 --> 01:25:03,868
(Jae Seok casts his first vote for Hoon.)

3436
01:25:07,178 --> 01:25:12,248
(Jae Seok with 7 votes also focuses his votes on Hoon!)

3437
01:25:07,633 --> 01:25:10,073
This should work. Let me leave it to fate.

3438
01:25:11,173 --> 01:25:12,333
Leave it to fate.

3439
01:25:14,373 --> 01:25:15,773
There's no way it would be me.

3440
01:25:16,388 --> 01:25:21,918
(Se Chan: 6 votes)

3441
01:25:16,513 --> 01:25:19,243
If I distribute the votes,

3442
01:25:19,443 --> 01:25:20,683
there'd be a high chance I'd get hit.

3443
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:22,813
They have the reflection tickets.

3444
01:25:22,058 --> 01:25:23,988
(It looks like Se Chan with 6 votes will also give all his votes...)

3445
01:25:23,553 --> 01:25:26,153
It would be better to focus the votes on one person.

3446
01:25:23,988 --> 01:25:25,758
(to one person.)

3447
01:25:27,328 --> 01:25:30,398
(Daniel)

3448
01:25:30,428 --> 01:25:34,368
(Ji Hyo: 7 votes)

3449
01:25:34,368 --> 01:25:37,208
(Ji Hyo with 7 votes also writes Daniel!)

3450
01:25:37,963 --> 01:25:40,663
Since I have seven votes... This is so hard.

3451
01:25:39,678 --> 01:25:41,808
(She writes Daniel again!)

3452
01:25:41,838 --> 01:25:43,678
(Most of the votes went to Hoon and Niel.)

3453
01:25:43,173 --> 01:25:45,573
I thought hard about this. Seriously.

3454
01:25:43,678 --> 01:25:47,178
(Who will get voted?)

3455
01:25:46,003 --> 01:25:48,643
- Now, the problematic members... - Yes.

3456
01:25:47,218 --> 01:25:50,018
(The voting ended.)

3457
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:52,773
will decide whether they'll use the reflection ticket and gather.

3458
01:25:50,048 --> 01:25:51,888
(It's time for the younger members to decide...)

3459
01:25:51,888 --> 01:25:53,758
(whether they'll use reflection tickets or not.)

3460
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:55,113
- Are you going to use it? - I don't know.

3461
01:25:55,888 --> 01:25:58,758
(Ye Eun, who wasn't elected,)

3462
01:25:56,043 --> 01:25:57,283
I think Kang Hoon is in the most danger.

3463
01:25:57,283 --> 01:25:59,053
- I'll leave it to chance. - That's my final deduction.

3464
01:25:58,758 --> 01:26:01,598
(shouldn't use the reflection ticket.)

3465
01:25:59,053 --> 01:26:00,753
- That's my final deduction. - Goodness.

3466
01:26:02,553 --> 01:26:04,823
I won't use it.

3467
01:26:04,828 --> 01:26:09,608
(Ye Eun is surprisingly sharp and doesn't use the reflection ticket.)

3468
01:26:07,293 --> 01:26:09,093
Yes. I don't think they'll vote for me.

3469
01:26:09,463 --> 01:26:12,963
If I go with the most obvious, I think they'd pick me.

3470
01:26:09,608 --> 01:26:13,138
(Meanwhile, the strongest candidate, Daniel)

3471
01:26:13,163 --> 01:26:15,503
But if they twist it once, they'd pick Ye Eun.

3472
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:14,338
(Rule for the problematic youngest)

3473
01:26:14,338 --> 01:26:15,708
(If they use reflection tickets when they're not voted,)

3474
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:18,473
If they twist it three times, they'd focus all the votes on Hoon.

3475
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:17,178
(they get the penalty.)

3476
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:22,173
But they might have gone back to the beginning...

3477
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,643
and cast all their votes for me.

3478
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:26,443
So the reflection ticket...

3479
01:26:27,413 --> 01:26:29,413
I'll use it. As a safety measure.

3480
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:30,828
(Daniel uses it.)

3481
01:26:30,283 --> 01:26:32,053
What should I do?

3482
01:26:30,828 --> 01:26:32,628
(What will Kang Hoon choose to do?)

3483
01:26:33,253 --> 01:26:34,283
But...

3484
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:35,623
I'll...

3485
01:26:35,828 --> 01:26:39,328
(What choice did Kang Hoon make?)

3486
01:26:36,453 --> 01:26:39,193
The voting ended. I'll announce the results.

3487
01:26:39,193 --> 01:26:40,993
Please!

3488
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:42,498
(Revealing the final results)

3489
01:26:40,993 --> 01:26:42,563
- I have no clue about this. - As a result of the voting,

3490
01:26:42,563 --> 01:26:43,563
- Please. - The reflection ticket.

3491
01:26:43,563 --> 01:26:45,033
Who is the first?

3492
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,063
- The reflection ticket. - I'll announce...

3493
01:26:47,063 --> 01:26:48,363
- the problematic member... - With the fewest...

3494
01:26:48,178 --> 01:26:51,108
(Revealing the 3rd place first)

3495
01:26:48,363 --> 01:26:50,103
- with the fewest votes. - Who is it?

3496
01:26:50,103 --> 01:26:51,803
The problematic member with the fewest votes.

3497
01:26:51,348 --> 01:26:56,418
(Will Ye Eun be in 3rd place as the voters predicted?)

3498
01:26:51,803 --> 01:26:56,543
- As a result, in third place... - Yes.

3499
01:26:57,613 --> 01:26:58,743
- Ji Ye Eun. - Ji Ye Eun.

3500
01:26:58,743 --> 01:27:00,313
- It's Choi Daniel. - What?

3501
01:27:00,513 --> 01:27:01,783
- What? - What?

3502
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,053
- It's Choi Daniel. - What?

3503
01:27:03,053 --> 01:27:04,283
- It's Daniel? - What?

3504
01:27:03,128 --> 01:27:06,228
(Daniel used the reflection ticket when he wasn't elected.)

3505
01:27:04,283 --> 01:27:05,753
- What? - It's Daniel?

3506
01:27:06,228 --> 01:27:08,898
(He will receive a penalty.)

3507
01:27:06,883 --> 01:27:08,283
It's Daniel?

3508
01:27:09,723 --> 01:27:11,053
He used the reflection ticket.

3509
01:27:11,053 --> 01:27:12,453
In second place...

3510
01:27:12,298 --> 01:27:14,598
(What about the 2nd?)

3511
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:13,823
The second...

3512
01:27:14,698 --> 01:27:17,268
(The people who voted for Kang Hoon)

3513
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:16,293
Kang Hoon?

3514
01:27:16,693 --> 01:27:17,693
Ji Ye Eun...

3515
01:27:17,408 --> 01:27:21,508
(Ye Eun's name should be said now!)

3516
01:27:22,533 --> 01:27:23,633
It's Ji Ye Eun.

3517
01:27:23,633 --> 01:27:25,173
- Kang Hoon is first. - It's Kang Hoon?

3518
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:26,503
It's Ji Ye Eun.

3519
01:27:25,578 --> 01:27:30,118
(Kang Hoon was voted as the final problematic member!)

3520
01:27:26,503 --> 01:27:27,803
- Kang Hoon is first. - It's Kang Hoon?

3521
01:27:27,803 --> 01:27:29,973
- In first... - Kang Hoon would have used it.

3522
01:27:30,118 --> 01:27:31,248
(Those who voted for Kang Hoon)

3523
01:27:30,173 --> 01:27:32,413
Kang Hoon was voted...

3524
01:27:31,248 --> 01:27:32,588
(Jae Seok: 7, Jong Kook: 4, Se Chan: 2, Ji Hyo: 2, Seok Sam: 2)

3525
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,583
as the final problematic member of Running Man.

3526
01:27:32,588 --> 01:27:35,558
(If Kang Hoon didn't use the reflection ticket...)

3527
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,583
- He definitely used it. - If he didn't use it...

3528
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:37,488
(The top 2 would get the prize.)

3529
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:37,853
He used it.

3530
01:27:37,488 --> 01:27:39,328
(Kang Hoon would get the penalty.)

3531
01:27:37,883 --> 01:27:39,183
- Also, - It's so one-dimensional.

3532
01:27:39,183 --> 01:27:41,283
Kang Hoon, who was elected first...

3533
01:27:39,358 --> 01:27:42,598
(If Kang Hoon used the reflection ticket...)

3534
01:27:41,283 --> 01:27:42,923
- He... - He used it.

3535
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:44,568
(Everyone would get the penalty,)

3536
01:27:42,923 --> 01:27:43,953
- It would be amazing if he didn't. - He used it.

3537
01:27:44,568 --> 01:27:46,898
(and Kang Hoon would get the prize.)

3538
01:27:45,353 --> 01:27:46,623
- Did he not? - It would be amazing if he didn't.

3539
01:27:46,723 --> 01:27:47,723
I don't think he used it.

3540
01:27:47,723 --> 01:27:49,063
He used the reflection ticket.

3541
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:51,333
He used the reflection ticket.

3542
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:54,438
(He succeeded in fooling the members!)

3543
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:59,233
I heard Seok Jin and Se Chan whisper Kang Hoon.

3544
01:28:00,303 --> 01:28:01,843
Haha. Who did you vote for?

3545
01:28:02,203 --> 01:28:03,213
Who was it?

3546
01:28:03,213 --> 01:28:04,343
- Honestly... - Tell me.

3547
01:28:04,318 --> 01:28:05,648
(Kang Hoon)

3548
01:28:04,343 --> 01:28:05,673
Kang Hoon?

3549
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:07,218
(Whispering)

3550
01:28:05,673 --> 01:28:06,983
Did you also vote for Kang Hoon?

3551
01:28:07,313 --> 01:28:08,313
Did you also vote for Kang Hoon?

3552
01:28:08,388 --> 01:28:11,988
(Retorter is usually great at lip-reading and eavesdropping.)

3553
01:28:10,213 --> 01:28:12,553
- It's me. - No.

3554
01:28:12,128 --> 01:28:15,128
(He managed to catch it again.)

3555
01:28:13,383 --> 01:28:15,383
I think they've all decided to vote for me.

3556
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:17,223
I'll use the reflection ticket.

3557
01:28:18,953 --> 01:28:20,363
I think this is the right thing to do. But why is it me?

3558
01:28:20,363 --> 01:28:21,723
Why am I the problematic member?

3559
01:28:23,393 --> 01:28:24,393
Well...

3560
01:28:24,268 --> 01:28:26,338
(Those who voted for Kang Hoon)

3561
01:28:25,393 --> 01:28:28,703
- So, the voters, who are Seok Jin, - Yes.

3562
01:28:26,338 --> 01:28:29,378
(Jae Seok: 7, Jong Kook: 4, Se Chan: 2, Ji Hyo: 2, Seok Sam: 2)

3563
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:32,073
Jae Seok, Se Chan, Jong Kook,

3564
01:28:29,378 --> 01:28:34,548
(Everyone who voted for Kang Hoon will get the penalty.)

3565
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:33,503
- and Ji Hyo... - They all voted for me.

3566
01:28:33,503 --> 01:28:35,003
- See? - will receive the penalty.

3567
01:28:35,003 --> 01:28:37,713
I wrote Daniel's name and switched to his.

3568
01:28:37,713 --> 01:28:39,643
- Right. - He'd have been the first...

3569
01:28:39,643 --> 01:28:40,913
if I had written his name.

3570
01:28:41,013 --> 01:28:44,183
To the three... I was foolish. I voted for all.

3571
01:28:43,888 --> 01:28:47,698
(These two suddenly split their votes onto Kang Hoon.)

3572
01:28:45,213 --> 01:28:46,783
- Why did I do that? - Ye Eun...

3573
01:28:47,153 --> 01:28:48,523
- I voted for all too. - Why did you vote for all of them?

3574
01:28:47,728 --> 01:28:50,028
(Annoying)

3575
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:50,153
- You should give it to one person. - You should give it to one person.

3576
01:28:50,353 --> 01:28:53,093
It would be better to focus the votes on one person.

3577
01:28:51,068 --> 01:28:54,338
(He said he would focus the votes on one person at first.)

3578
01:28:55,693 --> 01:28:56,893
You know,

3579
01:28:56,893 --> 01:28:58,263
I have to give two votes to each of them.

3580
01:28:58,263 --> 01:28:59,333
Because...

3581
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:04,078
(As if suddenly confused, he gives 2 votes to each.)

3582
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:02,833
It's not clear. It feels too risky to put all the votes on one person.

3583
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:04,003
I think they're all going to use the tickets.

3584
01:29:04,003 --> 01:29:06,273
I think I should leave fate in the hands of the rest.

3585
01:29:04,308 --> 01:29:08,478
(This way, he gets a penalty when anyone uses the ticket.)

3586
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:08,373
No. I'll split the votes.

3587
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:14,788
(Ji Hyo with 7 votes also splits the votes to all 3 of them.)

3588
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:17,213
Did I split the votes too much?

3589
01:29:15,758 --> 01:29:17,988
(Her mind keeps changing.)

3590
01:29:18,983 --> 01:29:20,383
- What about Ye Eun? - I voted for all too.

3591
01:29:19,088 --> 01:29:23,898
(A mistake made by two Empty Heads who didn't understand the rules)

3592
01:29:20,383 --> 01:29:22,053
Why did you vote for all of them? You should give it to one person.

3593
01:29:22,053 --> 01:29:23,993
There is only one person...

3594
01:29:23,928 --> 01:29:26,668
(The sole winner of today)

3595
01:29:23,993 --> 01:29:25,853
- I should have just written Ye Eun. - who can win today's prize.

3596
01:29:25,853 --> 01:29:28,323
Only Kang Hoon, who used the reflection ticket properly,

3597
01:29:27,568 --> 01:29:29,598
(Kang Hoon succeeded in the counterattack,)

3598
01:29:28,323 --> 01:29:30,633
- will get the prize. - Seriously.

3599
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:31,608
(using the reflection ticket.)

3600
01:29:30,633 --> 01:29:33,063
- That little fox. - He's a fox.

3601
01:29:33,063 --> 01:29:35,333
- Ye Eun avoided both... - I knew she wouldn't use it.

3602
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:37,148
(Ye Eun doesn't get the prize and the penalty.)

3603
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:36,733
the prize and the penalty.

3604
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:37,833
- That fox. - That young fox.

3605
01:29:37,148 --> 01:29:40,248
(Haha also doesn't get the penalty because he didn't vote for Hoon.)

3606
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:39,673
I heard Seok Jin and Se Chan...

3607
01:29:39,943 --> 01:29:42,043
- I heard Kang Hoon... - While eating the durian...

3608
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,613
That young fox.

3609
01:29:42,178 --> 01:29:43,688
(The old fox says)

3610
01:29:43,613 --> 01:29:46,413
- Today's prize... - Is it gold?

3611
01:29:44,618 --> 01:29:46,688
(Here comes today's prize.)

3612
01:29:46,413 --> 01:29:48,043
is honey that helps boost your immunity...

3613
01:29:47,918 --> 01:29:50,428
(Premium honeycomb honey)

3614
01:29:48,043 --> 01:29:49,783
- It's honey! - during the winter.

3615
01:29:50,353 --> 01:29:51,513
- That's nice. - How nice.

3616
01:29:51,513 --> 01:29:52,513
Give it to your parents.

3617
01:29:52,513 --> 01:29:54,423
I should give it to my parents.

3618
01:29:54,198 --> 01:29:55,858
(Jealous)

3619
01:29:54,423 --> 01:29:55,983
It's really nice to drink honey tea.

3620
01:29:55,983 --> 01:29:58,423
We'll proceed with the penalty right away.

3621
01:29:58,423 --> 01:30:01,023
The penalty will be short but intense.

3622
01:30:01,023 --> 01:30:03,363
You will get off work after getting flogged.

3623
01:30:03,733 --> 01:30:04,993
- Make it interesting. - Make it interesting.

3624
01:30:04,993 --> 01:30:06,563
- Loud sound, but not painful. - Of course.

3625
01:30:05,068 --> 01:30:07,508
(Executioner Kang carries it on right away.)

3626
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:12,408
(Today's penalty-takers: Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Jong Kook)

3627
01:30:08,963 --> 01:30:10,003
Go!

3628
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:13,133
- It made a loud sound. - That part hurts.

3629
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:18,518
(Ji Hyo, Se Chan, Daniel)

3630
01:30:13,133 --> 01:30:14,373
- It doesn't hurt. - It's okay.

3631
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:15,843
- That much is fine. - It doesn't hurt.

3632
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:17,813
- Three! - Goodness.

3633
01:30:17,813 --> 01:30:18,843
Who was that? Why did you hit it so hard?

3634
01:30:18,843 --> 01:30:19,843
Go.

3635
01:30:20,643 --> 01:30:21,713
Goodness.

3636
01:30:21,813 --> 01:30:23,013
- Niel. - The bones...

3637
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:25,058
(The last penalty-taker: Daniel)

3638
01:30:23,013 --> 01:30:24,183
- Is it me? - Are you the last one?

3639
01:30:24,183 --> 01:30:25,213
- The last one. - Niel...

3640
01:30:25,613 --> 01:30:27,883
- Jong Kook hits it well too. - He does.

3641
01:30:28,058 --> 01:30:30,428
(Executioner: Mr. Big Eyes)

3642
01:30:28,853 --> 01:30:30,393
- It's this one. - That's the one.

3643
01:30:30,598 --> 01:30:34,368
(A real sloppy man who gets the penalty until the last day)

3644
01:30:30,653 --> 01:30:32,153
- Niel. - Go at the count of two.

3645
01:30:32,153 --> 01:30:33,893
- I'll go like this. Ready? - Jong Kook.

3646
01:30:33,893 --> 01:30:35,663
- When? Okay. - I'll go.

3647
01:30:37,068 --> 01:30:38,668
(Screaming)

3648
01:30:38,963 --> 01:30:40,563
- That was good. - You did well.

3649
01:30:39,338 --> 01:30:43,248
(The rented member, Daniel, is done carrying out the last penalty.)

3650
01:30:40,563 --> 01:30:42,063
- You did well. - You did well,

3651
01:30:42,063 --> 01:30:43,533
- Niel. - Well done, Niel.

3652
01:30:43,533 --> 01:30:45,533
We got very attached to Niel.

3653
01:30:44,348 --> 01:30:47,748
(The graduation speech from Daniel whom we grew fond of)

3654
01:30:45,533 --> 01:30:46,703
- Right. - We did.

3655
01:30:46,703 --> 01:30:49,703
I'm an insignificant person,

3656
01:30:49,703 --> 01:30:51,773
but for seven months...

3657
01:30:51,773 --> 01:30:53,343
- or eight... - Really?

3658
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:56,058
(8 months passed by quickly.)

3659
01:30:53,343 --> 01:30:55,583
- It's been that long. - He was here for 7 or 8 months.

3660
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:58,483
For more than half a year, you took care of me...

3661
01:30:58,483 --> 01:30:59,683
and embraced me.

3662
01:30:59,683 --> 01:31:02,653
To the production crew, seniors, and juniors,

3663
01:31:02,653 --> 01:31:04,393
thank you so much.

3664
01:31:06,323 --> 01:31:07,393
Also,

3665
01:31:07,923 --> 01:31:10,433
Jong Kook always called me a blockhead.

3666
01:31:11,263 --> 01:31:12,293
- Hey, you... - My head...

3667
01:31:12,293 --> 01:31:13,533
You're about to leave.

3668
01:31:13,533 --> 01:31:14,603
- "Blockhead." - I...

3669
01:31:13,738 --> 01:31:15,408
(Niel's favorite, Mr. Big Eyes)

3670
01:31:14,603 --> 01:31:15,663
It was when the cameras weren't there.

3671
01:31:15,663 --> 01:31:17,573
- When did I say that? - He also said...

3672
01:31:17,573 --> 01:31:19,203
- my eyes were small. - Hey.

3673
01:31:19,203 --> 01:31:20,573
- I did say your eyes were small. - Even when he said that,

3674
01:31:20,573 --> 01:31:21,973
I could feel his warm heart.

3675
01:31:22,478 --> 01:31:28,758
(From everyone's ideal type Daniel from "High Kick!")

3676
01:31:22,803 --> 01:31:25,113
To Jae Seok, I was very thankful...

3677
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:29,043
when he first asked me to join Running Man.

3678
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:34,028
(To the cute and strange Old Daniel who gave us laughter)

3679
01:31:29,043 --> 01:31:32,253
Seok Jin and Haha. Ji Hyo and Se Chan...

3680
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:34,453
Ye Eun also always...

3681
01:31:34,128 --> 01:31:40,868
(Running Man's Flimsy)

3682
01:31:34,923 --> 01:31:38,553
Everyone treated me nicely.

3683
01:31:38,553 --> 01:31:40,523
I was really thankful.

3684
01:31:40,863 --> 01:31:43,463
I had so much fun. It was very warm as well.

3685
01:31:40,938 --> 01:31:44,338
(1st rented member: Kang Hoon, 2nd rented member: Choi Daniel)

3686
01:31:43,463 --> 01:31:44,863
We're family, aren't we?

3687
01:31:44,338 --> 01:31:49,478
(Now, Daniel is our official family member.)

3688
01:31:45,263 --> 01:31:46,933
- This applies to Kang Hoon as well. - That's right.

3689
01:31:46,933 --> 01:31:48,163
- Come visit... - Yes.

3690
01:31:48,163 --> 01:31:49,433
- from time to time. - Thank you.

3691
01:31:49,433 --> 01:31:51,173
Hit the slate, Niel.

3692
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:53,003
Well done, Niel.

3693
01:31:53,003 --> 01:31:54,373
The slate.

3694
01:31:54,373 --> 01:31:56,573
I'll hit the slate.

3695
01:31:56,943 --> 01:31:58,713
One, two, three!

3696
01:31:58,843 --> 01:31:59,843
Well done, Daniel.

3697
01:31:59,843 --> 01:32:01,743
- Well done! - Niel.

3698
01:32:01,783 --> 01:32:03,243
- Goodness. - Let's have a meal!

3699
01:32:03,243 --> 01:32:05,153
- Daniel. - Yes, Jae Seok.

3700
01:32:04,858 --> 01:32:10,028
(Thank you, Daniel, our rented member, and Hoon for revisiting us.)

3701
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,723
- Okay. - It's the last filming.

3702
01:32:06,723 --> 01:32:07,953
- Well done. - Well done.

3703
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:12,840
- It's Christmas. - Merry Christmas!

3704
01:32:10,428 --> 01:32:14,338
(Mysterious gifts for Christmas?)

3705
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:14,540
- What? They're so big. - What are these?

3706
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:15,610
This is... My goodness.

3707
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:17,410
- Perfume. - It's expensive.

3708
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:18,638
(As the mega-scale gifts are revealed,)

3709
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:18,650
- Why did you bring this? - Gold?

3710
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:21,080
- This is worth about 400 dollars. - This is crazy.

3711
01:32:18,838 --> 01:32:20,938
(the eyes of greed start working.)

3712
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,080
- What's that? - What's that?

3713
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:23,948
(And there's another mystery.)

3714
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,090
- What? Who's that? - Who is he?

3715
01:32:24,048 --> 01:32:25,748
(The suspicious villain Santa appears.)

3716
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:25,950
- This is crazy. - What...

3717
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:27,620
Please confirm if this is mine or not.

3718
01:32:27,518 --> 01:32:28,718
(Santa,)

3719
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,760
Is it a gift for me?

3720
01:32:28,718 --> 01:32:30,388
(who doesn't want to give out gifts, sabotages them!)

3721
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,630
- What? - Is that how you drink it?

3722
01:32:30,588 --> 01:32:32,488
(The trap has been activated.)

3723
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:34,158
(Another crybaby moment is added.)

3724
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:34,160
This is... What's that?

3725
01:32:34,588 --> 01:32:37,788
(Santa's tricks spark a division among the cowards.)

3726
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:36,030
- You startled me. - Hey.

3727
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:37,870
- I was startled. - Not me.

3728
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:38,870
Who was that?

3729
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:40,470
Jae Seok, you were talkative earlier.

3730
01:32:40,058 --> 01:32:41,398
(Obviously, they're being suspicious.)

3731
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:41,500
But why are you being quiet now?

3732
01:32:41,528 --> 01:32:42,728
(Will you be accused of being a traitor?)

3733
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,840
Haha, it's you!

3734
01:32:42,728 --> 01:32:44,168
(Will you deceive others?)

3735
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,270
- No! - Hang on.

3736
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:45,440
- It's Jee Seok Jin! - Seok Jin.

3737
01:32:45,298 --> 01:32:47,538
(Who will take the Christmas gifts that have become a mess?)

3738
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,640
Seriously, it's not me.

3739
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,680
- Jee Seok Jin! - Jee Seok Jin!

3740
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:50,380
- It's Jee Seok Jin. - It's not me.

3741
01:32:48,098 --> 01:32:49,798
(May You Reach the Christmas Gifts)
