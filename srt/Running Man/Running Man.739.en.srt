00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,810
Hello.

6
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,650
(There's someone
who looks out of place.)

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,619
- Hello.
- I look strange, right?

8
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,949
- No, it looks cute.
- This is my pet dog.

9
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,190
- They keep calling me a poodle.
- Poodle.

10
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:18,460
- Seok Jin, you have thick hair.
- A big poodle.

11
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:19,989
- You look cute.
- A big poodle.

12
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,390
You know a big poodle
that jumps at people, right?

13
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,859
Hey, good boy.

14
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,699
- Scratch his belly.
- Hey.

15
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,769
A dog of the British royal family.

16
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,640
(Flopping down)

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,909
A dog of the royal family.

18
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:37,079
Did you just see that?

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,979
- You. Don't laugh.
- Hey, good boy.

20
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,609
- Don't laugh.
- Why did you suddenly...

21
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,079
- Why are you wearing it?
- Good boy.

22
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,350
- Why...
- You guys said it was okay.

23
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,549
- What are you doing?
- Why?

24
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,890
- Why?
- I said you looked cute.

25
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,619
My gosh. Oh, dear.

26
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,119
It sticks to your jacket.

27
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,159
- He looks cute.
- That's a lot.

28
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,329
- You can't keep him. Look.
- Mr. Dog Owner.

29
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,259
- Look at the dog hair.
- Pick up after your dog.

30
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,659
- I should take this.
- You should.

31
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,170
I will clean up after my dog.

32
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,700
Good boy.

33
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,969
A big dog.

34
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,599
- Good boy.
- A big dog wearing shiny clothes.

35
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,340
- A talking dog.
- By the way...

36
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,969
Today, all the members make up
the animal kingdom.

37
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,340
A lot of us...

38
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,150
How did you think
of wearing something like this?

39
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,079
- Well...
- This is too much.

40
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,620
- What... Seok Jin.
- Too much?

41
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,879
Look who's talking.

42
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,879
This is too much.

43
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,890
He said that was too much
wearing a woolly hat.

44
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,319
Look at your head.

45
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,060

- It's hot though.

46
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,129

47
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,260
- with your appearance today.
- Yes.

48
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,829
Today, we have three guests...

49
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,359
- who will make us laugh.
- Really?

50
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,129

- Seriously?

51
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,799

- Really?

52
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,540
- We have guests?
- Who are they?

53
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,769
- What?

00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,269
- Are they singers?
- Are they singing?

55
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:41,340
- They must be singers.
- Three guests?

56
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,370
We should step back.

57
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,680
They must be SG Wannabe.

58
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,340
- They must be singers.
- I bet they are tall.

59
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,180
- Who are the three guests?
- Who is it?

60
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,250
Are they idols?

(The music starts.)

62
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,150
Is Hoshi and the guys coming?

63
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,750
- Are they B.S.S?
- My gosh.

64
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
(Who are today's guests
hidden behind a veil?)

65
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,560
- Whose song is this?
- It sounds like a musical.

66
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,430
It's Kyu Hyun.

67
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,189
It's Kyu Hyun.

68
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,959
(Kyu Hyun is back after two months.)

69
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,730
- It's Kyu Hyun.
- Is it Kyu Hyun?

70
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,069

from "The Man Who Laughs")

72
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,710
(He shows up in a costume
that is as unique as Seok Jin's.)

73
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,169
That's Kyu Hyun?

74
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,909
(It's all like that,
I can't be perfect)

75
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,349
- He's so good.
- He sings well.

76
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,710
He's good at musicals.

77
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,580
(What is a person, even you)

78
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,650
(They've never seen Kyu Hyun
like that before.)

79
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,960
(The next guest shows up
at the moment.)

80
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,360
(Lee Seok Hoon without glasses on)

81
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,659
It's SG Wannabe for real.

82
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,659
Who is he?

83
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,729
It's Seok Hoon.

84
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,870
(He didn't recognize Seok Hoon
without his glasses.)

85
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,469
He's really good.

86
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,340
(The last guest walks out
of the shadows.)

87
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,919
(The members recognize him
right away.)

88
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,120
Is that him?

89
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:03,960
(The legend of musicals,
Park Eun Tae)

90
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,719
This is crazy.

91
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,360
(A top-notch musical actor
with perfect notes, voice, and acting.)

92
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,800
He sings really well.

93
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,330
- He's amazing.
- He's talented.

94
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,000
(A celestial voice
that draws a standing ovation)

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,569
He looks different now.

96
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,909
He's so cool.

97
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,879
(The center of SG Wannabe...)

98
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,650
(who wants to be an idol center)

99
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,909
(Musical center, Lee Seok Hoon)

100
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,250

(Super Musical Junior, Kyu Hyun)

103
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,889
(Tear down that wall)

104
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:48,699
(only true freedom and only justice)

105
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,439
(Live and breathe)

106
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,340
(The hot harmony
of three main actors)

107
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,569
They are amazing.

108
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,620
(Open those eyes)

109
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,060
- Yes!
- Bravo!

110
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,560
- I had no idea.
- I got goosebumps.

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,430

- They sing so well.
- They are amazing.

113
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,970
You look different
when you do a musical, Kyu Hyun.

114
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,339
- He's different.
- He looks so serious.

115
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,800
- That's so cool.
- It's not fun.

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,410
- Why not?
- You look amazing.

117
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,870
I'm a singer. What can I do?

118
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,480
- That was amazing.
- It's "The Man Who Laughs," right?

119
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,550
- Yes, that's correct.
- It features these three.

120
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,449
You know what?

121
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,180
Our Ddochi right here...

122
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,389

- Right.

123
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:43,050
- I watched "The Man Who Laughs."
- You did?

124
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,560
- I watched it twice.
- Who's play did you watch?

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,689
- SUHO.
- I see. You watched SUHO.

126
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,160
- So you watched the re-run.
- Yes.

127
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,660
- Was it the re-run?
- Yes.

128
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,329
It was the last time.

129
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,360
- Not this time.
- What did you say?

130
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,699
- So it was the re-run.
- Oh, right.

131
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,069
- That's called the re-run.
- Is that so?

132
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,970
Wasn't it five years ago?

133
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,310
- We were there too.
- Really?

134
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,310

135
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,709
- She likes stuff like that.
- She watches it a lot.

136
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,079
Aren't you supposed to introduce us?

137
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,519
- We already know you guys.
- I will.

138
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,980
Let's have the guy in the middle
introduce himself.

139
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,790
"The guy in the middle?"

140
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,189
- I'm sorry.
- Please forgive us.

141
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,120
- It's really...
- Our dog has grown up a lot.

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,529
- We have Seok Hoon here.
- It's all right.

143
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,399
Kyu Hyun was on our show
only a few weeks ago.

144
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,660
- Right.
- And he's back with a musical.

145
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,600
- Please introduce yourselves.
- Okay. I'm...

146
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,399
an actor and a celebrity
in charge of promotion.

147
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,339
I'm Singer Kyu Hyun.
Nice to meet you.

148
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,970
- You are really good.
- You are so talented.

149
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,410
Seok Hoon, you go next.

150
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,480
Hello. This is my first time
on Running Man.

151
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,079
- I'm Lee Seok Hoon.
- Is this your first time?

152
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,009
- This is your first time.
- It is.

153
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,379

- It's my first time.

154
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,949
- And this is also my first time...
- Yes.

155
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,319
to be on a major variety show...

156
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,990
- without my glasses on.
- Hey, that's why...

157
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,889
- So I...
- I didn't recognize him.

158
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,060
You should put on some glasses.
Let him borrow yours.

159
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,990
- It's not like that.
- We're not used to your face.

160
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,360
You can lend yours, you brat.

161
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,769
- I would rather...
- You can lend yours, you brat.

162
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,769
- I would rather...
- That's Seok Hoon.

163
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,600
- There's Seok Hoon.
- Hey, Seok Hoon.

164
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,269
I didn't recognize him
when he showed up.

165
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,639
- That's the face we know.
- Without your glasses on,

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,810
you smile with your eyes a lot.

167
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,980
- I didn't know that.
- What are you talking about?

168
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,509
I'm always like that.

169
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,149
- You should wear glasses.
- Okay.

170
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,680
They're sharing the glasses.

171
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,779
- Eun Tae.
- He plays Gwynplaine with us...

172
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,490
- on "The Man Who Laughs."
- Yes.

173
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,189
And he's a legend
in the musical scene.

174
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:23,959
- Eun Tae.
- We know that.

175
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,290
I'm Park Eun Tae.

176
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,389
(The stars of the musical stars,
Park Eun Tae)

177
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,189
- He's so famous.
- Eun Tae,

178
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,860
How long have you been
doing musicals?

179
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,300
It's been about 19 years.

180
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,000
- That's a long time.
- It's been a really long time.

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,699
In the musical scene,

182
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,139
- he's the S-class actor.
- I know.

183
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,240
- Right.
- He's the best actor.

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,639
- S?
- The S-class.

185
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,269
- Right.
- When a musical begins,

186
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,279
actors like Eun Tae make...

187
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,040
- all performances sold out.
- Right.

188
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,879
- The ones that feature him.
- That's right.

189
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,550
- Fans love him.
- Right.

190
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,990
- Eun Tae, I heard your wife was...
- Right.

191
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,519
- Papaya.
- That's true.

192
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,819
She's Go Eun Chae.

193
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,959
- I was really surprised.
- Papaya?

194
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,290
- The Papaya we know?
- Papaya?

195
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,560
She's here to support him.

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,629
- Really?
- Where is she?

197
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:04,730
She's hiding now.

198
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,300
- Where is she hiding?
- Why hiding? Come on out.

199
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,029
- Where is she?
- Where are you, Eun Chae?

200
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,430
- She's hiding.
- Why...

201
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,870
- Really?
- She works as my manager now.

202
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,399
- She's your manager.
- I see.

203
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,670
How is it?
There must be good things, but...

204
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,410
- What are you trying to say?
- My gosh.

205
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,680
- You all know...
- Hey.

206
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,750
- There are pros and cons.
- I mean...

207
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,149
- Look at him.
- There are pros and cons.

208
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,519
- I don't agree.
- Why?

209
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,850
- Why?
- There are pros and cons.

210
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,050
Go around as you please.

211
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,620
- That's...
- I drive her around.

212
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,490
- So there are pros and cons.
- The thing is...

213
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,930
- You need some time apart.
- It's for your sake, Eun Tae.

214
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,230
- Right.
- And for each other.

215
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,060
"The Paradise of the rich
is made..."

216
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,470
"out of the Inferno of the poor."

217
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,139
This is a line from Gwynplaine,

218
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,839
the main character of the musical,
"The Man Who Laughs."

219
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:48,839
So today's race is called
The Man Who Laughs in Paradise.

220
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,639
While the rich members
with a lot of tickets enjoy Paradise,

221
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,709
the poor ones
without enough tickets...

222
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,879
- will stay in the Inferno.
- It's Paradise and Inferno.

223
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,790
You can go to Paradise
by submitting tickets to Paradise.

224
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,720
The number of tickets you need
to submit changes each time.

225
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,519
You can collect the tickets
through missions.

226
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,790
For your information,
you can't use the tickets...

227
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,360
- that are damaged.
- I see.

228
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,600
Yang Se Chan...

229
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,100
I will tear them up
and spit on them.

230
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,000
There are a lot of thieves here.
I should be careful.

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
Are we starting right away?

232
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,839
- Yes, it's begun.
- Yes. We are starting like this.

233
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,769
- Then can I put on my glasses?
- No.

234
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,839
- Go ahead.
- Can I do that?

235
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,180
- Hey.
- Why did you take them off?

236
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,110
- I do the musical without them.
- I see.

237
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,680
- It would look strange.
- It's the Middle Ages.

238
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,149
Because it's the Middle Ages.

239
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,850
- It's a period play.
- I see.

240
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,519
He feels nervous
without the glasses on.

241
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,990
Those who wear glasses
feel that way.

242
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,789
- I feel comfortable now.
- Before the mission begins,

243
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,389
please put on the raincoats.

244
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,759
Are only the three of them doing it?

245
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,429
No. That's because they're
wearing the stage costumes.

246
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,730
- I see.
- Let me help.

247
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,429
Seok Hoon, is this for your musical?

248
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,730
- Yes, I wear it on stage.
- I see.

249
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,429
- Right?
- How old are you?

250
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,139
- I was born in 1981.
- We are the same age.

251
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,340
- We are?
- We're the same age.

252
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,870
I went to watch
your musicals a few times.

253
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,139
- I watched "Ben-Hur."
- Really?

254
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,539
My brother is a big fan of you.

255
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,409
Seok Jin, you told me about him.

256
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,409
- About Eun Tae? Sure.
- Yes. You told me once.

257
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,980
- You remember that.
- Yes. You said...

258
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,519
- there was a great actor.
- That he was amazing.

259
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,620
Thank you so much.

260
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,590
The first mission is
RC Car to Paradise.

261
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,960
With your eyes closed,
you will control an RC car...

262
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,929
that races toward your face...

263
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,759
and stop it where you think
is the right location.

264
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,830
It runs toward my face?

265
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,730
You will receive points
for the location where it stops.

266
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,139
- I get it.
- We wrote down the scores...

267
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,269
for each section.

268
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,070
For your information,
there will be three teams...

269
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,809
- of 3, 3, and 4.
- Okay.

270
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,509
You will be given
only one chance each.

271
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:33,580
- Okay.
- Okay.

272
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,419
The team with the highest score
will receive five tickets.

273
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
The 2nd team gets 3 tickets,

274
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,419
and the 3rd team gets
2 tickets each.

275
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:45,360
- As you can see, to get...
- It's difficult.

276
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,860
- a high score, it should be here.
- Right. That's five points.

277
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:49,960
- Is it out if it hits my face?
- Is it out?

278
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,659
No. If it touches your face,
you get one point.

279
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:52,899
- We get 1 point?
- If it hits me, I get 1 point.

280
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,870
- We should get hit then.
- You can at least get one point.

281
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:57,669
- Okay.
- This isn't easy.

282
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:59,269
- It's hard.
- It's not easy.

283
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,269
You should do it in one go.
Don't stop it in the middle.

284
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,909
- I can't stop it?
- You can't.

285
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,379
- Don't stop it.
- You can't do that.

286
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:05,940
Split into teams as you please.

287
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,379
Seok Hoon, how about
the four members wearing glasses?

288
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,480
Okay. The four members
wearing glasses.

289
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,820
- Glasses?
- Four members with glasses on.

290
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,149
- These four?
- Four members with glasses on.

291
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,320
- One, two, three, four.
- Okay.

292
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,490
- Why?
- Four with glasses on.

293
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,690
We have four members
wearing glasses.

294
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,590
- Those with long hair.
- The bobbed hair.

295
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,759
- The three with bobbed hair.
- The three with bobbed hair.

296
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,330
- Ji Hyo and I...
- You should join them.

297
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,029
- The three with bobbed hair.
- They look great together.

298
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,529
- We are a team with bobbed hair.
- The three with bobbed hair.

299
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,730
- Are you with us?
- Do you not like me?

300
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,370
That's not it. I like you, Kyu Hyun.

301
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,429
- You seem to hate me.
- Good, Kyu Hyun.

302
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,169
- It's a game you play with a hunch.
- Right. It's all about hunches.

303
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,970
- We can win, Ji Hyo.
- We might...

304
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,169
- If we focus,
- With a woman's hunch.

305
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,970
we will be able to do well.

306
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,379
- I'll try my best.
- Okay.

307
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,779
They look great together.

308
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,080
Let's go.

309
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,179
Our glasses have lenses.

310
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,350
The ones without lenses
should go first.

311
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,080
- Without lenses.
- All right.

312
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,120
- Seok Hoon, you go first.
- Okay.

313
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,320
Take off your glasses, Seok Hoon.

314
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,889
Should I take them off again?

315
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,860
You should think
that it's better to get hit.

316
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,059
- Close your eyes.
- Good luck, Seok Hoon.

317
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,289
- Let's go.
- Go, Seok Hoon.

318
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,759
- Don't squint.
- Don't be afraid.

319
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,960
- Don't be scared.
- Be honest.

320
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,000
- Start.
- Don't be scared.

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,169
Be bold.

322
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,299
You can hear the sound.

323
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,929
You should hear it
when it's in front of you.

324
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,100
You should hear it
when it's in front of you.

325
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,070
(When it speeds up,)

326
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,440
(he puts the brake on the car.)

327
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,840
- My goodness.
- Okay.

328
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,450
(Bang)

329
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,649
- This is scary.
- One point.

330
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,549
- How long does it skid?
- Is it a lot?

331
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,750
- It skids a lot.
- It moves a lot after braking?

332
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,320
I thought it was far away,
but it hit me right away.

333
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,559
- Really?
- Yes.

334
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,659
It hit me right away.

335
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,690
It's faster than I thought.

336
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,529
It's better to get hit, right?

337
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,259
- Yes.
- You got one point.

338
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,100
- You look cute, Seok Hoon.
- Are you next?

339
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,769
- Are you next?
- I'll go next.

340
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:36,830
Okay. Haha.

341
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,970
(The next player is Haha.)

342
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,600
I can do this. Okay.

343
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,909
- What's so hard about this?
- It's better to get hit, right?

344
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,309
- It's better to get hit.
- You might get hit a lot.

345
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,909
(The RC car is placed
in the middle.)

346
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:47,950
He's a coward.

347
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,610
- You should close your eyes.
- Close your eyes.

348
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,820
Don't squint.

349
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,320
He's a coward.

350
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,120
(The RC car starts.)

351
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,190
- Come on.
- Hey.

352
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,919
(Stopping)

353
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,289
- What a coward.
- That's horrible.

354
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,690
- How could he...
- That was too soon.

355
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,230
- I'll do it seriously.
- Move over.

356
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,529
- Let me do it again.
- Come on out.

357
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,500
- Move over.
- You can't do it again.

358
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,200
- They won't let you do it again.
- Hurry and move over.

359
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,669
- It's not like...
- You talked big.

360
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,740
- you will fall into the paint.
- Let me try.

361
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,309
- My goodness.
- Gosh, seriously...

362
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,240
It skids a little.

363
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,080
- When it reaches here...
- My gosh.

364
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,110
Let's do this.

365
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,850
(He is more serious
than anyone else.)

366
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,620
- No. You can't do that.
- Why your chin...

367
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,490
- No. You can't do that.
- Why your chin...

368
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,620
- How do you want to do it?
- Use your hand.

369
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,990
- Why...
- To push it with your chin?

370
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,019
- It's not easy.
- No, you should use your hand.

371
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,429
You can't use it with your chin.

372
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,629
Put your chin on it.

373
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:38,529
- Why do you put your nose?
- Why...

374
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,000
- Close your eyes.
- Move forward.

375
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,370
- You should close your eyes.
- Good. It's done.

376
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,929
He doesn't know the rules.

377
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,440
That's it. Stay right there.

378
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,840
- He must be nervous.
- Close your eyes.

379
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,169
He didn't press it yet.

380
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,740
No, that's not it. It's here.

381
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,809
- What?
- This is it.

382
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,980
You pressed the bottom one.

383
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,139
- My gosh.
- He doesn't know the rules.

384
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,409
- All right. Here I go.
- He's a handful.

385
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,409
(He's ready
after many twists and turns.)

386
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,279
- Put it on here.
- Here it comes.

387
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,490
(Right at the moment)

388
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,320
(The prankster booster is on.)

389
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,490
(Braking)

390
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,590
(Hitting)

391
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,889
I stopped it.

392
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,700
I stopped it.

393
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,759
(I stopped it.)

394
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,230
I'm serious.
It's caught on the camera. Look.

395
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,840
- It skidded.
- But why...

396
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,970
You felt the wind, right?

397
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,169
- It skidded.
- I stopped it.

398
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,409
- This is...
- You get one point.

399
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,240
- It's one point.
- No. I'm serious.

400
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
- You got one point. That's right.
- You have to watch it.

401
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,080
- I pressed it.
- That's how it feels.

402
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,049
- Seok Hoon felt the same way.
- Right? You felt it too, right?

403
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,710
- It skids.
- It skidded, right?

404
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,720
It skidded.

405
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,519
- It was really fast.
- Seok Jin, you know what?

406
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,149
- It's really fast.
- It skidded.

407
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,120
- Does he really not know?
- He doesn't know. Seriously.

408
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,820
- It was like an ice surface.
- It was fast.

409
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,889
Seok Jin, you have to watch
this episode on TV.

410
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,259
- Why?
- You have to.

411
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,159
I want another chance.

412
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,360
Aren't you on the same team?

413
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,399
- He wants at least 1 point.
- At least 1 point.

414
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,200
- I'm ready.
- Are you ready?

415
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,340
Close your eyes.

416
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,070
- Okay.
- It's ready.

417
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,110
- Show them what you are made of!
- Right here.

418
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,340
- I have to do this for my team.
- Right.

419
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,909
- Good luck.
- Okay. Wipe it.

420
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,149
- Let's go.
- Go.

421
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:04,820
- It's fast.
- It's done.

422
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,320
Okay. It will work.

423
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,690
(He stops it pursing his lips.)

424
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,059
I pressed it.

425
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,320
- It skidded, right?
- It skidded.

426
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,789
- Just a little...
- It skids a lot.

427
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,389
- This is...
- I pressed it though.

428
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,600
- So...
- You have to press it sooner.

429
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,960
- Right? Because...
- You see,

430
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,059
it slides for a while
after pressing the brakes.

431
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,100
- It does.
- Yes.

432
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,330
- It catches speed on its way.
- Press it right about here.

433
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,340
Vroom and press.

434
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,399
(Next up is Team Remainders.)

435
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,210
- Hit the brakes as it heats up.
- Exactly.

436
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,470
- I'll go.
- Sure.

437
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,409
(First attempt)

438
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,379
It went too slow.

439
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:38,820
- Nice!
- Was it too slow?

440
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,289
(Team Remainders: Jong Kook, 1)

441
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,690
- Okay.
- Nicely done.

442
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,190
(After two experiments,)

443
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,830
(he finally found the rhythm.)

444
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,330
- Five points.
- That's five points!

445
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,299
(Team Remainders rises
to 1st place.)

446
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,929
- We're good with 5 points.
- Nice. That's 5 points.

447
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,029
No way.

448
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,299
(Next up is Team Ladies.)

449
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:59,070
- Yes!
- That's minus one point.

450
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,100
Minus one point.

451
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,710
(Even with the ladies' sixth sense,
they have a hard time guessing it.)

452
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,409
Okay, good!

453
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,309
You have to approach it
in a bold way.

454
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,509
They're still at zero points
which isn't so bad.

455
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,149
- I think Ye Eun will do great.
- I'll place it at the end.

456
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,120
- I bet she'll do a good job.
- She's incredible.

457
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,750
She's seriously packing
in her shoulders.

458
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,149
It might not hit her in the face.

459
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,159
- It might hit us instead.
- Lucky you for having a flat face.

460
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,419
You have a flat face.

461
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,360
Do I push it forward?

462
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:24,899
(They'll be in last place
if she scores minus points.)

463
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,059
- Go ahead.
- Here I go.

464
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,259
I know I can do this.

465
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,669
I doubt she'll score ten points.

466
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,000
That's insane.

467
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,070
Here I go. I know I can do this.

468
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,110
(However)

469
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,480
(Did Ye Eun actually succeed?)

470
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,850
(It didn't touch her face!)

471
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,549
- No, hold on.
- It went over the line.

472
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,919
- It went over the line.
- It didn't hit me.

473
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,620
- It didn't hit me.
- It's over the line.

474
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,659
- Come on.
- It went over the line.

475
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,730
It didn't hit you,

476
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,000
- but it went over the line.
- But that...

477
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Let's see.

478
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,330
- Did it go over the line?
- I succeeded.

479
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,730
- It went over the line.
- It didn't.

480
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,470
It's still in the ten-point box.

481
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,139
- Didn't it pass the line?
- It didn't.

482
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:07,169
- Didn't it pass the line?
- No way.

483
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,840
- I did it!
- Yes!

484
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
Hurrah for Team Ladies!

485
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,879
- Ddochi, I'm impressed.
- Hurrah for Team Ladies!

486
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,110
Her nose isn't as tall as ours.

487
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,480
- Her nose...
- Come on!

488
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,320
Her nose was squished
after a beating from someone.

489
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,419
- She barely has a nose.
- I would've asked my brother...

490
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,549
for a beating too.

491
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,750
- Not having a nose isn't a crime.
- What...

492
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:26,460
- Not having a nose isn't a crime.
- If it were Seok Jin...

493
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,059
- Mine's not as tall.
- If it were me...

494
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,860
- Seok Jin would've been hit.
- Most definitely.

495
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,929
- The same goes for Kyu Hyun.
- It went over the line.

496
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,200
You succeeded
thanks to having a flat nose.

497
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,399
It's thanks to my flat nose.

498
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,470
(Screaming)

499
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,039
Go, Team Ladies!

500
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,570
(She miraculously lucked out
thanks to her flat nose.)

501
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,070
Team Ladies has the highest score...

502
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,139
- and will get five tickets each.
- I'm jealous.

503
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,110
Team Remainders in second place...

504
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,639
- will get three each.
- What's this? Three?

505
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,450
Team Glasses in last place...

506
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,820
- will get two each.
- It's like we didn't play.

507
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,789
- Let's not get the penalty today.
- I'm going to win.

508
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,820
I should keep these safe.

509
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,519
Ye Eun is holding her chin up high
after scoring ten points.

510
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,059
Wasn't that the first time
she won a game?

511
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,460
- Yes, the first.
- Right.

512
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,700
How can we beat her
when she has a flat nose?

513
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,269
- It's an adorable nose.
- Seok Jin's known for his nose,

514
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:11,029
- and Ye Eun's nose was her savior.
- Exactly.

515
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,400
- The flat nose and...
- Jee and Ji are killing it.

516
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,740
Big Nose and Flat Nose.

517
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,839
Their noses do wonders for them.

518
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,140
To make it to the first paradise,

519
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,109
you must hand in two tickets.

520
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,279
- Two?
- Yes, two.

521
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,309
Two?

522
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,920
There are many other Infernos...

523
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,019
and paradises you'll come across,

524
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,519
so think wisely.

525
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,490
- Are you kidding me?
- What is it?

526
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,230
Unbelievable. I can't take it!

527
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,559
- He's at it again.
- Who did it?

528
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,660
- Again?
- Darn it!

529
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,059
- Again?
- Really?

530
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,599
- Was it you?
- Did someone take his?

531
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,900
- Are you kidding me?
- He's scaring me.

532
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,730
- Eun Tae, I'm sorry.
- Did someone steal his?

533
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,000
I apologize since we first met,
but these punks... Hey!

534
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,369
- But...
- Check again.

535
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:49,240
- Why didn't you keep them safe?
- You should keep them safe.

536
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,380
- Unbelievable.
- Why leave it lying around?

537
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,680
I forgot, okay?

538
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,009
- And I trusted you.
- Seok Jin.

539
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,650
- You know how Running Man is.
- I do, but...

540
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,079
The director has us playing
certain roles.

541
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,220
- It was you.
- You're at it again.

542
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,750
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't him.

543
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,079
It's not me. I had left the room.

544
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,519
- I can't believe him.
- Do you have yours?

545
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,059
- I was outside.
- We only have two each.

546
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,589
Do we need to spend
two tickets this time?

547
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,930
- I only have two myself.
- How can I spend all that I have?

548
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,759
- You'll go one at a time.
- You first.

549
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,000
- Should I go first?
- Go ahead.

550
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,700
- Okay, go ahead.
- Is this even necessary?

551
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:16,000
- When will we be served lunch?
- I think right now.

552
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,670
Lunch won't be served just yet.

553
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,240
- I'm saving up for lunch.
- Same here.

554
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,599
- I'll hold onto mine.
- I'd rather eat.

555
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,670
Exactly. Eating is more important.

556
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,079
It costs two tickets
to enter Paradise.

557
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,579
Will you go?

558
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,910
I can't.

559
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,279
Because some jerk stole my tickets.

560
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,750
I'm sorry.

561
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,250
Some jerk stole mine.

562
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,420
Please head to the Inferno.

563
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,859
To the Inferno. Really?

564
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,890
I'll go to the Inferno.
It's the same as the Inferno.

565
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,390
(Going to the Inferno
became a reality.)

566
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,890
(How will it be in the Inferno?)

567
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,960
You've got to be kidding me.

568
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,130
(Next up is Jae Seok.)

569
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,069
(Jae Seok, Number of Tickets: 2)

570
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,069
(He can only be in Paradise
by cashing in all his tickets.)

571
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,130
Two?

572
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,839
(He can only be in Paradise
by cashing in all his tickets.)

573
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:56,109
(He takes out his tickets.)

574
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,980
I'll spend them.
Saving up for later will only...

575
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,150
Am I off to Paradise?

576
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,109
(Act-first-think-later Jae Seok
decides to go to Paradise.)

577
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,950
Don't I need my jacket?

578
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:06,980
Darn.

579
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:08,349
You have five, so...

580
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,089
- Exactly.
- We should spend our tickets.

581
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,819
- You're right.
- Can't you give me one?

582
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,960
- The rich must spend.
- I'll give you one.

583
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,029
- Why would you do that?
- No, don't!

584
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,390
- Don't.
- What's wrong with you?

585
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,799
Let him be.
Why would you give me one?

586
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,559
- Because I'm a fan.
- Don't.

587
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,829
- Give me one too, then.
- Seriously?

588
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,470
- What are you doing?
- He's giving me one.

589
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,539
That's not how you play
on Running Man.

590
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,970
- Don't do that.
- But Eun Tae wants to.

591
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,210
- This isn't how you play.
- You're going about it wrong.

592
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,579
- Don't be too generous.
- That's not how you play.

593
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,579
- Don't waste your money like that.
- Exactly.

594
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,779
- What's wrong with you?
- But he's offering.

595
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,049
- Give us all one.
- He's so kind.

596
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,019
That's just how sweet Eun Tae is.

597
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,450
You'll regret
wasting your tickets like this.

598
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,990
- Put it back.
- If not...

599
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,359
Is it wiser to spend our tickets?

600
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,319
(Next, Haha enters the Ticket Zone.)

601
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,730
(Haha only has 2 tickets as well.)

602
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,700
Jae Seok and I stole the tickets.

603
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,500
(A confession?)

604
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,200
We each took one.

605
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,640
(Haha and Jae Seok
stole Seok Sam's tickets?)

606
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,309
(Earlier,
while they changed clothes)

607
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,910
It'll be over if we lose these two.

608
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,109
(Rummaging)

609
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:07,779
(Chuckling)

610
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,480
- I took Seok Jin's.
- Did you steal them?

611
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,650
Did you?

612
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,880
Was this caught on camera?

613
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,319
(Jae Seok and Haha
each took 1 of Seok Jin's tickets.)

614
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,490
I'll hold onto mine.

615
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,319
I should save mine
if I'm to eat later.

616
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,359
(Mr. Free Meals saves his tickets
for lunch.)

617
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,690
(He heads to the Inferno
where Seok Sam awaits.)

618
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,599
- What on earth?
- Didn't you spend yours?

619
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,730
(The Inferno is outdoors?)

620
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,799
Did you choose the Inferno?

621
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,299
Yes.

622
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:29,700
Good for you.

623
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,599
- What on earth?
- Unbelievable.

624
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,299
Look. Check out the ice.

625
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,869
Is this real ice?

626
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:36,910
(The icy Inferno
where everything froze over...)

627
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,940
(due to a subzero temperature)

628
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,240
It froze over.

629
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,339
Gosh, it's freezing.

630
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,380
(Real ice)

631
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,549
Is that food?

632
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,650
- As long as it's not food.
- It isn't.

633
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,349
It's cold out here.

634
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:49,190
You need to watch yours, Seok Jin.

635
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,019
It was careless of me.

636
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,089
Seok Jin, here's your jacket.

637
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:54,190
I see mine's there.

638
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,589
Jong Kook, did you choose
the Inferno as well?

639
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,529
- I'd rather spend these to eat.
- You didn't spend yours?

640
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:58,700
He's saving his.

641
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,299
We're going to cash them in
for meals.

642
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,200
Isn't this on?

643
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,700
Why is this here
when it's not even turned on?

644
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,000
Because it's the Inferno.

645
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,470
Because it's the Inferno?

646
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,009
You can check out
the menu in the Inferno.

647
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:09,369
The Inferno has its own menu.

648
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,740
- What's on the menu?
- The menu in the Inferno.

649
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,440
- DIY bungeoppang.
- Bungeoppang.

650
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,950
- Red bean or custard.
- Red bean or custard.

651
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,109
That costs a ticket.

652
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,609
DIY...

653
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,450
- black coffee costs a ticket.
- Black coffee costs a ticket.

654
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,680
How about a cup of citron tea?

655
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,490
- Wait, do we have to spend one?
- Don't we get one?

656
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,950
The stove costs a ticket.

657
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,390
You're right.

658
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,559
- Per person...
- You get two.

659
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,460
They'll turn it on
if we spend our tickets.

660
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,829
- Look.
- This is annoying.

661
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,400
Hello.

662
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,029
(Next up is Mr. Sweet Guy.)

663
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,900
I'd like my time on Running Man
to be stress-free.

664
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
(Eun Tae, Number of Tickets: 5)

665
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:42,410
To Paradise.

666
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:44,880
- I'll head to Paradise.
- Sure.

667
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,109
(He chooses Paradise
in an elegant tone.)

668
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,680
I see the camera is
following me around.

669
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,119
(He arrives in Paradise.)

670
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,150
Hello.

671
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,890
Hey, Eun Tae.

672
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,190
Mr. Nice Guy is here.

673
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,119
Goodness.

674
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,089
This sure is Paradise!

675
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:01,559
From fruits to...

676
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,230
That looks good.

677
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,660
(Freshly-made winter snacks)

678
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,799
This is incredible.

679
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,299
What's all this?

680
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,329
(Paradise, a place
rich with food and entertainment)

681
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,869
There's even a claw machine!

682
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:13,599
- He's a sweetheart.
- So I heard.

683
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,640
Hardly.

684
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,240
- I'm glad you came.
- Eun Tae.

685
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,180
Could you perhaps...

686
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,640
spend a ticket...

687
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,210
- Should I?
- and get us bungeoppang?

688
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,609
Isn't he nice?

689
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,019
Could he be nicer?

690
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,420
He doesn't get angry about anything.

691
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:27,920
Check out the menu first.

692
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,089
- Right.
- Here,

693
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,259
we can have bungeoppang
for just a ticket.

694
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,589
We can all eat.

695
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:35,529
- Then I'll spend one.
- Hi!

696
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,589
Ye Eun, you also need
to give us a ticket.

697
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,099
(Ddochi makes her entrance
at an impeccable timing.)

698
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,430
- Why?
- Eun Tae spent one.

699
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,630
We all spent one as well.

700
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,140
Come on. Hand it over.

701
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,440
Red bean or custard.

702
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,039
Eun Tae only knows how to say yes.

703
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:50,410
- I won't give up mine.
- Eun Tae only knows how to say yes.

704
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,940
Three red bean and...

705
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,140
- Hey.
- custard.

706
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,049
- Give us one.
- You must give us one.

707
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,210
- What do you mean?
- For bungeoppang.

708
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,619
You need to spend one for this.

709
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,420
Hold on a second. Let me see.

710
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:01,789
- It's true.
- For bungeoppang?

711
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:03,089
- You had 5 each.
- How can you not spend 1...

712
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,819
- when you had five in total?
- Also...

713
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,460
- Sweet Eun Tae didn't think twice.
- You must spend one.

714
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,490
- He wanted to treat us.
- He's nice but...

715
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,029
- It's true.
- But here...

716
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,190
I'll pay for us all.

717
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,960
(I'll pay for us all.)

718
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,259
No, you need to spend a ticket.

719
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,369
- Aren't you going to play?
- Exactly.

720
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,940
- Let's have iced citron tea.
- And coffee.

721
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,269
We'll also have citron tea.

722
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:21,670
- Here.
- We'll have citron tea.

723
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,779
It'll cost you two tickets
to enter Paradise.

724
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:25,839
Sure.

725
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:27,509
Many spent their tickets.

726
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,549
(Kyu Hyun, Number of Tickets: 3)

727
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,880
This many went to Paradise?

728
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,279
Hold on. Two...

729
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,480
How many tickets do you have?

730
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,619
I have three.

731
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,450
At least three people
went to Paradise.

732
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,359
(What will Kyu Hyun choose to do
now that he completed his research?)

733
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,490
You're lucky today.

734
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,960
- I'm lucky today.
- Hey.

735
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,700
- Team Paradise.
- I'm lucky today.

736
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,660
- Hey.
- Kyu Hyun, you must pay up.

737
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,069
- You must pay up.
- You don't.

738
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:50,829
- Kyu Hyun, you must pay up.
- What?

739
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,599
- We need beverages.
- You'll pay for the claw machine.

740
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,369
What about our beverages?

741
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,369
- Let's have beverages.
- Beverages and...

742
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,809
Jae Seok, will Kyu Hyun
pay for the claw machine?

743
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:57,940
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

744
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,640
Will you go to Paradise
or the Inferno?

745
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,009
(Seok Hoon, Number of Tickets: 2)

746
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,309
Where did the others go?

747
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,450
- They're not all in one place.
- What's the ratio?

748
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,579
I can't tell you that.

749
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,289
How long will I have
to be in the Inferno?

750
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,519
How many times
will we make this choice?

751
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,259
(After a swarm of questions)

752
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,259
I...

753
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,029
I'll go to the Inferno.

754
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,859
I must get a taste of misfortune.

755
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,369
Then I'll know
what Paradise is like.

756
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:23,630
Are you all in the Inferno?

757
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,369
- This is the Inferno. You too?
- I came to the Inferno.

758
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:27,369
- Welcome to the Inferno.
- Thanks.

759
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:29,470
Here in the Inferno, you must work.

760
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,509
While you're here,

761
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:33,509
so that Team Paradise
can enjoy their time,

762
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:36,009
as soon as you get an order,
you must make and deliver it...

763
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,380
- to them.
- We make it? Okay.

764
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,349
- We chose the Inferno.
- You can eat as well,

765
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,650
but of course,
you must pay with a ticket.

766
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,259
I don't have any.
Can I take out a loan?

767
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,960
- No loans.
- No?

768
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,990
They just placed an order,
so get cooking.

769
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,799
- What?
- Three red bean bungeoppang...

770
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,559
and three custard cream bungeoppang.

771
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,660
- Okay.
- Red bean 3, custard cream 3.

772
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,569
- We make the batter? How?
- How?

773
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,599
- This is the batter mix.
- Yes.

774
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,000
Make the batter with this,

775
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,970
and then pour it in with the kettle.

776
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,940
- The bowl...
- Four citron teas, two coffees...

777
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,880
- were ordered too.
- Don't we spread something on?

778
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,450
They ordered citron tea?

779
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:12,079
- Citron tea?
- I'll make the teas over here.

780
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,920
- Yes, do that.
- Make 4 citron teas and 2 coffees.

781
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,490
- Let's divide the tasks.
- I'll make the batter.

782
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,190
- It's not too windy.
- Four citron teas and...

783
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,990
What coffee? Hot coffee?

784
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,490
I'll make the batter.

785
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,759
- Do you know how?
- The batter...

786
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,559
Bungeoppang batter
looked pretty watery.

787
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,500
- Let's play on the claw machine.
- Do you know...

788
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,569
- There's a reason we must play.
- What is it?

789
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,569
- There are tickets in here.
- No way.

790
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,269
- My gosh.
- Play quick.

791
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:34,799
- Kyu Hyun, you play.
- Insert a ticket.

792
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,109
No, I only have one left.

793
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,380
Play with one and win at least two.

794
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,309
- No, thanks.
- Look at him.

795
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,450
- No, don't.
- You can use mine.

796
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,680
- No, don't.
- You can use mine.

797
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,920
This guy is just too nice.
Keep it for now.

798
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,250
(Angel Eun Tae wants so badly
to donate his tickets.)

799
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,920
- Keep it for now.
- I want to use it.

800
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,490
- No.
- No. Put it back in your bag.

801
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,990
- We can use it to play.
- No. Put it back.

802
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,630
- There are so many in there.
- No. Put it back.

803
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,500
Play quick. Use a ticket.

804
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,200
I'll give it to you if I get one.
Hurry up and play.

805
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,099
- Do you mean that? It's mine?
- I promise.

806
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:04,769
- Wait.
- You'll play?

807
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:05,839
Yes.

808
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,369
- Give me one ticket.
- I'm a master at this.

809
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,809
- Are you really?
- Jae Seok, you'll play alone?

810
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,940
- Just one time.
- Okay.

811
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,509
This is my money so why...

812
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,109
- Shall I play first?
- Yes, you go first.

813
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,009
That one there...

814
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,619
This one, the bear...

815
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,720
That looks like it's in the way.

816
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,990
- It is.
- Can't you just...

817
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,990
- nudge it?
- But...

818
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,119
Play first. Let's see how it feels.

819
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,460
Whether it's stiff or loose...

820
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,730
One person has to play this.

821
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,759
- I'm done for. This one...
- Still,

822
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,259
- the crew used elastic bands.
- Yes.

823
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,500
To add more friction.

824
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,029
- Why did you grab it there?
- Why did you grab it there?

825
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,039
- It's a skill.
- You got it.

826
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,099
- No, that's...
- You didn't grab it right.

827
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,569
You need to grab the head.

828
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,809
(He lifted it.)

829
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:49,579
(Success on the first try?)

830
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,250
Se Chan!

831
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,480
(He scored a big one in one go!)

832
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,150
- How did you do that?
- My gosh.

833
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:58,089
- That's crazy.
- Se Chan! What are you really?

834
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,490
- What are you?
- I did it.

835
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,990
- Wait. This is serious.
- My gosh.

836
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,259
- That was my ticket.
- Yes.

837
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,660
- Wait.
- That was my 50 cents.

838
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,730
- Keep it.
- Se Chan. Listen.

839
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,259
- That was my 50 cents.
- I know it was.

840
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,200
- Don't forget that.
- Wait.

841
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,400
- It was my 50 cents.
- Yes, it was.

842
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,039
- It would be fun if we all won.
- Is this even possible?

843
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,410
(They have 2 more tries.)

844
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,869
- It would be fun if we all won.
- Is this even possible?

845
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,480
- I got two tickets.
- It's easy to win.

846
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
How did you do that?

847
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,380
- I didn't expect it.
- Aim for the elastic bands.

848
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,809
- You got it!
- I got it. It's perfect.

849
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,250
(A perfect grab!)

850
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,480
It's perfect.

851
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,190
Be quiet.

852
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,650
(Will Jae Seok succeed
in one try as well?)

853
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,119
(Fail)

854
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,390
(What a shame!)

855
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,859
That was... Why did it fall
when we almost had it?

856
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:40,099
- We got the bear but not that?
- Try again. It bounced.

857
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,500
- We have one more try.
- Yes.

858
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,569
It's the last coin.

859
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,970
- Whose turn is it?
- I'm bad at this. You do it.

860
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,299
Why do you keep playing
when you're bad at this?

861
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,109
- Right now...
- Why is he playing?

862
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:51,609
- No, just do it.
- Shouldn't Se Chan play?

863
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:53,109
- It's done.
- Good luck.

864
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,980
- Go for it!
- No, move a bit more.

865
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,380
- Go up. A bit more.
- A bit more.

866
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,279
- Go further.
- This will do.

867
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,079
- I don't think that's it.
- It looks right.

868
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,289
- We didn't get it.
- The earlier mark was right.

869
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,420
It was...

870
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,920
(What?)

871
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,490
(The puppy is floating!)

872
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,730
(Will it keep moving?)

873
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,599
(Another fail)

874
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:16,400
(Oh, come on!)

875
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,900
Come on!

876
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,170
- Come on.
- Jae Seok!

877
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,470
Jae Seok!

878
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,309
How much did we spend?

879
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,309
Did we spend everything?

880
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:27,779
- We spent everything.
- We still won that.

881
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,180
- With that...
- Let's use one.

882
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,779
- Shall we play again?
- With one ticket.

883
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,980
- Let's exchange one of those.
- Okay.

884
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,720
- Can we keep doing this?
- Yes.

885
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,819
- Can you turn off the heater?
- Yes, the heater.

886
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:38,819
Se Chan, you do it.

887
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,690
- Eun Tae, you try.
- Yes, Eun Tae.

888
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,130
- Yes, Eun Tae.
- He's so kind.

889
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,029
- He's good-natured.
- He's so nice.

890
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:46,000
Go for whatever you want.

891
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,299
Pick the one you want.

892
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,500
I think we can get
the puppy this time.

893
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,029
Let him get whatever he wants.

894
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,500
- He's so nice that...
- He'll get us something.

895
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,869
- Good people win.
- I've never met someone so nice.

896
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,769
- Right.
- How can someone like him exist?

897
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,809
(I'll save you, puppy dog.)

898
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:01,410
He's like Santa Claus.
Look, it's so still.

899
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,009
- You got it.
- You got it.

900
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,750
- He got it.
- No way.

901
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,279
(Can he save the puppy?)

902
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,490
We got it this time.

903
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,450
(A very close loss)

904
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,819
- This is a con.
- It's a con.

905
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:15,190
- It's madness.
- It came right up.

906
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,690
- The head's too big.
- The head's too big.

907
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,700
- As long as it hooks.
- We got it.

908
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,859
- It's hooked.
- We got it.

909
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,970
Oh, no.

910
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,269
- It has to go in.
- It must grab the inside.

911
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:26,339
- It's in!
- We got it. Now be quiet.

912
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,509
Why is it always me?

913
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:31,940
- Shall we use one more?
- No.

914
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,480
- Don't.
- Why...

915
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,410
- Now's not the time.
- Leave it.

916
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,910
- Don't use yours.
- This isn't how we play.

917
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,049
- We can play and win.
- No.

918
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:41,779
- Is there anything else?
- Can I eat something?

919
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,920
- Shall we play? You have one.
- It's Paradise.

920
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,390
- Yes. Let's play once more.
- You and I should play again.

921
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,690
We'll each give up a ticket.

922
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,930
Jae Seok, you don't have any.

923
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,359
- What?
- My gosh.

924
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,660
(Flustered)

925
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,599
- What?
- Oh, Seok Jin's.

926
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,500
- Seok Jin's tickets...
- Haha gave me one.

927
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,700
Seok Jin's ticket...

928
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,299
- We can return it to him.
- Yes.

929
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,009
(They keep using tickets
to relive the glory of winning.)

930
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,140
- Let's eat something too.
- Come on!

931
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,279
We must pay.

932
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,539
We must pay to eat?

933
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,710
Yes. We must pay.

934
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,779
(Making Inferno bungeoppang
is so gloomy.)

935
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:13,019
I need to do this twice. My gosh.

936
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,549
They ordered six bungeoppang.

937
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,220
If it were four,
I could make them in one go.

938
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,990
- Three custard creams.
- Yes, three, and red bean...

939
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,119
(Lots of custard cream)

940
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,190
Seok Hoon,
aren't you being too generous?

941
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,390
Why are you adding so much?

942
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,200
- Should we not?
- No.

943
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,059
What you're doing is normal...

944
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,130
What you're doing is normal...

945
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,200
(This is Running Man
red bean bungeoppang.)

946
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,839
- The red bean...
- This is how it's done.

947
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,740
This has red bean filling.

948
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:37,740
It's has some filling.

949
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,640
Isn't that too little?

950
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,009
- Still...
- You can't even smell the filling.

951
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
(Snorting laugh)

952
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,450
I can't eat anything. Shoot.

953
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,420
Can't I even taste-test?

954
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,119
I can?

955
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,119
(He can't even lick the teaspoon.)

956
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,160
Running Man is so merciless.

957
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,089
Do you know how strict they are?

958
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,430
My gosh. There's no leniency at all.

959
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,869
That's why we all turned evil.

960
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,299
(The monsters
that Running Man created...)

961
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,670
That one has three tickets.

962
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,670
(are addicted to winning
Paradise Tickets.)

963
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,869
There's one with three?

964
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,210
(Jae Seok hasn't given up yet.)

965
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,470
I think that'll do.

966
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,109
- Jae Seok. You got it.
- It got a good hold.

967
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:16,210
You got it. Now be quiet.

968
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,119
- You can get it this time.
- Go for the butt.

969
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,880
- You can get the bottom now.
- Grab its bottom.

970
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,789
How much do you have, Jae Seok?

971
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,690
- You haven't won so far.
- You have so much money.

972
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,720
- The head.
- Aim for...

973
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,259
- the elastic band.
- I need to grab it right there.

974
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:30,859
- You got it.
- Not this time.

975
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,430
- Can't we aim for the head?
- Let's give up.

976
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,170
- You grabbed it wrong.
- It's fine if the bands hold.

977
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,970
You got it.
The elastic bands will do it.

978
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,900
(Oh, dear...)

979
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
(They take a break
with one more coin left.)

980
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,940
How much do you have, Jae Seok?

981
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,140
Shall I have a go?

982
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
(The Dongducheon Claw steps up.)

983
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,339
- Try for the bear.
- What a pity. It was close.

984
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,609
I think you'll do it this time.

985
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,150
I don't care. Grab the head.

986
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,980
- You got it.
- You got it.

987
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,490
- You got it.
- I think this is it.

988
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,289
It's hooked. Be quiet. Please.

989
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,789
(He did it!)

990
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,259
(Dongducheon's Hand of Midas
won a 2nd time.)

991
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,500
Se Chan, you're on a roll today.

992
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,869
- You got it.
- It's your day today.

993
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:10,130
Be quiet, everyone.

994
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:11,369
You got the leg.

995
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,200
Ji Ye Eun!

996
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,809
- What a day this is.
- My gosh.

997
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,009
- Ye Eun! What's going on?
- What's happening?

998
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:20,109
- I feel so good.
- Ye Eun!

999
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,779
It's a good day for me.

1000
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,009
- Yes, Ye Eun. You're amazing.
- This is crazy.

1001
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,210
Take it, Eun Tae.

1002
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,650
(Eun Tae and Kyu Hyun get a ticket
for just standing to the side.)

1003
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,190
This is my last try.

1004
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,589
(The claw machine expert
put in his last coin.)

1005
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:33,890
- That one.
- Let's go for this one.

1006
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,630
That one's too thin.

1007
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,990
- It looks fine. Go far back.
- It's too slim.

1008
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,099
- You need to go further.
- It won't go that far.

1009
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,029
- It doesn't go that far.
- It doesn't.

1010
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:44,299
- Then this one might do.
- Let's try it.

1011
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,869
- It might... No?
- No.

1012
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,170
(He pressed the down button.)

1013
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,369
- It might... No?
- No.

1014
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:51,240
- It's in.
- You got it.

1015
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
- It's hooked.
- It's on.

1016
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,880
You got it.

1017
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,349
- Hey.
- Be quiet.

1018
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,380
(Is it a success at last?)

1019
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,049
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

1020
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,150
(It froze.)

1021
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,759
(Oh, what?)

1022
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,319
- No, you didn't get it.
- What is this?

1023
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,930
- This is...
- What is going on?

1024
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,630
- What is this?
- What is this?

1025
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,730
There we go.

1026
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,829
What is this? There we go.

1027
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,960
This was...

1028
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,099
(They end up rescuing it
by using force.)

1029
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,170
- How many are there?
- How many?

1030
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,470
- Two? One?
- One.

1031
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,299
- There are two!
- There are two!

1032
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,769
- Let's take one each...
- All right...

1033
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,240
Did anyone order tea?

1034
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,069
- Oh, yes. I'll take those.
- Did anyone order tea?

1035
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,779
Four cups of citron tea
and two cups of coffee.

1036
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:28,380
- But isn't this plain water?
- Here you go.

1037
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,950
No, try it.

1038
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,349
- Oh, that's nice.
- Isn't it good?

1039
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,319
The bungeoppang is so good.

1040
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,750
(Let me have a little.)

1041
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,650
- Have a seat here.
- Who would like some coffee?

1042
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,289
If you're done, then...

1043
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:41,559
Okay, got it.

1044
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,960
(Saying bye to him cheerfully)

1045
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,230
This is nice.

1046
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,759
Hey, but you should come here
after using the ticket,

1047
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,029
- no matter what.
- You really should.

1048
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,069
You get a chance if you come here.

1049
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,670
If you come here... Over there...

1050
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,000
Going there to save...

1051
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,299
- means nothing.
- Right.

1052
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,740
- Is there something in there too?
- Let's sit.

1053
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,670
- I think it's to have fun.
- To have fun?

1054
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,180
These...

1055
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,779
It might be fun to bet tickets
as we play with these.

1056
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:03,809
- What...
- Oh, my.

1057
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,519
- You are...
- You seem to be hooked.

1058
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,950
- I don't know about betting.
- No?

1059
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,719
- A little...
- What should I say?

1060
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,150
He has a unique personality.

1061
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,650
He's like...

1062
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,119
But he has no bad intentions.

1063
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,619
- He's so pure.
- Right, he has no bad intentions.

1064
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,460
- He is very pure.
- And right now...

1065
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,460
We have to eat the bungeoppang
from the Inferno first.

1066
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,900
- We have to eat the bungeoppang.
- The bungeoppang.

1067
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,630
By the way,
is the hygiene okay over there?

1068
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,730
- The hygiene...
- Their hygiene is a bit...

1069
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,769
(Laughing)

1070
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,940
If they laugh like that,
their saliva will go into the food.

1071
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,869
But that is important.

1072
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,409
- Right.
- Hygiene is so important.

1073
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,179
- If you're cooking for yourself...
- Wait, let me call and tell them...

1074
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,849
- not to laugh while making food.
- About hygiene.

1075
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:39,579
- To wear masks.
- Yes, they should wear masks.

1076
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,849
- Ye Eun is sensitive about this.
- Or you know those things...

1077
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,849
- I'm sensitive about that stuff.
- There are those things.

1078
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,590
- Excuse me, sir.
- What?

1079
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,389
- It's nothing big, but...
- Yes?

1080
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,960
- about two of our customers here...
- Yes.

1081
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,929
- brought up something important.
- What is that?

1082
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,869
You're cooking without
even wearing masks.

1083
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:57,199
Your saliva will get in the food.

1084
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,599
How would saliva get in here, man?

1085
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,269
- Look.
- So,

1086
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,469
- don't laugh and talk as you cook.
- Right.

1087
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,369
(Hanging up)

1088
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,610
(He touched their nerves
as he laughed in the mere Inferno.)

1089
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,780
If they're worried
about our saliva going in,

1090
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
- they shouldn't eat, then.
- I know.

1091
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,650
But we might get complaints again,

1092
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,949
- so we should wear them.
- Hey, but this is...

1093
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:16,989
(They still do as they're told.)

1094
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,489
Seok Hoon is nice.

1095
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:20,389
Everyone with protruding mouths
is over there.

1096
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,960
I know. Those ugly guys.

1097
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,159
(They're chatting as they spray
their saliva like sprinklers.)

1098
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,429
(The bungeoppang made
while wearing masks gets delivered.)

1099
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,400
Excuse me. Your bungeoppang is here.

1100
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,199
- Sorry, but you can't...
- Hey, you keep...

1101
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,500
- You can't keep talking.
- What? We're not talking.

1102
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,539
You can't talk
while holding the food.

1103
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,400
- I'm holding it far away like this.
- This is red bean...

1104
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,809
- But this...
- Is there red bean paste in there?

1105
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,210
You'll find red bean paste
if you look closely.

1106
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,639
- But...
- Why are they so thin?

1107
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,980
- They're so...
- Hey.

1108
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,480
- If you keep doing this,
- I mean, we're paying for these.

1109
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,909
you'll get reported to
the consumer panel.

1110
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,219
- Just...
- The buns are too skinny.

1111
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:47,250
Just try them.

1112
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,519
- Don't tell us to just try them.
- But this isn't right.

1113
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,590
- What do you want us to do?
- I mean, sir.

1114
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,949
- Make them again.
- These are seriously...

1115
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:51,989
- If you overcharge like this...
- Hey.

1116
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:52,989
- Hey, mister.
- Just try them before you say that.

1117
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:55,760
- You'll be arrested for this.
- Just try them first.

1118
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,429
- Do they usually fight like that?
- Yes.

1119
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:58,900
(Laughing)

1120
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,300
And this one isn't fully cooked.

1121
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,329
- There is no red bean paste.
- I mean, this is...

1122
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,800
- You'll find it if you look.
- Look at this.

1123
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,099
The red bean paste
is only in the tail.

1124
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,400
- What is this bungeoppang...
- I mean,

1125
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,440
- What is this...
- we couldn't give you...

1126
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,039
lots of red bean paste
because of financial difficulties.

1127
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,239
That's just our...

1128
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,309
I can't taste them.

1129
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,409
- What is this?
- I mean...

1130
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,480
- That's red bean paste.
- What is this?

1131
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,250
- Is that a dot or something?
- You call this bungeoppang?

1132
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,510
It is bungeoppang.

1133
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,710
This makes no sense.

1134
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,750
You can't keep doing business...

1135
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,780
- like this.
- Sorry.

1136
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,820
It's not that.

1137
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,889
Then order from somewhere else.

1138
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,420
We only put in
this much red bean paste.

1139
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,460
- We're paying with tickets...
- This is a very hard...

1140
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,530
- to have a good time here.
- You came here like Santa Claus.

1141
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,929
- Right.
- It's not like a big feast...

1142
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:33,030
- Bring us some plump bungeoppang.
- Please do this for us.

1143
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,130
(Right then,
a bribe with a Shine Muscat)

1144
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,329
Please do this for us.

1145
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,670
Well, that changes things.

1146
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,940
(His animosity melts away
at a single piece of Shine Muscat.)

1147
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,170
Please do this for us.

1148
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,539
- Make them nicely.
- Yes, make them plump.

1149
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,809
(Eating)

1150
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,539
- And I will...
- In that case...

1151
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,409
Hey, Jae Seok is
about to give him something.

1152
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,780
- I'll give you one. Take this.
- Oh, really?

1153
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,980
- I'll really make some good ones.
- For real?

1154
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,489
- For real.
- And...

1155
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,449
- Yes?
- Haha took one earlier.

1156
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,659
I'll give you one back.

1157
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:01,260
- Haha took one?
- Yes.

1158
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,559
- But why are you giving me one?
- Gosh, how heartwarming.

1159
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,989
Oh, I took one too.

1160
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,429
He's owning up to it.

1161
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh, indeed.

1162
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,269
- He's so honest.
- Gosh, Saint Yu.

1163
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:13,769
(They even give him a standing ovation
for bravely coming clean.)

1164
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:15,610
- Look forward to the bungeoppang!
- Sure.

1165
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,510
- Please make them well.
- Yes, I will.

1166
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,510
Gosh, I'll make some good ones.

1167
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,650
(He even falls for it so easily.)

1168
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,449
It's his to begin with,
but he's so happy.

1169
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,550
It's his to begin with,
but he's so happy.

1170
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,519
- Gosh, hey.
- Did they love them?

1171
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:32,250
No, they sent them back.

1172
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,820
Why did they send them back?

1173
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,929
There wasn't enough red bean paste.
Well, okay.

1174
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,659
We should do it right.
I'll make some good ones this time.

1175
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,300
I'll make them well
so they don't get sent back.

1176
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,900
We could make another batch here.

1177
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,300
- Yes, make some over there.
- Okay.

1178
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,809
- Use this oil.
- Okay.

1179
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,079
I should make some amazing ones.

1180
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:55,579
These guys.
I'll show them how it's done.

1181
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:56,849
(A whole bunch of filling)

1182
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:57,849
- What is it?
- I don't think it'll work...

1183
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:58,849
with that much filling.

1184
00:37:58,849 --> 00:37:59,880
No, it'll still work.

1185
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,550
- Gosh, that's too much.
- No, it's usually done like this.

1186
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,320
People who add a lot of filling...

1187
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,889
That's too much, Seok Jin.

1188
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,789
But then, it'll just burst out.

1189
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,429
You go like this,

1190
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,530
and when you close the lid...

1191
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,860
Oh, okay. What?

1192
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,730
(It ends up overflowing.)

1193
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,369
- I told you.
- What do I do?

1194
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:23,510
I told you it wasn't right.

1195
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:25,679
- Hey, I...
- We told you.

1196
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,579
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

1197
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:28,909
I couldn't help it.

1198
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,409
Hey, this isn't working.
This is ruined.

1199
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,320
(The other batch becomes
like porridge.)

1200
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,519
What's wrong with this?

1201
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,820
Why did you do that?

1202
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,090
Did you throw this out?

1203
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,719
- That got sent back.
- Oh, they got sent back.

1204
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,960
- You threw them out, so is it okay?
- Yes, they're okay.

1205
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,760
You can eat those.

1206
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,860
- The ones that were thrown out.
- Pick it up within three seconds.

1207
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,230
- They were just thrown out.
- Hey, they are...

1208
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,630
- Right.
- Yes, you can eat those.

1209
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,130
You must've had a dogged childhood.

1210
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,500
(You must've had
a dogged childhood.)

1211
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:57,610
By the way, you have the scarf on
to protect your throat, right?

1212
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,610
I'm trying to stay in character
for "The Man Who Laughs."

1213
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,409
Weren't you trying to imitate
Bae Yong Joon?

1214
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,380
I thought you watched a movie
or drama with Bae Yong Joon in it.

1215
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,650
I did play
that role back in the day.

1216
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,719
Eun Tae is sitting there naturally
without anything on.

1217
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,190
You seem like you're making
such a fuss.

1218
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,090
Usually, the guys
who aren't as good make a fuss.

1219
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,659
- They blame the equipment.
- Yes, right.

1220
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:17,389
- The true experts do anything.
- They don't care.

1221
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,199
- Eun Tae doesn't have anything.
- He's just himself.

1222
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,159
- It's my 15th year doing musicals.
- I know.

1223
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,099
- He's been doing this for a while.
- For 15 years?

1224
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:26,539
- He's such a good singer.
- He really is great.

1225
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,269
- I thought he was only good at pop.
- No. He's a great singer.

1226
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,539
But he was like
a real musical actor earlier.

1227
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:31,809
- He had that musical tone.
- Yes.

1228
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,079
- He is a musical actor.
- He is a musical actor.

1229
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:35,440
- I'm an actual actor.
- Oh, right.

1230
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,309
- She's doubting you.
- No.

1231
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,349
- Your tone was...
- If you watch me once,

1232
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,780
you won't be able to say this to me.

1233
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,280
(Getting angry)

1234
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:45,150
- Hey, invite her. Show her.
- I really should.

1235
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,460
- You know? Seriously.
- Please invite me.

1236
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,619
Here he comes.

1237
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,460
- Finally?
- They must be finished now.

1238
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:51,260
Eun Taek.

1239
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,530
- Eun Tae, so...
- Oh, yes.

1240
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,829
- Who's Eun Taek?
- Oh, sorry.

1241
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,829
- Eun Taek?
- Eun Taek.

1242
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:59,539
I created something that's not on
the menu for you, Eun Tae.

1243
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,269
- What is that?
- It's hotteok.

1244
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,769
I added so much red bean paste.

1245
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,179
You had a rumor go around
over there, right?

1246
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:08,409
- A rumor that Eun Tae is a fool.
- Not at all.

1247
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,110
This is the only one.
I can't make this anymore.

1248
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,110
- Thank you so much.
- I made it with hotteok mix.

1249
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,050
- Hey, taste it before paying.
- I'll take it.

1250
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,250
- Just give me one ticket.
- Oh, okay.

1251
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,289
- No.
- No.

1252
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,349
- Just give me one ticket.
- Oh, okay.

1253
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,789
- No.
- No, why are you doing that?

1254
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:20,889
- No, Eun Tae, don't pay him.
- Put it back.

1255
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:22,059
- No, but later, I will...
- Come here.

1256
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,289
No, just leave
if you're going to do this.

1257
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:24,590
- I'll repay your kindness.
- Just go if you'll be like this.

1258
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,960
- Haha, don't use people.
- No, for real.

1259
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,599
- No, this is really warm. Eun Tae.
- Seriously, this guy...

1260
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,730
- Stop using the nice guy.
- No.

1261
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,099
- Just come and sit here.
- No, you can't.

1262
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,840
- Instead...
- That guy will get in trouble.

1263
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,639
- Instead, you should take this.
- Why give him a strawberry?

1264
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,340
- Take this, at least.
- Don't give him a strawberry.

1265
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,670
- It's good if you eat it together.
- No, just...

1266
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,940
- I made...
- Just go.

1267
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,340
- Eun Tae, just give me one...
- Get out.

1268
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,750
- This is Paradise. Don't come up.
- No, but...

1269
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,150
- Give that here.
- Just get out.

1270
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,710
- Why are you...
- Just hurry up and go.

1271
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,449
- In any way...
- I'll pay you in secret later.

1272
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,219
- What? Give me one, then.
- Just go.

1273
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,650
- Later. Eat this.
- Leave it here and go.

1274
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,090
- Give it here, then.
- Pay me later.

1275
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,590
- Eun Tae?
- Yes.

1276
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,690
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1277
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,730
- Seriously, this guy is...
- Later.

1278
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,159
You'll go to the Inferno
if you don't.

1279
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,500
- Hey, but...
- That guy...

1280
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,860
- Hey, mister.
- Eun Tae.

1281
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,730
- Go and get us our bungeoppang.
- Then...

1282
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,929
- Hurry up with our bungeoppang.
- We paid.

1283
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:06,039
- Tell them to bring it. Seriously.
- Hurry up and bring it.

1284
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,340
(They promise without any words
but by making eye contact.)

1285
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,570
Why aren't you giving us
our bungeoppang?

1286
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,409
(He acts like he's leaving,)

1287
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:17,079
(but he just stays
and watches Eun Tae.)

1288
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,349
(Throw it to me now.)

1289
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,289
He's preparing to pay Haha again.

1290
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:25,119
- Are you preparing to pay him?
- No, I'll just...

1291
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,860
- Hey, come on.
- Don't!

1292
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,260
- You can't do that.
- Don't pay him!

1293
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,559
- Eun Tae, you can't do this.
- Why should we pay him?

1294
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,900
- You seriously can't do this!
- No, this isn't right.

1295
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,960
- Get out. Hey!
- Come to your senses.

1296
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,170
Eun Tae, throw it!

1297
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,969
- Come to your senses.
- Eun Tae, throw it!

1298
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
- Why are you doing this?
- You can't give it to him!

1299
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,440
I'm sorry. I got caught.

1300
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,070
(I'm sorry. I got caught.)

1301
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,269
Hey, get out.

1302
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:45,670
- Gosh, seriously...
- You can't pay him.

1303
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,780
(They turn the devil away
at the door.)

1304
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,909
- You can't pay him.
- Seriously.

1305
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:50,579
- Eun Tae is great at "Leave."
- What?

1306
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,309
In "Jesus Christ Superstar,"
he has a line that goes, "Leave!"

1307
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,449
- Show us.
- Yes.

1308
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:54,579
- What is it?
- You should say it when they come.

1309
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,019
Leave!

1310
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,289
(Leave!)

1311
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:00,260
(His "Leave" pierces eardrums
instead of using violence.)

1312
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,219
- Say that when Haha comes later.
- Do that when he comes back.

1313
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,559
(The hotteok man reappears
as he's still hung up on a ticket.)

1314
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,400
Hey, seriously!
Why are you back here? Leave.

1315
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,670
- I mean, I just...
- No, you can't.

1316
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,969
You don't have to pay me.

1317
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,130
Eun Tae won't pay you.

1318
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,900
- Eun Tae, this guy is...
- No, you can't pay him.

1319
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,769
Don't ask Lady Eun for tickets!

1320
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,710
- Seriously, why are you doing this?
- Don't pay him.

1321
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,579
- Eun Tae! Hurry!
- No, don't pay him!

1322
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:23,650
- No, really. Don't!
- No! Hey!

1323
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,650
- Seriously, why are you doing this?
- Don't pay him.

1324
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,849
- Eun Tae!
- No, don't pay him!

1325
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:28,179
- Eun Tae, hurry!
- No, really.

1326
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,090
- Don't! Hey, seriously?
- No! Hey!

1327
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,559
- Gosh, that guy is too nice.
- Let's go.

1328
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,920
- What's wrong with him? Really.
- I love you, Eun Tae.

1329
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,760
Eun Tae, I was born in 1979.

1330
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:39,829
- Oh, right, you're older.
- He's not Eun Taek!

1331
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:41,059
Gosh, that punk.

1332
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,530
(He opens the envelope.)

1333
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,730
Oh, darn it.

1334
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,809
(Running money?)

1335
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,409
Give this to Haha later.

1336
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:54,179
(They used a trick to get rid of
the devil beggar 1 minute ago.)

1337
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,440
Oh, that's good.

1338
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,750
(They used a trick to get rid of
the devil beggar 1 minute ago.)

1339
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,179
He saw it.

1340
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,320
When he comes back,
you should say, "Leave!"

1341
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,750
- Oh, okay.
- He'll get an earful.

1342
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,219
- When he comes... Say it now.
- "Leave!"

1343
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:04,849
Leave!

1344
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,760
(Leave!)

1345
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,019
- Leave!
- Leave!

1346
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,230
(Scammer Ha was taught a lesson
by the pushover he trusted.)

1347
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,900
(A good-triumphs-evil ending)

1348
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,030
I'm sorry, but what's taking
the bungeoppang so long?

1349
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,269
We should just cancel our order.

1350
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,639
What's this?

1351
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,010
- It's a musical.
- We're singing.

1352
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,510
- Is there a stage?
- It's a musical stage.

1353
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,739
- Check this out.
- No way.

1354
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:28,409
- Does it puff out air?
- It's a musical stage.

1355
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,280
- No way.
- We must be...

1356
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,909
- singing up there.
- I guess we have to sing.

1357
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,119
Since we have guests
who are singers...

1358
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,190
- It's like "Challenge 100 Songs."
- Right.

1359
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,250
Will we sing in teams?

1360
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,119
- It's "Challenge 1,000 Songs."
- Is it 1,000?

1361
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,420
- Right.
- Get over here.

1362
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,460
- On "Challenge 1,000 Songs,"
- "Challenge 1,000 Songs."

1363
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,960
I won the golden key.

1364
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:50,599
"Challenge 1,000 Songs?"
Yes, I remember the show.

1365
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:53,940
I'm sure many of you
wish to go to Paradise.

1366
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,800
You'll play a game
to win tickets to Paradise.

1367
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,869
This is The One
Who Sings the Correct Answer.

1368
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:00,409
You will listen to the intro...

1369
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:02,849
and guess the artist and song.

1370
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,710
- If you know the answer,
- Unbelievable.

1371
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,349
- step forward and say the answer.
- Kyu Hyun will be great at this.

1372
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,849
For every correct answer,
that team will win two tickets each.

1373
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,889
- Two tickets per answer?
- Okay.

1374
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:13,889
I'm good at this.

1375
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:15,559
- Are you? Really?
- Totally.

1376
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:16,889
You say you're good at everything.

1377
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,829
- I live and breathe music.
- Do you like music? Okay.

1378
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,960
If it's the correct answer,
you will sing the song...

1379
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,329
to the karaoke version.

1380
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:25,030
For getting a score over 90,

1381
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,000
- A score over 90?
- balloons that randomly...

1382
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,639
have tickets will soar.

1383
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,570
- That's crucial.
- You can win tickets...

1384
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,269
- despite what team you're on.
- Really?

1385
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,639
You will compete in 2 groups of 5.

1386
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,409
The tickets won
will be yours to distribute.

1387
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,079
- Are these the teams?
- Is this our team?

1388
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,150
- The teams...
- Let these be the teams.

1389
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,119
- Wait, that's...
- She's right.

1390
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,849
- These will be the teams.
- The singers are over there!

1391
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,949
(Musical actor 1, 2, and 3)

1392
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,360
- Seok Jin's being sly.
- These will be the teams.

1393
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,420
- Don't play dirty.
- Why not?

1394
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,760
- This is how we're seated.
- That's wrong.

1395
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,860
Let's switch, then.

1396
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,260
- You... What?
- They should be separated.

1397
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,599
- Switch with me.
- No way.

1398
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,170
We'll play rock-paper-scissors
in this order.

1399
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,329
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1400
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:58,530
- Okay!
- Oh, no.

1401
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,239
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1402
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:01,739
- I lost.
- Okay!

1403
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:03,269
- Are you here? We have Ye Eun.
- I know a lot of songs.

1404
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:04,940
- Jong Kook, nice.
- We have a good team.

1405
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,010
- This is good enough.
- I like our team.

1406
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,480
- It's perfectly balanced.
- Nice.

1407
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,050
We should have Kyu Hyun on our team.

1408
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,380
- We've got this.
- We can cover all genres.

1409
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,079
- I know the latest songs.
- You two know a lot.

1410
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,420
- I'm putting my faith in Ye Eun.
- Sure.

1411
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,679
I'm clueless.

1412
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,019
- Trust me.
- We have a good team.

1413
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:18,250
We have a good team.

1414
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,619
- The younger ones are over there.
- But I...

1415
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,159
- You can do this, right?
- I can cover songs...

1416
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:24,789
- from the 90s and the 2000s.
- That's right. Se Chan...

1417
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,500
(Se Chan is an expert on music
from the 90s and the 2000s.)

1418
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,030
I'm a huge fan of songs
released in the 90s and the 2000s.

1419
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,269
- I'm like that too.
- That's not easy.

1420
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,400
I have a question.

1421
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,670
Can Se Chan guess the answer
while someone else sings it?

1422
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,940
As long as you're on the same team,

1423
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,710
- The same team?
- it'll be allowed.

1424
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,010
- We're set.
- As long as it's the same team.

1425
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,409
- We're set.
- Yes, we're set.

1426
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:43,849
- I have another question.
- Why on earth...

1427
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:46,219
Isn't it more important
to get the balloons...

1428
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:50,119
rather than guessing
the song correctly?

1429
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:51,719
No, because if you guess the song,

1430
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,760
- you'll get 2 tickets.
- You start with 2 tickets.

1431
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,789
The whole team?

1432
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:57,329
- The balloons are for ourselves?
- The balloons are a bonus.

1433
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,460
So a score over 90.

1434
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:00,300
Do we need to sing the entire song?

1435
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,929
Just so you know,
lunch will be served...

1436
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,730
during the next trip
to Paradise and the Inferno.

1437
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,030
Lunch!

1438
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:09,000
- We must win.
- I can't afford to lose.

1439
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,969
- We must win.
- Losing isn't an option.

1440
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,139
No joking around.

1441
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:14,179
- No joking around.
- I won't joke around.

1442
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,280
- We must win.
- Let's eat!

1443
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,710
- We must win this.
- We need to succeed.

1444
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,780
- This...
- We must win.

1445
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,380
- Let's do this.
- I'll try my best.

1446
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,550
We must win.

1447
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,349
(Gulping)

1448
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,789
Just run out there.

1449
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:24,789
- Move.
- Move?

1450
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:26,860
- Play the first song.
- Let's do this.

1451
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,360
Let me answer!

1452
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,300
(Jae Seok and Se Chan run out
after hearing the familiar intro.)

1453
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,659
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1454
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,769
Can.

1455
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,929
- Which song by Can?
- Five, four...

1456
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,800
(Glancing)

1457
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,440
- "Spring Days Go By."
- Two, one.

1458
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,739
- "Spring Days Go By."
- Wrong.

1459
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:45,710
- Wrong.
- That's wrong.

1460
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,809
"Spring Days of My Life Go By"
by Can.

1461
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,750
("Spring Days of My Life Go By"
by Can is incorrect.)

1462
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:50,949
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1463
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:52,579
- Move.
- "Spring Days of My Human Life."

1464
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:54,219
- Can.
- "Spring Day of My Life."

1465
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:56,150
- "Spring Day of My Life."
- "Spring Days Go By."

1466
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,650
- Is it a song by Can?
- Let me answer.

1467
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,360
- "Spring Days of My Life" by Can.
- That's it.

1468
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,519
- "Spring Days of My Life" by Can.
- That's it.

1469
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,989
- Okay.
- Yes!

1470
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,059
(The passionate Seok Hoon
is correct.)

1471
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:07,400
Let's have Seok Hoon sing it.

1472
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,559
- I know this song so well.
- I know this song.

1473
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:09,699
- I know it too.
- All right.

1474
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:11,630
- Do it.
- Go for it.

1475
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,170
Just wait for the balloons.

1476
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,739
(The opposing team
can win bonus tickets too.)

1477
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,269
Where will they shoot out from?

1478
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,369
You must get over 90 points.

1479
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,440
- Go for it.
- He's a recording artist!

1480
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,010
(Exclaiming)

1481
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,079
- Bring it!
- We can sing it together.

1482
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,309
("Spring Days of My Life" by Can)

1483
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,650
- We can sing it together.
- Eun Tae, come on.

1484
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:27,920
(Calling Eun Tae for an assist.)

1485
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,719
<i>I roam the fish-smelling quay</i>

1486
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,190
- He's good.
- He's great.

1487
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,590
(Like it's my own world)

1488
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,059
(Tossing)

1489
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,929
(With my two fists, fearlessly)

1490
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:42,159
Get up there.

1491
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,769
<i>I live another day</i>

1492
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,000
Let's go!

1493
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,599
(No hope, no dreams)

1494
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,710
(Adding technique)

1495
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:52,940
(Seok Sam's delighted to be
in the same shot...)

1496
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,139
(with the superstar of musicals.)

1497
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,579
(Delighted)

1498
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,650
Let's go!

1499
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,489
(Singing like a musical actor)

1500
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:05,750
(An assistance from Seok Hoon!)

1501
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,760
(Backup singer Big Nose)

1502
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,159
(The stellar singing
might grant them a high score.)

1503
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:14,960
I can't take this.

1504
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,730
- What a bummer.
- Eun Tae, let's do this!

1505
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:21,599
<i>- Like candles</i>
<i>- Like candles</i>

1506
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,639
<i>- A love that is short</i>
<i>- A love that is short</i>

1507
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:26,309
(The air in the room shifts...)

1508
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:28,409
(with it being sung
by two musical actors.)

1509
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:30,550
- They'll meet the score.
- Darn.

1510
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,449
(Checking the placement
of the balloons)

1511
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,150
(A high-quality performance
by master singers)

1512
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,119
Okay!

1513
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,420
What's the score?

1514
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:39,789
Okay. What's our score?

1515
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,289
Eun Tae, let's go!

1516
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:43,030
(Will they get over 90?)

1517
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,190
(Are you kidding me?
A true thumbs-up!)

1518
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,860
- Darn.
- You know...

1519
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,699
- Wait.
- Hold on. We still get two tickets.

1520
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,929
- You still get 2.
- We still won 2.

1521
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,639
Can you not sing
like musical actors?

1522
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,409
- Sing the karaoke version.
- Remember it's a karaoke.

1523
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:57,570
- We weren't good enough.
- You can't sing it like that.

1524
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,570
- You sang it like a musical.
- It was too much like a musical.

1525
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,409
Sing it straight from the throat.

1526
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,250
- You can't sing it like that.
- You need to show off...

1527
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,250
by singing straight from the throat.

1528
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,849
- Think of a team dinner.
- Okay.

1529
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:07,050
- Also...
- That's right.

1530
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,349
(Demonstrating a team dinner)

1531
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,590
(Don't you dare)

1532
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,289
(Call me a coward)

1533
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,460
(Even if I lose my way)

1534
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,489
This is fun.

1535
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,429
- Okay, good.
- Here's the second song.

1536
00:49:18,429 --> 00:49:20,500
- We got two.
- Get the mic, okay?

1537
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,199
Sit back down.

1538
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,670
Get it!

1539
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:27,199
(Ddochi gets it
as soon as she hears the intro.)

1540
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,239
"Tomboy" by (G)I-DLE.

1541
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:29,670
That's it. You got it.

1542
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,710
- What?
- What on earth?

1543
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:32,510
(That's not the song?)

1544
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,039
- What was that?
- "Cup Boy?"

1545
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,050
Let me answer. "Tomboy" by (G)I-DLE.

1546
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,110
- No?
- It's by (G)I-DLE.

1547
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,849
- Isn't it their song?
- It is.

1548
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:42,750
(It's definitely by (G)I-DLE.)

1549
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,190
- I'm sure of it.
- It is.

1550
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,690
I'm sure of it.

1551
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,289
- It is.
- "Tomboy" by (G)I-DLE.

1552
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,389
- Let me answer!
- That should be correct.

1553
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,059
(Let me answer!)

1554
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:52,230
"Queencard" by (G)I-DLE.

1555
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
(Team Seok Jin
gets 2 right in a row!)

1556
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,360
- Is it "Queencard?"
- I don't know the song.

1557
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,730
Not even Seok Hoon knows the song.

1558
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,869
Se Chan, sit back down.

1559
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,739
- It's "Queencard."
- Didn't you say...

1560
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:03,039
- you knew all the latest songs?
- Unbelievable.

1561
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:04,539
Seriously.

1562
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,010
It's "Queencard."

1563
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,510
("Queencard" by (G)I-DLE)

1564
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,250
<i>- Hey, you</i>
- "Queencard."

1565
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,610
<i>- What are you looking at?</i>
- "Queencard."

1566
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,920
(Sultry)

1567
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,980
- Oh, no.
- Yes, you.

1568
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,650
(Yang Ssaebssaeb and Poodle Jee
are beginning the team dinner.)

1569
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,389
(Do you want a kiss from me?
Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun)

1570
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:23,690
<i>- I want it Monday to Wednesday.</i>
<i>- Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur</i>

1571
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,190
<i>- My beauty doesn't rest</i>
- He'll bring down the score.

1572
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,699
(Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun,
my beauty doesn't rest)

1573
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:30,699
<i>You don't rest</i>

1574
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:33,269
(From head to toe,
I dazzle and am blinding)

1575
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:34,300
Oh, yes!

1576
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,500
(Glowering)

1577
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,170
(I copy the fashion
of the older girls)

1578
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,239
Oh, yes!

1579
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:43,579
(Jee-rasoni keeps hurting the team.)

1580
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:46,849
(A birthday cake prepared
for this party)

1581
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,480
(MR removed)

1582
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,949
They won't even get over 80.

1583
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,820
- They should be disqualified.
<i>- I'm grateful for being born</i>

1584
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,630
(They complain as a group
about his rotten falsetto.)

1585
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,030
(He doesn't let it faze him
and yells loudly.)

1586
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,130
(This is how they do team dinners
in Korea.)

1587
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:06,599
(Jumping)

1588
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,969
(General Manager Yu
is also partying.)

1589
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,340
(Assistant Manager Yang
and General Manager Jee...)

1590
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,139
(know how to party.)

1591
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,610
(I'm a queencard!)

1592
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,840
(I see!)

1593
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,510
(I'm a queencard)

1594
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,679
(It is flimsy which is nothing like
the previous performance.)

1595
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:22,179
(I'm a queencard, take a photo)

1596
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,690
(Sounding rustic)

1597
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,019
(His rapping is as rustic and homey
as a pot of cheonggukjang.)

1598
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,960
<i>Look so cool</i>

1599
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,760
This will be over 90 for sure.

1600
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,130
(They partied like nobody's
business. What's the score?)

1601
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,869
(Jin Young is in love!
That was incredible.)

1602
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:40,269
- No way.
- That's worth 88 points?

1603
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,300
(He can't believe it.)

1604
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,869
Okay. I agree that was weird.

1605
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:43,940
You need to sing it harshly.

1606
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,969
Just sing it from the throat.

1607
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,010
Seok Jin added...

1608
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,010
- too many useless ad-libs.
- That's right.

1609
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,480
- That lost them points.
- Exactly.

1610
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,250
(He had too much fun
and forgot about the score.)

1611
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,349
- That was great.
- Good job.

1612
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:53,349
I still can't believe it.

1613
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:55,619
- How can you be this good?
- It still got us a high score.

1614
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:56,949
- Good.
- My throat hurts.

1615
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:58,820
- Mine's hoarse.
- Did you sing along?

1616
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,320
A little from behind them.

1617
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,659
<i>- I'm a queencard</i>
- I was in the zone.

1618
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,559
Play the next song.

1619
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,500
(Standing up)

1620
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
- Let's stay seated.
- Sit down.

1621
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,000
- Place your butts down.
- Calm down.

1622
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,730
- It's a ballad.
- Get up there.

1623
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,639
(The balladeer stands up
at the sorrowful intro.)

1624
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,909
Brave sound!

1625
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:21,739
(It's not a ballad!)

1626
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,480
(A familiar signature sound)

1627
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,579
Brave sound!

1628
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,679
- After School?
- "Tonight?" After School!

1629
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,349
- After School?
- "Tonight?" After School!

1630
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,389
- Tonight, tomorrow night...
- After School.

1631
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:34,659
- You got it. It's by After School.
- "Diva."

1632
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:36,360
- No, it's not that.
- I'm right.

1633
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,360
"Diva."

1634
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:40,030
- Okay. Tonight, tomorrow night...
- Hold on.

1635
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,360
- Wait.
- Take the mic.

1636
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,269
Are we allowed
to discuss it up there?

1637
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:45,900
- Isn't this the song?
<i>- Tonight, tomorrow night</i>

1638
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,199
- Don't do ad-libs.
- Don't do ad-libs.

1639
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,340
- Sing it with force.
- With force.

1640
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,110
Only sing the lyrics.

1641
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:53,409
Seriously?

1642
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,750
(The nervous Jae Seok
missed the beat again.)

1643
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,920
She's good at this. We got this one.

1644
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,980
- She sings from the throat.
<i>- I love my boy</i>

1645
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,050
- Okay, good.
- Let's get a good score.

1646
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:05,619
<i>I love my boy!</i>

1647
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,190
Okay. Let's go!

1648
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,619
<i>Everybody, scream!</i>

1649
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:12,429
(Tonight, every night,
I keep thinking of you)

1650
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:16,260
(I am your diva, diva, di di diva)

1651
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,400
(Singing at the top of her lungs)

1652
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:22,539
(I am your!)

1653
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:23,739
(Actually laughing)

1654
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:27,710
(The shouting diva's passionate
singing livens the mood.)

1655
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,510
(Diva, diva, di di diva)

1656
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,250
(Tonight! Every night!)

1657
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:37,619
(I am your!)

1658
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,019
<i>- Di di diva</i>
<i>- Di di diva</i>

1659
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:40,590
(He goes to where the balloons might
come as he expects a high score.)

1660
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,989
- I should have lots of balloons.
<i>- Take my heart</i>

1661
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,260
- Hang on.
- Your!

1662
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,960
(What will the shouting diva's
score be?)

1663
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,099
- Hang on.
- Okay, 80.

1664
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,630
(You have amazing singing skills!
Great job!)

1665
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,269
(100 points!)

1666
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,039
(Right then)

1667
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,500
- Balloons!
- Hey. Get them.

1668
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,710
(A bunch of balloons pour out
from behind the wall.)

1669
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,210
(Rule: Both teams can win
bonus tickets.)

1670
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,239
Oh, man.

1671
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,750
(Belatedly rushing over)

1672
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:04,909
No!

1673
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,820
(Se Chan pops the balloons
in a flash.)

1674
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,119
(But there are no tickets inside?)

1675
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,090
Where did it go? Darn it.

1676
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:15,590
- Hey, the balloons are all duds.
- Where did they all go?

1677
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,590
Are they all duds?

1678
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,690
- Oh, I didn't get any balloons.
- Where are they?

1679
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,400
- Gosh, this is...
- Where did it go?

1680
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,429
(Right then,
Se Chan snatches something!)

1681
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,070
- How do you do this?
- Are they all duds?

1682
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,940
Are they all duds?

1683
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,500
- Darn it. It's a dud.
- They're all duds.

1684
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:30,909
He found one.

1685
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:33,110
- Oh, Seok Hoon has something!
- Seok Hoon.

1686
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,280
Hey.

1687
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,480
- He found it.
- What?

1688
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,150
- Hey, good job, Seok Hoon.
- I mean...

1689
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,250
(Just now)

1690
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,480
Here it is.

1691
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,719
(Passionate Seok Hoon popped
a balloon before anyone else.)

1692
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:50,329
(He found the Paradise Ticket
from the first balloon!)

1693
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,230
- Where did they all go?
- They're all duds.

1694
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,699
The balloons come from behind.

1695
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:56,130
Oh, there's only one
out of all the balloons.

1696
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,170
You just did someone else a favor.

1697
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,429
I did well, didn't I?

1698
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,269
- Good job.
- They throw them from behind.

1699
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:03,539
- You have to sing out loud.
- Yes, loudly.

1700
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:04,610
- Just sing loudly.
- That's right.

1701
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:06,269
And stay right on beat.

1702
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,510
- Staying on beat and be loud.
- That's it.

1703
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,880
- Here is the next song.
- Just go.

1704
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,780
It's done.
You can't discuss it anymore.

1705
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:15,019
- Shin Seung Hun.
- Let me answer. Shin Seung Hun.

1706
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,389
Wait. We just have to wait.

1707
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:18,889
- We have a chance.
- Let me answer!

1708
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,019
Kim Kyung Ho. "Forbidden Love."

1709
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:22,420
- What?
- Oh, my!

1710
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,659
- Seriously?
- Nice.

1711
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,530
- Was that right?
- We got it.

1712
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,400
(Kyu Hyun got it right
after only listening to 2 seconds.)

1713
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,130
- How did you know that?
- Hey, how did you do that?

1714
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,000
- Of course, I should know this.
- How did you know this?

1715
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,710
I thought it was Shin Seung Hun too.

1716
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,039
- Me too.
- Right?

1717
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,539
Jong Kook should go too.

1718
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:40,780
- Hey, sing this.
- Sing together.

1719
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,840
- Yes, I should.
- This...

1720
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,579
- Jong Kook sang this.
- Hey, no.

1721
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:46,050
- Jong Kook and Kyu Hyun should go.
- All right.

1722
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,150
- Hey, this song is really high.
- How did you know this?

1723
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,679
- Of course I know this.
- Hey, stay on beat.

1724
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,019
("Forbidden Love," by Kim Kyung Ho)

1725
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:58,159
(Don't cry. Look at our names)

1726
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,829
- He's so good.
- Nice.

1727
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:03,230
(That are engraved here)

1728
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,269
No, I won't look.

1729
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,440
What was that?

1730
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,599
What was, "No, I won't look?"

1731
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,940
(Immersed in the song)

1732
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,070
Gosh, that's nice.

1733
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:16,510
(The precious invitation
will get wet)

1734
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,880
(Put it in your pocket,
then it won't get wet)

1735
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,420
<i>Don't be sad</i>

1736
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,690
(Singer Kim shows off skills from
his day job after a long hiatus.)

1737
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:28,219
Let's get ready to sing along.

1738
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:31,130
(See your family)

1739
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,900
<i>Cell service is great these days</i>

1740
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,699
- It's great these days.
- What's this?

1741
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,130
That's so childish.

1742
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,170
It's starting now.

1743
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:41,239
This will be really high.

1744
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,400
<i>That day</i>

1745
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,539
<i>- Will come</i>
<i>- This is it.</i>

1746
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:47,039
- Let's go.
- This is it.

1747
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,880
(The climax is coming!)

1748
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,619
(My love made the world give you up)

1749
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:56,320
(Rock Kyu is here!)

1750
00:56:57,489 --> 00:56:59,519
(Impressed)

1751
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:01,659
(Until the end,
I will cherish and love you)

1752
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:02,789
He's so good.

1753
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:04,590
(Until the end,
I will cherish and love you)

1754
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:08,599
(Promise me)

1755
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:09,630
(He expects good results.)

1756
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,800
That's nice!

1757
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,969
(One day in the future)

1758
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:18,610
(At Singer Kim's passionate singing
with no funny business,)

1759
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,210
(Slowly walking over)

1760
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:23,039
Hey, get ready for the balloons.

1761
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,510
- Hey, this could be 80.
- You never know.

1762
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,579
- Yes!
- Hey, the balloons.

1763
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:28,949
(They're ready to catch.)

1764
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,289
Why aren't they coming?

1765
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:34,289
- Mine!
- Hey!

1766
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:35,289
No.

1767
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:36,519
(Popping)

1768
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,230
(Popping)

1769
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,590
(3 combo)

1770
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,000
- What is this?
- There's nothing in there.

1771
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,030
Oh, it's just paper.

1772
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:48,269
(Kyu Hyun gets a ticket!)

1773
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:50,070
(Laughing)

1774
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,070
(He's still cheerful after losing it
right before his eyes.)

1775
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,070
Where is it?

1776
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,070
(He's still cheerful after losing it
right before his eyes.)

1777
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,309
(Clapping to congratulate him)

1778
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:58,309
- What is this?
- There's nothing in there.

1779
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,150
(Laughing)

1780
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,750
- Hey!
- Gosh, darn it.

1781
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,420
- Se Chan.
- Why did that team take it?

1782
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,889
- No.
- Yang Se Chan.

1783
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:07,019
- Gosh, seriously.
- It's okay.

1784
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:08,690
Good job, Se Chan.

1785
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:09,960
(Team Jae Seok did the other team
a favor again.)

1786
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,389
Hey, we should just let
the other team do well on this.

1787
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:15,329
They have duds in here.

1788
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,099
- There are duds.
- They do have duds.

1789
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:20,500
Hey, but we got it right.

1790
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,000
- That was great.
- You sang amazingly.

1791
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,170
- Hey! What's that?
- I got it.

1792
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,309
- Good job.
- I got it.

1793
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:25,440
- Where?
- Oh, nice.

1794
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,809
- There were two.
- Good job.

1795
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:28,739
- All right. Please sit down.
- Okay.

1796
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,409
How are you so good
at guessing correctly?

1797
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:32,309
You both sing so well.

1798
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,380
- That was amazing.
- You were so good.

1799
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,820
- Sit.
- Sit down!

1800
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,550
- Sit.
- Sit down!

1801
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,690
- DAY6!
- Let me answer!

1802
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,420
- DAY6.
- DAY6, "Time of Our Life."

1803
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,929
- Okay!
- Yes!

1804
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,230
He likes this song.

1805
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,760
- He likes this song.
- Nice.

1806
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,860
- Hey, please do well.
- Who else will sing with me?

1807
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,170
- Hey, you two should sing.
- Shall I sing with you?

1808
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,139
- Let's sing together.
- Do a good job.

1809
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,610
(I'll be honest,
I've been waiting for long)

1810
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,309
(I'm sure you have been too,
Until this day came)

1811
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:04,510
(As you looked at the calendar
every day)

1812
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,780
Let's go!

1813
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,250
<i>- A page of our beautiful youth</i>
<i>- A page of our beautiful youth</i>

1814
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:11,750
(As everyone is excited
at their favorite song...)

1815
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,820
<i>- I will fill the page</i>
<i>- I will fill the page</i>

1816
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,989
- Sing!
<i>- With memories with you</i>

1817
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:19,929
(Seok Sam goes for
Kyu Hyun's ticket.)

1818
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:22,000
(Totally focused)

1819
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:25,769
(But...)

1820
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:29,400
(he's really bad at this since he's
only been on the losing end before.)

1821
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,010
(The song is nearing its end now.)

1822
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,679
(In a rush)

1823
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:40,320
(He didn't notice.)

1824
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,860
(Seok Hoon comes in with the assist
by putting his arms around him.)

1825
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:51,789
Me too.

1826
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:53,389
- Let me have one.
- Hang on.

1827
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,429
Give me one too.

1828
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:55,829
(It's mine!)

1829
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:59,530
(Singing passionately)

1830
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:02,570
All right. Let's go.

1831
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:05,409
- Balloons!
- No. I thought it wouldn't work.

1832
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,409
- Gosh, what a shame.
- What a shame.

1833
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:10,210
Because you put his arms
around his shoulders...

1834
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,849
- Did you get it?
- Seok Jin.

1835
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:15,480
Don't sing the song.
We could just swarm them...

1836
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,219
- and steal a bunch...
- Right.

1837
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:19,820
(They switch to
a daylight robbery strategy.)

1838
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,019
- Good.
- Hang on!

1839
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:22,719
- But Seok Jin... I'm sorry,
- Well...

1840
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,429
but we won't look like
absolute thugs on TV, will we?

1841
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:25,429
It's fine.

1842
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,429
- How can we do this...
- We used to do all sorts of things.

1843
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:28,429
Is that right?

1844
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:31,030
- Oh, my throat hurts. It's hoarse.
- My throat hurts too.

1845
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,070
- I sound hoarse after one song.
- My throat hurts.

1846
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,440
My voice is gone.

1847
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,539
- We got three right already, right?
- My voice is totally gone.

1848
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:37,639
(Current score,
Team Jae Seok 3, Team Seok Jin 2)

1849
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:39,940
(The next song continues.)

1850
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,679
- Let's go. You know this!
- It's Papaya!

1851
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,510
- You sing it!
- What is the title?

1852
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,079
- Papaya, "Call My Name?"
- What?

1853
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:49,750
(The husband got his wife's
most popular song incorrect!)

1854
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,219
- Eun Chae!
- Papaya's...

1855
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:54,590
- Eun Chae, what's the title? What?
- "Listen to Me."

1856
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,219
- "Listen..."
- "Listen to Me."

1857
01:00:56,389 --> 01:00:58,329
Papaya, "Listen to Me."

1858
01:00:58,329 --> 01:00:59,489
(Seok Hoon gets it right
thanks to Eun Chae.)

1859
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,500
(I can only listen to you
if it ends with a word or two)

1860
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,000
(Not sure)

1861
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,030
I don't know.

1862
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,630
(I can only listen to you
if it ends with a word or two)

1863
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,230
(They only got 82 points
since they didn't know the lyrics.)

1864
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,769
Gosh, when we focus on the song...

1865
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,199
- Oh, okay!
- No!

1866
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,840
SECHSKIES, "The Way."

1867
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:13,909
- "The Way This Guy Lives."
- Oh, right.

1868
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:14,980
Okay!

1869
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,250
(Kyu Hyun got the full title correct
although it's not well-known.)

1870
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,409
<i>- I live for style</i>
<i>- I live for style</i>

1871
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,579
(They get a high score too.)

1872
01:01:23,019 --> 01:01:24,619
- Nice.
- Hey, Seok Hoon.

1873
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:26,389
- Oh, that was funny.
- Good job.

1874
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:28,389
- Let's sit down.
- Let's get it right.

1875
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,320
- Please, an old song.
- The next song.

1876
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,559
Just run out.

1877
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:35,500
(Shouting)

1878
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:38,900
(Ddochi charges forward
after listening for only 2 seconds.)

1879
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,539
(Se Chan sets off right away too.)

1880
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:42,239
- You got it.
- Ye Eun!

1881
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:43,400
<i>- A dance only to seduce you</i>
- What is it?

1882
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,510
- Three, two,
- You...

1883
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:46,809
- one!
- MAMAMOO?

1884
01:01:46,809 --> 01:01:48,179
Let me answer!
That's it. You're done.

1885
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,340
- You...
- Is it a song by god?

1886
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,679
- Is it god?
- Se Chan. He knows it.

1887
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:53,010
SISTAR's "Loving U."

1888
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,019
- No.
- No.

1889
01:01:54,019 --> 01:01:55,019
SISTAR.

1890
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,320
- "Loving U."
- "Loving U."

1891
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,619
- No.
- That's not it.

1892
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,219
(The two pop song experts
face off again.)

1893
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:03,190
- Let's go. It is.
- Is it SISTAR's song?

1894
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,929
SISTAR. "Shake It."

1895
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,130
- That's right.
- Okay!

1896
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,429
(Ddochi is correct.)

1897
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,530
- Hey, indeed!
- Okay!

1898
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,800
- I'm on a roll today.
- Ye Eun is flying high.

1899
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,400
- Hey, she's pretty good.
- Nice.

1900
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,039
- Let's go!
- Sing with me.

1901
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:19,409
("Shake It" by SISTAR)

1902
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,909
- This dance.
- Anpanman!

1903
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,949
- You're so bad.
- Hey.

1904
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,480
Here it comes.

1905
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,750
- You know this, right?
- Sing loudly.

1906
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,250
(A dance only to seduce you)

1907
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,250
Hey, that's good.

1908
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,219
(Showing off my charm to your heart)

1909
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:35,989
(Vocalizing)

1910
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,260
<i>- When our fingers lightly touch</i>
- Hey, Ddochi is doing well.

1911
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,530
(Creaking)

1912
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:40,800
Please get a high score.

1913
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:44,070
(Shake it)

1914
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,000
(They may be stiff,
but they still do all the dance moves.)

1915
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,000
(Vocalizing)

1916
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,210
(The managers are singing together!)

1917
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,409
(Reading the room)

1918
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:59,309
(Team Daylight Robbery looks
for their chance.)

1919
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,750
(Spotting Seok Hoon, What is this?)

1920
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:06,750
(He checks his bag
due to a foreboding feeling.)

1921
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:09,619
(He sees that his tickets are gone.)

1922
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,190
(Running away)

1923
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,659
He found out.

1924
01:03:12,659 --> 01:03:14,699
(Cheerful)

1925
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:16,429
(He charges toward Seok Hoon
upon seeing Eun Tae's reaction.)

1926
01:03:16,429 --> 01:03:18,230
It isn't me.

1927
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,969
It isn't me.

1928
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:21,769
- It isn't me.
- Give me my tickets.

1929
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:23,400
- Give me my tickets.
- It isn't me.

1930
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,539
- Hurry up.
- It really isn't me.

1931
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,409
- You were by my side.
- It really isn't me.

1932
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:27,579
- Hurry up and give them back.
- It isn't me.

1933
01:03:27,579 --> 01:03:29,039
- Hurry up and give them back.
- It isn't me.

1934
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,309
Hurry up and give them back.

1935
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:33,480
<i>Louder, make it louder</i>

1936
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,079
(Ddochi sings passionately
amidst the chaos.)

1937
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:38,889
<i>You shake me, you shake me,</i>
<i>you shake me and surprise me</i>

1938
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:40,960
(She's about to pass out
from singing too passionately.)

1939
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,559
(Will she get a high score
this time as well?)

1940
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:47,130
- Okay. One hundred points.
- One hundred points.

1941
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,300
(It's 100 points again!)

1942
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,400
One hundred points.

1943
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,570
One hundred points.

1944
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:56,969
(Bursting)

1945
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,639
No. For goodness' sake.

1946
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:00,170
- I found it!
- It isn't this one.

1947
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:02,710
(Jae Seok finally acquires
a ticket.)

1948
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,579
It's better to look for a ticket
on the floor.

1949
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:06,010
(Seok Jin, the poodle
snatches a balloon.)

1950
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,079
- Please.
- Okay.

1951
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,190
(Seok Jin acquires a ticket
as well!)

1952
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,349
I got one.

1953
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,789
- We need to go.
- Hurry up.

1954
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:15,260
(Meanwhile, the two of them
were having a brawl.)

1955
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,460
Gosh, where did it go?

1956
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,130
- I found it!
- It isn't this one.

1957
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:20,360
(Both of them fail
to acquire a ticket!)

1958
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,199
- Why can't I find one?
- What are you guys doing?

1959
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:23,230
- What's wrong?
- Yes!

1960
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,130
- Hurry up and show me.
- I found one.

1961
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,130
- Hold on.
- I found one.

1962
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,469
- I have three tickets.
- Hurry up.

1963
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:29,170
- I'll show you three tickets.
- Show me.

1964
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:30,239
- No.
- What are you guys doing?

1965
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:31,369
- Hold on.
- What's wrong?

1966
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:33,010
- What is it?
- Did he take Kyu Hyun's tickets?

1967
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,710
- You'll take them by force.
- I won't.

1968
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:36,039
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1969
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,780
- What's going on?
- What's up with the two of them?

1970
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,349
He's suspecting me
since he lost his tickets.

1971
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,579
- Someone stole them.
- Did someone take them?

1972
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:42,619
- What?
- Did you put them down?

1973
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:43,780
- I had them in here.
- Who took them?

1974
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,420
Someone stole them
while I was singing.

1975
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,389
You should've held on to them.
Who took them?

1976
01:04:47,389 --> 01:04:49,019
- You should keep it at the front.
- Hey.

1977
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,929
- Kyu Hyun, you should tuck it in.
- Hey.

1978
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:53,489
- Wear the money bag at the front.
- The money bag.

1979
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,900
- Seriously.
- Hey.

1980
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:57,230
- Cover it with your top.
- Hey.

1981
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:58,369
I can't believe these thugs.

1982
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:00,329
- Why do we need to do this?
- Seriously.

1983
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,599
I don't think they were taken
while you were singing.

1984
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:03,900
That means Seok Jin took them.

1985
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,539
I don't think they were taken
while you were singing.

1986
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,769
That means Seok Jin took them.

1987
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,309
Seok Jin took them.

1988
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,150
Things often get stolen
when you sing.

1989
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,179
It's Seok Jin.

1990
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,619
No.

1991
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,550
Someone put his arm
around my shoulder. Who was it?

1992
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:22,019
I'll distribute the tickets
you acquired through this mission.

1993
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,590
Team Yellow will get ten tickets.

1994
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:26,090
Team Green will get six tickets.

1995
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,030
- Nice.
- Distribute them as you want.

1996
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,159
- Let's distribute them as we want.
- Let's give Ye Eun one ticket.

1997
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,400
- As for us...
- I need a ticket.

1998
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,800
- How many do we have?
- Let's take two tickets each.

1999
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,099
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

2000
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:36,269
Let's distribute them evenly.

2001
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:38,110
- Let's distribute them evenly.
- Okay.

2002
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,440
- I'll be able to eat.
- I'll be able to eat.

2003
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,380
- I'll be able to eat.
- I'm in trouble. What should I do?

2004
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,349
- Maybe it'll require many tickets.
- A meal?

2005
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:45,880
- There are 6 tickets.
- Let's take 1 ticket each.

2006
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,849
- Take it.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2007
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,320
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2008
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,050
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2009
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:52,619
The winner will take one more.
Rock-paper-scissors.

2010
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:53,849
- Okay.
- Okay.

2011
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:54,989
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

2012
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:56,460
- Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.
- Gosh.

2013
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,059
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.

2014
01:05:58,059 --> 01:05:59,960
- Seok Jin has good energy.
- Nice.

2015
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,260
Will he take two tickets?

2016
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,730
He'll take two tickets.

2017
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,769
You haven't done anything,
to be honest.

2018
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,369
- Seriously.
- That isn't true.

2019
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:08,500
Let's play
rock-paper-scissors again.

2020
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,400
"You haven't done anything."

2021
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,710
(The passionate man
ended up speaking his mind.)

2022
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:12,909
(I went overboard.)

2023
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:14,079
- One was mine anyway.
- That was funny.

2024
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,210
- Seriously.
- It was mine.

2025
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:16,239
- That was funny.
- I got one more...

2026
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,480
- through rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

2027
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:18,780
My stomach hurts.

2028
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,349
- I won't be able to eat.
- Why not? You'll be able to eat.

2029
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,550
For goodness' sake.

2030
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:25,489
You'll now choose Paradise
or Inferno for lunchtime.

2031
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,559
The number of Paradise Tickets
you need...

2032
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:29,219
- is five.
- What?

2033
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,960
- That's so many.
- That's expensive.

2034
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,460
- That's expensive.
- Isn't that too many?

2035
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,730
- I'm still going to eat.
- That's expensive.

2036
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,099
- I knew it.
- Please.

2037
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:38,329
That's so expensive.

2038
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:41,800
If you want to choose Paradise,
please turn in the tickets.

2039
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,500
Go outside and choose
one at a time...

2040
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,769
- and come back to this place.
- Five is too many.

2041
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:46,969
For your information,

2042
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,909
Team Inferno will get a meal
as well.

2043
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:49,980
- Really?
- Yes.

2044
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,010
- They won't starve.
- They'll get a meal.

2045
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,550
- I guess it's a meal for a diet.
- Of course, they'll get a meal.

2046
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,550
A meal for a diet.

2047
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,519
Will we need the tickets for later?

2048
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:58,320
- If I use them now...
- I don't know what to do.

2049
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:00,489
The number of tickets we need
keeps increasing.

2050
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:01,690
Shall I go without using them
this time?

2051
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:04,190
(Is there a ticket inside?)

2052
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,090
Kyu Hyun is slowly falling
into the pit.

2053
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:07,829
Kyu Hyun is...

2054
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:09,360
(He accepts the reality
before the door to the Inferno.)

2055
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,869
Who stole my tickets?

2056
01:07:10,869 --> 01:07:13,500
- I'm torn this time.
- But...

2057
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,039
(The thief, Seok Jin chooses first.)

2058
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:17,099
I need to eat.

2059
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,469
I collected them diligently.

2060
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,940
- Should I put them inside?
- Yes.

2061
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,239
- I need to eat.
- Please go to Paradise.

2062
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,650
Where? Am I going now?
Am I going later?

2063
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,010
- Yes.
- Please sit down and wait.

2064
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:27,619
I need to wait.

2065
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:29,780
- I'll eat lunch no matter what.
- Okay.

2066
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,090
- One, two...
- You need five tickets.

2067
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:33,550
Two, three, four, five.

2068
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,119
I need to eat.

2069
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,420
Will it be a good meal?

2070
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,030
Are you certain about that?
You don't lie about that, do you?

2071
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,699
You'll get a meal
that suits Paradise.

2072
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:42,929
Will it suit Paradise?

2073
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:47,230
(Are you certain?)

2074
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,400
(After interrogating the crew,
he chooses Paradise.)

2075
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,070
How many games remain?

2076
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,809
One more game remains.

2077
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:56,010
(Let me think.)

2078
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,239
I'll keep things luxurious today.

2079
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,480
I'll enjoy the food and play
the remaining game diligently.

2080
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,880
I won't be able to do well
unless I eat now.

2081
01:08:04,949 --> 01:08:06,150
Will there be protein?

2082
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,420
- There'll be meat.
- Okay.

2083
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,920
(He goes all in for the lunch
he has been waiting for.)

2084
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,329
(Haha, Number of Tickets: 5)

2085
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:13,159
I'll go all in.

2086
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:15,860
(Mr. Free Meals chooses Paradise
without hesitation.)

2087
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,859
I need to eat.

2088
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,569
Five tickets are too much.

2089
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:22,600
(There'll be
the next Inferno as well.)

2090
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,340
Okay.

2091
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:25,770
I won't turn in the tickets.

2092
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:27,340
(He thinks about the future
and chooses the Inferno.)

2093
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,380
I'll choose the Inferno.

2094
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,649
It's such a waste.
I collected five tickets like crazy.

2095
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,279
I can't use them all at once.
I won't use them.

2096
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,720
People think that I'll eat.

2097
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,960
But today, I'll try to avoid
the penalty.

2098
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,359
(Ye Eun, Number of Tickets: 5)

2099
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:43,619
I won't use them.

2100
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,590
Will I still get food?

2101
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,529
(The king of penalties, Ddochi keeps
the tickets to avoid the penalty.)

2102
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,729
I don't have enough tickets.
I'll go to the Inferno.

2103
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:51,770
- Okay.
- For goodness' sake.

2104
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,229
(This happened
because of one stolen ticket.)

2105
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,800
It's too much.

2106
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,600
(He worked himself to sweat
to no avail.)

2107
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,869
I can't go to Paradise.

2108
01:08:57,869 --> 01:08:59,109
(She currently has 3 tickets.)

2109
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:00,470
I don't have enough tickets.

2110
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:03,539
Thus, the decisions were made.

2111
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,279
Those who chose the Inferno...

2112
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:10,079
will follow a staff member
to the back.

2113
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,590
- What?
- Are we going somewhere?

2114
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:12,789
Why are so many people going
to the Inferno?

2115
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:14,659
It seemed like a waste
to use up five tickets.

2116
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:15,789
Ye Eun chose the Inferno.

2117
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,789
Except for Eun Tae,

2118
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:19,430
- every Team Inferno member is here.
- You're right.

2119
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,699
- They went to Paradise earlier.
- You're right.

2120
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,000
- Are you serious?
- Are you serious?

2121
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:27,199
- What's this?
- It's too much.

2122
01:09:27,369 --> 01:09:29,340
I'd rather skip a meal.

2123
01:09:29,739 --> 01:09:32,810
I think they got bad food.

2124
01:09:32,909 --> 01:09:35,539
- Food can't be good in the Inferno.
- That's right.

2125
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:36,779
Are they eating now?

2126
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,510
They were like, "What's this?"
Are they eating now?

2127
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:43,180
Maybe we'll eat the food they make.
Things are taking too long.

2128
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:45,819
- No way.
- I think we'll eat such food.

2129
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:47,189
It seems like they're making food.

2130
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,390
(Banging)

2131
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:50,890
They're doing something.

2132
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,659
- This is wrong.
- We paid five tickets.

2133
01:09:53,659 --> 01:09:54,729
We paid, so...

2134
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:57,100
- I mean...
- What? Are they beggars?

2135
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,699
- Are they beggars?
- What?

2136
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:02,840
(The beggars enter.)

2137
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:05,439
- My goodness.
- Thank goodness.

2138
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,239
- I'm so glad.
- Thank goodness.

2139
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:09,680
<i>- Please spare me a coin</i>
- Thank goodness.

2140
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,979
- Kyu Hyun.
<i>- Please spare me a coin</i>

2141
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:12,250
Must I eat like this?

2142
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,850
Kyu Hyun is the man who laughs.

2143
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,319
(The beggar who laughs)

2144
01:10:15,819 --> 01:10:17,619
I'm so glad I didn't choose
the Inferno.

2145
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:19,390
You beggars.

2146
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,220
- This is so annoying.
- Let's see.

2147
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:22,989
- Who stole my tickets?
- Seriously.

2148
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:25,529
- You need to give us food.
- You need to give us food.

2149
01:10:25,529 --> 01:10:27,289
This is practically a penalty.

2150
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,329
While dressed up as beggars,

2151
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:31,229
Team Inferno members...

2152
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:33,300
will find a citizen who has a cause
for a celebration...

2153
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,699
and give a celebratory performance.

2154
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:38,770
(They need to go out in this state
and give a celebratory performance.)

2155
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:39,939
That's the worst.

2156
01:10:39,939 --> 01:10:41,710
- It's the worst.
- Seriously.

2157
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:43,510
- Isn't this a penalty?
- Thank you.

2158
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:45,079
- It's the worst.
- This is a penalty.

2159
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:46,149
- What?
- I'm glad I paid up.

2160
01:10:46,149 --> 01:10:47,850
- I'm glad I paid up.
- Seriously.

2161
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:50,020
- It isn't even about eating.
- Seriously.

2162
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,149
- Eating is much better.
- This is a penalty.

2163
01:10:51,149 --> 01:10:52,890
Had we known,
we would've paid up and eaten.

2164
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:54,560
- This is a penalty.
- I mean...

2165
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,989
How will we give
a celebratory performance?

2166
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,390
How will we give
a celebratory performance?

2167
01:10:58,529 --> 01:10:59,689
- This is worse than the penalty.
- This is a penalty.

2168
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:01,800
- This is worse than the penalty.
- What's the penalty? I'm curious.

2169
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,569
- Give a celebratory performance.
- How fun.

2170
01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:07,430
After the performance,
get a score from the citizen.

2171
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,869
If you get 10 out of 10...

2172
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:13,609
three or more times,
we'll provide a meal.

2173
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:15,239
- Three times?
- Three times.

2174
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,909
In that case...

2175
01:11:16,909 --> 01:11:18,479
- We need to put on a show.
- We need to put on a show.

2176
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:22,350
It's intense.
So this is a real variety show.

2177
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:25,949
Team Paradise, go to the restaurant
the production crew reserved...

2178
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,689
- and eat comfortably.
- Okay.

2179
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:30,020
- Bravo.
- Okay.

2180
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,489
- Enjoy the food.
- Let's go.

2181
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,529
Turning in five tickets
was the best thing I've done.

2182
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,359
- Seriously.
- Seriously. I mean.

2183
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:38,000
Turning in five tickets
was the best decision...

2184
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,470
- I've made today.
- Same here.

2185
01:11:39,569 --> 01:11:41,239
- I don't regret it.
- Me neither.

2186
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:43,239
- It's worse than the penalty.
- Seriously.

2187
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,510
I guess we'll get good food.

2188
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,010
- We'll get bossam.
- Bossam?

2189
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:50,340
- Bossam with oysters?
- This is incredible.

2190
01:11:50,579 --> 01:11:51,880
It looks tasty.

2191
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,180
- There's protein.
- There's so much protein.

2192
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,220
- It's seasoned squid and radish.
- It contains squid.

2193
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,289
This gamjatang is complimentary.

2194
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:01,119
- Okay.
- Yes.

2195
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:03,659
- I love this dish.
- It's insane.

2196
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,529
- Okay. Let's go.
- Go ahead and eat.

2197
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:06,630
- Enjoy the meal.
- Thank you for the food.

2198
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,600
- Enjoy the meal. Well done.
- Yes.

2199
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:11,000
Bossam is a healthy dish.

2200
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,970
It has protein and fat.

2201
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,369
It's my favorite dish.

2202
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:16,069
- Do you like bossam?
- Yes.

2203
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,569
My goodness.

2204
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:20,340
(Eating)

2205
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:22,979
(Satisfied)

2206
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:27,609
(The protein enthusiast is
about to pass out.)

2207
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,649
It's so tasty.

2208
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,119
Had the others been here,
we would've teased them.

2209
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:35,319
(Mr. Free Meals eats
a big lettuce wrap.)

2210
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:36,760
It's so tasty.

2211
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,789
- Throw it away.
- Pick it up in three seconds.

2212
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:44,329
(Their meal quality went up
from the dirt bungeoppang.)

2213
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:47,840
(The former Team Inferno members
turned their lives around.)

2214
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:50,100
While the meal is tasty,

2215
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,810
thinking about the hardships
the other members will face...

2216
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:54,170
makes me so glad
that I turned in five tickets.

2217
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:55,779
It's so tasty.

2218
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:58,550
(They begin to eat in earnest.)

2219
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,380
Hey, it's insane.

2220
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:02,520
(They keep exclaiming.)

2221
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:04,220
This is happiness. I'm so happy.

2222
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,520
My goodness.

2223
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,590
(The former beggar is happy
with each wrap.)

2224
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,119
It's so tasty.

2225
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:10,989
Turning in five tickets today...

2226
01:13:10,989 --> 01:13:13,359
was the best decision I made
in the past six months.

2227
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:14,359
Same here.

2228
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,829
This is incredible.

2229
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:19,130
(Seok Hoon keeps eating the wraps
as if he hasn't eaten in days.)

2230
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:22,600
(Eun Tae just eats the raw oysters.)

2231
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,069
The oysters are so tasty.

2232
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:27,369
This restaurant makes tasty food.

2233
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:30,079
The oysters are fresh.

2234
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,779
The oysters are so good.

2235
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:33,550
- They're fresh.
- Yes.

2236
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:35,180
- I can't stop eating.
- It can be like that...

2237
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,220
(He eats in an elegant way.)

2238
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,220
- I can't stop eating.
- It's tasty.

2239
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,590
- It's really tasty.
- I'm so happy.

2240
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,659
Can we get more food?

2241
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:44,119
I think he needs a bit more oysters.

2242
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,859
- Can I get more oysters?
- He needs them.

2243
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:47,960
- Would you give us a bit more?
- Order more meat.

2244
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,699
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2245
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,470
Do people get fed well...

2246
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,199
on Running Man?

2247
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,699
- Yes, they get fed well.
- Yes.

2248
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,239
A big variety show
sure is different.

2249
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:57,770
- Of course.
- We get taken care of.

2250
01:13:58,109 --> 01:13:59,170
It has aired for 15 years.

2251
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,140
The production crew is generous.

2252
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,239
There's more meat.

2253
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:03,939
Vegetables.

2254
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:05,680
Can we order a beverage?

2255
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,279
- Of course.
- My goodness.

2256
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,420
How long has it been
since you got married?

2257
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,920
- It has been 12 years.
- What?

2258
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:14,449
He has three children.

2259
01:14:14,819 --> 01:14:16,260
- Do you have three children?
- What's the order?

2260
01:14:16,489 --> 01:14:18,090
- He has three children too.
- Daughter, son, and daughter.

2261
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:19,859
He's a patriot.

2262
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:21,960
- I'm jealous.
- It's nice.

2263
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,529
It isn't easy to raise
three children.

2264
01:14:23,529 --> 01:14:24,699
(Seok Jin has a son too.)

2265
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:26,369
Do you have one child?

2266
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:27,840
- One.
- You have one child.

2267
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,869
- Yes.
- Seriously.

2268
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:30,800
- Raising one is hard enough, right?
- Gosh.

2269
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,569
- Raising one is hard enough.
- It's hard enough, right?

2270
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:33,710
It's hard.

2271
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,739
I want to have one child
and raise him or her well.

2272
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:38,680
(He should get married first.)

2273
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:41,319
By the way,
how did your wife become...

2274
01:14:41,319 --> 01:14:43,149
a manager?

2275
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:45,420
- Seriously.
- If you're always together...

2276
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,789
She only accompanies me
on an occasion like this.

2277
01:14:46,789 --> 01:14:48,159
- An occasion like this?
- Yes.

2278
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:52,229
Still, a professional manager
could talk in your stead...

2279
01:14:52,229 --> 01:14:55,659
about the conditions
such as payment.

2280
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:58,369
- I take care of them myself.
- Really?

2281
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,630
Do you share the money
with your wife?

2282
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,000
Do you do that
even though you do all the work?

2283
01:15:02,869 --> 01:15:04,840
- I give her all the money.
- That's right.

2284
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,239
(His wife is in charge of money.)

2285
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:08,539
He gives her all the money.

2286
01:15:08,539 --> 01:15:10,039
Having private funds is meaningless
when you get married.

2287
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:11,079
- Yes.
- That's right.

2288
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:12,609
My money is your money.

2289
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,680
- That's right.
- Your money is your money.

2290
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,979
(It's a common joke.)

2291
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:17,949
You learned the truth.

2292
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:21,420
I had friends who said this
when they first got married.

2293
01:15:22,659 --> 01:15:24,460
When their wives used their money,

2294
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,489
they thought at times,
"Is this okay?"

2295
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,229
Isn't that your story?

2296
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,000
It isn't my story.

2297
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,229
I don't think it's a waste at all.

2298
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,039
- Not at all.
- Right?

2299
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,739
- We're one.
- I mean...

2300
01:15:36,739 --> 01:15:38,670
- That's why I earn money.
- Same here.

2301
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:40,510
- I'm happy.
- Some people are like that.

2302
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,710
Isn't it ridiculous?

2303
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,350
(He found his friends ridiculous
because he loved his wife a lot.)

2304
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:49,720
What was the biggest problem
your friends had at first?

2305
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,850
On which item
did their wives spend money on?

2306
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:52,689
(Thinking)

2307
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:55,159
It wasn't anything big.

2308
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:56,319
It wasn't anything big?

2309
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:57,720
(He answers without hesitation.)

2310
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,960
Really?

2311
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:00,229
You're only a person, so...

2312
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:01,229
(Coughing)

2313
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,670
- It isn't my story, okay?
- I know that.

2314
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,699
- I know that.
- I was just curious.

2315
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,199
- I was just curious.
- You're only a person, so...

2316
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:13,670
It wasn't anything big, so...

2317
01:16:14,539 --> 01:16:16,340
When they think about it now,
they feel bad.

2318
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:20,310
Clothes are necessary, right?
Their wives bought clothes.

2319
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,750
- That's right.
- The clothes weren't so expensive.

2320
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,420
Did they feel like
they were a big waste?

2321
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,590
Not a big waste. Just a little bit.

2322
01:16:27,789 --> 01:16:29,119
They were like, "Must I do this
for the rest of my life?"

2323
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,390
- Did your friends think that?
- Your friends?

2324
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,890
- You know all the details.
- My friends.

2325
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,560
You must be very close
to these friends.

2326
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,960
- Seok Jin.
- I was very close to them.

2327
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,500
(He remembers the conversation
in great detail.)

2328
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,699
I was very close to them.

2329
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:43,069
I see.

2330
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,039
The wives don't know about it.

2331
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:48,579
- Really?
- Yes.

2332
01:16:48,579 --> 01:16:50,239
I guess they'll find out today.

2333
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,409
(Oh, no.)

2334
01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:55,020
This is nice.

2335
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,520
Thank goodness
I turned in the tickets.

2336
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,149
- Seriously.
- I would've turned in ten.

2337
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:59,689
Thank goodness
I didn't only have four tickets.

2338
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:02,819
Thank goodness
I stole Kyu Hyun's tickets.

2339
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,829
- It's so embarrassing.
- It's so embarrassing.

2340
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:07,130
(New Team Inferno members
used to be in Tem Paradise.)

2341
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,729
- Beggars.
- Yes?

2342
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,899
- Come here.
- We need to stick...

2343
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:12,369
- together.
- Let's listen to the boss.

2344
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:13,569
We need to stick together.

2345
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,239
- Come here.
- Boss.

2346
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:17,539
We need to go over it.

2347
01:17:17,539 --> 01:17:19,069
Was it 3 times to the right
and 3 times to the left?

2348
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:20,439
- It's so embarrassing.
- Three times to the left.

2349
01:17:20,439 --> 01:17:21,779
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

2350
01:17:21,779 --> 01:17:23,539
(They need to perform and receive 10
out of 10 from 3 citizens to eat.)

2351
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:25,109
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

2352
01:17:25,109 --> 01:17:28,149
(They go over the dance
for the celebratory performance.)

2353
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:29,779
- Ta-da. Okay.
- Ta-da.

2354
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,079
Three times to the left
and three times to the right.

2355
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,520
- Smile. Come to the front.
- Okay.

2356
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,689
My hair is itchy.

2357
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,159
I scratched mine.

2358
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:36,189
(They move
as they scratch their hair.)

2359
01:17:36,189 --> 01:17:38,289
Running Man isn't
this kind of a show, is it?

2360
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:40,529
- Right.
- It isn't this kind of a show.

2361
01:17:40,529 --> 01:17:42,659
Hold on. Why don't we talk
to the owner of the hair salon?

2362
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:45,130
- Has she eaten?
- I hope she has good news.

2363
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:48,000
The owner is alone.
There are no customers.

2364
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,500
- Hello.
- My goodness.

2365
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,539
(It's nice to meet you!)

2366
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,140
- Hello.
- My goodness.

2367
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:57,239
- She isn't looking at us.
- Let's go. She's busy.

2368
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,949
- She's busy.
- Is she busy?

2369
01:17:58,949 --> 01:18:00,449
- She has no interest.
- Hello.

2370
01:18:00,449 --> 01:18:01,619
Let's try again.

2371
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:02,819
Jae Seok.

2372
01:18:02,819 --> 01:18:04,479
(They suppress the embarrassment
and try again.)

2373
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:05,619
(She doesn't look
in their direction.)

2374
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:07,350
- She isn't paying attention.
- Jae Seok.

2375
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,760
It isn't like that.
She really thinks we're beggars.

2376
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,119
- Hello.
- Seriously.

2377
01:18:11,289 --> 01:18:12,729
She really thinks we're beggars.

2378
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:13,960
- Seriously.
- People don't recognize Jae Seok.

2379
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,630
- Seriously...
- Jae Seok.

2380
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,630
- Kyu Hyun.
- It makes no sense...

2381
01:18:18,029 --> 01:18:19,399
that she isn't looking at us.

2382
01:18:19,399 --> 01:18:21,640
- I think she misunderstood.
- She thinks it's real.

2383
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:24,470
She probably thinks
that we're performers or...

2384
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:27,109
(It's the 3rd try.)

2385
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:28,109
Ma'am.

2386
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:33,149
(She does her best to avoid them.)

2387
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:34,510
I think she's scared.

2388
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,979
- Seriously.
- She didn't recognize you.

2389
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:37,149
- Seriously.
- She thought...

2390
01:18:37,149 --> 01:18:39,119
that we were actual beggars.

2391
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,250
I think she misunderstood.

2392
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,420
She thought we were
after money or free food.

2393
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:46,060
- She thought we were...
- Hello.

2394
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,460
She thought we were begging...

2395
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,630
- for real.
- What?

2396
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:50,260
- My friend, where are you going?
- Hello.

2397
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,399
Mom, I'll call you back shortly.

2398
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,470
You were on the phone with your mom.
Where are you going?

2399
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,739
I'm going to a taekwondo gym.

2400
01:18:56,739 --> 01:18:59,170
- Taekwondo.
- How many years has it been?

2401
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,340
Well, five years.

2402
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,810
(They celebrate suddenly.)

2403
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,510
- What's your belt?
- A black belt.

2404
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:08,949
- A black belt.
- A black belt.

2405
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:10,850
- That's the best one.
- He's the future.

2406
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,449
- May I take a selfie with you?
- Sure.

2407
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,220
- Shouldn't we perform 1st?
- Let's perform 1st.

2408
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,489
- We'll perform 1st.
- We'll perform 1st.

2409
01:19:16,489 --> 01:19:18,020
- Officially...
- I don't have much time.

2410
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,829
- When do you need to be there?
- By 2:30 p.m.

2411
01:19:19,829 --> 01:19:21,229
- Did you say 2:30 p.m.?
- Do you need to run there?

2412
01:19:21,229 --> 01:19:22,829
He needs to hurry up.
He only has five minutes left.

2413
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:24,829
Take a selfie with him
and ask him for a score.

2414
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,170
Will you take a photo of me
like this?

2415
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,100
- All right. Let's begin.
- All right.

2416
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,239
- My friend.
- What's your name?

2417
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,510
Jang Do Hyun.

2418
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:34,569
- Do Hyun.
<i>- Do Hyun, may you do well in life</i>

2419
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:38,479
(Do Hyun is flustered
upon hearing their lousy song.)

2420
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:41,680
<i>- Black belt for Do Hyun</i>
<i>- Black belt</i>

2421
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,119
<i>- Taekwondo</i>
<i>- May he do well in life</i>

2422
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:45,020
<i>- Five years</i>
<i>- Black belt</i>

2423
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:48,359
(They end the song hurriedly
due to shame.)

2424
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:50,590
- Do Hyun.
- Do Hyun with the black belt.

2425
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:52,130
- Do Hyun.
- Do Hyun, please hold on.

2426
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,060
They gave a performance just now.

2427
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,529
Which score would you give them
if the perfect score is ten points?

2428
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:57,060
- Ten points.
- Ten points?

2429
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,300
Do Hyun.

2430
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,930
Do Hyun, congratulations.

2431
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,069
- Congratulations on the black belt.
- Yes.

2432
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:03,600
May you become a national athlete...

2433
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,369
- in taekwondo.
- Yes.

2434
01:20:05,369 --> 01:20:06,739
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2435
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:08,640
- Bye.
- Work out diligently.

2436
01:20:08,779 --> 01:20:09,939
- Bye.
- Run.

2437
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,510
I don't think he has the intention
of becoming a national athlete.

2438
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:14,710
- Isn't it his hobby?
- Hey.

2439
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,520
- Be quiet.
- He gave us ten points.

2440
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,720
- I think it's his hobby.
- Be quiet.

2441
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,390
- The national athlete?
- We were congratulating him.

2442
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:21,819
Why did you go, "Taekwondo!
Bang, bang, bang!"

2443
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:22,890
What was that?

2444
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,159
- Jae Seok.
- It was too much.

2445
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,859
Do Hyun still gave us ten points.
We didn't have much time.

2446
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:27,090
- Let's go.
- We did it.

2447
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:29,829
Firstly, you need to ask them
if they have a cause...

2448
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:31,430
- for congratulations.
- Okay.

2449
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,170
- We can't make it up.
- But they might not know.

2450
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:34,600
- That's right. We did it once.
- We found...

2451
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,640
- a cause for congratulations.
- That's right.

2452
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,810
Taekwondo!

2453
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:40,170
- The 5th rank!
- The 5th rank!

2454
01:20:40,909 --> 01:20:42,680
The future of the Korean taekwondo!

2455
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:45,279
- He won't take that route.
- Taekwondo!

2456
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:47,710
- It's his hobby.
- It'll be cool if he does.

2457
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,479
Does anyone have
a cause for congratulations?

2458
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:51,119
- There's a baby.
- Where?

2459
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:53,489
- It's a baby.
- Congratulate her for being born.

2460
01:20:53,489 --> 01:20:54,550
Congratulate her for being born.

2461
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,119
Hello. What's her name?

2462
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:59,460
- Ah Rin.
- Ah Rin.

2463
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,760
- Ah Rin is a good name.
- Ah Rin.

2464
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,760
She's so pretty.

2465
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,430
Do you have a cause
for congratulations?

2466
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:07,329
- Recently? It's quite small.
- Yes.

2467
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,069
Ah Rin is six months old now.

2468
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:10,869
- Six months.
- Listen.

2469
01:21:10,869 --> 01:21:13,010
- Six months.
- Listen.

2470
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:16,340
- Ah Rin entered the world.
- Yes.

2471
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:17,909
She has lived for six months.

2472
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:20,050
- We should congratulate her.
- Yes.

2473
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:21,949
Three times to the left,
three times to the right.

2474
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:23,649
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

2475
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:25,289
(They begin
the performance right away.)

2476
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:26,850
<i>Congratulations, Ah Rin</i>

2477
01:21:26,989 --> 01:21:29,220
(Ah Rin dances with them.)

2478
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,859
<i>- Ah Rin</i>
- One, two, three. Arin!

2479
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:33,090
<i>- Ah Rin</i>
- One, two, three.

2480
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:35,659
- Ah Rin!
- Ah Rin!

2481
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,470
- Six months old!
- Say nice things to Ah Rin.

2482
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:41,369
Ah Rin, stay healthy.
Health is the best.

2483
01:21:41,369 --> 01:21:42,939
- All right.
- If you get sick,

2484
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,369
my heart will ache.

2485
01:21:44,369 --> 01:21:46,710
- Ah Rin.
- She smiled.

2486
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,739
- Go ahead.
- Ah Rin, stay healthy always.

2487
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:51,340
Listen to your mom
and grow up prettily.

2488
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,350
All right.

2489
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,579
Ah Rin, grow up as pretty as me.

2490
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:57,250
Ah Rin, grow up as pretty as me.

2491
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,720
(A straight face)

2492
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:02,260
Make lots of money, Ah Rin.

2493
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,159
- Ready. One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

2494
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:06,529
(They start an encore performance
that no one asked for.)

2495
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:09,260
<i>- For Ah Rin</i>
<i>- For Ah Rin</i>

2496
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:12,500
- Be healthy, Ah Rin.
- Be healthy.

2497
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:14,369
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2498
01:22:14,369 --> 01:22:16,270
Did you like your cheer?

2499
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,600
I'm so thankful.

2500
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,869
- Our performance...
- Did...

2501
01:22:18,869 --> 01:22:21,170
What score would you give
out of ten?

2502
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,340
(Will they get 10 points?)

2503
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:24,239
Out of 10? It's 100 points.

2504
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,250
- It's 100 points.
- It's 100 points.

2505
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,720
(It's 100 points.)

2506
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:30,579
Ah Rin's mom is the best!

2507
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:31,579
Ah Rin.

2508
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:33,449
She looks so much like you.

2509
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,789
- Thank you.
- Bye, Ah Rin.

2510
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:38,260
- Bye.
- Be healthy.

2511
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,329
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

2512
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,029
We congratulated Ah Rin.

2513
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,260
This is how I look.

2514
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,069
- One more...
- This is how I look.

2515
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,670
- I'm walking around like this.
- Did you see that now?

2516
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:51,810
I'm laughing because of you.

2517
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:53,909
It's the same for us.
We're laughing because of you.

2518
01:22:53,909 --> 01:22:55,579
I became "The Man Who Laughs"
because of you.

2519
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,840
I laughed so much.

2520
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,310
- We have to find one more person.
- One more person.

2521
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,979
Then we can have a meal.

2522
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:03,420
One more.

2523
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,989
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

2524
01:23:04,989 --> 01:23:06,420
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

2525
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,890
(What is that?)

2526
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,760
(Passing by quickly)

2527
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:13,890
How about congratulating the pigeon?

2528
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:14,960
That's a great idea.

2529
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,229
- Congratulate the pigeon...
- If it flies away, it's ten points.

2530
01:23:17,229 --> 01:23:19,529
- Aren't they a pair?
- They're...

2531
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:20,600
Hey!

2532
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:22,170
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

2533
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:23,539
- Goodness.
- Hello.

2534
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:25,470
It must have been hard
coming all the way.

2535
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:27,569
- How did you hurt your arm?
- Your arm.

2536
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:28,779
How did you hurt your arm?

2537
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:29,810
Hello.

2538
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,079
- Madam.
- Yes?

2539
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:32,649
How did you hurt your arm?

2540
01:23:32,649 --> 01:23:34,710
- I fell down.
- Goodness.

2541
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:36,979
How long has it been
since you got injured?

2542
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:39,789
- Two months.
- It's almost time you remove it.

2543
01:23:39,789 --> 01:23:41,489
They removed the steel
before yesterday...

2544
01:23:41,489 --> 01:23:43,119
- and told me to come again.
- She removed the steel.

2545
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:44,890
Isn't that something
to congratulate?

2546
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:46,729
No. I have to stay like this
for a month longer.

2547
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:47,760
A month longer.

2548
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,260
(Their plan failed.)

2549
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,770
- One more month...
- What month is your birthday?

2550
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,170
- My birthday?
- Yes.

2551
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:55,699
- It's April 15.
- April? It's soon.

2552
01:23:55,699 --> 01:23:57,270
- It's soon.
- It's May 25.

2553
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:59,170
- May 25.
- May 25.

2554
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:01,369
Do you have anything
to congratulate...

2555
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,539
personally or in your family?

2556
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,310
- In your family.
- Something good.

2557
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,979
- Something good.
- Your granddaughter...

2558
01:24:06,979 --> 01:24:10,949
I only live with my husband.

2559
01:24:11,149 --> 01:24:13,420
Our two sons live separately.

2560
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:16,060
Is it a blessing
that they live separately?

2561
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,760
- It's a blessing.
- I'm not sure.

2562
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,229
(She doesn't have
anything to celebrate.)

2563
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:22,000
Hold on.

2564
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,600
- She and her husband are healthy.
- They're healthy.

2565
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,029
- Your husband is healthy, right?
- Their health.

2566
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:28,539
He's not healthy.

2567
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:30,699
(They keep failing
to get the answer.)

2568
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:32,840
Wasn't there any good news lately?

2569
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,739
- Good news?
- Something that made you smile.

2570
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:37,579
I injured my arm.
What good news would I have?

2571
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:40,310
- What about meeting Jae Seok today?
- Think a little...

2572
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:42,250
What about meeting Jae Seok today?

2573
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,680
I'm really happy about that.

2574
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,689
- Yes!
- Yes!

2575
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:49,590
(We found something to celebrate!)

2576
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,729
- Are you well?
- So, we met today.

2577
01:24:52,729 --> 01:24:54,760
- Isn't that something to celebrate?
- Of course.

2578
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,699
- Right.
- I saw all of you on TV earlier.

2579
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:02,600
We will wish you
a Happy New Year first.

2580
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,239
We will wish you a Happy New Year.

2581
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:07,569
- So.
- Thank you.

2582
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,180
Be healthy. Get well soon.

2583
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,109
- Get well soon.
- Be healthy.

2584
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:12,409
Get well soon.

2585
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:14,750
- Get well soon.
- I'm so thankful.

2586
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:17,220
- Health...
- Health, 3 lefts, 4 rights.

2587
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,850
Health, 3 lefts, and 4 rights.

2588
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:19,989
Start.

2589
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:21,149
What's your name?

2590
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,619
Hong Jeong Ja.

2591
01:25:22,619 --> 01:25:24,859
- Hong Jeong Ja.
- Hong Jeong Ja.

2592
01:25:24,859 --> 01:25:26,960
- Hong Jeong Ja.
<i>- Hong Jeong Ja</i>

2593
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,600
<i>Hong Jeong Ja</i>

2594
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,500
(They sing a simple song
with her name.)

2595
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,869
<i>- Hong Jeong Ja</i>
<i>- Jeong Ja</i>

2596
01:25:31,869 --> 01:25:35,239
<i>- Hong Jeong Ja</i>
<i>- Jeong Ja</i>

2597
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:36,699
- Jeong Ja.
- It's a bit...

2598
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:38,810
- It's her name.
- Yes.

2599
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,270
It's her name.

2600
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,739
- I'll...
- Yes.

2601
01:25:41,739 --> 01:25:43,310
I go to church.

2602
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,880
- Then...
- Senior Deaconess Hong Jeong Ja.

2603
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,149
- Senior deaconess.
- Senior deaconess.

2604
01:25:47,149 --> 01:25:48,520
- Senior deaconess.
- Senior deaconess.

2605
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,180
- One, two...
- First...

2606
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:53,949
I'll pray for KBS a lot.

2607
01:25:53,949 --> 01:25:55,560
- KBS?
- This is SBS.

2608
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,060
- SBS.
- SBS.

2609
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:59,590
For all the broadcasting companies.

2610
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:02,060
- All the broadcasting companies.
- They're all one.

2611
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,500
She'll pray
for all the broadcasting companies.

2612
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,729
- Senior Deaconess Hong Jeong Ja...
- Senior deaconess.

2613
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:08,069
will pray for them a lot.

2614
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:09,170
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2615
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:11,439
(Joy to the world)

2616
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:14,739
(They respond with a hymn.)

2617
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:20,449
(They're not sure about the lyrics.)

2618
01:26:20,449 --> 01:26:21,979
(Looking around)

2619
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:26,319
(They sing loudly in the streets.)

2620
01:26:26,989 --> 01:26:28,720
You're the best.

2621
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,789
I came here to do my hair.
Here. Monaliza.

2622
01:26:31,789 --> 01:26:33,689
- Monaliza.
- The salon.

2623
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:34,859
Were you going there?

2624
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:37,130
I came here to do my hair.
Thank you so much.

2625
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,260
So nice.

2626
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,500
Always be healthy,
Senior Deaconess Hong Jeong Ja.

2627
01:26:41,899 --> 01:26:43,439
- We...
- Yes.

2628
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,470
somewhat cheered for you.

2629
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:48,640
- It was a performance.
- What score...

2630
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,380
would you give out of ten?

2631
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:53,250
(They'll be able to eat
if they receive 10 points.)

2632
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:57,250
(Did those questions deduct points?)

2633
01:26:57,619 --> 01:26:58,850
- What you did?
- Just now.

2634
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,090
- I'd give full points.
- Yes?

2635
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,090
- It's 100 points?
- It's 100 out of 100.

2636
01:27:02,689 --> 01:27:04,720
(It's 100 points!)

2637
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,630
(The beggars win their meal!)

2638
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:10,060
- Thank you.
- Always be healthy.

2639
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,229
- Thank you.
- Get well soon.

2640
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:13,699
- Get well soon.
- It's winter.

2641
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:14,869
The roads are slippery in winter.

2642
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:17,439
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

2643
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2644
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:22,140
Please give us five bowls
of delicious kalguksu.

2645
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,640
Kalguksu!

2646
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,050
It's a famous restaurant
that rejected being on TV.

2647
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:27,050
- Amazing.
- Goodness.

2648
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:29,050
- The smell.
- It looks good.

2649
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:31,180
- It smells so good.
- What are you doing?

2650
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,020
That's too much.

2651
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:35,960
That's what Kwang Soo
used to do before.

2652
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:37,319
That's what Kwang Soo used to do.

2653
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,489
Here you go, Ye Eun.

2654
01:27:40,489 --> 01:27:41,529
This is so funny.

2655
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,199
This is so funny.

2656
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,869
It smells crazy.

2657
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:48,199
We should eat after working.

2658
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:50,699
- It's amazing.
- Is this kalguksu?

2659
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:52,539
- Give us the spoons next to you.
- Okay.

2660
01:27:52,609 --> 01:27:54,069
- It looks good.
- The youngest should do this.

2661
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:55,109
- Right.
- I think this is barley rice.

2662
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:56,109
- We have it here too.
- They're here.

2663
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:58,279
- They're giving us barley rice.
- It looks good.

2664
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:00,279
Barley rice.

2665
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,750
- Didn't she say she wouldn't eat?
- Didn't she say she wouldn't eat?

2666
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:04,949
She reacts so well.

2667
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:07,090
- But...
- Kimchi.

2668
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,819
What's with the eggs?

2669
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,189
What are the eggs for?

2670
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,890
Isn't that too exaggerated?

2671
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:14,359
- She's like that when she eats.
- Really?

2672
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,899
I really like this kind of food.
It looks healthy.

2673
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:18,260
My too.

2674
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,500
(He mixes it and starts eating.)

2675
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:23,600
Is it good?

2676
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,109
- Nice.
- Is it good?

2677
01:28:26,109 --> 01:28:28,369
(Exclaiming)

2678
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:29,380
It's so good.

2679
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:34,579
(It's like a warm-up stage
before eating the kalguksu.)

2680
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,319
It's crazy.

2681
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:40,350
(The kalguksu is out.)

2682
01:28:40,689 --> 01:28:43,319
We're seeing them make the noodles.

2683
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:45,260
- We're seeing how it's made.
- You can trust it, right?

2684
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:48,130
- The soup is clear.
- The noodles are great.

2685
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,500
- It looks so good.
- It looks good.

2686
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,770
- Thank you for the food.
- Here.

2687
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:53,869
(He blows it and starts eating.)

2688
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:58,140
(Exclaiming)

2689
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:01,039
It's good, right?
The owner makes the noodles.

2690
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,239
The noodles are amazing.

2691
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,180
(The king of the beggars
eat it too.)

2692
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,949
Could you give me the sauce?

2693
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:10,979
Here.

2694
01:29:12,289 --> 01:29:13,520
It's good.

2695
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,489
(The chewy handmade noodles
and the hot soup are great.)

2696
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,060
This is really nice.

2697
01:29:18,989 --> 01:29:20,029
It's good.

2698
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:23,659
(Ye Eun adds pepper.)

2699
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:25,260
(She spills a lot.)

2700
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:27,529
This is so good.

2701
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:29,869
The soup.

2702
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:34,770
(It's getting in his way.)

2703
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,939
The soup is amazing.

2704
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:40,050
I'm sorry, but the hair...

2705
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:42,949
- This...
- You can take it off.

2706
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,079
- Can I take it off?
- Yes.

2707
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:45,590
Your head feels itchy, right?

2708
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,489
(He removes the beggar's wig.)

2709
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:49,689
But...

2710
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,430
- It's really delicious.
- The cabbage is crunchy.

2711
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,659
- The kaguksu...
- The kimchi...

2712
01:29:56,659 --> 01:29:58,300
- The kimchi is amazing.
- is something.

2713
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:00,369
It's very red, but it's not spicy.

2714
01:30:02,539 --> 01:30:04,170
(Exclaiming)

2715
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:05,539
The noodles...

2716
01:30:05,539 --> 01:30:06,710
(It tastes even better
after the hard work.)

2717
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,810
- are really good.
- The noodles are very chewy.

2718
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:12,449
There are mixed grains
in the barley rice.

2719
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:14,550
- It's good for the blood sugar.
- Right.

2720
01:30:14,579 --> 01:30:17,220
But flour increases
the blood sugar level.

2721
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,380
So it's the same.

2722
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,789
It cancels out.

2723
01:30:19,949 --> 01:30:22,789
So it's the same.
It adds and subtracts.

2724
01:30:22,789 --> 01:30:25,289
But it was handmade.
I think it would be okay.

2725
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:27,390
- We can eat without worries.
- Right.

2726
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,399
It's zero.

2727
01:30:31,699 --> 01:30:33,270
I think the make-up
also plays a part.

2728
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:36,869
It looks more delicious
when I look at you.

2729
01:30:36,869 --> 01:30:38,399
- It looks...
- When you dress up as a beggar,

2730
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:39,909
- Yes.
- it looks much more...

2731
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:42,310
- delicious.
- It looks true.

2732
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:44,979
- True.
- I already finished a bowl.

2733
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:49,520
(Team Inferno became beggars
because they didn't have tickets.)

2734
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,119
(They hit cans and sang
to eat kalguksu.)

2735
01:30:54,819 --> 01:30:59,189
(They went around
feeling embarrassed.)

2736
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,829
(They managed to feed themselves.)

2737
01:31:02,829 --> 01:31:06,170
(Team Inferno's mealtime
was difficult.)

2738
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,100
- It's so good.
- It's good.

2739
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:11,239
Kyu Hyun.

2740
01:31:11,569 --> 01:31:13,409
(He's sweating.)

2741
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:15,069
The beggars are eating well.

2742
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:16,739
The cameras will move first.

2743
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:17,939
One, two, three.

2744
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:19,550
It's really good.

2745
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:22,449
- It's good since it's cold.
- The soup is great.

2746
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:24,350
If the penalty is weaker than this,

2747
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:26,449
- I won't tolerate it.
- There is no penalty like this.

2748
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:29,060
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

2749
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,760
- It's nice.
- It's amazing.

2750
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:34,189
This is the last mission
to get the ticket to Paradise.

2751
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:36,399
It's called Relay Race
to Escape the Inferno.

2752
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:40,800
(The Relay Race of the Inferno
on the acupressure board)

2753
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,739
(Screaming)

2754
01:31:44,369 --> 01:31:47,510
(Seok Sam is being dragged
from the beginning.)

2755
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:50,380
(Screaming)

2756
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,609
(Ddochi Ji is even weaker.)

2757
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:56,880
(Team Pink hands over the baton
after one lap.)

2758
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,520
(Ppakgu of Team Yellow came close.)

2759
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,750
(Ye Eun!)

2760
01:32:01,489 --> 01:32:03,920
(Jong Kook pulls her.)

2761
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,189
You have to run, Ye Eun.

2762
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:07,890
(Ddochi was weirdly
in good spirits today.)

2763
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,529
(But...)

2764
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,300
- We won.
- Ye Eun.

2765
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,770
(She ends up falling down.)

2766
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:15,000
We won.

2767
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,300
(Team Pink loses.)

2768
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,739
We'll give the tickets to the team
that lost and to the team that won.

2769
01:32:19,739 --> 01:32:20,770
- We still get them.
- The team that won...

2770
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:21,840
will be given five tickets.

2771
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:24,140
- We get the tickets.
- One each.

2772
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,479
- It's coming.
- The team that lost gets three.

2773
01:32:25,609 --> 01:32:27,010
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

2774
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:28,949
- One each.
- That...

2775
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,180
One each.

2776
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,020
Ten, nine... Ten, eleven.

2777
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:35,149
(Adding up the tickets
he picked up from the floor)

2778
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:36,359
Four.

2779
01:32:36,819 --> 01:32:38,720
- I have many.
- It's done. I have many.

2780
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,359
- I have 9.
- I have 9 too.

2781
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:42,960
- I have nine as well.
- We'll make the last decision...

2782
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,060
between Paradise and the Inferno.

2783
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,470
The number of tickets to Paradise
for the prize you need is...

2784
01:32:47,529 --> 01:32:49,170
I'm nervous. Please.

2785
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:52,239
The number of tickets to Paradise
for the prize you need is...

2786
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,239
(The number of tickets to pay
to go to Paradise)

2787
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:58,140
You need seven tickets.

2788
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:59,850
(The number of tickets to pay
to go to Paradise: 7)

2789
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,750
(He's going to the Inferno
because he lacks 1 ticket.)

2790
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:02,880
I have more.

2791
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:04,949
- They're going?
- I have more.

2792
01:33:04,949 --> 01:33:06,319
It's okay.

2793
01:33:06,949 --> 01:33:08,319
Can I transfer it?

2794
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,819
The people who ate.

2795
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:11,390
The people who ate.

2796
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:12,529
Are you here, Kyu Hyun?

2797
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:14,560
- Of course, I'm here.
- Nice.

2798
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,029
- We...
- The beggars.

2799
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:18,600
- The beggars.
- The beggars.

2800
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,829
- Eun Tae.
- What's with Eun Tae?

2801
01:33:19,829 --> 01:33:21,399
- You're in Paradise again?
- I have seven tickets.

2802
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:22,840
You were kind.

2803
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:24,369
- Well done.
- He gave out tickets,

2804
01:33:24,369 --> 01:33:25,810
and he still has seven.

2805
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,670
- He's amazing.
- He was in Paradise every time.

2806
01:33:27,939 --> 01:33:31,640
The person who has the most
number of tickets...

2807
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,380
- will definitely get the prize.
- Isn't that me?

2808
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:36,720
Isn't that me?

2809
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,819
(Is Ye Eun the 1st?)

2810
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,850
I have 11.

2811
01:33:42,859 --> 01:33:44,659
(He collected tickets by not eating
the Paradise feast.)

2812
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:45,789
I have ten.

2813
01:33:45,789 --> 01:33:47,289
(I have 10.)

2814
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:49,829
(Jae Seok will get the prize.)

2815
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:53,100
- Jae Seok will get the prize.
- These are 11 tickets.

2816
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,399
(That was close.)

2817
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:56,840
In the final Inferno...

2818
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,699
There are ten buckets.

2819
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:00,609
Five of them have ink,

2820
01:34:00,609 --> 01:34:03,140
two of them have water,
and three of them have confetti.

2821
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:06,850
You can choose between those.

2822
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,050
Ink?

2823
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:09,520
(There's a 50 percent chance
to get showered by ink.)

2824
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:12,319
The second one
was the most important one.

2825
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:13,350
(They exchanged the penalty that
gets them wet for delicious lunch.)

2826
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,649
I'd have to take a shower here.

2827
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:18,960
But Team Paradise
will get ten buckets.

2828
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,390
What?

2829
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:24,100
There are four with water
and six with confetti.

2830
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:25,229
These things...

2831
01:34:25,229 --> 01:34:27,869
So there's a chance all five of you
choose the confetti bucket.

2832
01:34:27,869 --> 01:34:29,000
(There's a 60 percent chance
they pick confetti.)

2833
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,699
Team Paradise will select...

2834
01:34:30,699 --> 01:34:32,810
- the buckets first.
- Okay.

2835
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:35,539
- I'm bad at selecting these things.
- I want the confetti too.

2836
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:36,840
(I'm bad at selecting these things.)

2837
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,779
I'm lucky today.

2838
01:34:38,979 --> 01:34:42,010
The five members of Team Paradise
can sit first.

2839
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,479
Let's go to Paradise.

2840
01:34:43,479 --> 01:34:45,850
Six of them have confetti,

2841
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:47,149
- so you have a 60 percent chance...
- Right.

2842
01:34:47,149 --> 01:34:48,489
- to pick it.
- That's right.

2843
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:50,859
- I get unlucky with these...
- Unless you're super unlucky...

2844
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:52,630
Why does it feel like
Ye Eun will be showered with water?

2845
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:54,159
You have to choose quickly.

2846
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,300
- Please choose a number.
- Seven.

2847
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,159
I'll choose the one next to her.
Number eight.

2848
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,569
I'll take number six.

2849
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:01,529
- I'll take five.
- I'll...

2850
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,369
Those who seek death shall live.
Number four.

2851
01:35:03,369 --> 01:35:04,640
- Four for death?
- Yes.

2852
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:06,170
- Four for death.
- Right.

2853
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:07,409
I'm number eight, Jong Kook.

2854
01:35:07,409 --> 01:35:08,840
- Ye Eun picked seven.
- Seven?

2855
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:09,979
You do it.

2856
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:11,909
Jong Kook recommended the number.

2857
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:13,149
- Mine is 5.
- Kyu Hyun picked 4.

2858
01:35:13,149 --> 01:35:15,819
You can pour at the count of three.

2859
01:35:15,819 --> 01:35:17,350
I'm in good spirits today.

2860
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:18,520
Please.

2861
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:20,520
He's been in Paradise the whole day.

2862
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,289
- Paradise after Paradise.
- That's amazing.

2863
01:35:22,619 --> 01:35:26,260
(Kyu Hyun chased away bad luck
by dressing up as a beggar.)

2864
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:29,359
There's a 60 percent chance
you'll get the confetti.

2865
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:30,500
- I want to poop.
- Okay.

2866
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:32,829
One, two, three.

2867
01:35:33,529 --> 01:35:35,199
One, two, three.

2868
01:35:36,369 --> 01:35:37,470
(Kyu Hyun and Ji Hyo
got the confetti bucket.)

2869
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:38,470
Nice.

2870
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:40,109
One, two, three.

2871
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:42,239
Okay!

2872
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,340
(Ji Ye Eun got the penalty again.)

2873
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:47,880
(She even gave up on food
to avoid the penalty.)

2874
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,020
Congratulations.

2875
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:51,720
(Laughing)

2876
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,449
Give me one.

2877
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:54,989
You're rich.

2878
01:35:54,989 --> 01:35:56,060
I'll give you one.

2879
01:35:56,260 --> 01:36:01,159
(He was a saint...)

2880
01:36:01,159 --> 01:36:04,300
(who gave out tickets.)

2881
01:36:04,529 --> 01:36:06,630
- Are you okay, Eun Tae?
- He got it.

2882
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,430
- You got it at the end.
- Are you okay, Eun Tae?

2883
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,300
Are you okay?

2884
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,569
Next is the ink.

2885
01:36:12,569 --> 01:36:13,810
- Ink.
- Ink.

2886
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:14,840
- Ink.
- Sit down.

2887
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:18,939
Team Inferno gets 5 buckets of ink,
2 buckets of water,

2888
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,250
and three buckets of confetti.

2889
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:21,550
- Okay.
- Three buckets of confetti.

2890
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:25,050
- They're coming.
- Amazing.

2891
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:27,250
- It's no joke.
- It's serious.

2892
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,590
What's that?

2893
01:36:28,989 --> 01:36:29,989
Why is it so big?

2894
01:36:29,989 --> 01:36:31,789
(The audience overreact.)

2895
01:36:31,789 --> 01:36:33,359
Don't do that.

2896
01:36:33,529 --> 01:36:35,359
It's scary hearing their footsteps.

2897
01:36:35,729 --> 01:36:36,930
Okay.

2898
01:36:37,229 --> 01:36:38,829
Make your choices.

2899
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:42,329
Numbers 1 to 5 might be bad
and the rest might be good.

2900
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:43,899
Go first, Haha.

2901
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:46,539
I'll take number eight.

2902
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:48,909
- Eight.
- Next?

2903
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:50,109
Number two.

2904
01:36:50,109 --> 01:36:51,340
- Number 5.
- Number 5?

2905
01:36:51,909 --> 01:36:53,149
- Number 6.
- Number 6.

2906
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:54,710
I'll take Seok Sam's. Number six.

2907
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:56,449
Your mic, Haha.

2908
01:36:57,149 --> 01:36:58,380
Hold your mic tight.

2909
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,649
(Your mic, Haha.
Hold your mic tight.)

2910
01:36:59,649 --> 01:37:02,489
Se Chan told me to hold
my mic tight.

2911
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:04,359
- Really...
- I'll give you the last chance...

2912
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:05,489
to switch your buckets.

2913
01:37:05,489 --> 01:37:06,689
- A chance.
- Me.

2914
01:37:06,789 --> 01:37:08,630
Me.

2915
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:10,500
- I'll take number 1.
- Number 1.

2916
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,699
- You'll switch it?
- Yes.

2917
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:13,229
(Haha changed the bucket
at the end.)

2918
01:37:13,229 --> 01:37:15,600
He's really...

2919
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:17,640
Let's wash up clean.

2920
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:19,810
Are you ready?

2921
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:22,210
- Pour it at the count of three.
- Hold your mic tight.

2922
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:23,579
Okay.

2923
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:24,979
Let's go.

2924
01:37:24,979 --> 01:37:26,180
(Will they be able to avoid
the 50 percent chance of getting ink?)

2925
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:29,649
One, two, three.

2926
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:35,449
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook
avoided getting the ink.)

2927
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,390
(Haha avoided the ink as well.)

2928
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:41,930
- It makes no sense.
- Look at number eight.

2929
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:43,729
- What was number 8?
- Number 8.

2930
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:46,029
Number eight was confetti too.

2931
01:37:46,029 --> 01:37:48,000
- Really? I was going to take 8.
- Number 8.

2932
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:50,470
(What about Seok Hoon at the end?)

2933
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:51,670
I'm sorry.

2934
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:54,869
(He got showered with ink.)

2935
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,479
(He got the worst penalty as well.)

2936
01:37:56,479 --> 01:37:58,840
Seok Hoon.

2937
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,449
Seok Hoon.

2938
01:38:00,449 --> 01:38:02,479
(He's the only one
who got showered with ink.)

2939
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:05,149
(He has to stay behind
to take a shower.)

2940
01:38:05,149 --> 01:38:06,189
- Ink.
- Seok Hoon.

2941
01:38:06,189 --> 01:38:07,890
- Seok Hoon.
- Was it Seok Hoon?

2942
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:09,859
I'm totally wet. Even my underwear
is wet.

2943
01:38:10,359 --> 01:38:12,460
Also, as for the prize,

2944
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:13,859
Jae Seok will get it
since he had the most number...

2945
01:38:13,859 --> 01:38:14,960
- of tickets.
- Yes.

2946
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,159
Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and Kyu Hyun
who got showered...

2947
01:38:17,159 --> 01:38:20,170
with confetti in Team Paradise
will get the prizes too.

2948
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:21,170
(The 3 people who chose the confetti
will get the prize too!)

2949
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:24,470
The prize is honey
which is good for your throat.

2950
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:28,170
- It's amazing.
- This tastes like honey.

2951
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:29,479
It tastes like honey.

2952
01:38:29,479 --> 01:38:30,810
Thank you.

2953
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,479
We had the three members
from "The Man Who Laughs."

2954
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:35,750
- Please clap for them.
- Thank you.

2955
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:37,819
- Okay.
- Bye.

2956
01:38:39,819 --> 01:38:40,989
- Madam!
- Goodness.

2957
01:38:40,989 --> 01:38:43,560
(They were asked to dress up as
slaves, but they came as beggars.)

2958
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,819
I had a drink.

2959
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:47,930
(The slaves are as messed up
as they appear.)

2960
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:50,399
(The master of the slaves appears.)

2961
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:51,960
He has a bad voice.

2962
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:55,630
(The master has bad pronunciation
and gets teased by his slaves.)

2963
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:57,739
(Find the doctor who will
straighten his tongue!)

2964
01:38:57,739 --> 01:38:59,340
How will we find him using this?

2965
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:00,739
- Please save us.
- The celebrities in Insa-dong.

2966
01:39:00,909 --> 01:39:04,939
(The slaves are running around
for their master.)

2967
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:09,010
(Did they find the doctor
after all the trouble?)

2968
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:13,989
(Why is Robert Pattinson here?)

2969
01:39:13,989 --> 01:39:15,689
We are famous in Korea.

2970
01:39:15,689 --> 01:39:17,560
(The Joseon celebrities are frozen
after meeting the Hollywood star...)

2971
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,390
(dressed up shabbily.)

2972
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:24,529
(Will the slaves be able
to find the doctor for their lord?)

2973
01:39:24,529 --> 01:39:25,729
(The Chaotic Life of Slaves)
