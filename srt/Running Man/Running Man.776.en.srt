1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,340
What is this?

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,640
This is so cool.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,280
- What is this thing?
- Look at this.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,110
- It's amazing.
- When did they build this?

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,420
This is really...
(The older members appear
with admiration.)

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,520
The design looks amazing.
Gosh, what's that?

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,120
What is that sculpture?

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,520
- This is so cool.
- My goodness.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,060
- What is all this?
- This place looks so cool.

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,260
This is Songhyeon Green Plaza,
located near Anguk Station.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,000
- I know.
- Yes. Today,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,430
to celebrate the Seoul Biennale
of Architecture and Urbanism,

13
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,240
which takes place every two years,

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,840
we've gathered in front...

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,770
of the Humanize Wall,
a landmark structure.

16
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,370
- I love it.
- It looks so cool.

17
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,080
- So, this is what it is.
- It looks amazing.

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,980
- This is a piece of work.
- There are sculptures here.

19
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,810
The Seoul Museum
of Architecture and Urbanism...

20
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,280
offers free access to exhibitions
that showcase architecture...

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,620
from Seoul and around the world,

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,450
including the works
currently on display here.

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,790
- Is it free?
- Yes, it's free of charge.

24
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,360
- It's K-architecture.
- Designers from around the world.

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,560
- It's amazing.
- Right.

26
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,290
Seoul is now a truly global city.

27
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,390
It is a global city, indeed.

28
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,460
So, can anyone visit
the exhibitions?

29
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,900
You can see the architecture
from around the world.

30
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,270
People of all ages and genders?

31
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,600
- That makes sense!
- In Seoul.

32
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,940
It'll be great
to go there with your family.

33
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,100
- This is really...
- Was it...

34
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,210
- last year?
- We played foot volleyball here.

35
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,310
- Exactly.
- This is the place.

36
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,280
Yes. With the idols, right?

37
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,710
- The idols were here.
- Yes.

38
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,710
- BABYMONSTER.
- You look cold, by the way.

39
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,020
Yes, I'm cold.

40
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,220
Hey, aren't they too short?

41
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,590
He's a so-called
"Young Forty" these days.

42
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,720
- The Young Forty.
- This is what the Young Forty does.

43
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,890
Why would you say that?

44
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,190
- The Young Forty.
- Hey, show us your phone.

45
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,990
- Show it off!
- I really didn't know.

46
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,890
- Go ahead and show us.
- I didn't know when I bought this.

47
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,200
The Young Forty.

48
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,300
The Young Forty.

49
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
- Not you!
- Give it to me. I'm fine with that.

50
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,270
I showed off my new phone...

51
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,900
during my radio show like this.
And suddenly,

52
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,740
people posted a lot of comments
saying, "Young Forty."

53
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,210
Young Forty? Why?

54
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,410
But on the other hand, we have...

55
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,710
always been told to do...

56
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,110
- whatever we wanted.
- I know.

57
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,610
- We were told to do that.
- That's what we've been told.

58
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,710
But those who pursue youth...

59
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,320
- And now..
- I know. This is really...

60
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,120
Who do you think you are
to judge me? Darn it!

61
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,420
Haha isn't Young Forty!

62
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,190
- Who do you think you are?
- Haha is still young!

63
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,560
Look.
He is the epitome of Young Forty.

64
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,960
(Ha Dong Hoon's life in his 40s,
where he was busy chasing youth)

65
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,900
- My gosh.
- I got this sponsored.

66
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,900
By the way, when we were
talking about Young Forty,

67
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,370
Seok Jin had no idea
what the meme really meant.

68
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,400
- I didn't know.
- "I'm Young Fifty."

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
- I had no idea.
- Young Fifty?

70
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,170
- He liked it.
- Right.

71
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,080
- He's not Young Fifty.
- Young Sixty.

72
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,380
Actually, he's not Young Fifty.

73
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,810
- Yes.
- Are you sure you're Young Fifty?

74
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,550
- Of course, you brat!
- Young Sixty.

75
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,620
- Young Sixty.
- Haha's Young Forty...

76
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,120
and my Young Fifty
are totally different.

77
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,320
- You're Young Sixty.
- You're Young Sixty.

78
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,520
- And...
- Sixty!

79
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,990
- Why do you keep saying fifty?
- What's wrong with you?

80
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,120
- Be honest about your age now.
- Here's the thing.

81
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,590
- I'll make it clear here.
- Okay.

82
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,360
The "Young" of my Young Fifty
doesn't mean youth.

83
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,200
It means eternity.
I'm in my fifties forever.

84
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,060
- How lame.
- It's so boring.

85
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,700
- I'm serious.
- Enough.

86
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,000
- How lame.
- I'll be in my fifties next year.

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,570
I almost threw up in the morning.

88
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,600
I feel nauseated.

89
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
I'll be in my 50s for 3 years.

90
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,010
- That's so lame.
- Don't be ridiculous.

91
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,710
This is like
Jee Seok Jin's campaign.

92
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,580
- My campaign?
- Jee Seok Sam!

93
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,580
- Jee Seok Sam!
- Jee Seok Sam!

94
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,720
- Jee Seok Sam!
- I'm Young Fifty!

95
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,680
- He keeps saying Young Fifty.
- Forever Fifty.

96
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,890
As you saw earlier,

97
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,190
we have a guest joining us today.

98
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,620
Please bring the guest in.

99
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,820
This is controversial.

100
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,590
- Is he good enough to come alone?
- I don't think...

101
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,190
- he's good enough to come alone.
- He's not enough.

102
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,600
- Is he really alone?
- You're being slow.

103
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,060
- Hurry and run.
- Run.

104
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,330
Run.

105
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,100
- Jonathan.
- You should run.

106
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,270
I can still see your feet.

107
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,000
- Hello.
- His shoes...

108
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,710
- Okay.
- Stand here.

109
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,440
Jonathan.

110
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,610
You came from far away.

111
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,840
- Okay.
- Your shoes are soaked.

112
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,340
Hey, Jonathan.

113
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,180
You didn't text us on Chuseok.

114
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,480
- Right.
- Did you?

115
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,880
How could you be so disrespectful?

116
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,190
- It's not like that.
- We are closer than that.

117
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,820
I thought you would be busy.

118
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,160
- Come on.
- Why would we be busy on Chuseok?

119
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,190
- The production crew doesn't work.
- No one's busy.

120
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,590
He was on our show last September,
so it's been a year.

121
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,600
- Really?
- Jonathan.

122
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,360
- We met again after a year.
- I see.

123
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,600
That doesn't sound right.

124
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,430
- It feels like we met often.
- Jonathan isn't a guest.

125
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,270
- Exactly. He's just...
- He's just stopping by.

126
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,470
- He's our family.
- Right.

127
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,640
I'm very grateful.

128
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,870
Why is it so silent?

129
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,710
- We're not saying anything.
- Hey.

130
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,980
- This is why...
- Why is it so silent?

131
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,880
This is why he isn't good enough
to be here alone.

132
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,620
This is why.

133
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,550
- And...
- Seriously...

134
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,690
- We aren't usually so quiet.
- You should keep talking.

135
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,450
Jonathan is quite busy,

136
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,090
- so it's hard to have him here.
- Right.

137
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,460
He's still not good enough
to be here as a single guest.

138
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,760
- That's right.
- These days...

139
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Am I the only guest for today?

140
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,530
- We should ask how he's doing.
- Yes. You're alone.

141
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,260
- Are the other guests hiding?
- We don't need to ask.

142
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,700
- Behind the walls?
- What?

143
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,470
We have nothing to ask about him.
Should we ask him?

144
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,100
- Do you have any questions?
- How have you been?

145
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,470
I recently lost 2kg.

146
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,370
Our response...

147
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,710
- Hey, you can't be here alone.
- Why...

148
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,080
- Losing 2kg is not important.
- It should be at least 10kg.

149
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,580
- What else?
- He shouldn't be here alone.

150
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,750
It's okay.

151
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,450
What do I need to be here
as a single guest?

152
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,480
You should at least
have something...

153
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,320
- to tell us about.
- Something that makes us curious.

154
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,820
We need to run up to you in awe.

155
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,860
(He should bring a bunch of
intriguing stories to come alone.)

156
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,490
You guys have gathered here today
to participate in the Biennale.

157
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,800
You will first have a mission
to get a chance card...

158
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,200
- that will help you with your work.
- I see.

159
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,500
The mission consists
of two types of running.

160
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,100
- What's that?
- Are we doing it here?

161
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
- It's so muddy.
- Right here?

162
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,610
We asked your stylists to get you...

163
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,540
- cheap pants in advance.
- You did?

164
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
I see. Did you talk to them?

165
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,710
Are you wearing shorts
because it's muddy?

166
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,910
Well done, Young Forty.

167
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,750
- Young Forty.
- The shorts are expensive, though.

168
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,680
- Good.
- Young Forty.

169
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,150
It's finally Haha's time.

170
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,390
Right.

171
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,290
- Finally, Haha...
- For Young Forty.

172
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,560
It's Haha's time.

173
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,760
(Exclaiming)

174
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
(Complete)

175
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,100
It's for the Young Forty.

176
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,970
Young Forty.

177
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,430
(The meme of Young Forty
is coming to its end.)

178
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,740
- Okay.
- I'll explain the first game.

179
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,870
The first game is the 80m Rank Race.

180
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,110
- An 80m race?
- What's that?

181
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,840
You must get your running records...

182
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,280
in the order
chosen by the production crew.

183
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,550
You are supposed to achieve
your own records,

184
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,120
from 1st to 8th place,

185
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,950
- in the specified order.
- To match the given order?

186
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,390
It's not about winning the race.

187
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,190
Let's say I randomly pick
Ji Hyo's ranking,

188
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,990
and she is supposed to rank second.

189
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,260
- Then you should work together...
- We should match it.

190
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,830
to make Ji Hyo rank second.

191
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,360
- Really?
- Yes. The rest of the members.

192
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,970
- We should think about the ranking.
- It's the game of wit.

193
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,500
But all the members
must finish the lap...

194
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,210
- within 35 seconds.
- Within 35 seconds.

195
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,240
One person has to finish...

196
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,370
- Per person.
- the lap in 35 seconds.

197
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,180
And we need to match the ranking.

198
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,080
We should have the fast runners
run fast anyway.

199
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,110
Please decide on the first runner.

200
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,680
Then I will pick a number
for the runner's ranking.

201
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,320
- Okay.
- Who should go first?

202
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,390
- Jae Seok, the first runner...
- Shouldn't it be Ji Hyo?

203
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,090
- Let's go with Ji Hyo.
- She should be the reference point.

204
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,590
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo, you go first.

205
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I'll go first.

206
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,990
Song Ji Hyo.

207
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,890
- She picked the number.
- Ji Hyo should run...

208
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,560
(Ji Hyo's goal is to come in 5th.)

209
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,430
- to come in fifth.
- It's not bad.

210
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,670
- Fifth place.
- I can go slow.

211
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,340
- Then...
- She should finish in the 20s.

212
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,600
- Then...
- It's the middle rank.

213
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,170
Then you should run fast.

214
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,410
Ji Hyo, you should finish the lap
in about 25...

215
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,640
- to 27 seconds.
- About 25 seconds.

216
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,580
No. It doesn't have to be so fast.

217
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,410
She shouldn't be too slow.

218
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,080
- Ready.
- What should she do?

219
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,890
- It's fifth place.
- You don't have to be so fast.

220
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,250
- That's what I think.
- Ready.

221
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,090
Don't run too fast.
- This is...
- Not so fast.

222
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,420
- Good.
- You shouldn't be too fast.

223
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,190
- Don't be so fast.
- She's the fifth place.

224
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,900
You have to finish it in 35 seconds.

225
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,300
- Right. It's 35 seconds.
- Isn't one of us supposed...

226
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,400
- to be counting the numbers?
- She should hurry anyway.

227
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,430
- Run!
- You should run.

228
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,900
- Hurry!
- I think you should hurry.

229
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,140
- How many seconds has it been?
- Keep it up!

230
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,170
What's her record?

231
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,370
- Has it been 20 seconds?
- It's fast.

232
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,670
- You're too fast.
- Ji Hyo shouldn't run too fast.

233
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,980
- She's fast.
- Come here.

234
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,980
- It's okay.
- All right.

235
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,710
- I think this is good enough.
- Okay.

236
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,310
- Is it 26?
- I bet it's 24 or 25.

237
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,680
- I should be the fifth.
- Ji Hyo's record...

238
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,820
- is 25.40 seconds.
- Okay.

239
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
- That's perfect.
- It's 25.40 seconds.
- Good.
- It's not bad.

240
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,960
- That's good.
- It is good.

241
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,990
- Well done.
- Next up is...

242
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,160
- Young Forty. No, Young Sixty.
- Young Sixty.

243
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,300
- Young Sixty.
- Young Fifty.

244
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,500
- Young Fifty.
- Young Sixty.

245
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,200
- Young Sixty.
- Young Fifty.

246
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,430
- Young Sixty.
- Young Sixty?

247
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,100
- Young Sixty goes next.
- Young Sixty?

248
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,700
- Yes. Did you not know?
- Just don't pick number one.

249
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,170
He's in his sixties now.

250
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,710
- Is he 60?
- He looks young, doesn't he?

251
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,810
Running in jeans.

252
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,810
Just don't pick number one.

253
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,210
He looks young, doesn't he?

254
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,980
- Running in jeans.
- He should be in first place.

255
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,910
- First place?
- Seok Jin, Jonathan just said...

256
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,950
- First place?
- Seok Jin, Jonathan just said this.

257
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,750
"Is he 60?"

258
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,520
- No.
- First place.

259
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,590
- I'm not.
- You need to come in first place?

260
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,590
- He's got first place.
- Are you?

261
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,560
- Just run fast.
- She picked number one.

262
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,590
This is better.

263
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,260
- Run as fast as you can.
- I'll just run fast.

264
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,460
- You are not so slow.
- You have to run fast.

265
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,700
(Start)

266
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,200
- Run fast.
- Go!

267
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,430
- Good. It's okay.
- Run faster.

268
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,700
- What if he trips and falls?
- Run as fast as you can.

269
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,840
(The Young Sixty is jogging
in the middle of the Biennale.)

270
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,370
- Run fast!
- Hurry!

271
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,480
- Just come quickly.
- Hurry!

272
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,510
- Run fast.
- Seok Jin, run.

273
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,910
- Seok Jin.
- Hurry!

274
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,410
(With the support and encouragement
of the younger members,)

275
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,120
(he successfully finishes
the 80m lap on two legs.)

276
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,580
- That was fast.
- Sixty!

277
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,780
- That was good.
- What's his record?

278
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,220
- I bet it's 10.
- It's 15 seconds.

279
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,390
- Young Sixty!
- Young Sixty!

280
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,420
- Young Fifty!
- Young Sixty!

281
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,930
- Young Fifty.
- All right. Seok Jin's record...

282
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,690
- is 20.08 seconds.
- My gosh.

283
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,930
- It's 20 seconds.
- It's pretty good, right?

284
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,930
- That's good.
- It's not bad.

285
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,400
- But he ran at full speed.
- It's 20.08 seconds.

286
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,430
- At full speed...
- It's okay.

287
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,670
It's only 20 seconds?

288
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,700
But he ran at full speed.

289
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,310
- That doesn't make sense.
- That's because...

290
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,270
- he had to make a turn.
- Right.

291
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,880
- That's why.
- He had to slow down.

292
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,380
- He didn't run straight.
- And the ground...

293
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,180
- is muddy.
- All right then.

294
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,950
The first place record is
20 seconds.

295
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,350
- That's enough.
- There's enough time.

296
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,180
- Do you want me to go next?
- Yes.

297
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,650
- Okay. You go next.
- Me.

298
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,420
It's burdensome
to be the last runner.

299
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,620
- Right?
- It's Jong Kook.

300
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,660
It's better to run first.

301
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,130
- It's hard for me.
- The last runner is important.

302
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,060
- He should be in second place.
- Then...

303
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,060
Make it 21 seconds.

304
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,160
- No.
- It should be 21 seconds.

305
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,460
- It's 21 seconds.
- It should be 21 seconds.

306
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,560
My turn is good.

307
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,030
You have enough time
between the two.

308
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,030
What was your record?

309
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,840
- Between 20 and 25 seconds.
- Right.

310
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,600
Young Sixty, are you out of breath?

311
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,470
It should be about 21...

312
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,040
- or 22 seconds.
- Right.

313
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
- It's easy for you.
- All right.

314
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,680
- Ready.
- You can make it 21 seconds.

315
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,880
- Yes, 21 or 22 seconds.
- Go.

316
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,910
- Go.
- Okay.

317
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,150
- Yes, 21 or 22 seconds.
- Go.

318
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,280
- Go.
- Okay.

319
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,850
- Go!
- He's got it!

320
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,890
- He's fast.
- Go.

321
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,920
- Okay.
- One, two, three,

322
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,890
- four, five...
- He's got it!

323
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
- He looks like a bear.
- He runs like this.

324
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,830
We should be counting numbers.

325
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,030
- All right.
- Me.

326
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,260
Good.

327
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,500
- Wait.
- Slow down.

328
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,900
Slow down.

329
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,130
- Wait.
- Don't come yet.

330
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,230
Is it too soon?

331
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,940
- Come closer.
- He's too fast.

332
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,800
- Twenty, twenty-one.
- I think it's too soon.

333
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,770
- Come in. Twenty-three.
- Okay.

334
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,910
Twenty-three.

335
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,080
- Is it done? Did I do it right?
- No?

336
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,680
- No?
- Is it too soon?

337
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,510
He was fast.

338
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,920
All right.

339
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,320
Kim Jong Kook's record...

340
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,650
(If he is faster than 20.08 seconds,
the mission fails.)

341
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,450
- is 22.54 seconds.
- Yes!

342
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,720
- It is 22.54 seconds.
- Yes!

343
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,490
- You did it.
- What a relief.

344
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,430
- It's a relief.
- I got it right.

345
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,330
- Good. Did you count?
- Yes.

346
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,730
- Daniel.
- Daniel is next.

347
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,470
- I wish he were in first place.
- I'll pick a number.

348
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,800
- Okay.
- It's possible.

349
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,700
The records are good now.

350
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,940
It's easy for the lower ranks.

351
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,910
- It's third place.
- Three.

352
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,840
- Make it 24 seconds.
- It should be around 24 seconds.

353
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,910
Ready.

354
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,480
He's not a good runner, though.

355
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,510
One.

356
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,280
- He's just...
- You shouldn't run too fast.

357
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,820
He's not a good runner, though.

358
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,880
One.

359
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,090
(The human stopwatch
starts counting.)

360
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,090
- He...
- Look at his legs.

361
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,590
- Look at his feet.
- He's faster than I was.

362
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,020
Ji Hyo, was your record 25 seconds?

363
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,390
- My record was 25 seconds.
- Hang on.

364
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,960
- Darn it. This is...
- Hey.

365
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,190
- It's hard to stop here.
- You should hurry.

366
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,500
- Make a spurt.
- No. It's okay.

367
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,600
- You have to come.
- Come.

368
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,330
- You should wait here.
- Fifteen, sixteen...

369
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,700
- No, you fool!
- Hey.

370
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,870
- No.
- Keep running.

371
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,140
- No. Wait here.
- Keep running.

372
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,370
- Wait.
- No.

373
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,440
- Don't come.
- Wait.

374
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,540
- You should come.
- Come.

375
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,840
- Come.
- He's being slow.

376
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,040
- Done.
- It was too late.

377
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,940
- No. It's perfect.
- He waited too long here.

378
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,640
Daniel is in third place,

379
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,150
- and his record is 25.03 seconds.
- Darn it.

380
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,350
- See?
- It was too late.

381
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,980
- His record is 25.03 seconds.
- Darn it.

382
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,720
- It was too late.
- Seok Jin.

383
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,890
- He should get here first.
- I was counting.

384
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,720
- He should wait here.
- He was too late.

385
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,020
- Right.
- It was too late.

386
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,460
I was counting.

387
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,020
- So...
- You should come quickly.

388
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,290
Ji Hyo is in fifth place now.

389
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,330
- Yes.
- She's in fifth place.

390
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,100
Daniel is in third place.

391
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,400
The gap between them...

392
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,200
- is only 0.4 seconds.
- It's over then.

393
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,270
- It's over.
- No.

394
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,800
We have to get the 0.4 seconds.

395
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,440
Yes. Fourth place...

396
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,540
should be slower
than 25.03 seconds...

397
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,810
- and faster...
- He should've come sooner.

398
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,380
- than 25.40 seconds.
- You shouldn't have stopped.

399
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,610
- He should've waited here.
- But...

400
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,810
- Am I going next?
- We're doomed.

401
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,050
- I'll go.
- We're in trouble.

402
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,420
You have no idea.

403
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,750
- As you run...
- Of course not.

404
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,290
You should count as you run.

405
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,290
- Right.
- You should be in sixth place.

406
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,620
- In 6th place?
- Make it 27 seconds.

407
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,720
- Slower than her.
- Around 27 seconds.

408
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,060
- Around 26 or 27 seconds.
- All right.

409
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,230
- Around 27 seconds?
- You can go slow.

410
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,760
- You should go slow.
- Ready.

411
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,430
Around 27 seconds. Like a jog.

412
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Okay.

413
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,970
As slow as Ji Hyo.

414
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,400
- No.
- I think you're too slow.

415
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,900
Go faster than that.

416
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,740
- You should go faster.
- It's 26 seconds, so it's okay.

417
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,110
Jae Seok, go fast
and slow down when you return.

418
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,140
Eleven, twelve,

419
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,040
- thirteen, fourteen,
- I should go quickly anyway.

420
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,450
- You should come.
- fifteen,

421
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,780
- sixteen, seventeen,
- No.

422
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,680
- eighteen, nineteen,
- No.

423
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,050
- twenty, twenty-one...
- Just come here.

424
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,850
- Wait, Jae Seok.
- How long has it been?

425
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,990
- Twenty-three,
- A little more.

426
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,060
- twenty-four,
- Twenty-four.

427
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,460
- twenty-five.
- Come.

428
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,820
(If he finishes faster than Ji Hyo,
the mission fails.)

429
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,330
- Come here.
- Come here.

430
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,700
- It should be around 27 seconds.
- He's in 6th place?

431
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,800
It should be around 26 seconds.

432
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,830
It's 26 seconds.

433
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,470
- It's 26.03 seconds.
- Yes!

434
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,730
- It's 26.03 seconds.
- Good.

435
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,140
- Good job.
- We succeeded.

436
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,200
- It's perfect.
- Well done.

437
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,640
- Jonathan.
- Me?

438
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,970
- I'll go next.
- Jonathan. Okay, good.

439
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,170
- You can run wearing that.
- Okay.

440
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,710
Jonathan isn't good at running.

441
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,380
He says,
"Jonathan isn't good at running."

442
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,550
Isn't he a good runner?

443
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,280
My nickname was
Yongsan Usain Bolt. Seriously.

444
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,820
- Jonathan.
- I'm ready.

445
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,320
- It's seventh place.
- Our single guest.

446
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,450
Seventh place!

447
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,920
It should be
between 28 and 29 seconds.

448
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,120
- Ready.
- In 29 seconds.

449
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,190
(The goal is 29 seconds.)

450
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,560
- Around 29 seconds.
- Young Forty, are you cold?

451
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,630
- Around 29 seconds.
- Young Forty, are you cold?

452
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,260
(Jonathan sets off!)

453
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,660
- Four, five...
- Four, five...

454
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,900
(The old stopwatch
is still working properly!)

455
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,540
Thirteen.

456
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,170
(Josain Bolt
with a unique running technique)

457
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,610
- Wait.
- Twenty-five.

458
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,010
Twenty-six.

459
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,180
Twenty-seven.

460
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,380
You should come.

461
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,080
- Okay. It's perfect.
- He was right on time, right?

462
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,650
- His record is 28.15 seconds.
- See?

463
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,980
- That's good enough.
- We did it.

464
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,380
- That's just good.
- It's not bad.

465
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,420
No one intended it,
but it was just good enough.

466
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,790
- We intended it.
- That's good enough.

467
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,620
- I'll go next.
- All right.

468
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,460
- Good.
- These days,

469
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,560
he's working out his legs.

470
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,720
- Go, Young Forty.
- Haha.

471
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,430
- Young Forty.
- Good.

472
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,260
- Young Forty.
- Young Forty.

473
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,860
- It's fourth place.
- Oh, no.

474
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,900
What's the record for fourth place?

475
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,000
- It's fourth place.
- Oh, no.

476
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,100
What's the record for fourth place?

477
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,070
- This is...
- Is it the 0.4 seconds?

478
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,140
- This is it.
- It should be 25 seconds.

479
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,470
It should be between 25.03
and 25.40 seconds.

480
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,240
- That's impossible.
- Just give it a try.

481
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,310
- Haha.
- Give it a go. You can do it.

482
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,410
Just give it a try. It's possible.

483
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,540
- We will count here.
- You can do it.

484
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,050
- Get here as soon as possible.
- I will...

485
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,050
run as fast as possible.

486
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,350
It should be 25.40 seconds?

487
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,680
- My gosh.
- Your shoes are perfect.

488
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,190
- Go.
- Ready.

489
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,490
- You can do this.
- Go, Young Forty!

490
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,590
Go!

491
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,660
Not yet.

492
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,120
Young Forty!

493
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,060
- One.
- Run.

494
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,630
- Run fast.
- Three.

495
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,860
- Hey!
- Turn around.

496
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,860
Hurry.

497
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,930
You can do this!

498
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,730
Gosh, it's cold.

499
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,930
- That's difficult.
- Young Forty!

500
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Eleven.

501
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,670
Not yet.

502
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,240
You should get here first.

503
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Wait here.

504
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,650
Come in now!

505
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,880
- Go!
- All right.

506
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,290
- I think it was fast.
- It was a little fast.

507
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,320
- A little fast.
- No.

508
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
He was one second faster.

509
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,520
- No.
- He was fast.

510
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,090
Haha's record is...

511
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,930
- It's 24 seconds, right?
- I think he was slow.

512
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,960
It's 25 seconds...

513
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,030
It's 25 seconds...

514
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,700
It's 25.60 seconds.

515
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,030
It was so close, but he failed.

516
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,900
- It's amazing that it was so close.
- So close.

517
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,400
- It was really close.
- We were almost there.

518
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,310
- Hey, you were...
- So close.

519
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,640
- That was amazing.
- Unbelievable.

520
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,380
- It was so close.
- I know.

521
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,540
We could've succeeded.

522
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,810
We should've counted when he ran.

523
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,780
What a shame.

524
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,480
- It was so close.
-The first mission...

525
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,750
- What a shame.
- failed.

526
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,050
We have the second mission.

527
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,290
The second mission is...

528
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,990
the Tail Running.

529
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,060
- What is it?
- Tail Running.

530
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,160
You wear a long tail
around your waist.

531
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,690
- Each person runs for 20 seconds.
- That's easy.

532
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,500
The goal is to keep...

533
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,170
your tail above the ground
for 20 seconds while running.

534
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,930
(That means
they should run around like a dog.)

535
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,040
- But...
- Hey.

536
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,470
- Young Sixty.
- What do you think you're doing?

537
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,540
This is upsetting.

538
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,880
I can't rest.

539
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,010
He ran 80m at full speed,
and it took over 20 seconds.

540
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,310
- This is Running Man.
- We will measure...

541
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,880
- We can't rest.
- how long the tail...

542
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,080
- remains on the ground.
- I see.

543
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,790
The eight members will take turns.

544
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,890
- That's better.
- The goal is to keep...

545
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,990
the combined time under 50 seconds.

546
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,760
- I see.
- That's not so bad.

547
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,390
What's the tail?

548
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,330
- The tail is too long.
- This is...

549
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,500
- It will drop well.
- Is it that long?

550
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,060
- This is...
- How are we supposed to run?

551
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,730
My gosh. This is too long.

552
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,870
This is too long.

553
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,970
- But...
- It's really long.

554
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,970
It's not a tail.

555
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,710
- I know.
- It's rolled up. Unbelievable.

556
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,140
You shouldn't step outside the line.

557
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,440
You should make a big turn.

558
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,510
Okay.

559
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,640
I'll go first.

560
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,550
- Haha.
- Put it on as late as possible.

561
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,880
Go, Young Forty!

562
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,050
- He is...
- The wind...

563
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,650
- Make good use of the wind.
- It will be better this way.

564
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,020
- Okay.
- Let's go.

565
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,220
- Young Forty!
- Young Forty!

566
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,220
(He starts running for 20 seconds.)

567
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,490
He's running well.

568
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,660
(The tail is floating.)

569
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,360
(Time of touching the ground)

570
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,390
He's running well.

571
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,560
Young Forty!

572
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,700
- There you go.
- You're running well.

573
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,730
(It touches the ground!)

574
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,800
Young Forty!

575
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
- There you go.
- You're running well.

576
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
- No! Run faster.
- Okay.

577
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,270
- Nice.
- Young Forty!

578
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,470
Young Forty!

579
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,940
- A little more!
- He's really good.

580
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,540
- Careful when you make a turn.
- Make good use of the wind.

581
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,780
He's really good.

582
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,910
Make good use of the wind.

583
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,250
Young Forty's
protruding belly is funny.

584
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,510
Haha's record...

585
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,280
- is four seconds.
- Really?

586
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,520
- We can make it.
- Really?

587
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,590
Go, Young Forty!

588
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,050
Get up, Young Forty!

589
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,790
Do whatever you want!

590
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,630
Supreme has been popular
since we were young.

591
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,530
Stussy?

592
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
It became popular because we wore it
when we were young!

593
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,930
(His incomprehensible appeal)

594
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,270
Listen. I think...

595
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,370
you should slowly run...

596
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,540
- back and forth here.
- That's better.

597
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,770
In the direction of the wind.

598
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,110
- I see.
- You can run this way.

599
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,610
- Go back and forth?
- In the direction of the wind.

600
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,180
- Okay.
- Go back and forth.

601
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,780
Okay. Let's do that.

602
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,010
(Jae Seok starts running
against the wind!)

603
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,280
- Oh, no.
- It's floating.

604
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,820
- Get it.
- It's high up.

605
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,950
- It's floating.
- It's floating.

606
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,950
You should run faster.

607
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,020
(As he makes a turn,
the tail touches the ground again.)

608
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,050
You should run faster.

609
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,060
Oh, no.

610
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,420
- It's this way.
- Turn around right away.

611
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,860
- From here.
- This isn't bad.

612
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,530
The wind is good here.

613
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,690
Go right away.

614
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,930
Turn around.

615
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,400
Right. The wind is good there.

616
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,070
- Go that way.
- No, it touches the ground.

617
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,600
- Oh, no.
- It's not windy at all.

618
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
Your record is six seconds.

619
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,770
- This is...
- Six seconds.

620
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,840
- It's good.
- It falls when you come back.

621
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,480
Next up is Young Sixty. Let's go.

622
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,540
Here I go.

623
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,580
- Ready.
- Yes.

624
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,750
Hey.

625
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,950
- Cheer for me.
- Okay.

626
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,350
- Go!
- Go!

627
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,290
He tells us to cheer for him.

628
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,960
- It's not touching.
- It didn't touch the ground.

629
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,390
- You're doing well.
- It didn't touch the ground.

630
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,130
- There you go.
- Run.

631
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,660
- You're doing well.
- It didn't touch the ground.

632
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,460
(Shouting)

633
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,830
(He takes off his hat
with a scream.)

634
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,000
It's not touching.

635
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,100
He's trying really hard.

636
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,570
He's about to fall.

637
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,810
He might fall.

638
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,140
(He was running an 80m marathon...)

639
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,510
(in the mud earlier.)

640
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,480
(Now he's doing
a ridiculous sprint with a tail.)

641
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,380
- Go!
- Jee Seok Sam!

642
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,850
Jee Seok Sam!

643
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,420
Jee Seok Sam!

644
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,720
- It's touching the ground.
- It's touching the ground now.

645
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,760
(Hyun Woo, don't watch the show
and study hard.)

646
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,330
The belt lowers.

647
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,600
No way. He's really trying his best.

648
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,330
(Dad's Challenge, the end)

649
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,430
The belt lowers.

650
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,070
Jae Seok, we have to hold the belt.

651
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,170
- Sounds good.
- Seok Jin,

652
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,310
you dragged the tail for 11 seconds.

653
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,540
I did quite well
despite the belt going down.

654
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,110
- We can do this.
- We should drag it up.

655
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,910
- Get ready.
- He's not good at sports.

656
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,080
That flimsy Daniel.

657
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,380
- That flimsy Daniel.
- He won't be able to do this.

658
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,320
- Being tall helps.
- He's doing great.

659
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,590
- That flimsy Daniel.
- He won't be able to do this.

660
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,390
- Being tall helps.
- He's doing great.

661
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,520
Keep running. Make a turn.

662
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,620
Make a turn!

663
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,230
- It's not dragging.
- It's thanks to his height.

664
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,030
- It's not touching.
- It's not touching.

665
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,330
- It's not touching at all.
- It's not dragging.

666
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,360
- Is it not touching?
- It's not.

667
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,100
- It's not dragging.
- It's still not dragging.

668
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,740
(Running with big strides,
beaming with joy)

669
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,040
It didn't touch at all.

670
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,440
(Daniel's long legs came in handy
once in a while.)

671
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,610
- Zero seconds.
- It's not touching at all.

672
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,040
- I think it's zero seconds.
- Nice, zero seconds.

673
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,580
- Zero seconds?
- It only dragged for a second.

674
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,550
(Total seconds: 22 out of 50)

675
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,920
Being tall helped.

676
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,120
Daniel, that was awesome!

677
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,450
I didn't know I'd be good at this.

678
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,990
- You were like...
- It didn't touch...

679
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,660
- because you were so tall.
- the neighborhood fool.

680
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,090
- How am I doing?
- Run faster.

681
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,760
- Faster?
- That's it. Run!

682
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,830
- Jong Kook's up.
- All right.

683
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,260
(Total seconds: 45 out of 50)

684
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,630
You're the last one to run.

685
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,470
How many seconds do we have left?

686
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,830
The total accrued time
is 45 seconds,

687
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,970
so you need less
than five seconds...

688
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,070
- to succeed.
- Okay.

689
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,710
- That's more than enough.
- Okay.

690
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,740
- Can I go?
- Get ready.

691
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,870
Take your time.

692
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,910
It'll be a disaster if he trips.

693
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,810
If he falls, it'll be a disaster.

694
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,010
Get ready.

695
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,150
(Taking off)

696
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,190
(Mr. Out-toed Gait is off
to a good start.)

697
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,190
- Looking good. It's not touching.
- We've got this.

698
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,320
- Looking good. It's not touching.
- What's with that face?

699
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,860
- It's not touching.
- What's with that face?

700
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,930
- Why is he making that face?
- We'll win for sure.

701
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,730
- Is he sucking the air in?
- Seriously?

702
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,430
Put on a smile!

703
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,230
- He's changed a lot.
- Faster, Jong Kook.

704
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,500
He never ran like that
on "Let's Go! Dream Team."

705
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,800
- He...
- He's working harder...

706
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,070
- now that he's married.
- How is that not a comedy?

707
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,310
He's working harder
now that he's married.

708
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,040
(The tail did touch
the ground a bit.)

709
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,550
- Why was he running like that?
- All right.

710
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,810
(Did it drag less than 5 seconds?)

711
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,420
Kim Jong Kook...

712
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,680
- Two seconds.
- Three?

713
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,350
- Three seconds.
- Three seconds.

714
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,760
- Half a second.
- It touched for only three seconds.

715
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,730
- Okay!
- Good job.

716
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,330
You succeeded in the mission...

717
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,660
- and won one chance card.
- Jong Kook,

718
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,160
why were you running
with your mouth open?

719
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,830
- What a relief.
- That was hilarious.

720
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,300
Young Forty, we're still kicking.

721
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,900
Young Forty.

722
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,540
We're still kicking.

723
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,340
- Earlier...
- See him roll his hips.

724
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,310
Did you see him run
with his belly sticking out?

725
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,310
- I love it.
- Young Forty.

726
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,550
Today's race is
Photographers Who Capture Time.

727
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,720
You must take photos
to enter the photo biennale.

728
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,690
The photos will be taken
at three locations.

729
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,530
However, there's a set time frame
for every location,

730
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,100
so you can only take photos...

731
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,760
- Really?
- when you arrive exactly on time.

732
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,800
Here's the catch.

733
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,140
Starting now,

734
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,070
- you will hand over your phones.
- What?

735
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,580
We will also cover
any visible clocks,

736
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,340
including the one in the van.

737
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,380
- How can we tell, then?
- You must guess the time.

738
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,810
- Hold on. Seok Jin...
- We'll use a sundial.

739
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,980
- needs to check the stock market.
- Exactly.

740
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,480
- Seok Jin...
- It's an important day for me.

741
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,690
It's an important day for Seok Jin.

742
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,590
It's do or die for him today.

743
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,490
- It's do or die for him today.
- Not really.

744
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,760
- It's D-Day.
- It could be a disaster for him.

745
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,830
A penalty will await you
at any location...

746
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,130
where you miss the time.

747
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,000
You will only be able to move on
after receiving the penalty.

748
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,270
You'll each enter one of the photos
you took today,

749
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,840
and through a vote by the citizens,

750
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
- the winner will receive a prize.
- Really?

751
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,410
With the chance card
you won earlier,

752
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,210
you may either extend
the error range...

753
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,480
by plus or minus three minutes,

754
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,520
or check the time whenever you want.

755
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,580
- Whenever we want?
- Yes.

756
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,720
- That'll be a last resort.
- So that's the bonus we get.

757
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,360
Can't we check the time
even without our phones?

758
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,460
- With the sun.
- The sun isn't out today.

759
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,790
- You can't see the sun today.
- There's no sun.

760
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,790
- It's not out.
- On a deserted island...

761
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,460
- Use a sundial.
- If only the sun was out today.

762
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,660
- I'm good at reading a sundial.
- Exactly.

763
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,030
(What's the time?)

764
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,430
(The sun's direction
and the shade's angle)

765
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,700
(Calculating all of that...)

766
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,410
Hold on. That's west.

767
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,970
(Calculation completed,
It must be around 1 p.m.!)

768
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,480
(Isn't it around 1 p.m.?)

769
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,180
(Jae Seok is
an unlicensed sundial reader.)

770
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,410
(A charmer)

771
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,880
(Of all days,
the sun chose to hide.)

772
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,950
I can tell what time it is.

773
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,490
- How?
- What's the current time?

774
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,620
- Isn't it about 10:30 a.m.?
- You should tell us that much.

775
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,890
Shouldn't we know
what the current time is?

776
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,290
- What did you say?
- Isn't it 10:32 a.m.?

777
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,030
- So, 10:32 a.m.?
- No, it's 10:47 a.m.

778
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,400
- Yes, 10:47 a.m.
- It's 10:51 a.m.

779
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,530
- It's 10:47 a.m.
- It's 10:47 a.m.

780
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,070
- It's 10:47 a.m.
- He checked his watch.

781
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,640
- I checked my watch.
- Did you?

782
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,070
- He was surprised.
- Was I taking it too seriously?

783
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,510
Aren't you allowed to peek...

784
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,040
- at other people's watches?
- No.

785
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,610
- Someone walking down the street.
- Why not?

786
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,610
Can't we check their phones?

787
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,510
- Maybe someone with a phone...
- Can't we ask what time it is?

788
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,410
- "Hello, there!"
- You can't ask for the time.

789
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,520
- We can't?
- No.

790
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,790
- I'm hungry.
- Won't we be hungry at noon?

791
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,690
Are you saying we should trust
our internal clocks?

792
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,920
- Internal clocks, seriously?
- Unbelievable.

793
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,760
Now, please hand in your phones.

794
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,160
Don't forget to hand in
your watches as well.

795
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,300
- Come on.
- My stylist has my phone.

796
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,830
- I have yours.
- Hey.

797
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,870
- Mine... It's the new 17.
- Your watch, please.

798
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,170
- Here.
- I'll keep the chance card.

799
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,410
- Young Forty's phone.
- Remember the time.

800
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,240
Wasn't that my phone?

801
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,650
Oh, it was my wallet.
Sorry about that.

802
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,710
I can't believe
you tried to fool her like that.

803
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,150
I need to check
the stock market today.

804
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,680
(Small Investor Jee can relate.)

805
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,750
- The current time is...
- It's a big day today.

806
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,490
- Tell me about it.
- It's 10:50 a.m.

807
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,620
Jong Kook,
there's a way we can tell.

808
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,160
Office workers leave the building
to grab lunch.

809
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,590
Lunch breaks usually start at noon.

810
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,630
- When they all leave the office.
- Exactly.

811
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,500
The first location
you'll take photos at...

812
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,400
is Namsangol Hanok Village.

813
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,740
- We're giving you...
- Namsangol Hanok Village.

814
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,070
the first location.

815
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,370
We'll drive you in a van...

816
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,810
- and let you off at the entrance.
- Sure.

817
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,250
You must arrive at exactly 11:45 a.m.

818
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,310
- At 11:45 a.m.?
- Yes.

819
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,750
- That's in an hour.
- To succeed,

820
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,280
- you must enter the village...
- We have 50 minutes.

821
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,380
- at exactly 11:45 a.m.
- Right, 11:45 a.m.

822
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,350
Seok Jin's good
at counting the time,

823
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,750
- so start counting.
- He's right.

824
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,490
- Go on. You kept bragging.
- What?

825
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,230
- Don't participate in the games.
- It's 10:55 a.m.

826
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,630
- Start counting.
- Two, three...

827
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,160
(Current Time, 10:50:21 a.m.)

828
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,530
- Keep counting.
- We'll head out...

829
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,930
- after you change clothes,
- Sure.

830
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,400
so guess the time...

831
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,340
- while changing as well.
- Got it.

832
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,540
- Right now, it's 10:50 a.m.
- Is it 10:50 a.m.?

833
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,870
- It's like the military.
- We should change in here.

834
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,040
Shouldn't we do something
about the shoes?

835
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,480
- Should we go to the restroom?
- Yes, let's do that.

836
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,510
- Sure. Where is it?
- Let's go.

837
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,450
I'd know the time
if the sun were out.

838
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,950
Exactly, but it's hiding today.

839
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,120
The sun isn't out.

840
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,390
Let's look around us...

841
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,020
to see if there are any clocks.

842
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,490
- Okay!
- Let's get going.

843
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,630
- Let's see. Let's take a look.
- Let's go.

844
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,100
- Is it 11 a.m.?
- Hello.

845
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,800
I bet it's 11:18 a.m.

846
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,600
- No, it's 11:16 a.m.
- Is it 11:16 a.m.?

847
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,540
Let's say it's 11:17 a.m., then.

848
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,140
- I keep touching my pocket...
- It's 11:17 a.m.

849
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,840
to see if my phone is there.

850
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,410
- Really?
- Yes.

851
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,080
I'm having cellphone withdrawal
right now.

852
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,610
- As a group, you'll...
- We're heading out now.

853
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,780
- Is that allowed?
- Can you guess what time it is?

854
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,980
- It's 11:20 a.m.
- It's 11:22 a.m.

855
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,290
(They get in the van at 11:17 a.m.)

856
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,890
- It's 11:19 a.m.
- It's...

857
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,690
- It's 11:19:20 a.m.
- It's 11:19 a.m.

858
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,090
- It's 11:20 a.m.
- It's 11:19:20 a.m.

859
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,390
- I bet you're surprised.
- It's 11:20 a.m.

860
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,360
- Then...
- Aren't you going to tell us?

861
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,700
No, we're not going to answer you.

862
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,130
- They're surprised.
- You must enter the village...

863
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,100
- at exactly 11:45 a.m.
- Can you drive for now?

864
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,040
Don't we just have to make it
before 11:45 a.m.?

865
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,710
- At exactly 11:45 a.m.
- The deadline is 11:45 a.m., right?

866
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,580
It can take 30 minutes...

867
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,840
since it's about 11:20 a.m. now.

868
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,480
There's no way to tell the time.

869
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,980
It's frustrating
not to be able to see outside.

870
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,380
- This is crazy.
- Why did you cover the windows?

871
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,990
Just in case you'd see a clock.

872
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,950
- Come on.
- Seriously?

873
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,190
- What do you take us for?
- We wouldn't do that.

874
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,160
- Keep checking the time.
- No?

875
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,390
- Myung Jae.
- This is broken.

876
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,230
I have to take my medicine
at 11:40 a.m., so let me know.

877
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,630
(He takes his medicine
at a very specific time.)

878
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,400
Let me know.
I have to take my medicine.

879
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Myung Jae, Seok Jin
has a lot riding...

880
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,670
- on the stock market today.
- I need to check the market.

881
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,240
Don't tell him
if it's a sea of blue.

882
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,780
- Don't tell him.
- I have to abort if necessary.

883
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,380
(Of all days,
it's the big day today.)

884
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,320
- Are you a Samsung?
- Trash cans have to be installed.

885
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,980
- Who has a Samsung?
- Why did they remove trash cans?

886
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,020
- A Samsung phone.
- They were difficult to manage.

887
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,490
(Seok Sam's suddenly asking
for anyone with a Samsung phone.)

888
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,760
Hi, Bixby!

889
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,730
(Calling for a virtual assistant)

890
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,190
- Hi, Bixby!
- Siri!

891
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,530
- What's the time?
- Siri, what's the time?

892
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,730
Young Forty!

893
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,300
- Young Forty?
- Young Forty.

894
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,200
- He's a Young Forty.
- Here's my take on the iPhone.

895
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,110
I've been using their phones
since the original iPhone.

896
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,140
Me too.

897
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,170
- I've been using iPhones...
- It's not about having an iPhone.

898
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,280
- from the 1st one to the 17th.
- Having that model is the issue.

899
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,410
What about that model?

900
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,510
- It's the color.
- What about that color?

901
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,510
- The color is the issue.
- The color's the problem.

902
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,680
- How so? Says who?
- Who knows?

903
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,950
The younger generation.

904
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,620
Why should I listen to them?

905
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,860
- Exactly.
- This is my life I'm living.

906
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,660
It was the first phone
to be in orange,

907
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,090
so I bought it out of curiosity.

908
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,530
I bought it with my own money!

909
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
- Haha.
- Yes?

910
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,060
You should gather
the so-called Young Forties.

911
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,500
Young Forties,
gather at Yeouido Park.

912
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,070
Wear a Supreme sweatshirt.
You know the one.

913
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,040
- Wear a Supreme sweatshirt.
- Supreme.

914
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,340
- Bring the orange phone.
- Supreme.

915
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,610
He's been gathering
a lot of people lately.

916
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,510
Meet me at Yeouido Park.

917
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,750
That's hilarious.

918
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,450
Young Forty, shut that mouth.

919
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,020
Young Forty closed his mouth...

920
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,520
at exactly 11:32 a.m. I'm sure of it.

921
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,160
- Go, Young Sixty.
- Said by a Young Sixty.

922
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,930
A Young Fifty spoke at 11:32:22 a.m.

923
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,160
- Forever!
- He's on point.

924
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,800
- We should get him to count.
- It's 11:32 a.m.

925
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,930
- Aren't I right? I know I am.
- I'm sure.

926
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,000
Young Sixty, shut it.

927
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
(The human timer isn't good
at counting minutes.)

928
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,870
- Junior Jee.
- Compared to then...

929
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,070
- What is it?
- Massage my hand.

930
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,810
- What? Why should I?
- Well...

931
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,370
- You're his junior.
- You're my junior.

932
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,610
- You're his junior.
- Because you're my junior.

933
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,510
- That's not a thing.
- He's your senior.

934
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,450
I debuted three years earlier
than him.

935
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,150
As he talks about his seniority,

936
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,250
it's 11:37:22 a.m. right now.

937
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,590
(It's probably 11:37:22 a.m.?)

938
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,250
Were you startled? I bet you were.

939
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,590
- It's 11:40 a.m.
- If only the sun were out...

940
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,590
- I'd be accurate.
- It's cloudy.

941
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,830
It's 11:38 a.m.

942
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,590
- No, it's 11:30 a.m...
- It's 11:30 a.m...

943
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,800
It's so frustrating
not to know the time.

944
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,800
- Spin that. The Sony thing.
- Does that turn?

945
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,530
- Oh, yes. That thing.
- This?

946
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,070
- No, Seok Jin.
- He means that.

947
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,240
Myung Jae.
I really need to take my medicine.

948
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
- Tell me when it's past 45.
- Is it 11:40 a.m. now?

949
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,680
- Myung Jae. Is it 11:40 a.m.?
- He'll pass out.

950
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,580
- The time...
- They're not ready for lunch.

951
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,780
It's not yet past 45.

952
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,680
The current time is forty...

953
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,180
I think we have
about ten minutes left.

954
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,150
- No, wait, you think so?
- Yes.

955
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,020
- I don't think so.
- I think we have...

956
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,920
(Jae Seok accurately guessed
the current time.)

957
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,260
- I don't think so.
- From there to here,

958
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,730
- it took 15 minutes.
- It's about 11:40 a.m. now.

959
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,130
- I think it's 11:40 a.m.
- We rode for about ten minutes.

960
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,800
It's just 11:30 a.m.
if we drove 15 minutes.

961
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,530
About ten minutes.
Ten minutes to go.

962
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,500
This is pretty hard.

963
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,610
We have five minutes left.

964
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,210
We're here.

965
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,340
- Three plus one...
- It's Namsangol Hanok Village.

966
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,410
We're here.

967
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,410
(They reached the parking lot.)

968
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,250
I think we're almost on time.

969
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,020
- Four, five minutes to go?
- We have about eight minutes.

970
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,250
- Four, five minutes to go.
- It's 11:40 a.m. right now.

971
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,620
- It's 40 past right now?
- Yes.

972
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,990
We have some time left.

973
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:50,160
Not a lot, but I think we have
about seven minutes left.

974
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,830
No, we have less than five minutes.

975
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,200
We have seven minutes to go, mister.

976
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,630
Less than five, I say.

977
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,230
- Yes, less than five.
- Less than five.

978
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,770
No. We have seven minutes left.

979
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,570
- Shall we get out?
- Let's use the chance.

980
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,210
- We must get out.
- Once we're outside...

981
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,410
- Do we get out?
- Yes. Let's all get out.

982
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm dead curious.

983
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,480
Let's get... What's this?

984
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,310
Hang on. This is...

985
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,680
Move, mister.

986
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,720
I see.

987
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,020
We have about four minutes twenty...

988
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,020
Four minutes 60 seconds...
We have 4 minutes 32 seconds left.

989
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,930
We have less than five minutes.
A camera...

990
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,060
Let's get moving first.
We need to go.

991
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,730
- Yes. In front of...
- We must set up.

992
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,060
Is this the hanok village?

993
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,430
I could guess
if the sun were shining.

994
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,070
I think we're cutting it close.

995
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,100
The current time is 11:41 a.m.

996
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,200
- It's 41 minutes?
- No.

997
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,240
- No?
- It's passed that.

998
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,810
It's about 43...

999
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,070
- Really?
- It's 43 minutes past.

1000
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,410
- You reached the first location.
- Yes.

1001
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,310
If you open the main gate
that's behind you, you'll see...

1002
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,450
- a white line on the ground.
- Okay.

1003
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,190
We'll stop the timer the moment...

1004
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,690
you all cross that line.

1005
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,690
If that time is exactly 11:45 a.m.,
you succeed.

1006
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,430
- All of us?
- Yes.

1007
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,930
You must cross it together.

1008
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,630
Talk among yourselves
when to open the gate.

1009
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,070
How about we go for 11:42 a.m.?

1010
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,100
- Seok Jin.
- Not 43?

1011
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,510
I also think it's past 11:40 a.m.

1012
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,940
- It's past 40. We're on 42, 43.
- Yes.

1013
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,180
Not yet.
Time doesn't go that quickly.

1014
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,180
I think it's about 11:39 a.m. now.

1015
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,320
- It's not yet 40 minutes past?
- No.

1016
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,450
It's impossible to get it
without using a chance.

1017
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,450
It's not impossible.

1018
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,220
I think we should use a chance.

1019
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,720
- Using it now...
- We must use a chance now,

1020
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,330
- then count down to the deadline.
- Yes.

1021
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,700
- Isn't that better?
- Check the time and count out loud.

1022
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,730
- Count out loud.
- Yes. You can get it about right.

1023
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,230
I'm oddly accurate.

1024
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,270
Usually, in my case,

1025
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,500
when I'm at home
because I don't have work,

1026
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,710
- I go to the gym around this time.
- Do you?

1027
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,940
I go to the gym.

1028
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,210
I reach the gym at around noon,

1029
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,210
- on average.
- Okay.

1030
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,410
- Eleven...
- Listen.

1031
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,910
- Look over there.
- It's about 11:42 a.m.

1032
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,150
People start to flock.

1033
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,520
The office workers...

1034
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,020
- are off to lunch.
- They're exiting the buildings.

1035
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,620
- They just left.
- The early starters...

1036
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,060
- get moving at around 11:30 a.m.
- Yes, at 11:30 a.m.

1037
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,330
You see quite a few people now.

1038
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,530
- Then...
- We're nearing our deadline.

1039
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,230
- Shouldn't we ask?
- Right now...

1040
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,830
- It's about 43 minutes past.
- Who here...

1041
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,170
- wants to use the chance?
- Me.

1042
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,130
- Me.
- Who thinks we need it?

1043
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,340
- We must use it.
- We must use it.

1044
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,640
- We don't need to.
- No?

1045
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,070
- We can't use it now.
- No?

1046
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,910
Right now... Listen, everyone.

1047
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,710
- You think...
- We'll miss the deadline.

1048
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,980
Look at the streets and sights.

1049
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,180
We must still try.

1050
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,680
Look at the streets.

1051
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,220
Sorry, but even if we look,
how can we tell...

1052
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,350
- There's nothing.
- We can't guess when it's 11:45 a.m.

1053
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,520
- How can we do that?
- Don't mention your marriage.

1054
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,720
- When did I mention it?
- Don't mention your marriage.

1055
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,690
- My wedding...
- It's 11:44 a.m. now!

1056
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,890
Let's go in.

1057
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,460
One, two, three...

1058
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,760
- I feel hungry at this time.
- It's 43 minutes.

1059
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,730
At around 43 minutes.
We must go in now.

1060
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,730
- No.
- I think...

1061
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,700
Isn't that truck scheduled
to deliver something at 11:45 a.m.?

1062
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,310
(Se Chan's guess:
The truck is coming in at 11:45 a.m.)

1063
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,610
- That truck...
- Hang on.

1064
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,880
- Wait.
- Fourteen. I'm still counting.

1065
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,910
Fifteen.

1066
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,780
We need to go inside now.

1067
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,410
- We must guess...
- What time did we set off?

1068
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,680
We left at 11:15 a.m.

1069
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,980
- It was 11:15 a.m.?
- Yes.

1070
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,190
- Over there.
- Then...

1071
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,220
It usually takes 15 to 20 minutes...

1072
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,790
- from there to here by bus.
- It does.

1073
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,590
- Then it's... 11:40 a.m.?
- 11:40 a.m.

1074
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,430
- Thirty-six, thirty-seven...
- We stood here talking for five.

1075
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,100
- Then...
- We must go inside!

1076
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,370
- We must go!
- We must go.

1077
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,600
- Forty,
- Go inside.

1078
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,930
- forty-one,
- This is...

1079
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,240
- forty-two,
- We must go.

1080
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,140
- forty-three, forty-four.
- We must go. One,

1081
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,310
- two!
- One, two!

1082
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,410
(They have just 1 minute left!)

1083
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,280
- Three!
- Open!

1084
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,180
- Hang on.
- Forty-seven.

1085
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,250
We haven't crossed it yet.

1086
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,980
(Yet to cross the line)

1087
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,320
(They just have to wait 50 seconds!)

1088
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,720
Not yet. We must all cross it.

1089
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,990
- Forty-nine.
- Wait.

1090
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,620
- We must go now!
- No.

1091
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,420
- Wait. Two,
- We must all cross together.

1092
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,590
- three,
- We must go.

1093
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,620
- four,
- Go, now!

1094
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,690
- Wait.
- five,

1095
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,260
- Wait.
- They all look anxious.

1096
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,430
He looks anxious.

1097
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,430
- They look tense.
- Okay.

1098
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:51,130
(Can they cross the line
at exactly 11:45 a.m.?)

1099
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,140
- Nine, ten.
- Let's go!

1100
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,710
- Now!
- Let's go!

1101
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,610
(They crossed the line.)

1102
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,310
- Now!
- Let's go!

1103
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,810
- We did it.
- Now.

1104
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,810
- Now.
- Stop the timer.

1105
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,310
- Stop.
- Stop it.

1106
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,680
(If it's 11:45:31 a.m., they succeed!)

1107
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,620
- We're almost on time.
- They look surprised.

1108
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,320
- They're surprised.
- They're surprised.

1109
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,620
- Right now...
- No way.

1110
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,090
We stopped the timer
when you crossed...

1111
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,290
- the white line.
- Yes.

1112
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,530
Wasn't that amazing?

1113
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,590
If it's not noon...

1114
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,460
You can come
and check the time yourself.

1115
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,600
- Can we?
- Yes.

1116
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
(Check the time
they crossed the line)

1117
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,470
- It says over there.
- The current time's on the left,

1118
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,600
and the timer you stopped
is on the right.

1119
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,310
Does this even make sense?

1120
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,710
(Is it 11:45 a.m.?)

1121
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,580
- Oh, shoot.
- It was 11:44 a.m.?

1122
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,210
(44 minutes...)

1123
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,110
It was so close.

1124
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,580
- It was 31 seconds?
- 11:44 a.m.

1125
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,350
(They failed by just 29 seconds!)

1126
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,690
I said we should wait...

1127
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,690
- No way.
- We were almost on time.

1128
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,030
(They entered the gate
at 44 minutes.)

1129
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,230
(Wait)

1130
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,600
(Nine...)

1131
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,870
(Ten, now!)

1132
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,300
- Let's go.
- Now!

1133
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,040
(At Seok Sam's yell,
they crossed too early.)

1134
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,210
I said we should wait...

1135
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,310
Let's not complain.

1136
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,310
- You crossed the line at 11:44:31 a.m.,
- We were almost on time.

1137
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,780
- so you failed the mission.
- I said we should wait!

1138
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,720
We could've used a chance.

1139
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,250
That's why I mentioned the chance!

1140
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,690
I said we should wait!

1141
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,920
Jae Seok.
You're the one who gave the signal.

1142
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,530
- It was so close.
- Hey, still...

1143
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,800
You acted like a general.
"Let's go!" That was you.

1144
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,370
- Hey! We did pretty well.
- "Let's go!" That was you.

1145
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,570
I said we should wait.

1146
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,340
We did well. This is amazing too.

1147
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,300
- My gut feeling...
- This is impossible.

1148
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,410
- Wasn't I right in the car?
- You were.

1149
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,840
- I was, right?
- You were right.

1150
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,250
And the time you said
after you got here...

1151
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,710
- I counted. Was I almost right too?
- Yes.

1152
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,220
It's such a shame.

1153
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,880
It's such a pity.

1154
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,890
- We just had to wait 30 seconds.
- It is a shame.

1155
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,690
Haha, we're awesome. What we did...

1156
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,590
All you idols. Come at us.

1157
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,890
- Can you do this?
- Take us on!

1158
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,730
- What is he saying?
- Take them on for what?

1159
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,230
What got into him?

1160
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,930
You can't live without your phones.

1161
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,700
- Come at us.
- We can.

1162
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,870
- We used pagers.
- Name tag elimination, anyone?

1163
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,870
Why do you want the idols
to challenge you?

1164
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,970
- What for?
- We almost had it.

1165
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,970
(Young Forty and Young Sixty
are taunting others for no reason.)

1166
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,840
- We can beat them.
- Why the idols?

1167
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,310
We accept team challenges.

1168
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,950
- Just a little...
- Trust my hunch!

1169
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,480
Yes. I trusted you.

1170
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,520
- Right, Kook Jong?
- I trusted you.

1171
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,250
But how can someone tell
when it's 11:45 a.m.?

1172
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,020
- You were almost right.
- You were almost right.

1173
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,320
Why didn't we use the chance?

1174
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,160
Young Forty. Keep quiet.

1175
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,830
It's Fifty. Why didn't you speak up
when I said Young Forty?

1176
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,630
(Born in early 1986, aged 39.
Born in 1986, aged 38)

1177
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,500
Young Forties. Come here.

1178
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,730
- Haha.
- Why didn't you complain?

1179
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,230
You do whatever you want.

1180
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,070
- You keep the title.
- They're 40, not Young Forty.

1181
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,240
Young Forty's the term
for people like you...

1182
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,910
Who make a huge fuss
about trying to be in their forties.

1183
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:50,210
They dress up
and wear sunglasses like that.

1184
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,210
You're Young Forty. Not us.

1185
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,350
- This is Young Forty.
- He makes a fuss.

1186
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,520
My pant leg went down.

1187
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,620
See? Things like that.

1188
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,620
- See? Things like that.
- Take pity on him, guys.

1189
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,530
- Take pity on him.
- Why?

1190
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,530
You can't bear the weight.

1191
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,330
- I'll treat you better.
- Why am I pitiful?

1192
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,730
Why am I pitiful?

1193
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,900
Comfort him.

1194
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,500
- Be nice to him.
- You too.

1195
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
- Be nice to him.
- Be nice to him.

1196
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,240
- Be nice to the poor guy.
- Stay away.

1197
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,910
Don't you dare console me.

1198
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,340
He acts out.

1199
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,910
This village brings together
traditional Joseon houses...

1200
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,410
and the ridges of Mount Nam.

1201
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,310
- I didn't know this place existed.
- Oh, this place is nice.

1202
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,050
You cannot take photos here,

1203
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,290
and you'll all get the penalty.

1204
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,790
- What is the penalty?
- As for the penalty,

1205
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,660
- We're getting the penalty here?
- we'll move as we look around.

1206
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,090
- Is that so? Since it's fall...
- Then, we'll tell you about it.

1207
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,460
Gosh, we have to get the penalty.

1208
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,230
Hey, but it was such a close call.

1209
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,330
- I really have my own...
- Hey, the...

1210
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,940
routine right around...

1211
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,440
- A routine?
- this time.

1212
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,600
Then, it must be noon about now.

1213
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,470
It was about 50-something earlier,
right? No, that's not it.

1214
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,640
- It was 11:45 a.m.
- Earlier, it was 40...

1215
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,010
We have to check.

1216
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,410
So, here is the first penalty.

1217
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,380
You must cut up
each of your team uniforms...

1218
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,480
in order and collect the pieces...

1219
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,220
so that they weigh a total of 1kg.

1220
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,320
- What is that?
- What?

1221
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,850
A total of 1kg.

1222
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,020
- What is that?
- What?

1223
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,220
- Come on.
- One kilogram?

1224
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,720
- How will the team uniform...
- I mean...

1225
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,860
- Cut what up?
- Cut this?

1226
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,390
- Why would we cut this up?
- How will we get 1kg of this?

1227
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,060
- How can we get 1kg of this?
- I mean...

1228
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,470
Once the uniforms are cut up,
you can keep wearing them...

1229
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,100
- throughout the day.
- What did you say?

1230
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,940
We have to keep wearing them?

1231
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,640
- Look here.
- Please save us.

1232
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,580
- Hey, at least the important bits.
- You can't do this to us.

1233
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,780
- Hey, let us cover our nipples.
- You can't do this to us.

1234
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,980
- We have to cover our nipples.
- This is...

1235
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,150
We have undershirts on,

1236
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,950
- so we can cut up to about here.
- Then, that's fine.

1237
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,820
You can cut off everything
except for this bit.

1238
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,120
- Yes, you can do that.
- Cut it all off except the collar.

1239
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,120
- That wouldn't look decent.
- Just leave this part.

1240
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,360
(Already looking forward to seeing
their masterpieces)

1241
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,630
So, decide on an order,

1242
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,800
and each person will add
their pieces to get 1kg total.

1243
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,870
If the first few people cut off
a small piece,

1244
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,930
- the next people can cut off a lot.
- Right, they have to cut off a lot.

1245
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,970
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?
- Hey, this...

1246
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,440
How many grams is this?

1247
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,600
- Each shirt is...
- Probably about 500g?

1248
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,670
- We measured it,
- About 500...

1249
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,270
- and it was about 300g.
- Does it only weigh 300g?

1250
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,140
Se Chan,
you should just take it all off.

1251
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,140
- No, you should...
- Why cut it up? Just take it off.

1252
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,310
Aren't you wearing an undershirt?

1253
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,510
- I'm naked underneath.
- Oh, dear.

1254
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,850
- I just need to...
- Why didn't you wear anything?

1255
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,680
Gosh, this is hard.

1256
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,950
We should play
rock-paper-scissors for this.

1257
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,020
- Right.
- Okay, rock-paper-scissors.

1258
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,050
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

1259
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,120
- Okay, let's play.
- Rock-paper...

1260
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,390
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1261
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,690
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin lose.)

1262
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,930
(The two older guys
will have to go later.)

1263
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,100
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1264
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,200
(Se Chan wins 1st place
in this group.)

1265
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,400
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1266
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,530
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1267
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,770
(Jonathan loses.)

1268
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,140
- Okay, you're in last place.
- Rock...

1269
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,210
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1270
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,440
- Okay!
- Rock-paper...

1271
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
(Jong Kook wins 1st place
in this group.)

1272
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,110
First place, come on up.

1273
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,510
- Who was in first place?
- I was.

1274
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,910
- Okay, we're deciding this now.
- I was in second place.

1275
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,310
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1276
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,820
- I won first place!
- Okay.

1277
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,320
(Se Chan comes in 1st place.)

1278
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,790
- He'll get to keep his shirt.
- Please cut off a lot.

1279
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,390
- Come on. Just cut some off.
- What?

1280
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,760
- I mean...
- Se Chan.

1281
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,460
- You won. Don't cut off a lot.
- You're in first place, but...

1282
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,590
- That way, it's more fun.
- I know.

1283
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,790
- Go ahead and cut it off.
- Right.

1284
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,060
- Come here. I'll cut it for you.
- But even if you do,

1285
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,330
- Oh, you will? Jae Seok.
- it won't be enough.

1286
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,700
To get 1kg,
we have to cut off a lot.

1287
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,800
In that case,
it wouldn't make sense...

1288
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,270
for you to cut off too much.

1289
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,270
What will you do?

1290
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,400
Should I cut it here?

1291
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,170
- But he'll have to show his belly.
- It's fine.

1292
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,300
- It's fine.
- No, it'd be a bit embarrassing.

1293
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,570
You have to keep wearing it
like that.

1294
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,640
- He was in first place.
- Hey.

1295
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,710
First of all,
just cover the important parts.

1296
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,340
- Right.
- I'm fine, but for the viewers.

1297
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,310
- Then, I'll cut it about here.
- Okay.

1298
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,050
But mister, I was in first place.

1299
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,280
Mister, I wasn't in last place.

1300
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,580
How far up are you going to go?

1301
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,750
Then, what? Should I make this
a short-sleeve shirt?

1302
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,850
- Let's do that.
- Yes, cut off his sleeves.

1303
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,520
- Let's go with short sleeves.
- Let's go with short sleeves first.

1304
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,590
- I should give something up...
- Give him short sleeves.

1305
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,660
- even if I'm in first place.
- That's right.

1306
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,760
Well, that's because...

1307
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,490
- If not, we won't have enough.
- we can't make this work.

1308
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,760
- It won't be enough without him.
- Hey, hold this for me.

1309
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,390
- Gosh, you're cutting a lot.
- Oh, this is...

1310
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,300
- Mister, is this...
- That's a lot.

1311
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,500
- It'll be enough for short sleeves.
- Short sleeves...

1312
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,700
This will show my armpits.

1313
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,730
- No, it won't.
- Let's see it. Lift your arms.

1314
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,830
All right.

1315
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,470
- You have short sleeves.
- That's all right.

1316
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,840
- Hey.
- It looks nice.

1317
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,510
- It's about that much.
- You had to give up your sleeves.

1318
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,040
Yes, that much is... Hey, this is...

1319
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,480
- That much is...
- Hey, that's good.

1320
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,410
- Hey, you still gave up a lot...
- This isn't...

1321
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,550
- even as the winner.
- too bad.

1322
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,150
- First of all...
- This is only about 50g.

1323
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,550
Let's give him a crop top.

1324
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,120
I'll just cut off this much.

1325
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,050
- But this doesn't weigh much.
- Each person...

1326
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,450
has to give up over 100g.

1327
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,790
- Go higher.
- But if we give him a crop top...

1328
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,390
- when he's in 1st place...
- He's in 1st place, but...

1329
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,930
- It'd mean to do that to him.
- Just do it.

1330
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,930
But he was in first place.

1331
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,530
He's still in first place.

1332
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,600
- Where are you cutting?
- Jae Seok.

1333
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,430
- Where are you cutting?
- Jae Seok.

1334
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,570
- Oh, but...
- He's in first place.

1335
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,970
- This is...
- Wait.

1336
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,000
(Working swiftly)

1337
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,170
- No, but...
- Can't I do this?

1338
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,210
(A totally different design
from what they agreed on before)

1339
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,270
- I mean, mister.
- Well...

1340
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,510
- From the moment you poked it in,
- Well, the length...

1341
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,540
- it was way too high up.
- No,

1342
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,880
I just measured it wrong.

1343
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,180
Oh, the length...

1344
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,580
(He started cutting pretty boldly
to call it a mistake.)

1345
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,280
Apologize before you move on.

1346
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,120
Let's just leave it
after I apologize.

1347
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,420
(Peekaboo)

1348
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,720
- I think you cut too much.
- Apologize.

1349
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,820
Hey, but just a little bit here...

1350
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,160
Jae Seok, that's trendy these days.

1351
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,390
- Just cut it all the way around.
- Hang on. Let's go around.

1352
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,930
- What...
- I can't...

1353
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,730
I just can't stand that sight.
What do I do?

1354
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,370
- I'll pull my pants up, Seok Jin.
- Yes, pull them up.

1355
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,500
Or I could pull my underpants up.

1356
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,070
- Make it unbalanced.
- I did make it unbalanced.

1357
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,370
Unbalanced?

1358
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,810
Hey, do you still want to
look stylish in that state?

1359
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,110
(He easily pulls off
the client's request.)

1360
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,840
(The masterpiece is complete.)

1361
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,310
- Hey, that's looks good.
- That's not bad.

1362
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,640
- It looks stylish.
- Nice.

1363
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,010
- Oh, my.
- Hey, let's see it.

1364
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,680
- Hey, that's kind of pretty.
- Se Chan.

1365
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,680
- Se Chan.
- That's nice.

1366
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,750
- It looks good.
- By the way...

1367
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,950
(The designer is very pleased too!)

1368
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,350
Hey, that's nice.

1369
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,420
- It looks so fashionable.
- No, really.

1370
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,590
- Se Chan.
- Do I look like a celebrity?

1371
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,660
- You totally do.
- You look like a celebrity.

1372
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,730
- Do I look okay?
- Hey, you know,

1373
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,890
you look like you came from Milan.

1374
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,060
You're quite talented.

1375
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,230
It's really not that bad.

1376
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,230
You're good.

1377
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,830
The current weight is 158g.

1378
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,930
My belly feels nice and cool.

1379
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,070
Next, who was in second place?

1380
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,100
- Me.
- Kook Jong.

1381
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,770
- You can cut off a lot from mine,
- Yes?

1382
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,370
but for the people to have some fun
later down the line,

1383
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,640
- shouldn't we go easy with me?
- Sure.

1384
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,770
- Just cut off a little.
- Cut the sleeves off.

1385
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,580
- Hey, you should go sleeveless.
- Yes, sleeveless.

1386
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,040
- You should go sleeveless.
- That's right.

1387
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,850
- Jong Kook needs to go sleeveless.
- Show his shoulders.

1388
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,250
I'll go sleeveless.

1389
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,680
You can make it look like
a soccer jersey.

1390
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,880
- You know?
- Sure, I can do that.

1391
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,720
Hey, you can go even deeper.

1392
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,050
Like this, all the way down.

1393
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,320
- All right.
- Yes.

1394
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,660
- Cut it longer.
- Because to get 1kg...

1395
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,290
- Please hold this.
- I'll hold it.

1396
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,660
- Oh, yes. You can do that.
- Because to get 1kg...

1397
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,490
- I'll hold it.
- That's right.

1398
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,030
But... Wait.

1399
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,600
Why are the people
who are behind me in order...

1400
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,100
Hang on a minute.

1401
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,700
Why are the people
who are behind me in order...

1402
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,970
Hang on a minute.

1403
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,540
Attention.

1404
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,570
(The older guys were trying to
get all 1kg from those before them.)

1405
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,270
Attention.

1406
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,940
- Look, Jong Kook.
- You should ask! Hang on.

1407
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,940
We can torment them too.

1408
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,040
- Mister.
- You should ask us nicely, mister!

1409
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,880
- We're in 1st and 2nd place.
- Yes.

1410
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,450
- Well...
- Yes, I know.

1411
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,620
- Please help us.
- You should ask us.

1412
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,020
- Thank you.
- All right.

1413
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,080
- Please help us.
- My goodness.

1414
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,620
- I mean, you're treating us...
- Cut this much.

1415
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,820
- He was in first place...
- Go in this deep.

1416
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,990
- Gosh, I can't go too deep.
- No.

1417
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,020
- He...
- I can't cut too much off.

1418
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,190
He usually wears stuff like this.

1419
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,230
It's fine
since he's wearing an undershirt.

1420
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,790
- Oh, nice.
- That much is...

1421
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,000
- Nice.
- See? That's good.

1422
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
- This is nice.
- That's good, isn't it?

1423
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,200
- This looks good.
- It's not bad.

1424
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,930
That looks cool.

1425
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,170
The total is 272g.

1426
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,500
You should stop now.

1427
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,900
- Let's stop.
- Yes, stop now.

1428
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,210
- I'm cold.
- Third place?

1429
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,770
Why did you...

1430
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:25,980
- give in so easily?
- Third place.

1431
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,180
I don't know. This man suddenly...

1432
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,640
- They should've asked you 1st.
- Were you 2nd place in that group?

1433
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,850
- Next, who was in third place?
- It's cold.

1434
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,380
- Third place?
- Third place.

1435
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,920
- All right. Third place.
- Why are you...

1436
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,820
always trying to do things
when it's my turn?

1437
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,320
What? Why? Come here.

1438
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,120
- Hey, 200 between the 2 of you...
- You have to do it.

1439
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,690
It's perfect if we can get 240g
between the 2 of you.

1440
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,820
As long as we each give up
this much...

1441
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,260
- Yes, that's right.
- Since there are four pairs,

1442
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,790
- we can get enough.
- We can't do that.

1443
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,560
- Why not?
- We should give up less in front,

1444
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,100
- and you should give up more later.
- I know.

1445
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,860
But then, you shouldn't have
given up your shirts.

1446
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,270
- Why did you cut off so much?
- My gosh.

1447
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,530
You should've refused.

1448
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,400
- Just do it for now.
- My goodness.

1449
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,840
- Cut off both my sleeves too.
- Okay.

1450
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,510
No, cut off both sleeves.

1451
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,040
But just a bit from your belly...
You have an undershirt.

1452
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,640
Right, you have an undershirt.

1453
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,780
- Watch your hands.
- Well, so...

1454
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,210
No, but what are you doing?

1455
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,450
- Watch your hands.
- The two of you...

1456
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,580
Hey, you two from Antenna.

1457
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,850
- What are you... Hang on.
- No, right here...

1458
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,850
Hold still.

1459
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,490
- I'm in third place.
- Just wait a second.

1460
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,490
- Hang on.
- Hold still.

1461
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,960
Hey, this undershirt is mine.

1462
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,660
- All right.
- Leave the collar alone.

1463
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,790
- I won't touch your undershirt.
- How are you...

1464
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,260
- going to cut it?
- We'll leave some. What's wrong?

1465
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,290
You're driving me crazy. Seriously.

1466
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,430
- Will you get rid of all of that?
- No.

1467
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,500
Don't worry.

1468
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,530
You have to leave
his name tag behind.

1469
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,630
Of course, I will.

1470
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,700
- It's fine. Leave the name tag. No.
- Yes, leave that.

1471
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,200
- You have to do that.
- The name tag will be fine.

1472
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,470
- Just hold still.
- Right.

1473
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,910
- What will he do?
- Okay.

1474
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,970
All right.

1475
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,380
- This is fun.
- Oh, no.

1476
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,680
- Oh, okay.
- No, but...

1477
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,950
What is that? It's just a rag!

1478
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,620
What is that? It's literally a rag!

1479
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,380
- Haha, it's fine.
- We got a lot from him.

1480
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,420
- What is this?
- You took so much.

1481
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,490
- You look like...
- Seriously.

1482
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,750
- You look like you were stranded...
- Come on!

1483
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,490
Were you stranded
on an island somewhere?

1484
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,760
- It's all right. For real.
- Were you stranded somewhere?

1485
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,460
- The order means nothing this way.
- Are you about to eat?

1486
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:50,930
- This looks like a bib.
- Next.

1487
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,660
Right. You have 523g now.

1488
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,230
- Okay.
- Who's next?

1489
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,400
- I'm next.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1490
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,670
- We have 520g.
- What, 500g?

1491
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,040
But if it's going to be like this,

1492
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,800
- those in last place won't...
- We pretty much got everything.

1493
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,540
- even have to cut anything off.
- No, but...

1494
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,910
He's not wearing an undershirt.

1495
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,140
- You're not wearing one?
- I'm not wearing an undershirt.

1496
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,740
- No, it's my bare skin.
- Let's cut off this part for him.

1497
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,240
- Let's cut this part off here.
- All right.

1498
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,950
- Let's just do that first.
- You should just get a crop top.

1499
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,450
- Let's cut it like this.
- Let's just give you a crop top.

1500
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,820
- Is this how it's supposed to be?
- What is this?

1501
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,050
- Is this supposed to be fun?
- That's cool.

1502
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,420
- It's cool.
- What is this?

1503
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,920
- Hey, can't you make that stick?
- Hey, that's...

1504
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,860
Who's next?

1505
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,220
First place is actually worse.

1506
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,290
Okay, nice.

1507
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,430
- I'm next.
- Okay.

1508
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,490
- Jae Seok. Okay, come here.
- I'm relieved.

1509
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,960
- Don't go overboard.
- Jae Seok, first...

1510
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,030
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

1511
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,200
- I'll turn him into Superman.
- Okay.

1512
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Do what you want to do.

1513
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,630
- No, but Haha.
- Hey, pull it so it's taught. Yes?

1514
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,100
- Be sensible with it.
- Okay.

1515
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,840
- Give it some thought, okay?
- Pull it.

1516
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,270
Be sensible with it.

1517
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,340
- That's what I'm doing.
- I mean...

1518
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,070
- It has to be fun.
- Come on.

1519
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,580
Come on.

1520
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,110
- Over here too.
- Watch out.

1521
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,710
- Hey, don't cut the mic too.
- You have to let me wear a mic.

1522
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,280
- Of course, he needs his mic.
- You can still wear it.

1523
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,780
- Keep the mic.
- I'm scared.

1524
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,120
- Hey, the mic...
- You're going to show everything.

1525
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,490
What are you doing?

1526
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:51,050
It's so...

1527
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,690
- Superman!
- Hey!

1528
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,090
Pull it.

1529
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,360
- Okay, let's go with a short cape.
- Oh, no!

1530
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,900
- There. Go ahead.
- You look cool.

1531
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,230
Okay. Turn around.

1532
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,830
Superman!

1533
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,500
(A shabby transformation)

1534
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,970
Go ahead and do this pose.

1535
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,640
Gosh, seriously. I'm so mad.

1536
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,140
That's good.

1537
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,010
- Seriously. I'm so mad.
- That's all set.

1538
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:17,050
- That's 884g.
- I mean, what...

1539
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,550
- We just need 120g more.
- Who's next?

1540
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,620
Go easy on her.

1541
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,850
Ji Hyo should get
three-quarter-length sleeves.

1542
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,180
That's good. That's enough.

1543
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,320
- That's cool.
- It looks cool.

1544
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,850
- But the next...
- So, right now, you have 922g.

1545
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,090
We only have 80g left.

1546
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,160
- Let's finish it here.
- Right.

1547
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,030
- I don't think I'll have to go.
- That's cool.

1548
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,390
- Jonathan, are you wearing a shirt?
- Are you wearing an undershirt?

1549
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,690
- I'm not wearing an undershirt.
- You don't have one on?

1550
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,530
- Let's go.
- Hey, this is nice.

1551
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,800
- Should we give him a crop top?
- Let's do...

1552
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,030
- Or what about this?
- something like this.

1553
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,730
How about we cut it like this?

1554
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,770
Hang on. How about this?

1555
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:41,600
Do you remember
what Rain used to wear?

1556
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,410
- He should have...
- Just stringing his arms through.

1557
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,970
- Do that.
- Jong Kook, but...

1558
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,510
You can't do that
since I'm really hairy.

1559
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,110
Or we should give him
a sleeveless shirt.

1560
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,010
- Let's see. I'll take a look.
- I want it to be something new.

1561
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,450
Jong Kook. No, we can't.

1562
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,820
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

1563
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,020
- Then... Jong Kook.
- Rain?

1564
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,550
- Hey, I know what we can do.
- Look at him being shy.

1565
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,550
- Gosh, Se Chan.
- Just cut it.

1566
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,790
- Se Chan. No, really.
- Just do it.

1567
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,860
Oh, or you could do...

1568
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,930
- I'm an expert. Watch out.
- He's done this a lot.

1569
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,060
- Right now, Seok Sam is...
- Hey.

1570
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,790
Look at him being shy.

1571
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,100
- Gosh, Se Chan.
- Hey, that's nice.

1572
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,300
- Like this.
- That's kind of cool.

1573
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,670
- Let me see.
- Oh, that's nice.

1574
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,000
- But my chest hair...
- Hey, just...

1575
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,670
- My hair is showing.
- It's fashion. Pull it.

1576
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,640
My hair is showing!

1577
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,940
- Protect him.
- Please protect me.

1578
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,110
- He's so shy.
- Oh, nice. Try it.

1579
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,980
- Oh, nice.
- Let's stop now.

1580
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,080
Hey, you're doing so well.

1581
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,950
- Do the back too.
- There you go.

1582
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,610
- There you go.
- That looks good.

1583
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,450
- Cut off everything in the back.
- Let's show his back.

1584
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,380
- Is this better?
- Sure, go with the back instead.

1585
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,620
- Go ahead.
- It's best to remove it all.

1586
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,690
Like this.

1587
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,420
Se Chan must be fond of Jonathan.

1588
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,720
He's being protective.

1589
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,790
- Nice.
- You look good.

1590
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,790
Jonathan,
he protected your integrity.

1591
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,600
- There.
- Let's get rid of the sleeves.

1592
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,000
- The sleeves.
- Stop it.

1593
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,530
- You fools!
- Please, not the sides.

1594
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,900
- Cut only that.
- Got it.

1595
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,470
A bear must've attacked you.

1596
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,070
- That looks good.
- There. We'll leave it at that.

1597
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,470
- This looks nice.
- You look good.

1598
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,710
- Nice.
- That looks nice.

1599
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,380
- You look great, Jonathan.
- This is stylish.

1600
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,580
Then there's me.

1601
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,110
You're exactly at 999g.

1602
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,050
- Nice.
- We only need 2g.

1603
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,350
This much would be enough.

1604
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,250
I want to see him
only wearing arm warmers.

1605
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,490
We'll give you arm warmers.

1606
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,820
He should take the most off.

1607
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,420
You'll then take this off.

1608
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,060
- What?
- Don't cut more and take it off.

1609
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,230
No more cutting is needed.

1610
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,530
- Take it off?
- Yes, just take it off.

1611
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,000
- Just wear the arm warmers.
- We only need 2g.

1612
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,530
(They leave him with arm warmers
when they only need 1g.)

1613
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:21,570
You managed to cut off
1,252g of clothing.

1614
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:25,210
Because it's over 1 kg,
your penalty is complete.

1615
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,480
- What on earth is this?
- Come on.

1616
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,840
This isn't even funny.

1617
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,180
- It's funny.
- It's not funny.

1618
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,880
Exactly. It's not funny at all.

1619
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,050
That's the beauty of it.

1620
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,620
- At least make it funny.
- That makes it funny.

1621
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,720
The fact that you're not funny
is funny.

1622
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,690
- What on earth is this?
- That's how it is.

1623
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,950
You look cool.

1624
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,220
- You'll now move...
- We should.

1625
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,460
to the next location.

1626
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,060
- Wait, the time.
- We can't afford these penalties.

1627
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,090
- I told you we should use...
- We can't afford it.

1628
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,430
- the chance card.
- We should.

1629
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,200
We should use the chance card
in the next round.

1630
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,630
The second location
will now be revealed.

1631
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,640
- The second location...
- Go on.

1632
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,770
can be guessed based on the photo.

1633
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,610
- Without a GPS,
- What?

1634
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,010
you'll have to drive there yourself.

1635
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,580
- To the location in the photo?
- Yes.

1636
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,510
Jong Kook, aren't you good
at doing this?

1637
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,680
- As long as I know where it is.
- Right.

1638
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,420
Is there no deadline for this?

1639
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,420
- There is. So...
- There's a deadline?

1640
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,720
The tasks aren't easy today.

1641
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,560
Once you arrive
at the next location,

1642
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,590
we'll give you a new camera.

1643
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,930
It's a digital camera
that automatically...

1644
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,830
- timestamps photos.
- Really?

1645
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,830
To succeed, you must take a photo...

1646
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:27,840
with the timestamp
that reads 1:10 p.m.

1647
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,310
It'll be a little over noon
right now.

1648
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,310
- I think it's 12:10 to 12:20 p.m.
- It won't be easy unless we focus.

1649
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,410
The current time is 12:10 p.m.

1650
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,850
- I was right.
- Nice.

1651
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,880
(Se Chan guessed correctly.)

1652
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,050
- Se Chan, that was awesome.
- Right, 12:10 p.m.

1653
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,080
You were right on the nose.

1654
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,720
You can ask people on the street...

1655
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,060
where the location in the photo is,

1656
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,160
but you can't have them
look it up online...

1657
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,090
or use an AI program to find it.

1658
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,260
If you want, we can give you
a paper map.

1659
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,500
- Please give us that.
- We need one.

1660
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,270
Before GPS,
we found every place on a map.

1661
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,540
- Before GPS.
- Here's the photo of the location.

1662
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,410
- Sure.
- We'll instantly know.

1663
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,910
- I'd be able to tell.
- The SBS building before...

1664
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,310
- What is that?
- I can't tell what this is.

1665
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,250
- What's this? Daerimjang?
- I haven't a clue.

1666
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,480
(Daerimjang)

1667
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,980
(Where an old inn still stands)

1668
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,080
Is it an inn?

1669
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,590
For photos like this,
we should look at what's behind it.

1670
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,620
A mountain.

1671
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:23,260
(Find this photo spot
somewhere in Seoul)

1672
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,190
Since it's called Daerimjang,
is it in Daerim-dong?

1673
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,930
- Daerim-dong's far from here.
- Hold on.

1674
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,400
I don't think it's in Daerim-dong.

1675
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,730
- Is that an inn?
- Wouldn't it be in Euljiro...

1676
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,830
or Jongno?

1677
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,340
- It ends with "jang."
- Is that an inn?

1678
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,570
Somewhere near Hoehyeon Station.

1679
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,040
(Around Euljiro or Jongno
where old inns would be)

1680
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,580
We should look at what's behind it.

1681
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,740
- A mountain.
- There's a mountain.

1682
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,150
It's on a clean brick road.

1683
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,880
This could be in Insa-dong.

1684
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,520
Could it be Seongsu-dong?

1685
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,080
Or maybe Pyeongchang-dong.

1686
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,150
Brick roads like this...

1687
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,750
- aren't common.
- Where else?

1688
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,220
This reminds me of Daehakro.

1689
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,820
- It could be Daehakro.
- Daehakro.

1690
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,290
- Near Hansung University.
- You know what?

1691
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,390
We should ask people about this.

1692
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,830
For some reason,
Daerimjang sounds familiar.

1693
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,930
Let's head out for now.

1694
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,230
(They agree to ask the people
on the street for now.)

1695
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,900
Daerimjang's an inn.

1696
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,240
Daerimjang.
I've heard that name a lot before.

1697
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,940
We should consider
the thought process...

1698
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,410
- behind these missions.
- Right.

1699
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,410
This location
must be somewhere nearby.

1700
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,510
- Exactly. It's not far away.
- Euljiro, Daehakro...

1701
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,980
What's our deadline?

1702
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,910
- Jongno. 1:10 p.m.
- It's 1:10 p.m.

1703
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:19,480
- It must be kind of far.
- That's an hour.

1704
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,620
It must be at least
an hour from here.

1705
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,720
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1706
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,520
- Think about it.
- Okay, maybe not an hour.

1707
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,860
- Maybe 40 minutes.
- It's less than 30 minutes away.

1708
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,960
- Really?
- Yes.

1709
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,590
But they gave us about an hour
to get there.

1710
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,690
It's Jongno, Euljiro, or Daekhakro.

1711
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,030
It's must be about 12:20 p.m.

1712
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,730
- Right.
- We'll have time for coffee.

1713
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,800
- Something like that.
- Let's grab a cup of coffee.

1714
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,370
- Can I call shotgun?
- Go ahead.

1715
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,170
Daerimjang sounds
awfully familiar to me.

1716
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:45,740
Maybe it's somewhere
we have no clue about.

1717
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,140
I think I've heard Daerimjang
many times before.

1718
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,080
Right? The name sounds so familiar.

1719
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,080
They covered everything.

1720
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,420
- Tell me about it.
- Anything that tells time.

1721
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,590
(The GPS)

1722
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:00,190
Don't you think
that sticker would come off?

1723
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,960
I don't think
a mountain's behind it.

1724
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,260
It just looks like a tree.

1725
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,830
I don't think that'll help
identify the location.

1726
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,630
I think I've seen that in Daehakro.

1727
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,500
It's why I said we should
use the chance card...

1728
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,570
in the first round.

1729
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,170
Sitting on that wouldn't earn you...

1730
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,270
- any extra treasure.
- Young Forty.

1731
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,070
- We ended up failing miserably.
- We...

1732
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,740
We can use it this round instead.

1733
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,680
- It's like this.
- Look at us right now.

1734
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,250
- If we had...
- It's not like your guess...

1735
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,650
was perfect.

1736
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,580
- Young Forty, come on.
- Don't be angry.

1737
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,080
Young Forty, hey.

1738
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,350
Look at how we're doing.

1739
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,420
- Young Forty, that's enough.
- As if you know better.

1740
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,060
You should be young at heart,
not just dress young.

1741
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,390
- Shut it!
- Sure, okay.

1742
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,060
There's a limit to how much
we can take, Young Forty.

1743
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,730
- Let's first go to Jongno.
- Sounds good.

1744
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,370
We'll stop by that area
and ask the older generation...

1745
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,570
if they recognize it.

1746
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,340
Let's get off at Jongno...

1747
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,670
and ask the elders
if they know the place.

1748
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,070
- Do you think they'll know?
- Yes.

1749
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,840
That inn seemed old.

1750
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,080
You can get to Daehakro from here.

1751
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,080
- It's close by.
- Right.

1752
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,320
- This is Euljiro in Jongno.
- I see.

1753
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,550
This bulgogi restaurant
has been around...

1754
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,350
- for a long time.
- I know that place, Jae Seok.

1755
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,350
- It has a long history.
- Is the food good?

1756
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,590
Yes, they serve good food.

1757
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,620
- And over here...
- Yes?

1758
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,090
Ojang-dong Hamheung Naengmyeon
is on the right.

1759
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,900
- Is the food good?
- Of course.

1760
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,730
That's Myungbo Movie Theater
on the right.

1761
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,430
- Of course.
- I know what it used to be.

1762
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,000
- Shin Young Kyun Art and Culture...
- That's right.

1763
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,210
I remember waiting in line
to watch "Over the Top."

1764
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,170
This used to be
the Piccadilly Theater.

1765
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,210
- This building right here.
- That's right.

1766
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,350
I'm not familiar
with this neighborhood.

1767
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,780
- We're now in Jongno.
- Right.

1768
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,250
Seoul Cinema used to be on the left.

1769
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:37,550
Exactly.

1770
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:40,720
Jae Seok, ask people
about the location in the photo.

1771
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,760
- We should get out.
- Why don't we lower our windows?

1772
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,090
I'll make a left first.

1773
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,230
Seok Jin should get out...

1774
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,860
so that we can ask his peers.

1775
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,300
- Give him the photo.
- Here you go.

1776
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,770
- Ask your peers.
- Give it to Seok Jin.

1777
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,640
- This?
- Get close to them.

1778
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,770
- I know.
- This is Songhae Street,

1779
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,040
named after Song Hae.

1780
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,240
- First...
- I see.

1781
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,540
We're near Nakwon Musical
Instrument Arcade.

1782
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,480
Let's ask the people around here.

1783
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,050
Hello, sir.

1784
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,450
- I see.
- Perhaps...

1785
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,250
- He already walked past us.
- Hello.

1786
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,150
We should ask the older generation.

1787
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,420
If only we could
look this up online.

1788
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,390
- Tell me about it.
- Hello, sir.

1789
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,490
Do you know where Daerimjang is?

1790
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,060
- I don't.
- You don't?

1791
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,360
- He doesn't know.
- Daerimjang.

1792
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,630
What do we do?

1793
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,770
- Goodness.
- Hello!

1794
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,800
Ma'am, do you know
where Daerimjang is?

1795
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:27,300
- Daerimjang?
- Yes.

1796
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,070
- Do you know that place?
- Jongno 3-ga...

1797
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,170
- What?
- Is it on Jongno 3-ga?

1798
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,540
(Jongno 3-ga...)

1799
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,610
(She asks him back.)

1800
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:33,780
Jongno 3-ga?

1801
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,510
We don't know.

1802
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,310
- You're asking me where it is?
- Yes.

1803
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,680
There are detached houses...

1804
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,680
- in the neighborhood.
- It can't be...

1805
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,180
- Jongno 3-ga.
- It's not Jongno 3-ga.

1806
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,290
Where do you think this is?

1807
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,590
Jongno 3-ga...

1808
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,460
It's not Jongno 3-ga,
but I should take a photo first.

1809
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,920
Sure, take the photo.

1810
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,630
So, it's not on Jongno 3-ga.

1811
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,060
- Hold on.
- Take the photo.

1812
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,190
It's not coming out right.

1813
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,960
- Hold on. Where is this inn?
- She's clueless.

1814
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:58,230
Since there are detached houses,
it might be up there.

1815
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,230
- Up there?
- Up there?

1816
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,270
Are there detached houses?

1817
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,670
This must be
in a trending neighborhood.

1818
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,810
I agree,

1819
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,140
- so we should ask youngsters.
- Youngsters might know.

1820
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,710
- Let me take a look.
- Sure.

1821
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,740
(An old gentleman followed them,
as if he knew something.)

1822
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,610
- Do you know where Daerimjang is?
- This...

1823
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:14,420
(This...)

1824
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,580
I don't know where Daerimjang is.

1825
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,520
- You don't? Thank you anyway.
- Thank you.

1826
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,620
- Do you know this place?
- Do you know where Daerimjang is?

1827
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,120
(It'll be a huge miss
if it's not in Jongno.)

1828
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,730
- Daerimjang?
- Daerimjang's over there.

1829
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,830
- Where?
- Where?

1830
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,560
(Someone who knows
where Daerimjang is?)

1831
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,300
- In Ikseon-dong.
- Ikseon-dong?

1832
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,430
- Yes.
- Is it there?

1833
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,800
- Over there, near Sulla-gil.
- Sulla-gil?

1834
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,470
- Solla-gil?
- No, Sulla-gil.

1835
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,600
Sulla-gil.

1836
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,170
- Sulla-gil.
- Sulla-gil in Ikseon-dong.

1837
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,170
- That's right.
- Then...

1838
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,310
Is it on Sulla-gil in Ikseon-dong?

1839
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,670
Go diagonally from here.

1840
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,040
- This way?
- In Ikseon-dong...

1841
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,440
- Sulla-gil.
- Straight ahead?

1842
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,110
- Sulla-gil.
- Sulla-gil.

1843
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:46,210
- Sulla-gil in Ikseon-dong.
- Sulla-gil.

1844
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,480
(Current Location,
Jongno 3-ga Station)

1845
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,750
(Seosulla-gil)

1846
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,320
(Seosulla-gil is a 6-minute drive
from their current location.)

1847
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,220
- Let's head over there.
- Let's go.

1848
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,620
Let's get back in the van.

1849
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,490
She told us it's on Sulla-gil
in Ikseon-dong.

1850
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,430
I don't know if she's right though.

1851
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,930
- I think she is.
- Right?

1852
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,060
- Sulla-gil in Ikseon-dong.
- Ikseon-dong.

1853
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,530
We can go that way.

1854
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,840
- Do you know your way there?
- Yes.

1855
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,700
What's our deadline?

1856
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,900
Our deadline is 1:10 p.m.

1857
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,410
- We have some time left.
- Don't we have some time left?

1858
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,070
- Yes.
- Sulla-gil in Ikseon-dong.

1859
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,140
Sulla-gil.

1860
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,310
- Hold on. The back isn't blocked.
- This way.

1861
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,850
- You're right.
- We can look outside.

1862
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,010
Seok Sam, over there.

1863
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,080
- Can you see anything?
- I'll find a clock no matter what.

1864
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,320
- Here we go.
- I know I can find one.

1865
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,890
No wonder the name sounded familiar.

1866
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,090
I had a feeling Daerimjang
would be in Jongno.

1867
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,090
Of course.

1868
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,890
We're currently near
Nakwon Musical Instrument Arcade.

1869
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,130
- About 200m ahead...
- We're now in Insa-dong.

1870
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,930
Look for Sulla-gil, Seok Jin.

1871
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,030
- Sulla-gil?
- Check the street names.

1872
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,770
- I haven't heard of it before.
- You can ask me, Seok Jin.

1873
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,100
Sure.

1874
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,370
I went there two weeks ago.

1875
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,370
- Really?
- Yes.

1876
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,470
Where is it?

1877
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,670
It's in Ikseon-dong.

1878
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,940
What the...

1879
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,980
(As if they don't know that.)

1880
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,350
I wonder what time it is.

1881
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,750
Look at the scenery on the streets.

1882
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,150
- What?
- As if that tells the time.

1883
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,750
- It does.
- We can't see anything back here.

1884
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,320
Lunch break is almost over.
See that cafe over there?

1885
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,490
That means it's around
12:45 p.m. to 12:50 p.m.

1886
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,160
(A crowded cafe,
Estimated time: 12:45 p.m. to 12:50 p.m.)

1887
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,230
As you know, I usually work out
around this time of day.

1888
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,000
Right around this time,

1889
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,300
coffee shops are usually packed,

1890
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,140
especially after 12:30 p.m.

1891
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,270
He's not wrong.

1892
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,270
What time do you think it is?

1893
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,370
Right now?
I think it's a little over 12:40 p.m.

1894
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,540
What a joke.

1895
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,610
What a joke.

1896
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,310
- Don't make...
- Hey, that's called Gyeongwoongwan.

1897
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,920
You keep calling me Young Forty,

1898
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,950
and I keep becoming absorbed
into that character.

1899
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,890
Do you feel braver or something?

1900
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,190
- I don't know. I just...
- Well...

1901
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,920
I think it's somewhere around
here and Anguk-dong.

1902
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,430
- Look. The street already feels...
- Here?

1903
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,730
- like it.
- Hey, where is Ikseon-dong?

1904
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,200
- Where? Duksung Women's University.
- This is... Oh, wait.

1905
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,730
- Over there. In there.
- This is the Jongno campus.

1906
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:46,400
- Hey, it's the same brick road.
- This is the Jongno campus.

1907
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,170
- Really?
- The road?

1908
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,440
(The brick road looks similar
to the one in the photo.)

1909
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,010
Hey, look at the map!

1910
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,910
I'm getting motion sickness
from looking at this so much.

1911
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,510
Make a right turn
at Anguk Station here.

1912
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,680
- Make a right turn.
- Turn right.

1913
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,580
We're in the right turn lane anyway.

1914
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,280
Or should we park the car
and walk around?

1915
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,880
Wouldn't that be better?

1916
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,720
- I think that might be better.
- I think it would be too.

1917
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,120
Is it a walkable distance?

1918
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,190
Oh, this is nice.

1919
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,160
- Hey, but this is...
- Wouldn't the police officer know?

1920
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,130
- Let's stop the car here.
- Let's get out.

1921
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,730
- This paid parking lot here? Okay.
- Yes.

1922
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,100
- Let's park it here.
- Will they charge us for parking...

1923
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,830
by the minute?
I think we should know the time.

1924
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,330
- Oh, right.
- It logs the time when we park.

1925
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,900
- It does.
- Right, we can't help it.

1926
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,040
- Right. You're seriously a genius.
- That's true.

1927
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,570
- Yes, we can't help it.
- We need to get the parking stub.

1928
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,040
- We can't help it.
- If you exit the car,

1929
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,080
- we will park it for you.
- Pardon?

1930
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,040
- You're so uptight!
- That's so strict!

1931
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,550
- So uptight!
- So strict!

1932
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,780
Hey, I think that person would
definitely know if we ask.

1933
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,480
- "It's in the back alley here."
- He looks like he would know.

1934
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,050
He looks like he'd say that.

1935
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,320
(He looks as though he'd know
the area like the back of his hand.)

1936
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,360
- He looks like he'd say that.
- Let's ask this gentleman.

1937
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,420
Are we all getting out?

1938
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,660
- Get out.
- Okay.

1939
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:45,360
- Sir, where is Sulla-gil near here?
- Pardon?

1940
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,900
- Ikseon-dong.
- That way.

1941
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,430
- Oh, do we have to go this way?
- Go that way.

1942
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:51,270
- Sir, where is Daerimjang?
- Yes?

1943
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,900
- Daerimjang? Oh, it's that way.
- Yes.

1944
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,940
- Oh, over there?
- Right there? Gosh, thank you!

1945
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,510
(Go straight and turn right.)

1946
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,140
- Thank you, sir. Is it right there?
- Go straight that way?

1947
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,440
- Did we find it?
- For real?

1948
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,140
- Is it here?
- All right. Let's go.

1949
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,150
- Where is it?
- Is it really here?

1950
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,420
- That's right.
- Jae Seok, the time.

1951
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,950
- Let's go.
- It's this way.

1952
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,190
(Running past)

1953
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,250
Look at him acting up again.
Seriously, that guy.

1954
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,620
(A rodent tries to take the lead.)

1955
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,790
Mister!

1956
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,160
Stop acting up!

1957
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,970
Excuse me.
Where is Daerimjang around here?

1958
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,470
- Over there. Yes.
- Right there?

1959
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,200
Hurry up!

1960
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,940
- Gosh, we found our way so well.
- Not there! It's on the other side!

1961
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,440
- The other side! Where is he going?
- Oh, is it on the other side?

1962
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,580
- Hey!
- We have to go this way.

1963
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,240
- Not that way! It's the other side!
- This way!

1964
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,580
- It's across from here!
- Is it across from here?

1965
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,050
- It's across and to the right.
- They said it was this way.

1966
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,020
- What?
- Hurry up.

1967
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,190
But... I mean...

1968
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,590
- She said to go this way.
- Are you sure it's this way?

1969
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,620
- I think we should go in here.
- A 2 or 3-story building.

1970
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,130
- Seok Jin, I bet it's around here.
- Yes?

1971
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,730
- I bet it's around here.
- Yes?

1972
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,060
- Hey, this...
- Should we head into this alley?

1973
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,730
- Should I try going in?
- Go in.

1974
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,530
- Gosh, it's cold.
- Your back is cold, isn't it?

1975
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,770
Yes, it's cold!

1976
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,440
(They head into an alley
that looks similar to the photo.)

1977
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,870
- This is the right vibe.
- It is a brick road. Look.

1978
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,840
- Oh, this looks like it.
- It was this kind of road, right?

1979
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,180
- Hang on.
- What?

1980
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,010
The thing we thought was a mountain
is this tree. This kind of tree.

1981
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,310
- You're right. Then...
- It's this way.

1982
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:13,580
- Then, it must be that building.
- This is the place I meant.

1983
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,680
The stone wall.

1984
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,720
Oh, I think it's that one.

1985
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,720
(They walk away from the tree.)

1986
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,750
- That one.
- My goodness.

1987
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,990
- Hey, Ssaebssaeb.
- Yes, Jae Seok.

1988
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,060
- That one.
- It's here!

1989
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,430
(A red brick building
that seems to be Daerimjang)

1990
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,330
- It's here!
- Is it there?

1991
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,100
- Yes. It's this one.
- Did you find it?

1992
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,500
(Running past)

1993
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,200
What's up with you, Haha?

1994
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,310
(He tries to
cut in front of them again.)

1995
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,580
Why is Haha doing that? Seriously.

1996
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,040
It's here!

1997
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,350
The dry cleaner's.

1998
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,450
- Hang on.
- Over there!

1999
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,780
It's this one.

2000
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,250
(Will it really be Daerimjang?)

2001
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,690
- Daerimjang.
- It's Daerimjang.

2002
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,690
Daerimjang!

2003
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,790
- Is that it?
- Is it there?

2004
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,720
- It's Daerimjang.
- Is this it?

2005
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,090
- Daerimjang.
- It is this building.

2006
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,890
- Daerimjang.
- It's Daerimjang.

2007
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:03,430
(They arrive 11 minutes before
the set time.)

2008
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,800
The background looks similar.

2009
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,800
- This is it!
- It's right here.

2010
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,930
It looks similar.

2011
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,500
- They must've found it.
- I think they have.

2012
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,700
- Is this it?
- It's right here.

2013
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,610
No, don't come yet.

2014
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,610
Gosh,
I guess this is where Daerimjang is.

2015
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,710
Oh, this is nice.

2016
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,710
It's so pretty
if you go to the back here.

2017
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,050
(Just like how it looked
when it was built in 1975)

2018
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,350
- It's fascinating.
- Gosh, that's awesome.

2019
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,680
I know, right?

2020
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,150
From now on,
at the time that you want,

2021
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,950
you can take a single photo.

2022
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,260
If the time that
the photo is taken...

2023
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,090
- is 1:10 p.m.,
- Then,

2024
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,730
- At 1:10 p.m. We still have...
- we should...

2025
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,260
- some time. I think...
- use the chance card in a bit.

2026
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,160
- Let's find out what time it is.
- That's right.

2027
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,900
- Hey, it's not 1 p.m. yet.
- Then...

2028
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,440
- Not yet.
- I think we have about ten minutes.

2029
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,170
Jae Seok, in about five minutes,

2030
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,440
- We should ask.
- let's use the chance card.

2031
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,670
- Let's use it in five minutes.
- Okay.

2032
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,080
It was amazing
how we found this place.

2033
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,210
- Yes, that's right.
- Gosh, it's insane.

2034
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,810
You know,
my experience really came in handy.

2035
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,610
- How often did I come to Jongno?
- Right, back in the day.

2036
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,450
- You know? My gosh.
- Goodness, you went around...

2037
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:56,780
- all over the place.
- I came to Jongno...

2038
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,090
as if I lived here.

2039
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,320
- My goodness.
- This is where I hung out.

2040
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,220
- Oh, you hung out here?
- Gosh, that's crazy.

2041
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,520
- Really, if it hadn't been for me,
- Even if we use the chance card,

2042
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,260
- I said to make a right turn.
- it should be 1 or 2 minutes prior.

2043
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,730
- That's right.
- This neighborhood has...

2044
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,200
- a sentimental vibe.
- Right.

2045
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,070
By the way, I've also...

2046
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,570
- walked around Jongno so much,
- Yes.

2047
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,300
but this is my first time
coming into this back alley.

2048
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,010
It's really nice here.
This back alley is a popular spot.

2049
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,240
(Making eye contact)

2050
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,010
- Hey, don't raise your hand.
- Oh, sorry.

2051
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,610
- Is it a popular spot?
- My nipple keeps...

2052
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,780
This alley in the back
is really popular.

2053
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,310
- The Young Forty crowd must come...
- Back there.

2054
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,020
- Hey, don't raise your hand!
- Back there,

2055
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,450
- there's a comic book store.
- Don't raise your hand. Seriously.

2056
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,850
Oh, man. Is anyone cold?
Do you want to huddle around?

2057
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:35,420
- I know, right? It's cold. Come on.
- Come here. I'm so cold.

2058
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,420
You're so weak.

2059
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,430
- The Young Forties have gathered.
- Hey, I mean...

2060
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,930
- I'm barefoot right now.
- I'm so cold.

2061
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:42,330
- Gosh, why is your belly so warm?
- I'm so cold, though.

2062
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,830
Hey, man.
Se Chan, are you wearing Armani?

2063
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:46,970
- My gosh.
- Are you trying to show it off?

2064
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,300
Hey, Armani underpants.

2065
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,070
It's because I'm cold.
I can't stand how cold it is.

2066
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:52,710
(Laughing)

2067
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,010
That's crazy.

2068
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:56,940
- Oh, it's warm like this.
- It's warm, right?

2069
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,610
- Just covering your belly button...
- He only wears Armani undies.

2070
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:00,820
- By the way, come to think of it,
- Yes?

2071
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,120
wouldn't it be better to use
the chance card...

2072
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,190
for plus or minus three minutes
instead of asking for the time?

2073
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,450
- No.
- No, we should ask for the time.

2074
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,620
That's not bad either.

2075
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,420
- They told us the time at first.
- We kind of know.

2076
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,230
But if we use
the three-minute chance,

2077
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,730
- we must count for three minutes.
- Yes, if you think about it,

2078
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,360
it's three minutes before or after.

2079
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,700
But we should find out
the exact time...

2080
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,900
- And use it five minutes later.
- That's right.

2081
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,570
"What time is it?" Then,
we can start counting from then on.

2082
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:23,170
For example, it can be three minutes
before or after.

2083
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:24,870
- That's right.
- Yes, plus or minus three minutes.

2084
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,010
- I think that's better.
- We could get up to six minutes.

2085
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:30,180
(One person is deep in silence.)

2086
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:34,120
(Fidgeting)

2087
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,690
(Mumbling)

2088
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,250
Should we use the chance card now?

2089
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,320
- No! Wait. Right now, wait...
- No.

2090
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,460
- I feel like...
- Let's use it in one more minute.

2091
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,430
(It's still too early
to use the chance card.)

2092
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,630
There's about six...

2093
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,700
- Two minutes.
- Five or six minutes?

2094
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,500
- Really? About 3 minutes later?
- There's about 5 or 6 minutes left.

2095
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,500
- What do you think?
- Pardon?

2096
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,310
Let's ask the time, then.

2097
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,440
Asking the time...
So, you think asking the time...

2098
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,680
- and counting is better?
- Hey, mister.

2099
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,680
Don't you eat, mister?

2100
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,510
We were ruined because of you
in the last mission.

2101
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,880
Haven't you been eating lately?

2102
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,880
Why?

2103
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,150
Just know that we have 5 minutes
left now.

2104
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,220
About 6 or 5 minutes.

2105
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,020
- You mean 5 or 6 minutes.
- Yes, 5 or 6 minutes.

2106
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,850
- Hey, you sounded like a foreigner.
- No.

2107
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,890
- Hey, you sounded like a foreigner!
- It's about four minutes.

2108
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,330
- Because of the 6 or 5 minutes?
- Yes, 6 or 5 minutes.

2109
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:18,830
- There's 6 or 5 minutes left.
- You sounded like a foreigner.

2110
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:20,090
Hey, Jonathan, are you sure?

2111
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,360
- Five minutes.
- Do we have five minutes left now?

2112
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,700
- Then, in about 5 minutes.
- We have 5 minutes left.

2113
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,000
- let's use the plus or minus three.
- Yes, right.

2114
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,870
- But we don't even know...
- Yes?

2115
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:31,570
if the time we choose is within
the plus or minus three timeframe.

2116
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,340
Wouldn't it be better
to find out the time?

2117
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,040
- Then, if we have about 3 minutes,
- No, the 3-minute card.

2118
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,350
- Yes?
- then we have to count 180 seconds.

2119
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:38,580
- We can count.
- We can count.

2120
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,620
- No.
- No, instead of doing that...

2121
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,780
- We have three minutes left, right?
- What Jae Seok is saying is that...

2122
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,220
- we can count a bit more.
- But then...

2123
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,020
(In the meantime,
Jonathan Watch is so precise.)

2124
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,190
(Laughing awkwardly)

2125
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,190
All right. We'll take the picture
in about 1 or 2 minutes.

2126
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:51,630
(Mediating)

2127
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,790
Three minutes. No, two minutes.

2128
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:54,030
- Who do you think you are?
- We have two minutes left.

2129
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,830
(Sighing)

2130
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:59,030
- I...
- You're nothing but a Young Forty.

2131
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,470
"Nothing but?"

2132
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,500
- "Nothing but?" Young Forties.
- Who are you?
All of you, stand behind me.

2133
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:06,510
Hey, if he keeps treating us...
Why are you avoiding me?

2134
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:07,980
(There isn't much time left.)

2135
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,180
If you have an orange iPhone,
you're in front. The iPhone 17.

2136
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,310
- Nice.
- As we speak, two minutes left.

2137
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,820
- All right.
- Let's go!

2138
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,950
- Do it. Use the chance card.
- We have plenty of time.

2139
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,720
- We'll use the chance card.
- Which chance card will you use?

2140
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,120
- Plus or minus 3 minutes.
- Plus or minus 3 minutes.

2141
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,220
- Let's use the three-minute card.
- If we use that,

2142
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,360
- we have to take the photo now.
- Let's do that.

2143
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
Not that one. Let's just...
- ask for the time.
- Let's ask for the time.

2144
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,460
- No.
- That's better.

2145
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,960
- Asking for the time is better.
- Come on.

2146
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,630
- That one is better.
- Then, play rock-paper-scissors.

2147
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,530
- Fine, play rock-paper-scissors.
- Asking for the time is better.

2148
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:32,800
(Rock-paper-scissors
when we don't have time?)

2149
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,200
- Ssaebssaeb, you do it.
- Plus or minus three minutes...

2150
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,670
- I choose plus or minus three.
- Me too.

2151
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,000
- Hey, hurry up!
- Plus or minus three minutes...

2152
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,670
- Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2153
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:39,710
- Okay, we won.
- Darn it.

2154
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,510
- Since Se Chan won...
- Plus or minus three minutes, then.

2155
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,080
- We chose to ask for the time.
- Yes, the time.

2156
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,610
- But we have to play too.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2157
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:46,410
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- But he was your representative.

2158
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,420
- Why is he the representative?
- He's not the representative.

2159
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,580
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2160
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,620
(Time is almost up!)

2161
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:52,690
He's not the representative.

2162
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,960
We only have one minute left
as we speak!

2163
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,060
- Okay, let's go.
- Do it.

2164
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,120
- Hurry up and use whatever!
- The time!

2165
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,090
- Hurry up! Just ask the time!
- Come on!

2166
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,190
Play rock-paper-scissors again!

2167
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,800
- The current time?
- The time.

2168
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,960
(They use the chance card to check
the time as they won.)

2169
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,330
- No.
- Okay, the current time...

2170
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,670
is 1 p.m...

2171
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,110
It's 1:09 p.m. and 13 seconds.

2172
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,540
- Now! Count!
- One.

2173
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,940
It's 1:09 p.m. and 13 seconds.

2174
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,180
(They'll succeed as long as they
count the remaining seconds well.)

2175
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,780
- Fifteen. Sixteen.
- See?

2176
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:17,910
- Seventeen.
- Asking for the time was right.

2177
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:20,780
- Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty.
- I told you!

2178
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,450
We can take our time
and take it during the tenth minute.

2179
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,820
- We have a whole minute to take it.
- Four. Five.

2180
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,360
- We can take our time.
- We have to succeed in this.

2181
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,690
- Seven.
- He's the clock man.

2182
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,630
- Don't confuse him.
- He's the clock man.

2183
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:33,130
Twenty-nine. Thirty.

2184
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,600
- That's too fast.
- One.

2185
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,130
Eight. Nine. Fifty seconds.

2186
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,870
Eight. Nine. It's ten past.

2187
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:42,440
- Let's take a little time. One.
- Take some time.

2188
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,870
- Take it!
- No.

2189
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,110
- Here. Fifteen.
- All right.

2190
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,510
- I took a photo.
- He took a photo.

2191
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,710
- Did you take a photo?
- Now,

2192
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,180
- we'll check the time.
- I think we'll be okay.

2193
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,780
- We did well.
- I think we'll be okay.

2194
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,610
- That was sufficient.
- It's okay. The time was...

2195
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:53,710
- We took it at the right time.
- Now,

2196
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,320
the exact time
at which you took the photo was...

2197
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,350
Was it 1 p.m.?

2198
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,850
- It was 1 o'clock and...
- Ten minutes.

2199
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,190
Ten minutes and 25 seconds.

2200
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,460
We did it.

2201
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,490
(They took the photo exactly
at 10 past 1!)

2202
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:07,090
- We did it.
- We did it pretty easily.

2203
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,560
- We did it.
- Okay.

2204
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,670
- Okay.
- Okay!

2205
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:14,870
- Don't act out.
- Jae Seok, using...

2206
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,240
Using the three-minute chance card
would've worked.

2207
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,410
- It wouldn't have worked.
- No.

2208
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,510
- It would've worked.
- Three minutes...

2209
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:19,740
It would've been perfect, you fool.

2210
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,740
- Why?
- It's plus or minus three minutes.

2211
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,480
- This is more dramatic.
- That's right.

2212
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,580
- We counted the seconds.
- This is...

2213
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,980
- more fun.
- It was so much fun.

2214
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,680
- I really don't like you guys.
- Seriously.

2215
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,720
Then leave.

2216
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,720
Why would I leave?

2217
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,090
(Their combined age is 99,
but they fight childishly.)

2218
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,420
- Hey, leave.
- Where would I go?

2219
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,920
- Where would I go?
- Go home.

2220
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,390
Who wants to come with me?

2221
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,390
He told Haha to leave.

2222
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:39,130
- Leave. Go home.
- Let's eat.

2223
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:41,030
This is the route
that was taken by Sunragun,

2224
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,630
the public safety officials
of the Joseon dynasty...

2225
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:45,300
- called Seosulla-gil.
- This is Seosulla-gil.

2226
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,970
This place became popular
when trendy shops entered...

2227
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,340
- along the stone wall.
- I was here.

2228
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,540
This place is pretty.

2229
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,740
It looks nice.

2230
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,570
This place has changed so much.

2231
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,380
Yes. Now,
you can finally take photos.

2232
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,050
Please take a few photos
you'll submit...

2233
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,680
in a free-spirited manner.

2234
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,280
You'll compete
with those photos at the end.

2235
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,890
- We need to capture the street?
- Yes.

2236
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:06,720
(Citizens will have a vote
using the photos they've taken.)

2237
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,760
Our photos will be evaluated.

2238
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:11,290
Only first place comes with a prize.

2239
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,890
If you want, you can use a model.

2240
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,430
None of them will make
a useful model.

2241
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,860
- Me.
- Everyone is useless.

2242
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,030
Should this place be the background?

2243
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,670
A photo that resembles
an oil painting.

2244
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,640
I'll take an incredible photo.

2245
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,040
I'm sorry, but would you be
my model?

2246
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:27,370
- No.
- No?

2247
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:28,980
- Are you expensive?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

2248
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,310
- Okay.
- And today is my day off.

2249
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,910
- Is it your day off?
- Yes.

2250
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,220
I'm sorry,
but how much will you pay me?

2251
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,190
I'm a model in Korea.

2252
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,320
I'll feed you three meals a day.

2253
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,890
Three meals a day.

2254
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,290
Three meals a day.

2255
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,660
- That sounds like a swear word.
- The cost of living is high.

2256
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,590
- Are you kidding me?
- Hold on.

2257
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,930
- This...
- These flowers are pretty.

2258
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,130
He loves flowers.

2259
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:52,700
It's natural to love flowers
as you age.

2260
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,970
(Photographer Kook is captivated
by flowers, the cheap models.)

2261
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,070
Good.

2262
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,740
(Focused)

2263
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,540
(He puts his heart into the task
and takes a photo.)

2264
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,640
Look at this.

2265
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,240
So many spots are pretty...

2266
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,350
and atmospheric.

2267
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,480
It's pretty.

2268
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:13,890
Why can't I press it?

2269
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,420
(Photographer Underboob
is at work as well.)

2270
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,520
Why can't I press it?

2271
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,930
It's so cold.

2272
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,690
My belly is cold.

2273
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,760
(Dongducheon's bicycle thief
captures his memories.)

2274
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,760
Why is this place so pretty?

2275
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,500
What's up with this place?

2276
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:33,510
What are you capturing?

2277
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,110
It's my aesthetic.

2278
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,410
Why are you criticizing
my aesthetic?

2279
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,510
(This time, he gets down
to the floor.)

2280
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,920
It's pretty.

2281
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,190
(This time, he tries
the shocking low-angle shot.)

2282
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,920
- What are you doing?
- Jae Seok.

2283
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,960
- Aren't you Jae Seok?
- No.

2284
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,090
- No?
- No.

2285
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,960
Don't you think people will like
Jae Seok's photo the most?

2286
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,300
Exactly.

2287
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,770
That's why I want to take
a photo of him.

2288
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:00,940
But he keeps saying no.

2289
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,240
(He fails to recruit
the popular model again.)

2290
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,300
Sir, let me take a photo of you.

2291
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,640
- No.
- No?

2292
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,210
- Let me take a photo of you.
- Today is my day off.

2293
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,370
- Is that why you're saying no?
- Yes.

2294
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,040
- Let me take a photo of your back.
- No.

2295
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,550
All right then.

2296
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,720
(After failing to recruit a model,)

2297
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,920
(he photographs Jonathan,
a celebrity.)

2298
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,290
This is a celebrity who is moved...

2299
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,160
by the tile-roofed hanok of Korea.

2300
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,760
(A foreigner in Korea)

2301
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,270
Oh, my goodness.

2302
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,470
(Culture shock)

2303
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:35,570
I love it.

2304
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,870
(I love it.)

2305
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,380
Laugh loudly.

2306
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,280
Life is so much fun.

2307
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,880
(Seok Jin recruited an older man
in the neighborhood.)

2308
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,580
Laugh out loud.

2309
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,980
(Giving a direction)

2310
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,120
(Laughing)

2311
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:51,950
Laugh out loud.

2312
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:52,990
(Photographer Jee
keeps telling the model to laugh.)

2313
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:54,120
Don't look at me. Look over there.

2314
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,890
(Photographer Jee
keeps telling the model to laugh.)

2315
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,630
Thank you. I'll do my best.

2316
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,530
Would you please stand here?

2317
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:02,530
Again?

2318
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,830
(Without connecting with the model,
Seok Jin directs him to laugh.)

2319
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,470
Please laugh as you look at the sky.

2320
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,710
(Meanwhile, Haha)

2321
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:14,070
This is cool.

2322
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,540
This umbrella is in the shot.

2323
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,610
(Young Forty Ha is absorbed
in the sentimentality of the past.)

2324
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:17,950
What's the concept of your work?

2325
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:21,850
It's the tile-roofed house
on a rainy day.

2326
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,220
The tile-roofed house
and umbrella...

2327
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:25,990
in the rain...

2328
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:28,020
and loneliness.

2329
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:32,490
It's nice.

2330
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:34,860
Solitude.

2331
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:39,270
(Solitude)

2332
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:40,370
Regret.

2333
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,100
(Regret)

2334
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,340
Longing.

2335
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,640
(Longing)

2336
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:47,070
(And foolishness)

2337
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,180
- Let's wrap up...
- I'm done.

2338
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,440
and move.

2339
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,280
Pick the best photo
and show it to us.

2340
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,320
How cute.

2341
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,920
A foreigner
who has just come to Korea.

2342
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,950
How cute.

2343
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,050
- This is mine.
- I'll go with this one.

2344
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,390
I created a masterpiece.

2345
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,260
I took a sentimental photo.

2346
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,320
It'll be really tasty.

2347
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,660
- What's this?
- It'll be tasty.

2348
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,060
It looks like they're cooking.

2349
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,300
I picked a truly shocking photo.

2350
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,430
It shows you what happiness is.

2351
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,100
The title is "Happiness."

2352
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,300
(Whose work will be the winner?)

2353
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,340
This is nice.

2354
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:16,500
This restaurant...

2355
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,470
is where you can taste
the authentic Texan barbecue.

2356
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:20,570
Texan barbecue.

2357
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,280
- Texas.
- My cousin lives in Texas.

2358
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,850
- Why are you bringing that up?
- Seriously.

2359
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,250
(No one wanted him to share
too much information.)

2360
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,780
(The famous Texan barbecue appears!)

2361
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,750
- Gosh, it looks so tasty.
- I'm sorry.

2362
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,350
I'll judge the taste.

2363
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,160
I've had the real Texan barbecue.

2364
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,290
(Traditional barbecue that has been
smoked for a long time)

2365
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,960
You had it too.

2366
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,360
- That's right.
- You and I had the Texan barbecue.

2367
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,530
(How will the Texas barbecue taste
where Jong Kook's cousin lives?)

2368
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,130
- It looks tasty.
- You've succeeded in...

2369
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,530
the time mission
at the second location,

2370
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:47,030
so you won't have
any penalties here.

2371
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,040
(They can eat comfortably
without any penalties!)

2372
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,100
This is the best.

2373
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,200
- If...
- Eat.

2374
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,410
We succeeded in the mission.

2375
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,570
If I hadn't told you to turn right
at Sulla-gil,

2376
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,010
it would've been a disaster.

2377
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:56,480
Hey, we were on the right-turn lane.

2378
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,850
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Seriously,

2379
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:58,950
had you listened to Young Fifty...

2380
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,350
Hey, get lost. Go home.

2381
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:01,450
- "Go home."
- Eat barbecue and go home.

2382
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:02,620
Why would I go home?

2383
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,520
Seok Jin and Jonathan did well
in the beginning.

2384
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,490
"Eat barbecue and go home."

2385
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,760
Hey.

2386
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,960
Eat and go home.

2387
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,120
No!

2388
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:12,030
No one is home.

2389
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,400
- This is...
- Let's try it.

2390
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,760
Do you have a small plate?

2391
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,130
Gosh, this is...

2392
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,670
I'm reminded of my trip to Texas.

2393
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:19,870
- Is it tasty?
- This is...

2394
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:20,900
Seriously.

2395
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,040
- If...
- Eat.

2396
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,240
We succeeded in the mission.

2397
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,410
If I hadn't told you to turn right
at Sulla-gil...

2398
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:27,610
(How is the burger he put together?)

2399
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,640
Gosh, it's tasty.

2400
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,280
You can eat it like this.

2401
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,410
It's great.

2402
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:34,450
The meat is so tender.

2403
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:35,550
- It's so tasty.
- Yes.

2404
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:36,550
(It gets approved
by the man from LA.)

2405
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,650
What's this?

2406
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,690
Hey, this is no joke.

2407
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,890
- It's butter rice.
- It's garlic rice.

2408
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,990
This is it.

2409
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:46,790
Their ribs are tasty.

2410
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,000
(It's the American taste
he hasn't had in Dongducheon.)

2411
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,530
- They're baby back ribs, right?
- Yes.

2412
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:52,470
- Seok Jin.
- This is it.

2413
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,400
Seok Jin, the ribs are no joke.
They're so tasty.

2414
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,770
(While the older members
focus on the meat)

2415
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,240
It's so tasty.

2416
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,540
(The Congolese man
is obsessed with garlic rice.)

2417
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:06,310
This is how you eat it.

2418
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:08,920
- Look at the meat. It's so big.
- It's tasty.

2419
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,020
It's the best.

2420
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,990
Do it now. There's no one.

2421
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:13,020
It looks like a bib.

2422
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,020
- A bib.
- I can't believe him.

2423
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,360
(Jong Kook is especially excited.)

2424
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:21,430
(This Korean American man
is absorbed in the taste of home.)

2425
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,000
Yesterday... Today,
I came back from the US.

2426
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,270
I feel like I'm still there.

2427
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:26,830
Jong Kook, stop it already.

2428
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,300
(Jong Kook's American dream)

2429
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,070
I won't need to go
and see my cousin.

2430
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,770
I'm full.

2431
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,040
It was a great meal.

2432
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,910
- The bread was great too.
- We ate so much. We enjoyed it.

2433
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:40,950
Now, the last location remains.

2434
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:42,820
- You know, he ate too much.
- His belly...

2435
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,020
- You know, he ate too much.
- His belly...

2436
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,690
His belly is protruding too much.

2437
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,420
- I'm sorry.
- It's so cute.

2438
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,790
- Oh, my.
- We ate so much.

2439
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,930
Your belly looks pretty.

2440
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,290
- It looks cute, right?
- Some bellies are ugly.

2441
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,490
- Some protruding bellies are cute.
- Yes.

2442
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,530
- You're right.
- Some bellies are ugly,

2443
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:56,600
but yours looks okay.

2444
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,700
- It looks cute, right?
- It looks cute.

2445
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,900
Your belly looks cute.

2446
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,770
For the last chance card,

2447
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,640
you'll have a mission.

2448
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,670
- Okay.
- The mission is...

2449
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:07,010
Fill in the Blank.

2450
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,410
- Okay. It's my favorite game.
- Okay.

2451
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,940
- You don't know what it is.
- I played it yesterday.

2452
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,880
I played it like crazy
during Chuseok.

2453
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,020
Young Forty, you're acting out
so much today.

2454
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,350
I'm not acting out.
Can't I voice my thoughts?

2455
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,490
Go home.

2456
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:19,890
- Leave.
- Do you wear such clothes...

2457
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,320
- at home?
- Yes, I do.

2458
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,760
- You wear such clothes.
- Why do you ask?

2459
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,490
It looks like you're home.

2460
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,560
You wear such clothes at home.

2461
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,560
I look like this at home.

2462
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,430
It looks like
you're in the living room.

2463
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:31,800
You'll get a three-syllable word.

2464
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,700
To the beat, the production crew...

2465
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,100
will say the first
and last syllables.

2466
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,340
Then you'll say the whole word
that comes to mind.

2467
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,610
- Okay.
- What does that mean?

2468
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:42,180
- I love that game.
- For example, I might go...

2469
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,880
Yu.

2470
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:45,710
- Seok.
- Seok.

2471
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,150
- Yu Jae Seok.
- Yu Jae Seok.

2472
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:48,320
- That's how you do it.
- I see.

2473
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,380
I'm good at it.

2474
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,520
Bi.

2475
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,590
- Cle.
- Bicycle.

2476
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,650
- There you go.
- Bicycle.

2477
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,220
- Young.
- Young.

2478
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,560
Ty.

2479
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,390
- Haha.
- Young Forty.

2480
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,660
That's right.

2481
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,000
You'll take turns.

2482
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,400
If everyone succeeds in it at once,

2483
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,070
- you'll get a chance card.
- Let's go.

2484
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,900
- Focus.
- Let's go.

2485
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,340
- Let's go.
- It's simple.

2486
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,640
- If we fail...
- Tomato. Bicycle.

2487
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,970
- We need a chance card.
- It'll be unbecoming.

2488
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:14,140
- You'll have six attempts.
- We'll give it a go.

2489
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,240
- Good.
- Everyone needs to succeed in it.

2490
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,740
Let's go in this order.

2491
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,850
- You'll go first.
- Okay.

2492
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:19,850
Let's go.

2493
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:21,250
- He isn't very good at it.
- Let's go.

2494
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,080
- He isn't very good at it.
- Seok Jin, I'll give it a go.

2495
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,080
Okay.

2496
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,020
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

2497
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,650
- One, two, three, four.
- Three, four.

2498
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,920
Man. Ray.

2499
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:32,690
Scallop.

2500
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,560
- Incorrect.
- It's "Manta ray."

2501
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,130
Scallop.

2502
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,730
- Incorrect.
- It's "Manta ray."

2503
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,540
- Doesn't he know the rules?
- Manta ray.

2504
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,140
- Mister.
- What's wrong with you?

2505
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,570
- Mister.
- Let's start from that side.

2506
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,140
- Mister.
- I thought it was "Scallop."

2507
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,610
- For goodness' sake.
- You fill in the middle syllable.

2508
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,040
- Seriously.
- For goodness' sake.

2509
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,110
I'm sorry.

2510
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,480
- For goodness' sake.
- Let's start from that side.

2511
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:55,050
- It's quite nerve-racking.
- That means...

2512
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:56,780
- you failed once.
- Let's start from that side.

2513
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,750
- No.
- Let it slide.

2514
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,950
- It was Jae Seok.
- Let's say it was a practice round.

2515
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,720
- Jonathan will go first.
- Okay.

2516
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,090
(Since he misunderstood the rules,
it'll be a practice round.)

2517
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:06,030
I'll sit here.

2518
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,960
- I can think of all the words.
- Seok Sam...

2519
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,360
Jonathan will go first.

2520
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,170
- One, two, three, four.
- Three, four.

2521
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,670
Draw. Pad.

2522
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,700
- Bellflower root.
- Incorrect.

2523
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,710
- What?
- That was an easy one.

2524
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,170
- Bellflower root.
- Incorrect.

2525
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,240
- What?
- That was an easy one.

2526
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,480
- Drawing pad.
- It was an easy one.

2527
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:25,880
(Oh, no)

2528
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,880
- He's a foreigner.
- Drawing pad.

2529
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,850
- Do you even speak Korean?
- Can you speak Korean?

2530
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,720
I didn't understand Korean.

2531
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,020
- I couldn't speak Korean.
- Go easy on him.

2532
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,390
- "Drawing pad" was easy.
- "Drawing pad" was easy.

2533
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:39,530
- We'll change the order.
- Okay.

2534
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:40,990
Let's start over with the order.

2535
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,130
Okay. Let's go in the order.

2536
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:44,130
- Jong Kook.
- Okay.

2537
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,730
- I mean...
- He's a foreigner in Korea, okay?

2538
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,800
- He's a foreigner.
- Drawing pad.

2539
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,040
"Drawing pad" is a bit much
for a foreigner.

2540
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,970
- Drawing pad.
- Let's go.

2541
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,410
- Jong Kook.
- Help us succeed in it.

2542
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:55,840
- Give us the easy ones.
- Jong Kook will go first.

2543
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,740
- Let's do this. Okay.
- Let's go.

2544
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,850
- Set, go.
- Let's go.

2545
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,580
One, two, three, four.

2546
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,950
- Cheap. Te.
- Cheap.

2547
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,620
- Cheapskate.
- There you go. It's easy.

2548
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,620
(Jong Kook gets a pass.)

2549
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,790
- It's easy.
- All right.

2550
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,530
Brack. Fern.

2551
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,260
Broken.

2552
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,360
- Incorrect.
- Bracken fern.

2553
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,070
- Broken.
- Bracken fern.

2554
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,400
Seok Jin, it was hard.

2555
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,340
- Bracken fern. What was "Broken?"
- Get down on the floor.

2556
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,710
- What was "Broken?"
- Give me a kick.

2557
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,710
- What was "Broken?"
- It was obviously "Bracken fern."

2558
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,140
- It was easy.
- He should've gotten it right.

2559
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:32,480
- Mister, come here.
- Mister, come here.

2560
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,780
- Here?
- Jonathan, take that seat.

2561
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,950
- Jonathan, take that seat.
- Scoot over.

2562
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:37,950
Listen. Don't try to do well.

2563
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:39,490
- Don't try to do well.
- Don't try to do well.

2564
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:41,590
- Just pretend to talk.
- Okay.

2565
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,490
- Imagine watching TV.
- Don't focus so much.

2566
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,490
- Imagine watching TV.
- That's the problem.

2567
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:47,360
- If you try to do well...
- That's right.

2568
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,530
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2569
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:50,330
Haha will go first. Set, go.

2570
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:51,360
I got this.

2571
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,530
- Three, four.
- An easy one.

2572
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:55,900
- It's easy.
- Ham. Ger.

2573
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,240
- It's easy.
- Ham. Ger.

2574
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,940
- It's easy.
- Hammerger.

2575
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,280
- What?
- What? Isn't it "Hamburger?"

2576
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,580
- What was that?
- Fire extinguisher.

2577
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,610
Hammerger.

2578
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:05,650
What?

2579
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,480
(Ham, ger)

2580
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,480
- Hamburger.
- Incorrect.

2581
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,820
Hammerger.

2582
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,450
- What's wrong with him?
- Get lost.

2583
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:13,920
What's wrong with Young Forty?

2584
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,190
Come here, Young Forty.

2585
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:18,890
(Haha's pathetic failure
makes Jong Kook laugh.)

2586
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:20,560
- Hey, Diving Beetle, come here.
- Young Forty.

2587
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,730
- Young Forty, come here.
- I mean...

2588
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:23,560
- What was that?
- What are those glasses?

2589
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,970
I said "Hamburger."

2590
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,900
- Come on.
- Seriously!

2591
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,670
I said "Hamburger."

2592
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,000
Hey!

2593
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:33,070
(He's nearly crying.)

2594
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:37,380
I couldn't believe it.
He had no confidence whatsoever.

2595
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,610
- Go over there.
- He had no confidence whatsoever.

2596
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,980
I can't believe him!

2597
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:45,190
There's nothing he does well.

2598
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,250
(Fourth attempt)

2599
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,890
(Only half the attempts remain.)

2600
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,630
Ji Hyo will go first.

2601
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:54,660
Let's begin. One, two, three, four.

2602
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,200
Po. To.

2603
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:00,200
- Potato.
- There you go.

2604
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,200
- There you go.
- Ji Hyo is good.

2605
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,570
- It was easy.
- Ji Hyo is good.

2606
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,600
(It's Jae Seok's turn.)

2607
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,710
Run. Shoes.

2608
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:10,910
("Running shoes" is an easy choice!)

2609
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:13,050
- Runna shoes.
- Incorrect.

2610
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,650
Running shoes!

2611
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:15,920
Runna shoes.

2612
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,820
(In disbelief)

2613
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,250
- Running shoes!
- Get up.

2614
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:22,490
- No excuses.
- Runna shoes.

2615
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,820
- Runna shoes.
- Listen.

2616
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,760
Jae Seok, it was too much.

2617
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,200
- I mean...
- Not "Running shoes."

2618
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,330
What's wrong with you?

2619
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,230
(They don't understand
his poor performance.)

2620
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:35,840
- I couldn't think of it.
- You said "Runna shoes..."

2621
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,000
- instead of "Running shoes."
- Runna shoes.

2622
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,440
He shouldn't criticize other people.

2623
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,710
(He becomes quiet.)

2624
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,110
- For goodness' sake.
- You couldn't get past two people.

2625
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,480
- Seriously.
- Let's do this.

2626
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,110
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

2627
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:48,420
- Let's go.
- We'll do this for real.

2628
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,280
Please go slowly and give us
some time.

2629
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,620
- Seriously.
- Then we'll answer.

2630
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:52,750
- Please give us some time.
- Okay.

2631
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,820
Again.

2632
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,590
Let's show them what we can do.

2633
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,090
Let's do this.

2634
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,160
- Ajou University.
- Ajou University.

2635
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,930
- Business major.
- Business major.

2636
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,360
Ajou University's business major,
let's go.

2637
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,360
- During a conversation...
- During a conversation...

2638
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,000
- It'll come smoothly.
- One, two, three, four.

2639
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,770
Mi. Ri.

2640
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:13,840
- Miari.
- It was an easy one.

2641
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,640
(After Seok Jin,
it's Jong Kook's turn!)

2642
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,280
- Wash.
- Wash.

2643
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,780
Sin.

2644
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,780
- Washer...
- Wash basin!

2645
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,820
Incorrect.

2646
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,820
(Even the fifth attempt fails.)

2647
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,390
- Washer.
- Wash basin.

2648
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,960
It's "Wash basin."

2649
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,160
(They only have one chance!)

2650
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,660
Couldn't you think of "Wash basin?"

2651
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,730
- Are you criticizing me?
- You should've thought of it.

2652
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:36,500
He got it confused with "Washer."

2653
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,100
Mister, sit here.

2654
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:40,200
- Okay.
- It's funny since we're bad at it.

2655
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,100
We're so bad at it.

2656
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,970
Did you prepare many words?

2657
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,210
Can you keep going?

2658
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:47,910
Even if you give us
the same ones, we'll fail.

2659
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:49,080
- We've never gone far.
- Give us...

2660
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,240
- the easiest ones at first.
- Yes.

2661
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:53,450
- When...
- It's hard.

2662
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,850
- Then...
- Make it three strikes.

2663
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:56,280
Count it as a success
if six members succeed in it.

2664
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,750
Five out of eight members
need to succeed in it.

2665
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,290
- Good.
- Let's do this.

2666
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,160
- Even if you mess up, keep going.
- Okay.

2667
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,160
Even if you mess up, keep going.

2668
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,030
- Don't scold other people.
- This is the very last chance.

2669
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:07,130
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2670
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,430
- Se Chan will go first.
- Okay.

2671
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:10,960
- Okay.
- He won't succeed in it.

2672
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:14,100
- Okay.
- One, two, three, four.

2673
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:17,800
Cut. Fish.

2674
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:19,410
Cuttlefish.
(Correct)

2675
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:22,140
(Se Chan gets a pass.
Jong Kook is next!)

2676
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,210
Three, four.

2677
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,750
- Au. Ra.
- Au.

2678
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,080
- Aurora.
- There you go.

2679
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,050
(The 1st 2 consecutive passes!
Ji Hyo is next!)

2680
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,520
Hou. Cat.

2681
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,860
It's an easy one.

2682
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:38,730
Hochu cat.

2683
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:39,790
- Incorrect.
- Go.

2684
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:40,960
(She fails,)

2685
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,260
(but they keep going!)

2686
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,430
- Go.
- Go.

2687
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:45,600
(Se Chan, Jong Kook: Pass
Ji Hyo: Fail)

2688
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,600
- A.
- A?

2689
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,970
- Shell.
- A.

2690
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:53,640
("Acorn shell" is easy!)

2691
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:57,840
(Jae Seok has never gotten a pass!
Will he get a pass this time?)

2692
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,980
Aga shell.

2693
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,010
- Incorrect.
- Acorn shell!

2694
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:02,080
Aga shell.

2695
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,550
- Acorn shell!
- Acorn!

2696
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:04,720
(Among the 4 remaining members,
3 need to succeed in it.)

2697
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:07,120
- Just keep going.
- What's your problem?

2698
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,760
(They keep going. It's Haha's turn!)

2699
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,620
- For goodness' sake.
- One, two, three, four.

2700
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,490
One, two, three, four.

2701
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,160
- Honey.
- Honey?

2702
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,660
Ger.

2703
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,470
- Honey roger.
- There you go.

2704
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:23,270
(Even Haha messes up!)

2705
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,800
What is it? Go ahead.

2706
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,840
- What is it?
- "Honey roger?"

2707
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:28,240
- "Honey roger?"
- What is it then?

2708
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,940
- Honey badger.
- Honey badger.

2709
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:32,210
- "Honey badger" was a hard one.
- It was a hard one.

2710
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:35,180
- All three need to succeed in it.
- All of us need to succeed in it.

2711
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:38,250
- This is the beginning.
- This is the beginning.

2712
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,790
- One, two, three, four.
- Let's go.

2713
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,890
Jeo. Ri.

2714
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,060
- Jeogori.
- There you go.

2715
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:49,300
(Daniel gets a pass.
Jonathan is next!)

2716
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,130
One, two, three, four.

2717
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:54,800
Mi. Phone.

2718
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,070
- Microphone.
- There you go.

2719
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,970
- There you go.
- That foreigner is good.

2720
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:00,070
(Even Jonathan gets a pass!)

2721
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:03,110
(They'll succeed in the mission
if Seok Jin gets a pass!)

2722
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,680
Hob. Lin.

2723
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,550
(Hob, Lin)

2724
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:10,980
(It's so easy! It's "Hobgoblin!")

2725
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,650
(Hob, Lin)

2726
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:15,120
- Hobsalin.
- Hobgoblin!

2727
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,390
Incorrect.

2728
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,420
- Hobsalin.
- Hobgoblin!

2729
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,190
(They fail the mission.)

2730
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:20,990
- What even is "Hobsalin?"
- Come on!

2731
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:25,930
You did it on purpose, right?

2732
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,170
- No. I'm serious.
- You did it on purpose, right?

2733
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:28,700
- No.
- You did it on purpose, right?

2734
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,570
- "Hobsalin" could be a word.
- Both of you...

2735
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,670
- What's wrong with you?
- Seok Jin, "Hobsalin" is...

2736
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,180
- I couldn't remember the word.
- That happens.

2737
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,280
- Jae Seok.
- What even is "Hobsalin?"

2738
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,740
- Don't lie.
- You did it on purpose, right?

2739
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,980
- I couldn't remember the word.
- Don't lie.

2740
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:42,080
- Seriously.
- I didn't do it on purpose.

2741
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:45,420
We'll do it without a chance card.

2742
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:48,090
It isn't your decision to do it
without a chance card.

2743
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:50,320
- You failed.
- You're so brazen.

2744
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,660
- We'll do it without a chance card.
- Mister.

2745
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,460
- You're so brazen.
- We'll do it without a chance card.

2746
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:55,730
It's nothing.

2747
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,760
How did we fail so miserably?

2748
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,500
- Seriously.
- We'll do it without a chance card.

2749
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,340
You failed the final attempt,

2750
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,870
so you won't get a chance card.

2751
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:05,370
Please give us the same questions.

2752
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:07,470
- I'm just annoyed.
- Stop. Do it at home.

2753
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,140
Why would I do it at home?

2754
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:11,540
- With whom would I do it?
- Go home.

2755
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,110
- Who will give me the questions?
- Go home.

2756
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:14,310
No, I won't go home.

2757
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:16,880
The third location is...

2758
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,790
- Naksan Park.
- Naksan Park.

2759
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:20,420
- At the park,
- Where is it?

2760
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:23,260
we installed a clock tower.

2761
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,760
You'll succeed in the mission...

2762
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,690
if you remove the cloth
exactly at 3:05 p.m.

2763
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:30,500
The current time is 2:38 p.m.

2764
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,560
Already?

2765
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:33,330
- Naksan Park must be nearby.
- We have 30 minutes left.

2766
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,670
- How far is it? Is it nearby?
- Ten minutes?

2767
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:36,400
- Ten minutes.
- You'll take the car.

2768
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,270
We'll drop you off nearby this time.

2769
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:39,340
- Okay.
- Yes.

2770
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,540
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2771
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:44,180
It'll be a miracle
if we guess correctly.

2772
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,110
In that case...

2773
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:48,650
- Hold on. We need to count.
- Ten or fifteen minutes.

2774
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,450
- Ten or fifteen minutes. So...
- We need to guess.

2775
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:52,450
- the estimated time of arrival...
- Yes.

2776
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:54,650
- Five minutes to three.
- Five minutes to three.

2777
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,490
Once we arrive there,

2778
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:58,690
we should do it in ten minutes.

2779
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:00,490
It'll take ten minutes to get there.

2780
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,200
Since it's raining,
it might take a bit longer.

2781
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,800
It'll be a miracle
if we guess correctly.

2782
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,770
Seok Jin, we might need to run
since there's a traffic jam.

2783
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,670
- There's a lot of traffic.
- But...

2784
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,570
- The time...
- We don't have much time.

2785
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:15,310
Did you hear the time
when we left earlier?

2786
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:18,850
It was 30-something or 40 minutes.
It was around 35 or 38 minutes.

2787
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:21,210
I'm focusing on guessing...

2788
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,280
Me too.

2789
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:26,390
I'm doing it more.
We have to get there by 3:05 p.m.

2790
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,790
- Right now...
- Just stay still.

2791
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:29,490
- Then it's...
- About 10 to 12 minutes left.

2792
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,590
Then it's past 50 minutes now.

2793
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:34,260
- It's not past that.
- Then what time do you think it is?

2794
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,030
What do you think the time is?
Pouty Mouth.

2795
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:38,900
Tell us, Young Forty.
What time do you think it is?

2796
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:41,370
Sixty can say it first,
and I'll say it.

2797
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:43,770
Hey, it's Fifty.

2798
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:45,370
(He snaps.)

2799
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:47,140
- Hey.
- That's funny.

2800
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,280
Should I say it now?

2801
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,980
- Fifty.
- You'd get shocked.

2802
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,050
It's 57 minutes 42 seconds.

2803
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:55,750
- No.
- No.

2804
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,050
- It's not that late.
- That's not right. Fifty...

2805
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:59,290
- That's nowhere close.
- Right now...

2806
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:00,920
- Right now...
- It's around 55 to 53.

2807
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,260
It's 2:49 p.m.

2808
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,590
- No.
- It's more than that.

2809
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:07,260
It's exactly 2:53 p.m.

2810
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,560
I think it's around 2:50 p.m.

2811
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,900
- It's only been that much?
- Yes.

2812
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,170
Our opinions are so different.

2813
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:16,240
That's how it is.
Do our opinions have to be the same?

2814
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,670
They can be different.

2815
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:18,670
- Seok Jin.
- What's wrong with you?

2816
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:19,840
Why are you swearing?

2817
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,570
Why are you doing that?

2818
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,580
(He's touched by all the scolding
from every direction.)

2819
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,810
It sounded like I was mad, right?

2820
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:26,550
I wasn't mad.

2821
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,210
Don't intimidate him.

2822
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:30,080
(Laughing)

2823
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,520
I can see how
you might've misunderstood.

2824
01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:33,690
I was shocked.

2825
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:36,390
You're at the back.

2826
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:37,960
- You're the furthest from me.
- Is that so?

2827
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,030
I was talking loudly.

2828
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:41,430
- Is that what it was?
- "Why are you doing that?"

2829
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:42,630
(He keeps talking in awkwardness.)

2830
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:45,100
You could've misunderstood that.
I'll admit that.

2831
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,070
You could misunderstand it,
but it was never my intention.

2832
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:50,100
It's so funny how Seok Jin says
he doesn't get mad.

2833
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:52,370
- He says he doesn't get mad.
- But...

2834
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:54,940
why do you scold him all at once?

2835
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:56,580
Because it doesn't make sense.

2836
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:59,480
It's in the script.

2837
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,280
Everyone says,
"Why are you doing that?"

2838
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,080
- "Don't get mad."
- You should say it too.

2839
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,590
- This is 100 percent script.
- You should also say it.

2840
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:08,690
- Why are you doing that?
- You should also say it.

2841
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:10,090
You should also say it
when the time comes.

2842
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:11,920
This is so funny.

2843
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,190
(Today's line that captured
the audience's heart)

2844
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,360
"You should also say it
when the time comes."

2845
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,900
- You should also say it.
- Seriously...

2846
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:21,900
(One man is silent
amid the script talk.)

2847
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,070
What is your guess, Jonathan?

2848
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,740
Are you secretly counting the time?

2849
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,470
- Yes. I'm...
- Jae Seok is...

2850
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:28,170
- really into it.
- I would be counting it accurately.

2851
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:29,540
He's doing it sharply.

2852
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,810
Jae Seok is good at focusing.

2853
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,810
What time is it now?
It would be around 58 minutes.

2854
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:41,390
I think it's around 53
or 54 minutes.

2855
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,320
(He's accurate.)

2856
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,090
I think it's 45 minutes now.

2857
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:47,130
- No.
- Around 43 minutes...

2858
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:51,000
We were accurate earlier
because we had the chance card.

2859
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,770
- We need it.
- This is hard.

2860
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,070
It would be a miracle
if we get this right.

2861
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:56,270
It would be hard to guess it right.

2862
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:58,710
- I think it's going to be hard.
- Seriously hard.

2863
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,370
It's making me a bit nervous.

2864
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:01,370
It has to be 3:05 p.m.

2865
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:04,080
- When we get there...
- It might be...

2866
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,280
It's 2:55 p.m. now,
and we have to be there at 3:05 p.m.

2867
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:08,680
We just have to guess it right
in between.

2868
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,680
How are we going to time those
ten minutes without a chance card?

2869
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,820
- This is hard.
- Now...

2870
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,490
- We're here.
- Right now...

2871
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:14,690
- It's 50 minutes.
- It's 57 minutes.

2872
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:16,560
- No. It's 50...
- It's 50 minutes now.

2873
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:18,320
- It's 57 minutes.
- It's 59 minutes.

2874
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,560
- It's 59 minutes?
- It's 58 minutes.

2875
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,560
- It's 58 minutes 22 seconds.
- What's wrong?

2876
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,030
(The bus shook.)

2877
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:23,460
- It's 58 minutes.
- It's 58 minutes 22 seconds.

2878
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,730
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

2879
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,030
- Can't we go up?
- Should we walk up?

2880
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:28,200
- I guess it got stuck.
- It got stuck.

2881
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:29,670
In the gutter.

2882
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:31,670
- It's slippery.
- We'd have to get out.

2883
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:33,070
We'll get out then.

2884
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,970
If you give the bus a little push...

2885
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,680
- Let's push it.
- Seok Jin.

2886
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,810
You don't all have to leave.

2887
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:39,810
- Let's get out.
- It's that bad?

2888
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:42,180
- Get away.
- Don't do it.

2889
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:43,580
We'll get out and go.

2890
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,620
- You have to be careful.
- The right...

2891
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:45,790
One...

2892
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:46,890
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2893
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,350
- Okay.
- It's moving.

2894
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,560
- Did you get out?
- It's because of the metal.

2895
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,530
Move forward a bit more.
Move forward.

2896
01:29:54,290 --> 01:29:55,760
I think it's done.

2897
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:58,530
We just need to pass
over the metal part.

2898
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:00,130
- It's done.
- You can move forward.

2899
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:01,630
- It's done.
- Should we push more?

2900
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:02,640
(They managed to save the bus.)

2901
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,740
It would be nearly 3 p.m. now.

2902
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:08,040
- Yes.
- What?

2903
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,940
- Can it move?
- I think it's around 3 p.m.

2904
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:11,580
- Keep going forward.
- Hey.

2905
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,410
- It's cold.
- I think it's around 3 p.m.

2906
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:14,780
It's so cold.

2907
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,750
We don't have much time.

2908
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:18,820
(It's exactly 3 p.m.)

2909
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:20,490
- Let's go.
- It's 3 p.m.

2910
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,990
- It's 3 p.m.
- It's 3:01 p.m.

2911
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,390
- Hey, hurry up.
- Get out. Let's all go.

2912
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:26,590
I think it's around 3:01 p.m.

2913
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,960
- What?
- I think it's a little past 3 p.m.

2914
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,300
- How did you know that?
- Really?

2915
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,660
- Is it your feeling?
- It's my feeling.

2916
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:34,370
I've been counting in my head.

2917
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:36,570
Hold on. Let's count from now on.

2918
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:38,170
Do we have four minutes left now?

2919
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:40,910
Around 4 or 3 minutes.

2920
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:42,880
- Let's count three minutes now.
- One, two,

2921
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:46,050
three, four, five,

2922
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:48,080
- six, seven,
- Because earlier,

2923
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,880
- it was around 3 p.m.
- eight,

2924
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,680
nine, ten,

2925
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,990
eleven, twelve, thirteen...

2926
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:56,660
You're a bit fast, Seok Jin.

2927
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,590
- Slow down.
- Go on.

2928
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:01,130
- I was counting.
- thirty-eight, thirty-nine,

2929
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:04,100
Young Forty,

2930
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,770
forty-one, forty-two,

2931
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,230
- forty-three,
- It's nearing your age.

2932
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,270
forty-four,

2933
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,370
- It's nearing your age.
- forty...

2934
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:12,040
- Shall we say "happy birthday?"
- forty-six,

2935
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,640
- when he says sixty.
- forty-five,

2936
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,470
Why are you saying forty-five
after forty-six?

2937
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,680
- forty-nine,
- What's wrong with him?

2938
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,840
- fifty,
- Okay.

2939
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,850
- fifty-one, fifty-two,
- Two minutes passed.

2940
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,680
- fifty...
- He counts backward.

2941
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:24,180
fifty-four, fifty-five,

2942
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,450
- fifty-six, seven,
- Seven.

2943
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:28,990
- eight, nine...
- Eight, nine...

2944
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:33,630
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

2945
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,760
It's finally 60.

2946
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,060
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

2947
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,170
Happy 60 years.

2948
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:40,470
(Jae Seok isn't even participating
in teasing Seok Sam.)

2949
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:41,870
(He's still counting the time.)

2950
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:43,800
Has it been about ten seconds?

2951
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,610
- Nine, ten,
- Yes. It's been ten seconds.

2952
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:46,640
eleven,

2953
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,440
- You're on 20 seconds.
- twelve, thirteen...

2954
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,810
If only the sun were out,
I could tell the exact time.

2955
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,980
I've been getting a grasp
on how long ten minutes are.

2956
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,920
It's not a smooth road.

2957
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,650
This is a hard mission.

2958
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:02,690
It's very hard.

2959
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,860
Where is it? How...

2960
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:05,590
(They have to arrive
before the deadline.)

2961
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,590
- Eight.
- We're here. We have to run.

2962
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:08,790
It's been two minutes!

2963
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:11,060
- We have to run.
- It's been two minutes!

2964
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:13,370
Let's run as soon as we get out.

2965
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:15,370
We have to hurry
as soon as we get out.

2966
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:17,170
When should we arrive there by?

2967
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:19,170
- By 3:05 p.m.
- Let's go.

2968
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:21,040
(They arrive at the parking lot.)

2969
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,910
- Hurry.
- Unbuckle your seatbelt.

2970
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:23,910
- Let's go!
- Seok Jin.

2971
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:25,980
We have to take it
as soon as we get there.

2972
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:27,650
- Nineteen,
- Where is it?

2973
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:28,710
twenty,

2974
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,020
- Where is it?
- twenty-one,

2975
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,350
- twenty-two,
- Where is it?

2976
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:32,550
- twenty-three,
- It's cold!

2977
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:33,890
- Let's go.
- twenty-four...

2978
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:35,290
- Hurry up and go.
- Go.

2979
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:36,590
- Where is it?
- Twenty-six,

2980
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,460
twenty-seven, twenty-eight,

2981
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,960
twenty-nine, thirty,

2982
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,260
thirty-one...

2983
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:44,430
- We have no time.
- It's here.

2984
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:45,560
- Thirty-three,
- Here.

2985
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,630
- thirty-four...
- Here.

2986
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:47,630
(Will they be able to pass
at exactly 3:05 p.m.?)

2987
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:49,170
Thirty-seven, thirty-eight,

2988
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,470
- Hold on. Is it really the time?
- thirty-nine...

2989
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:52,470
It's this one.

2990
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,210
- Here.
- I don't think it's time yet.

2991
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:55,840
- This one.
- Do we open this?

2992
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:56,910
What was the time earlier?

2993
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,640
When you think it's exactly 3:05 p.m.,

2994
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,880
you can remove the black cloth.

2995
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,020
- If it's 3:05 p.m., you'd succeed.
- No.

2996
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:05,650
- I think we could do it now.
- Now!

2997
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:07,450
- Should I do it now?
- Hold on.

2998
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:09,120
- No.
- Ten seconds.

2999
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,590
- Earlier,
- Ten,

3000
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:11,890
- nine,
- you said it in the car...

3001
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,030
- eight, seven,
- It's been three minutes.

3002
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,730
- six, five...
- Six, five...

3003
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:18,000
- Can't we wait a little longer?
- It's been three minutes.

3004
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,400
Remove it. One,

3005
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,630
- two, three!
- No.

3006
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,100
(Would it be 3:05 p.m.?)

3007
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,770
- Two, three!
- No.

3008
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:28,340
- It's past the time.
- It's past the time.

3009
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:30,080
(It's past 3:05 p.m.)

3010
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:32,180
- It's past the time.
- So...

3011
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,350
(Has it been 2 minutes
since they arrived?)

3012
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:35,680
- We...
- It's past the time.

3013
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:38,220
- We arrived after the time.
- What time is it now?

3014
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:39,750
We should have removed it
right away.

3015
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,050
The time would have passed
even if we had done that.

3016
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:43,790
- Still.
- According to the digital watch,

3017
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,890
it's 3:05:35 p.m...

3018
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:47,630
- right now.
- Did we get it?

3019
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:52,830
(The clock tower's time
doesn't match the real time.)

3020
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,370
- Really?
- Did we get it?

3021
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:56,270
- This is right.
- How did you know?

3022
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:57,300
Is it correct?

3023
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:58,340
(Current time: 3:05 p.m.)

3024
01:33:58,340 --> 01:33:59,910
- Really?
- I...

3025
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:03,680
(They removed the cloth
at exactly 3:05 p.m.)

3026
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:06,880
(30 minutes
before the members arrived)

3027
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:08,980
(The clock broke...)

3028
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:12,350
(in the pouring rain and wind.)

3029
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,050
Jae Seok guessed this right.

3030
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,260
I kept in mind
how long ten minutes were.

3031
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:20,960
He kept saying it was 3 p.m.
as soon as we got out. "How?"

3032
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,760
I had the same in mind.

3033
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:25,060
I have goosebumps. Jinx.

3034
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,500
It's also very similar
to what I thought.

3035
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:29,200
It's exactly as I counted.

3036
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,600
It's almost...

3037
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:31,740
We three are really crazy.

3038
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:33,940
- We three are crazy.
- We three did it.

3039
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:35,240
(The human clocks
did it by their feeling.)

3040
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,440
The idols...

3041
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:39,150
- We three did it.
- He's saying, "We three did it."

3042
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,210
"We three did it."

3043
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:42,820
It's crazy.

3044
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,550
- But...
- You're the best, Jae Seok.

3045
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:46,450
We were lucky. If that bus...

3046
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,190
- Right.
- had just come, we'd have lost.

3047
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:49,320
Pushing that bus was also luck.

3048
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,320
That's right.

3049
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,420
We were lucky that the bus stopped.

3050
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,690
- If we hadn't done that,
- Jae Seok is the best.

3051
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:54,060
- we'd have removed it at 3:04 p.m.
- Right. At 3:04 p.m.

3052
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:57,360
We've arrived at a park
where the walls of the Hanyang Fortress...

3053
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,430
blend beautifully with the forest.
Recently, it appeared...

3054
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:02,300
- That's right. It was there.
- on "KPop Demon Hunters,"

3055
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,040
- It's right here.
- and has become popular...

3056
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,540
- with foreigners as well.
- Really?

3057
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:08,910
Actually, we prepared a penalty...

3058
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:10,580
in case you would fail again.

3059
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,140
But you're exempt from the penalty.

3060
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,180
(All the members
are exempt from the penalty.)

3061
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:16,020
(Sticking out)

3062
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,680
We succeeded.

3063
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,190
- I'm so relieved.
- We did a good job.

3064
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,220
- It could've been dangerous.
- Well done.

3065
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:21,620
- It could've been bad.
- Right.

3066
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:24,120
I will now tell you the results...

3067
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,690
of the citizens' vote...

3068
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,830
- on the photos you took.
- Yes.

3069
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,460
The winner,
with the most votes, is...

3070
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,060
- Yes.
- I bet it's Se Chan.

3071
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,330
(Who is the winner
to get the prize?)

3072
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:34,530
The winner is...

3073
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,040
Is it Jonathan?

3074
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,310
The winner is...

3075
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:41,570
Jong Kook with "A Flower Alley."

3076
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:42,910
(1st place: Kim Jong Kook
with 17 votes)

3077
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:44,210
Jong Kook with "A Flower Alley."

3078
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:45,440
(He even named his work himself.)

3079
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:46,950
- Why?
- I knew it.

3080
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:47,950
- Seriously?
- Why?
What about the flowers?

3081
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:50,320
- What?
- How many votes did it get?

3082
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,650
The thing is, the title
and the photo matched well.

3083
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:54,950
The second place
is "A Healing Smile."

3084
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:56,160
(2nd place: Jae Seok with 12 votes)

3085
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,320
- What was that?
- "A Healing Smile."

3086
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,330
- Really?
- I see.

3087
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:00,390
I'm the one in the photo?

3088
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:01,890
- I took it.
- He had a model.

3089
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:03,830
- It came in second place.
- It was him?

3090
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,630
- "A Healing Smile" was a good one.
- The third place...

3091
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,570
is "We're AI."

3092
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,600
(3rd place: Jonathan with 11 votes)

3093
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:09,600
"We're AI."

3094
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,610
Seok Jin thought
he would win first place.

3095
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:13,940
Seok Jin...

3096
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,840
got only two votes.

3097
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,880
(Jee Seok Jin came in last
with just 2 votes.)

3098
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:19,250
Who's the last?

3099
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:21,280
- I was really...
- Mine is a sensitive work.

3100
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,020
To Kim Jong Kook,
who won first place today,

3101
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:25,520
we will give the prize.

3102
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,890
- It's a box of seasonal pears.
- Nice.

3103
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:29,560
(A box of ripe pears that resemble
Ssaebssaeb's belly)

3104
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,160
- Pears sound nice.
- I love pears.

3105
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,260
Contrary to our expectations,

3106
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,890
- you succeeded twice today.
- That's unbelievable.

3107
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:36,960
- So you only received one penalty.
- Yes!

3108
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,000
- Okay.
- Today,

3109
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,670
you may go home now.

3110
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,330
(All of them get to go home.)

3111
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,200
We are amazing.

3112
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,500
Good work, Jonathan.

3113
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,770
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3114
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:47,310
We did a great job today.

3115
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:49,110
Right. It was amazing.

3116
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:51,480
(The 3 keywords that heated up
Running Man for the past week)

3117
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,050
(The protagonist
of the first keyword)

3118
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:54,380
(Keyword 1: Ji Ye Eun's comeback)

3119
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:56,550
(Crying suddenly)

3120
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:57,550
(Why are you crying again?)

3121
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,720
(I'm getting emotional
to come back after 3 weeks.)

3122
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,290
- Tell us what you want to eat.
- Yangjangpi.

3123
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:02,820
(A healthier body
and a stronger appetite)

3124
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:04,890
(Narrow it down to 3
when I talk to you nicely.)

3125
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,060
(Keyword 2: Young Forty Haha)

3126
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:08,360
(He's dressed like
the Korean Association president.)

3127
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,130
(They keep making fun
of Young Forty Ha.)

3128
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,730
(Find the perfect style for Haha,
