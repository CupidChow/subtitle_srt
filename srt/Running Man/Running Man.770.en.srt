1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,240
Why are we so early today?
What are we doing?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,310
- Why so early?
- I'm sleepy.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,080
You're sleepy, right?
It's just an hour early, but I'm sleepy.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,280
All right. Let's have a seat.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,620
- Ye Eun.
- Haha.

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,790
Sit next to Seok Jin.

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,960
(He refuses.)

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,990
- Come here.
- No.

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,230
- Come here.
- Haha, over there.

11
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,930
- Mister.
- Hurry and come here.

12
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,090
- Mister.
- You...

13
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,730
- Mister, why don't you sit there?
- No.

14
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,370
- He's the new groom.
- I...

15
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,530
(Everyone is reluctant
to sit next to Seok Sam?)

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,140
You're not coming down
with a cold, are you?

17
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,040
Jong Kook,
Seok Jin is coming down with a cold.

18
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,410
- But...
- Really?

19
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,780
- His voice sounded like that.
- Yes.

20
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,140
No. I'm feeling a lot better.

21
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,810
They say I'm coming down
with a cold. Come here, you.

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,480
- He's the new groom.
- I...

23
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,180
- Mister.
- I will have a performance.

24
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,450
- You should sit next to Seok Jin.
- Come here.

25
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,490
- I'll sit here.
- Please excuse me.

26
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,120
- This is what Seok Jin did before.
- My nose is stuffy.

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,990
- When Ji Hyo coughed,
- Yes.

28
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,300
he said,
"Wait. Did you catch a cold?"

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,860
- "Will you stay away from me?"
- He did?

30
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,200
(Last December,
when Ji Hyo caught a cold)

31
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,100
(Sneaking away)

32
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,010
(Now that Ji Hyo has a cold,
Seok Jin is avoiding her.)

33
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,810
(He's the worst.)

34
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,880
(He writhed
in front of his sick friend.)

35
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,880
- Go away.
- We're doing the same thing to you.

36
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,220
- Right. I did that.
- He should suffer too.

37
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,650
It's the mirror therapy.

38
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,490
- Ji Hyo, sit.
- Ji Hyo, lower your head!

39
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,950
- Hey.
- Seok Jin has a cold!

40
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,120
- Don't come here.
- Cold.

41
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,390
- Really?
- That's not true.

42
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,220
- Go in there.
- Ji Hyo.

43
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,060
- What's with her?
- What's with her hair?

44
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,460
Did Ji Hyo and Ye Eun
fight yesterday?

45
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,930
- By the way...
- Why...

46
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,830
- I mean...
- What's with her hair?

47
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,140
- Why is Ye Eun blushing?
- What's that?

48
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,200
Ji Hyo, did you come here
on a motorcycle today?

49
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,940
- Hey.
- You know what?

50
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,140
- She drove Exiv.
- Here.

51
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,210
- You're on Running Man.
- Exiv.

52
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,480
- Why did you two fight?
- Exiv.

53
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,410
- Exiv? That's hilarious.
- What's that?

54
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,850
Did you two not go
to a beauty salon today?

55
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,380
- Hey.
- That hat...

56
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,750
- Hey, look.
- What's that?

57
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,950
What are these cupping marks
on your back?

58
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,990
(Cupping marks on her back)

59
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,990
Why...

60
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,590
(An unusual scene from the opening!)

61
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,100
Hey, the cupping marks...

62
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
- What are they?
- No!

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,470
- Ji Hyo.
- My back is so sore.

64
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,640
- Ji Hyo.
- After showing off your belly,

65
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,740
- you're showing off your back.
- This is my first time seeing this.

66
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,810
- I have a sore back.
- My first time seeing your belly.

67
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,010
Do we have to see
the cupping marks on your back?

68
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,840
You shouldn't have done the cupping.

69
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,210
- Right.
- No cupping.

70
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,450
This gets aired worldwide,
and you got cupped?

71
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,050
That's K-Healthcare.

72
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,790
(Song the Cupped became
the K-Healthcare endorser.)

73
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,520
There's something
you have to fill out...

74
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,420
- before the race begins.
- What?

75
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,290
We came up with a questionnaire
to learn more about...

76
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,900
- your taste.
- Taste.

77
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,930
Really? But you see,

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,930
more than anything,
Jong Kook's wedding is in a week.

79
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,640
- And we still don't know who...
- Stop!

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,370
Why would you keep
mentioning the date?

81
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,740
- Stop mentioning it.
- Wait.

82
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,870
But it will be aired
after the wedding anyway.

83
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,540
- Will it?
- He wouldn't...

84
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,710
He wouldn't tell us
who the bride is.

85
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,980
We don't know anything about her.

86
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,580
Why do you want to know about her?

87
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,820
Even Ronaldo is more open...

88
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,390
about his wedding than you are.

89
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,650
Quiet.

90
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,860
- Quiet!
- It's the biggest secret.

91
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,660
- Quiet.
- He won't tell us a thing.

92
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,290
Quiet. Let's keep it down.

93
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,690
Why would you ask me?

94
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,330
- Should we fill it out?
- Yes.

95
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,630
Put your name down at the top
and fill it out.

96
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,630
- What?
- People...

97
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,670
So many people ask me about it.

98
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,170
"If you could get money
from Jae Seok,"

99
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,000
- "how much would you ask for?"
- "How much would I ask for?"

100
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,170
- About 1,000 dollars.
- From me?

101
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,340
We should get that much.

102
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,040
Why would you ask me for money?

103
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,480
- Is Seok Jin going to ask too?
- No.

104
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,780
Jae Seok's rich, so should I ask...

105
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,580
- for about 5,000 dollars?
- About 6,000 dollars.

106
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,750
Jae Seok, you will write
how much you can give.

107
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,190
- How much I can give?
- Yes.

108
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,750
- Should I fill it out now?
- Yes.

109
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,890
"Who's a character
from a recent movie or drama..."

110
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,960
"that left an impression on you?"

111
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,990
"What's the farthest
you'd trust Ye Eun to drive you?"

112
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,200
"What's your
favorite rest stop menu?"

113
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
I don't want to change my name.

114
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,970
"What part of Seok Jin's outfit
today needs a change?"

115
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,700
"What is my own way
of making memories with Jong Kook?"

116
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,370
"What was my greatest
achievement on Running Man?"

117
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,170
I need to write just one, right?

118
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,980
- Just one answer, right?
- Just one answer.

119
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
"If you were locked up like
in 'Oldboy' and could only eat..."

120
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,680
"one food, what would you eat?"

121
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,780
(If you were locked up like
in 'Oldboy' and could only eat...)

122
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,920
(one food, what would you eat?)

123
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,050
We have to choose well.

124
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,220
When it's about food.

125
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,590
I'm going to be truthful.

126
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,660
I won't think about the race.

127
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,990
- Just one food?
- If you could only eat...

128
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,330
I can't choose between
sundaeguk and stir-fried pork.

129
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,400
- I will choose something realistic.
- Really.

130
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,430
Gosh.

131
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,570
Will we get what we choose?

132
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,300
What did I watch recently?

133
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,440
- Recently...
- What did I watch recently?

134
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,640
I watched "F1" recently.

135
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,810
(Who's a character
from a recent movie or drama...)

136
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,810
(that left an impression on you?)

137
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,380
Brad Pitt aged beautifully.

138
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,550
- I know. His body is...
- He's incredible.

139
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,250
- He's my role model.
- He took care of himself so well.

140
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,620
He's about 5, 6 years older than me.
He was amazing in "F1."

141
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,720
"Low Life." I watched "Low Life."

142
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,360
Yang Se Jong played Hee Dong.

143
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,560
Was it "KPop Demon Hunters?"

144
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,860
Is that where "Soda Pop" is from?

145
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,360
- "KPop Demon Hunters."
- He's my role model.

146
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,700
(Who's a character
that left an impression on you?)

147
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,330
Saja Boys.

148
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,000
In the drama
"When Life Gives You Paint,"

149
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,400
what's the name of the character
Park Bo Gum played?

150
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,270
Park Bo Gum was in it.

151
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,510
But it's supposed to be a character.

152
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,340
What's this?
"What's the farthest..."

153
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,680
"you'd trust Ye Eun to drive you?"

154
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,740
(It's clearly a strange question.)

155
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,110
I think they are
going to make me drive.

156
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,580
Gosh, it should be somewhere near.

157
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,820
"What's the farthest I'd trust
Ye Eun to drive me?"

158
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,450
I don't think she can drive
beyond Seoul.

159
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,720
Wait.

160
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,850
(It seems there's more to it,
but they write the answer down.)

161
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,950
Right, this.

162
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,620
- I wrote everything seriously.
- I did on almost everything.

163
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,560
- You must be done.
- Yes!

164
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,160
Let's share some of your answers.

165
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,930
- Okay.
- The first question was how much...

166
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,370
you wanted to get from Jae Seok.

167
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,800
- How much did you write?
- Me?

168
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,200
I wrote,

169
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,300
"Apgujeong Hyundai Apartment."

170
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,370
(Hyundai Apartment, Apgujeong 195m²)

171
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,580
- I want the 195m² one.
- How...

172
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,710
How does that qualify
as pocket money?

173
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,710
I know you have it.

174
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,380
- You can't go that far.
- But...

175
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,410
You have to write the amount
you are likely to get.

176
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,450
But he can afford it.

177
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,520
Wait. I'm offended,
so I'm going to deduct some.

178
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,050
- You have to stay realistic.
- Right.

179
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,690
I wrote, "20 percent
of his share of Antenna,"

180
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,190
(20 percent of his share of Antenna)

181
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,420
That's nice.

182
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,560
- That's a fair amount.
- That's pocket money?

183
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,860
We need a big sum.

184
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,860
- How about you?
- I wrote 1,000 dollars.

185
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,530
He can afford 1,000 dollars.

186
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,900
- Right.
- Right.

187
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,000
- Right.
- That's a reasonable amount.

188
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,770
- You wrote a realistic amount.
- You were realistic.

189
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,770
I was being realistic too.

190
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,940
(He wants an apartment.)

191
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,010
I wrote...

192
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,840
fifty million dollars.

193
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,380
You wrote fifty million dollars?

194
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,340
That's pocket money?

195
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,050
- That's pocket money?
- I...

196
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,080
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance...

197
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,580
- to get pocket money from him.
- You're being ridiculous.

198
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,450
- I wrote that I would give...
- He gives us money often.

199
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,750
Jong Kook 1,000 dollars,

200
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,290
- Right.
- Daniel 1,000 dollars,

201
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,390
- Ye Eun 1,000 dollars,
- Right.

202
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,390
Ssaebssaeb 1,000 dollars,

203
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,520
- and Ji Hyo 500 dollars.
- Why?

204
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,560
- Why 500 dollars?
- Why just 500 dollars for me?

205
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,760
I think Ji Hyo could do
with about 500 dollars.

206
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,800
(For a strange reason,
it's understandable.)

207
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
- Why would you say that?
- 500 dollars to Ji Hyo.

208
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,530
And I would give Haha 50 dollars.

209
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,570
Hey!

210
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,940
- He wants a 20 percent share.
- You get 50 dollars.

211
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,210
- He's younger.
- Right.

212
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,210
- How about me?
- Right.

213
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,240
I would give Seok Sam 30 dollars.

214
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,340
(Seok Sam 30 dollars)

215
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,880
- Because he's older.
- Just 30 dollars.

216
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,110
- Why would you give us 30 dollars?
- Seok Sam is rich.

217
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,110
Why would you give me 30 dollars?

218
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,950
- Seok Sam's loaded.
- That's not it.

219
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,350
- Ji Hyo...
- He's rich.

220
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,580
- Right.
- runs a company.

221
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,620
- Right.
- Jong Kook is getting married soon,

222
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,720
- so he gets 1,000 dollars.
- Right.

223
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,950
- That's why.
- Nice.

224
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,090
The fourth question was...

225
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,260
"What's the farthest
you'd trust Ye Eun to drive you?"

226
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,800
I haven't driven since then.

227
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,930
(After learning to drive)

228
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,330
Since that time in Suwon?

229
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,070
I'd trust her to drive
from Gangnam to Mapo...

230
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,130
during rush hour, stuck in traffic.

231
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,140
It's still hard.

232
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,600
- It's hard to drive in Gangnam.
- That's very realistic.

233
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,670
- It's really hard.
- Seok Sam.

234
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,770
From my place to Gwacheon.

235
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
- As far as Gwacheon.
- That's far.

236
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,510
- That's far.
- Gwacheon.

237
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,680
I say Seoul.

238
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,110
- Somewhere in Seoul.
- Going to Seoul from here?

239
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,450
She can't drive outside of Seoul.

240
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,080
I wrote the Han River...

241
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,220
Gapyeong?

242
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,980
- You can't get to Gapyeong.
- You can't.

243
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,590
- You will be in big trouble.
- You can't go.

244
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,790
Jong Kook, what did you write?

245
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,260
From home to gym.

246
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,990
(That's a 5-minute distance.)

247
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,990
Perfect.

248
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,160
(Home to gym, 5-minute distance)

249
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,600
- That's a perfect route.
- Right.

250
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,700
It's not hard at all.

251
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,800
- Right.
- Right.

252
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,500
- I say...
- Where?

253
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,830
- Suwon.
- Suwon?

254
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,040
She can take
the Gyeongbu Expressway.

255
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,540
- Suwon is far.
- The Gyeongbu Expressway.

256
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,670
- That's dangerous.
- Why so far?

257
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,940
Once she gets on
the Gyeongbu Expressway,

258
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,170
she can just go straight.

259
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,440
I wrote Daejeon. Daejeon from here.

260
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Wait.

261
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,680
You just want to
go to Daejeon, don't you?

262
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,110
Daejeon was the nearest.

263
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,110
Where is it, Daniel?

264
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,320
- My goodness.
- I think I chose the wrong place.

265
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,980
Busan.

266
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,120
- Hey!
- Hey!

267
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,250
- Busan?
- She can't go to Busan.

268
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,960
How can I go to Busan?

269
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,990
You just want to go to Busan.

270
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,560
I went to Busan a lot
recently for filming. That's why.

271
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,460
- Seriously.
- Why would you write Busan?

272
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,830
Next is the last question,
question number ten.

273
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,630
What's one thing you want
the member next to you...

274
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,240
- to fix before the year ends?
- Okay.

275
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,570
- Let's share the answers.
- I wrote it truthfully.

276
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,940
(Question 10)

277
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,910
- Is he the member next to me?
- Yes.

278
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,580
- How about me?
- The one sitting next to me now.

279
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,480
- Do we go with the right side?
- Let's go with the right side.

280
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,810
- This is the hardest.
- Last time...

281
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,150
(What's one thing you want
the member next to you...)

282
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,250
I will write truthfully.

283
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,890
(to fix before the year ends?)

284
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,090
We have to be honest.

285
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,490
(What sincere words did they
put down for one another?)

286
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,690
You go first.

287
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,430
"Se Chan, don't date secretly.
Tell us if you are dating."

288
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,330
"Gosh, Kim Jong Kook."

289
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,660
"I know you have a girlfriend."

290
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,700
"Tell us who she is."

291
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,000
- That's for me?
- What is that?

292
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,100
What is that?

293
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,240
I don't want him...

294
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,070
- to keep secrets from us.
- Something you want him to fix.

295
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,110
- Right.
- I don't have a girlfriend.

296
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,940
He should tell us
and not keep it a secret.

297
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,140
You should write something
you want him to fix.

298
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,910
This is what I want him to fix.

299
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,950
(It's what he wants
Seok Jin to fix.)

300
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,520
"If you have the cold,
be a good, considerate man..."

301
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,550
"and take a week off."

302
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,090
"If you have the cold,
be a good, considerate man..."

303
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,150
"and take a week off."

304
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,320
(Exposing Mr. Nasal Voice openly)

305
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,730
- Be a good man.
- Read the room.

306
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,800
Be considerate.

307
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,330
- Right.
- Great.

308
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,770
- Be considerate.
- Right.

309
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,570
- Nice.
- That felt so good.

310
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,170
- This is hilarious.
- Great.

311
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,370
I truly hope he will gain
about five kilograms.

312
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,910
- You should put on five kilograms.
- That's just right.

313
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,280
- Five kilograms isn't easy.
- Five kilograms.

314
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,080
- It's easy.
- You can gain muscle.

315
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,480
- Now...
- You can gain muscle.

316
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,780
- This is what I want for Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

317
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,850
For her health,
she should drink moderately.

318
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,220
Drinking in moderation is great.

319
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,950
- You should drink in moderation.
- Right.

320
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,860
This is what I want Ye Eun to do
before this year ends.

321
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,260
I want her to reevaluate Se Chan
and date him.

322
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,460
(Ji Hyo to Ye Eun)

323
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,000
Why would you write such a thing?

324
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,060
- What is that?
- That came from nowhere.

325
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,230
- Why...
- What?

326
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,370
How did that come about?

327
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,200
- How did that come about?
- But...

328
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,070
For the very first time,
Ye Eun is giving Ji Hyo a look.

329
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,570
- She's going,
- "What the..."

330
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,010
"What is this girl saying?"

331
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,040
(They are like real sisters.)

332
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,740
- What did you write, Ye Eun?
- I wrote,

333
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,380
"I want him to be quick-witted."

334
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,550
(Ye Eun to Daniel)

335
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,520
- You need to be quick-witted.
- It's important.

336
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,820
What are you talking about?

337
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,990
Daniel is slow-witted.

338
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,490
It's because he's got small eyes.

339
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,920
- Ye Eun is seriously...
- He's got small eyes.

340
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
- I'm quick-witted.
- Look at him.

341
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,490
- I should show you.
- He's ridiculous.

342
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,930
He's ridiculous.
He thinks he's quick-witted.

343
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,200
What did you write, Daniel?

344
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,570
I thought about what I should write,
so I wrote something simple.

345
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,100
"Wearing colorful clothes."

346
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,970
- That's a good one.
- Right.

347
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,100
- Right.
- Good one.

348
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,240
- He always wears gym clothes.
- He's a fool.

349
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,670
He always wears black.

350
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,110
Jong Kook, I'm really curious.

351
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,480
Does your fiancée also wear black?

352
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,980
(Does your fiancée also wear black?)

353
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,880
Or maybe she only wears white.

354
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,020
I shouldn't buy any more clothes.

355
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,220
I'll have to buy her clothes.

356
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,890
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

357
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,490
- The newlywed!
- He's changed.

358
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,790
Goodness.

359
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,890
"A Man."

360
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,060
He's a sweet man.

361
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,360
Let's see if it goes that way.

362
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,730
- Let's see.
- We will see.

363
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,630
Lastly, Jong Kook,
what do you want Haha to fix?

364
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,700
I...

365
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,430
I want him to fix how
the restaurant income is split.

366
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,570
(Jong Kook to Haha)

367
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,710
That's not it.

368
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,940
That's not it.

369
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,380
I invested money.

370
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,510
How can I not get a cent in return?

371
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,350
I gave you a cent.

372
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,480
Fans will believe you
and message me.

373
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,350
I will pay you
if the meal kit sells successfully.

374
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,490
(I will pay you
if the meal kit sells successfully.)

375
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,760
(A happy partnership
built on friendship)

376
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,860
We will take the papers.

377
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,060
Please collect them.

378
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,360
Why did we write this?

379
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,660
(Why did we write this?)

380
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
For no reason.

381
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,100
(They finished
answering all 10 questions.)

382
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,730
- What are we doing today?
- It's going to be fun.

383
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,570
- I'll tell you the rules for today.
- Yes.

384
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,470
Today's race is
Go Straight With Your Answer.

385
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,470
What is that?

386
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,480
From the answers you've just given,

387
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,380
you must carry out the sentence
that is made,

388
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,920
- drawn at random.
- What is that?

389
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,050
- What?
- What's that?

390
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,390
You don't know
where you're going today.

391
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,590
So you gathered earlier than usual.

392
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,420
It will go on from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.

393
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,890
If you fail to complete
the mission within the given time,

394
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,160
- everyone will be punished.
- No.

395
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
- We're a team.
- We can pull it off, though.

396
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,530
If we get Busan, it's game over.

397
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,770
(The Time Attack Race
with a huge penalty on the line)

398
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,940
Didn't you notice
anything strange...

399
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,400
while filling out the questionnaire?

400
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,940
- Color.
- Color.

401
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,040
- Right.
- Right.

402
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,210
I'm sure some of you noticed
that each question was...

403
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,050
- in different colors.
- Yes.

404
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,750
- Oh, my.
- We'll put up a board for you.

405
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,010
So that's how this works.

406
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,420
- No way.
- Where, what, how,

407
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,820
with whom, and why.

408
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,150
Hold on a second.

409
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,150
(There are 5 squares
in different colors.)

410
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,920
- This sounds like fun.
- This will be the hardest.

411
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,620
There was a question with a color...

412
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,530
that matched one of the squares.

413
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,530
You will choose
one of the answers...

414
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,870
and complete the sentence,
which will be your task today.

415
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,100
- It'll all be random today.
- Here we go.

416
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,470
Everything will be random.

417
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,470
This is a tough one.

418
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,180
Anyway, the first square
labeled "where..."

419
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,810
will be today's destination.

420
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,580
It's the question about Ye Eun.

421
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,850
- We might have to go to Busan.
- Oh, no. I put down Busan.

422
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,950
We might have to go to Busan.

423
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,990
What if Busan gets chosen?

424
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,050
- The square is blue.
- Sure.

425
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,160
- Here's the question.
- What was it again?

426
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,560
"What's your favorite dish to eat
at a rest stop?"

427
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,460
It doesn't have a location.
Oh, I get it.

428
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,100
- You will choose one...
- The restaurant?

429
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,770
- of the answers,
- I like it.

430
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,640
and you'll go to where
that dish is best known.

431
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,110
Where it's famous?
Not the rest stop?

432
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,010
We need to go to Cheonan
if we wrote walnut cake.

433
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,510
There are so many options.

434
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,720
(They must go wherever
that dish takes them.)

435
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,850
What about rice cake
and sausage skewer?

436
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,980
What about grilled potatoes?

437
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,490
- This is bad.
- Oh, my.

438
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,290
First of all, Jae Seok wrote...

439
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,720
- walnut cake.
- Yes, walnut cake.

440
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,460
- Where?
- If that's chosen,

441
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,060
you'll go to Cheonan
since the city is best known for it.

442
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,160
That'll be a problem.

443
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,660
We can't even guess
since it'll be random.

444
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,160
This is bad.

445
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,800
Seok Jin wrote...

446
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,430
- doughnut with red beans.
- That's right.

447
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,640
- Where is it best known?
- You'll go to Daejeon,

448
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,440
the city known for buns.

449
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,470
(From Seoul to Daejeon:
2 hours and 30 minutes by car)

450
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,270
- Sungsimdang in Daejeon.
- Sungsimdang?

451
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,280
All the way to Daejeon?
That won't be easy.

452
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,310
Ji Hyo wrote three dishes.

453
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,580
Pork cutlet, ramyeon,
and silken tofu stew.

454
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,620
- If pork cutlet is chosen...
- She wrote three?

455
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,050
- Pork cutlet is delicious.
- Where do we go?

456
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,920
- You'll be going...
- Mount Nam?

457
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,720
- to Mount Nam.
- I love it.

458
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,190
- No way!
- That's the best option.

459
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,930
- Nice.
- Mount Nam is way better.

460
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,630
- Go, Mount Nam.
- Nice.

461
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,630
Daniel and Haha wrote ramyeon.

462
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,670
- Where for ramyeon?
- If ramyeon...

463
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,670
- is chosen,
- Japan?

464
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,670
- you'll go to the Han River.
- Yes.

465
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,300
- Nice!
- The Han River.

466
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,070
The Han River is a great one.

467

Jong Kook wrote...

468
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,280
- a cafeteria meal.
- That's right.

469
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,080
That will take you
to a Korean restaurant in Jongno.

470
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,580
- Nice.
- That's a good one.

471
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,580
- I love it.
- Not bad.

472
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,380
- Jongno's a good one.
- Ye Eun wrote grilled potatoes.

473
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,520
- That'll take you...
- Where?

474
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,590
- to Gangwon Province.
- Gangwon Province, of course.

475
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,820
Gangwon Province is famous
for its potatoes.

476
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,060
- Gangwon Province?
- That's too far away.

477
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,260
- That's bad.
- It's totally random.

478
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,830
Se Chan wrote ramyeon
and Chungmu gimbap.

479
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,160
- Are we going to Chungmu?
- If that's chosen,

480
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,830
- Chungmu gimbap...
- Chungmuro.

481
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,400
- Tongyeong?
- You'll be going to Tongyeong.

482
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,540
(If Chungmu gimbap is chosen,)

483
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,170
(they'll go to Tongyeong
which is 5 hours away.)

484
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,540
No way.

485
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,910
- Tongyeong?
- Did you have...

486
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,980
- to write that down?
- No way.

487
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,350
Tongyeong... Sorry about that.

488
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,980
- We can't make it there.
- It's too far away.

489
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,720
We'll have to take the train
with Kyeong Hwan.

490
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,060
- You punk.
- You punk.

491
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,160
- By the way.
- By the way.

492
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,090
- We have to keep it in Seoul.
- That's too far away.

493
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,600
- Mount Nam or Jongno.
- This is so random.

494
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,830
We need to get ramyeon.

495
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,830
- This will be tough.
- It's so random, though.

496
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,830
Get ramyeon.

497
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,870
The answers you gave
have been written down.

498
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,470
(Their answers were transferred
to pieces of paper.)

499
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,110
You will choose one of these...

500
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,580
to complete the sentence
for "where."

501
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,710
- Who's going to pick it?
- You'd better do a good job.

502
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,820
We can't afford to get Tongyeong.

503
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
- That'll take us five hours.
- Okay.

504
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,090
The nasal voice or groom?

505
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,690
- No, I won't do it.
- Daniel?

506
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,060
- Haha, you do it.
- Me?

507
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,190
- The nasal voice.
- Daniel is usually lucky.

508
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,890
How about Mr. Nasal Voice?

509
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,900
- I'll do it.
- No, don't!

510
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,500
- I'll do it.
- You shouldn't.

511
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,700
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Daniel is luckier.

512
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,970
- I'm lucky with draws.
- He's usually lucky.

513
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,030
- I mean it.
- Yes, Daniel.

514
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,470
- Just so you know,
- I'm lucky with draws.

515
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,900
you'll be going to Tongyeong,
if that's what you choose.

516
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,310
- Got it.
- No backsies.

517
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,870
- Then...
- I can't go to Tongyeong.

518
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,480
In that case, we have to go there.

519
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,110
If we go to Tongyeong,
you can ride our ship.

520
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,750
- In Tongyeong...
- Hey!

521
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,880
The passenger ship.

522
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,910
Right, it's in Tongyeong.

523
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,980
Right, in Tongyeong!

524
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,550
Don't be serious.

525
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,920
She wasn't kidding.
She'll let us ride her ship.

526
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,850
Let's go there.

527
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,190
She wasn't kidding!

528
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,990
- You can ride our ship.
- That's just wrong.

529
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,060
You weren't kidding.

530
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,430
We can go ride her ship.

531
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,100
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- No resenting.

532
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,260
- No resenting.
- Will the loser pick it?

533
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,470
- If you win, you can sit it out.
- The winner?

534
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,500
- I don't want to do this.
- I don't want to either.

535
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,840
- I'm always unlucky.
- Only join if you want to do it.

536
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,140
- I'm unlucky.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

537
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,640
(Win, lose)

538
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,610
Hold on. Why do you want to do it?

539
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,580
- He shouldn't.
- Don't.

540
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,110
- You stay out of it.
- It's already too late.

541
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,540
- I lost.
- Why do you want to do it?

542
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,580
- Come on.
- Go ahead.

543
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,780
- I can't believe him.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

544
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,050
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Don't let it be Jae Seok.

545
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,250
- Why do you want to do it?
- He shouldn't win.

546
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,620
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Why?

547
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,590
- Why did you win?
- I can't believe you.

548
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,660
- I'm nervous.
- Jae Seok, go ahead.

549
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,830
- Please...
- Picking Tongyeong...

550
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,230
will be a disaster. Jae Seok.

551
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,160
Jae Seok will choose.

552
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,560
I ended up winning.

553
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,570
- Pick Tongyeong!
- Pick and reveal that square.

554
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,370
- Sure. Can it be any one of these?
- Yes.

555
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,740
Jae Seok, please.
Don't choose Tongyeong.

556
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,270
Some of us have other work
after this.

557
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,180
Jae Seok, please.
Did you already pick one?

558
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,210
(He chose one
without giving it much thought!)

559
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,950
Do we check this first?

560
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,710
- Do we check this first?
- Go ahead.

561
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,720
- Where?
- Jae Seok, wait.

562
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,850
Do we have to go there...

563
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,020
even if it means
we'll wrap up at night?

564
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,290
- Of course.
- Yes, you must go.

565
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,750
- Exactly.
- All of you will then...

566
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,820
receive a penalty.

567
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,290
("Where" is that important.)

568
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,960
- Where.
- The location.

569
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,730
(There's a 50-percent chance
the location will be in Seoul.)

570
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,870
- Please.
- One, two...

571
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,970
- Walnut cake.
- Cheonan.

572
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,300
- Cheonan?
- Is it Cheonan?

573
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,270
(Walnut cake in Cheonan)

574
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,940
Cheonan?

575
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,540
Cheonan?

576
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,850
(Cheonan which is
1 hour and 30 minutes away by car)

577
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,250
- Walnut cake.
- Cheonan.

578
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,620
- Cheonan?
- Today, you'll be going to Cheonan.

579
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,450
- Cheonan isn't so bad.
- It's not the worst.

580
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,920
- Cheonan.
- Yes, we lucked out.

581
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,090
I thought we'd get Tongyeong.
Cheonan's pretty far away, but...

582
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,830
- Cheonan isn't so bad.
- Compared to that...

583
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,260
I've been meaning to go to Cheonan.

584
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,060
Doesn't it take
about two hours to get there?

585
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,260
That being said, you'll head
to your destination,

586
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,300
- which is Cheonan.
- Cheonan is our location.

587
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,670
You can drive there...

588
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,140
- or take the train.
- Let's drive.

589
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,240
It won't take long on a train.

590
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,340
I think a train would be better.

591
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,240
Isn't Suseo Station nearby?

592
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,350
- Yes.
- It'll take about an hour.

593
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,810
- Suseo Station?
- Check the schedule,

594
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,720
and we'll help you
book your tickets if needed.

595
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,320
We'll have to go to the station
and then wait for the train.

596
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,120
There will be a lot of traffic.

597
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,990
It takes an hour and a half
to Cheonan Station by car.

598
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,430
- Cheonan Station.
- When's the train?

599
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,660
- The train.
- Check the train schedule?

600
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,330
Can you check
the train schedule for us?

601
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,000
We checked,

602
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,600
and the 10:20 a.m. train is available.

603
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,870
That sounds better
than driving there.

604
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,610
- Taking the train is better.
- The train is better.

605
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,240
- Let's go.
- Let's take the train.

606
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,510
- Can you book it for us?
- Will do.

607
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,350
Don't forget that you must drive...

608
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,080
- to Suseo Station.
- Sure.

609
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,310
- Got it.
- Don't worry.

610
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,880
- Let's go.
- We're off to Cheonan.

611
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,020
- How long does it take?
- About 20 to 30 minutes.

612
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,150
- Gosh, it's humid.
- We should hurry.

613
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,520
It's so hot.

614
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,660
Last night was incredibly humid.

615
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,790
- Right?
- It was so hot.

616
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,890
I played soccer yesterday, and...
My gosh.

617
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,960
Let's hop in.

618
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,860
- Hurry up.
- Hold on.

619
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,170
- We don't have much time.
- How do we all fit in here?

620
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,400
We don't have a lot of time.
Where's the car key? Wait.

621
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,840
Are we taking the 10 a.m. train?

622
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,970
Where's Daniel?

623
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,170
- Daniel!
- It's so hot.

624
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,640
- I think he went to the restroom.
- Daniel!

625
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,040
- He went to the restroom.
- The restroom.

626
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,910
- Daniel.
- Daniel!

627
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,940
Where did Daniel go?

628
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,750
- Unbelievable.
- Read the room, will you?

629
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,210
- Read the room.
- Be wiser.

630
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,380
- Ye Eun's right.
- I can't believe him.

631
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,450
- Right?
- Daniel, you...

632
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,320
Someone call him.

633
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,150
- This one, Ji Hyo?
- We have to hurry...

634
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,720
- if we're to make it to Cheonan.
- I can't see.

635
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,760
We're really short on time.
Isn't it the 10 a.m. train?

636
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,460
- No, the 10:20 a.m. train.
- The 10:20 a.m. train.

637
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,560
The 10:20 a.m. train?

638
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,660
- We've got time.
- We're not short on time.

639
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,960
By the way, we'll choose...

640
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
- "with whom" in Cheonan.
- I'm sorry to ask,

641
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,070
- Didn't you write Brad Pitt?
- but can you...

642
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,870
- get out that way?
- We'll have no choice but to fail.

643
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,100
- Exactly.
- I wrote Gwan Sik.

644
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,310
- Who's that?
- "When Life Gives You Tangerines."

645
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,680
As for me...

646
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,080
Maybe we'll have to find
someone named Gwan Sik.

647
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,010
(Jong Kook thinks they must find
someone with the same name.)

648
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,210
That's a possibility.

649
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,780
- I don't think we'll find anyone.
- What if...

650
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,150
- we need to eat something?
- I wrote Saja Boys.

651
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,590
(No one will have that name.)

652
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,690
- They sang "Soda Pop."
- In the series "Low Life..."

653
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,520
I wrote Hee Dong for my answer.

654
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,390
Do you think we'll have to look
for someone with that name?

655
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,690
Why did you write Hee Dong?

656
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,060
- Who's Hee Dong?
- In the series "Low Life,"

657
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,500
he appears as one of the characters.

658
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,430
Where? Is it this van?

659
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,670
(The tardy member appears.)

660
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,970
- Daniel, come on!
- Sorry.

661
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,440
- Seriously, Daniel?
- Hear me out.

662
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,110
I went to the restroom and...

663
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,380
- Just get in.
- Get in already!

664
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,180
- Get in before you speak.
- Read the room, will you?

665
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,280
- Fasten your seat belts.
- I went to the restroom.

666
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,310
- And?
- What happened?

667
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,380
- Your seat belt.
- The water wouldn't flush.

668
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,720
- What?
- Really?

669
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,750
I managed to flush it, though.

670
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,950
That's enough.
Stop talking about toilets.

671
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,720
Let's head out for now.

672
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,890
Let's go!

673
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,130
(They head to Suseo Station
with the member that arrived late.)

674
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,230
- This is Wirye.
- Should I open the window?

675
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,560
I went to a camping site
in Wirye last week,

676
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,370
and I really enjoyed it.

677
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,200
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

678
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,970
You've been going to places
you don't usually go.

679
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,240
- It was for a show.
- With your future wife?

680
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,570
I went with Sun Ho's son
and Shorry's daughter.

681
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,140
It was my chance
to experience life with kids.

682
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,780
Daughters are much easier to handle.

683
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,810
Really?

684
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,980
- Why?
- Daughters are cuter.

685
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,650
Jong Kook,
are you already planning...

686
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,880
- Are they easier?
- to have kids?

687
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,550
Yes, that was the concept.

688
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,190
Was she easier or just cuter?

689
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,550
Easier and cuter.

690
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,390
- Really?
- Daughters are calmer, right?

691
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,230
Boys can be so wild.

692
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,960
- Boys throw things.
- You were a boy too.

693
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,000
Tell me about it.

694
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,130
Anyway, I should definitely
have one kid at least.

695
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,370
You can throw them into a pool.

696
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,470
It was easier
to play with them in a pool.

697
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,540
- You can throw them in.
- Exactly.

698
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,440
Seok Jin, you've gained some weight.

699
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,140
I weigh more than I ever have.

700
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,410
Right? Your cheeks are super chubby.

701
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,480
I weigh 76kg.

702
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,780
- Really?
- What happened?

703
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,650
- Everything's too delicious.
- Why did you gain so much weight?

704
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,590
It has me worried.
I need to slim down a bit.

705
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,690
You should.

706
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,090
I like seeing you a little chubby.

707
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,390
You look a lot like Ha Ryong.

708
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,830
- Hey.
- Ha Ryong.

709
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,730
- Don't you love him?
- What did you say?

710
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,230
- I like him, but...
- You adore him.

711
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,860
- He's a senior I respect.
- Ha Ryong?

712
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,000
He called me the other day.

713
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,170
- Why?
- To ask for a wedding invitation.

714
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,870
- That's how Ha Ryong is.
- He goes anywhere...

715
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,540
- and everywhere.
- He never misses an event.

716
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,180
I went to Ha Ryong's son's wedding.

717
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,650
- You went.
- Young Sik.

718
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,780
Hey, you...

719
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,450
It'll be hard
to reduce the guest list.

720
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,420
That's why I took you off the list.

721
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,990
(Oh, okay...)

722
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,320
- Good for you.
- "Oh, okay."

723
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,460
"Oh, okay."

724
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,860
Seok Jin's flustered.

725
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,330
- He's shaking his right leg.
- I hope you understand.

726
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,300
I'm glad you brought it up.

727
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,870
It was a huge headache.

728
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,900
- I'll just go anyway.
- I'm glad you brought it up.

729
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,810
Jong Kook's wedding... Years ago...

730
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,880
- Jong Kook and I played a game.
- Chicken.

731
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,410
- Not chicken, a flatfish tail.
- A fish.

732
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,080
- Was it?
- You gave me a fish's tail.

733
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,450
At your wedding,
instead of a pocket square,

734
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,920
- Yes, you said you'd use that.
- I said I'd wear that.

735
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Oh, really?

736
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,490
- People posted that everywhere.
- I know.

737
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,060
(12 long years ago)

738
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,160
(Take it!)

739
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,190
(Thank you!)

740
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,700
(When you get married,)

741
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,800
(I'll wear this here.)

742
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,330
Hey, shouldn't you wear it, then?

743
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,830
- You should.
- You should.

744
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,700
I can't put an actual flatfish tail
in my chest pocket.

745
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,840
- Get a dried one.
- A flatfish?

746
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,710
- A flatfish-shaped...
- Yes.

747
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,670
- handkerchief or something.
- Yes.

748
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,840
Get something made.

749
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,910
(He really did.)

750
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,710
Thanks for trying to keep your word.

751
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,650
- I bless you so much.
- Seriously.

752
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,650
Of course.

753
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,920
My algorithm keeps showing
"Jong Kook's successful revenge."

754
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,350
It drove me insane.

755
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,350
You, at least...

756
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,660
Everyone I meet mentions it.

757
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,260
- I wasn't going to tell you.
- I know.

758
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,190
I waited ten years
to get back at you.

759
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,600
- To do that?
- Yes.

760
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,430
- It's been ten years already?
- You keep a grudge.

761
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,900
We're at Suseo Station!

762
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,930
- Jeong Hwa...
- Hey!

763
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,240
(They chatted their way
to the station.)

764
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,900
- Let's go!
- Is that the station?

765
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,940
- Thank you.
- Okay.

766
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,510
- Okay!
- Okay. Let's get out.

767
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,240
Okay.

768
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,810
Let's quickly head to Suseo Station.

769
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,410
- Run.
- We're getting out.

770
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,250
This is my first time
at Suseo Station.

771
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,050
- Don't lie.
- Move the car first.

772
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,820
I've never taken a train from here.

773
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,550
- For real?
- It's my first trip from Suseo.

774
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,720
It's exciting to be
at a train station after so long.

775
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,830
Yes, it's nice.
It feels like we're traveling.

776
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,690
Why would you be excited?
What's there to be excited about?

777
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,000
You punk.

778
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,670
Gosh, this is amazing.

779
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,530
Suseo Station is well-equipped.

780
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,940
- Is it your first time here?
- Yes.

781
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,340
Is this where you take the SRT?

782
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,740
It's the SRT station.

783
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,540
- Do you remember this place?
- What place?

784
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,740
When the SRT service opened.

785
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,710
- Yes, right. We were here.
- We filmed here.

786
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,450
- We leased a train.
- When there were no customers.

787
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,550
I remember that.

788
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,550
(September, 2016)

789
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,520
(They filmed at Suseo Station
9 years ago even before it opened.)

790
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,790
It's exciting to be
at a train station.

791
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,660
It's nice to go somewhere.

792
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,890
Seok Jin was here twice,
and he kept saying...

793
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,130
it was his first time.

794
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,700
- This is my first time.
- I was here before.

795
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,970
- Seok Jin. We were here...
- Yes.

796
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,930
even before it officially opened.

797
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,400
- Right.
- Now you say "right?"

798
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,770
Why do I want to eat everything
I see at a station?

799
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,280
- Like what?
- I'd like a donut.

800
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,310
From Krispy?

801
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,350
- Hey.
- Over there.

802
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,810
- The Korean snacks look good.
- That's too much.

803
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,050
The Korean snacks look good.

804
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,180
It's too much.

805
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,820
(They pass everything by
to catch the train.)

806
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,950
Look at the old man.

807
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,860
Look at the old man.

808
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,860
Hello.

809
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,830
- Watch behind you.
- Behind you.

810
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,490
- The robot.
- Hi.

811
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,830
- The robot...
- It's evading us.

812
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,000
That's amazing.

813
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,100
- Sorry. Bye.
- Hey.

814
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,200
- Good.
- Did you see it evade me?

815
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,940
No way.

816
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,070
(Giggling)

817
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,870
- What is it?
- Do we go that way?

818
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,010
- I feel embarrassed.
- Did you see it evade me?

819
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,510
I'm embarrassed.

820
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,780
You seem pleased to be here.

821
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,250
- I love it.
- Why are you so excited?

822
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,720
I'm loving this so much.

823
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,190
It's great fun.

824
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,360
I should've bought a few donuts.

825
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,090
Donuts.

826
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,960
Wait, don't we have time to kill?

827
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,530
- We do.
- Then why...

828
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,260
come here already when it's hot?

829
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,700
Let's go back upstairs.

830
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,170
- Hey.
- It's hot.

831
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,240
- Aren't we early?
- What time's the train?

832
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,540
I think the train will pull in
at around 10:30 a.m.

833
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,810
- At 10:30 a.m.?
- It's delayed.

834
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,080
(The train will come
10 minutes later than scheduled.)

835
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,150
We have to wait here for 30 minutes.

836
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,450
- For real?
- Yes.

837
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,350
- We must wait 30 minutes?
- I can't wait here that long.

838
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,520
- We should've driven there.
- Exactly.

839
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,050
Then we'd be on our way.

840
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,090
- Why did you lose?
- We'd have left...

841
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,920
- Your opinion...
- There was too much opposition.

842
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,560
- I was against too many.
- No.

843
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,360
- We're going back up?
- There were four...

844
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,890
- on our team. Yes.
- Were there?

845
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,630
(Ye Eun's logic beat him for once.)

846
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,960
- We'd have...
- Why did you lose?

847
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,170
We'd have covered a third of the way
by now if we'd decided to drive.

848
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,230
Yes.

849
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,940
You said driving
would be inefficient.

850
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,910
Where should we drop by?

851
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,440
- Shall we sit over there?
- Sounds good.

852
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,240
- Shall we eat something?
- Gosh.

853
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,080
I like the benches here.

854
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,550
Let's play rock-paper-scissors
for some snacks.

855
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,520
- Shall we?
- I'll go.

856
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
With Ye Eun.

857
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,960
(The Free Meals Couple
goes on their errand.)

858
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,360
Seok Jin's checking
the stock market.

859
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,590
Don't check on your stocks.

860
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,830
(Startled)

861
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,530
He's checking his stocks
during filming.

862
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,600
You'd have been filmed
if this were the National Assembly.

863
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,700
The National Assembly...

864
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,540
Watch out.
There are cameras everywhere.

865
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,040
You bought gimbap?

866
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,540
It's really good.
It's crazy popular. Look at it.

867
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,810
You have a hearty appetite.

868
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,810
This is good.

869
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,780
(Checking the time)

870
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,180
I think we should go.

871
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,280
Let's stay a bit longer.

872
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,420
We must go at 10:20 a.m.

873
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,950
- What time is it now?
- It's 10:20 a.m.

874
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,150
We must hurry.

875
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,760
- What if...
- The train comes in at 10:20 a.m.

876
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,860
- Let's all stand up.
- Is it time?

877
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,990
One, two, three.

878
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,530
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

879
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,530
Shall we go?

880
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,860
Let's go!

881
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,630
That's where we board.

882
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,500
(Double Unit, 18, Car Number)

883
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,770
- Hi.
- Hello.

884
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,540
This is it.

885
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,510
Gosh. I haven't been
on a train in so long.

886
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,280
Hello.

887
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,350
Hello.

888
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,610
Seats 11 and 12.

889
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,550
Hello.

890
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,150
(They're excited
about the train trip.)

891
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,290
- This is it.
- It's really nice.

892
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,860
I'll sit over here.

893
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,430
- It's a bit...
- Gosh.

894
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,160
Do you know we'll go backward?

895
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,100
Oh, really? Then I'll sit here.

896
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,170
I can't handle going backward.

897
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,040
- Hello.
- This row goes backward.

898
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,440
This row?

899
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,440
- Seok Jin.
- Leave it.

900
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,140
- Sit back down.
- You chose your seat.

901
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,410
It can't be helped.

902
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,750
- Sit back down.
- You chose your seat.

903
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,410
- It can't be helped.
- We must be quiet now.

904
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,250
- Hey.
- Seok Jin...

905
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,290
- He has to go backward.
- Darn you.

906
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,750
You said you'd go backward.

907
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,420
(Laughing out loud)

908
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,600
- Ma'am. Are you all right?
- Gosh.

909
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,130
You wanted to look good.

910
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,800
I get the look you were going for.

911
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,130
- I don't look good, though.
- No.

912
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,040
I get what you were aiming for.

913
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,070
You look so much older.

914
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,910
Not that, but he did gain weight.

915
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,540
- Jong Kook.
- The extra weight...

916
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,550
Haha posted a photo of his new look.

917
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,810
Someone asked
if he were a thin Shin Gi Ru.

918
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,980
(A rough-looking Shin Gi Ru)

919
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,990
- A thin Shin Gi Ru.
- I get it.

920
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,720
I get what hairstyle you wanted.

921
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,990
I get how you wanted to dress.

922
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,890
I say this in all seriousness.

923
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,630
- I don't get it.
- I wore that nine years ago.

924
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,500
Doesn't your son say anything...

925
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,770
about how you dress?

926
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,940
- My son and I got different tastes.
- You don't talk?

927
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,510
- He dresses like you.
- We have similar tastes.

928
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,440
- He's just like you.
- Yes. Gym rats are like us.

929
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,410
For example, the shoes I wear.

930
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,810
- Stuff from Balenciaga.
- Yes.

931
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,810
- He's too ashamed to wear them.
- It's embarrassing.

932
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,380
- He's weird.
- I can't do that.

933
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,750
- He's more like my son.
- He's like you.

934
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,780
- He's frugal.
- He dresses like you all the time.

935
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,790
"Care more about how you dress."
"It's fine."

936
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,790
That's cool.

937
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,560
He grew up to be a nice young man.

938
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,990
What I find fascinating is,

939
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,900
- Kids are like that.
- I realize how fast time is...

940
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,830
- when I see your kids grow.
- Right.

941
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,000
- My son's in university.
- Yes.

942
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,970
Jae Seok, when you only had Ji Ho,

943
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,800
- he was just a baby.
- Yes.

944
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,370
And Hyun Woo was small...

945
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,910
- when I first met him.
- Right.

946
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,680
- Right.
- It's weird to think they've grown.

947
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,480
I won't be able to stand it
if my son likes luxury brands.

948
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,320
Do you want a boy or a girl?

949
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,920
"Where did he get his taste from?"

950
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,790
Do you want a boy or a girl?

951
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,560
- Girls are easier to raise.
- Yes.

952
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,920
It's so fast.

953
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,960
We'll be there in no time.

954
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,860
- Cheonan.
- This is nice.

955
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,160
Aren't your parents overjoyed?

956
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,000
They're just pleased.

957
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,470
- They would be.
- They are.

958
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,710
They're pleased and happy,

959
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,910
but they'll also feel
somewhat bittersweet.

960
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,310
- I get it.
- Yes.

961
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,050
- You were always there for them.
- Yes.

962
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,810
- Now you have your own family.
- Yes.

963
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,250
That's why it'll feel like...

964
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,520
No, Jong Kook. It'll be fun.

965
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,150
Yes, of course. It'll be the same.

966
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,160
It's the same. Life is just...

967
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,790
I thought he'd marry someone
who was as crazy...

968
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,060
- about working out as he was.
- No.

969
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,970
- Not at all.
- That's fascinating.

970
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,370
Does she accept
and understand your routine?

971
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,570
She has to. That's my livelihood.

972
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,610
I love to drink so much,

973
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,410
but my wife can't drink at all.

974
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,680
I dreamed of sitting across
from my wife over a drink.

975
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,310
- It's best if only one is into it.
- Yes.

976
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,720
- That balances things out.
- It does.

977
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,450
- That's how you keep going.
- Yes.

978
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
How about...

979
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,090
- Gi Ru.
- What?

980
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,390
That's him.

981
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,560
Hey, watch out.

982
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,460
(Things falling)

983
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,990
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

984
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,400
- Oh, no.
- Ji Ye Eun.

985
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,560
My gosh...

986
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,170
- Sorry.
- "Sorry."

987
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,470
- I'll clean it up.
- Okay.

988
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,840
- Thanks. I'll clean it up.
- No, it's fine.

989
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,570
Thank you.

990
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,810
My goodness.

991
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,710
When I become a dad,
I have to clean up after them.

992
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,950
- Of course.
- Yes.

993
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,580
It's cute when it's a kid.

994
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,320
It's cute if it's a kid.

995
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,520
- Jong Kook's dreaming happily.
- Yes.

996
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,850
- Jong Kook.
- Hey.

997
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,250
He's living in dreamland.

998
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,060
- Do you need more?
- One sheet's enough.

999
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,260
Have a daughter.

1000
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,290
- Yes, that would be nice.
- Have a girl.

1001
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,300
It's so pretty.

1002
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,730
(The scenery changed
as they were talking.)

1003
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,530
Ye Eun, you need to find a nice guy.

1004
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,930
(Now they offer Ye Eun advice.)

1005
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,870
There's no one left
if you put it off too long.

1006
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,810
- That's true.
- You must keep looking.

1007
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,240
My goal is age 35.

1008
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,340
How do you feel about a younger guy?

1009
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,840
I don't really like younger guys.

1010
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,720
- You don't, do you?
- I know a guy who works at Google.

1011
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,220
He's handsome.

1012
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,920
(He's handsome.)

1013
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,420
(Giggling)

1014
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,590
She likes slender guys.

1015
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,760
She's happy just hearing about him.

1016
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,660
- Look at her after hearing that.
- Google.

1017
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,330
- You only heard about him.
- No.

1018
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,390
(Drooling while smiling)

1019
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,530
I have a junior
who works at Facebook too.

1020
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,600
Krispy?

1021
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,230
- Krispy?
- Krispy.

1022
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,970
- Krispy?
- Krispy.

1023
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,540
- Are you hungry?
- I mean, hey.

1024
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,670
Why would Seok Jin suddenly say that?
Krispy?

1025
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,840
(Ddochi seems to prefer eating
to blind dates so far.)

1026
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
He said Facebook.

1027
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,210
(Ddochi seems to prefer eating
to blind dates so far.)

1028
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,850
(As they chat and giggle...)

1029
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,380
This is an announcement.

1030
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,920
This train will soon arrive
at Cheonan Asan Station.

1031
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,190
We're here.

1032
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,390
- This train will soon arrive...
- We're here!

1033
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,490
- We're in Cheonan!
- We're in Cheonan.

1034
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,130
- This is Cheonan.
- We're here.

1035
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,930
Asan Station?

1036
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:15,000
- My goodness.
- I think it's less hot than Seoul.

1037
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,170
- That's because we're indoors.
- Is that right?

1038
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,530
- It's so hot.
- The moment...

1039
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,040
- we step outside...
- Gosh, it's hot.

1040
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,270
- Gosh, it's scorching hot.
- The weather is...

1041
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,470
- My gosh, it's hot.
- Let's hurry over to the shade.

1042
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,340
Asan. So, isn't your wife...

1043
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,780
- Seosan.
- Byul is from Seosan.

1044
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,510
Jang Dong Min is from Asan.

1045
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,580
Oh, he's from Asan.

1046
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,120
- Dong Min is from Asan?
- Yes, he's from Asan.

1047
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,250
Daniel, where were you from?

1048
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,820
I'm from Seoul. I was born there.

1049
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,890
- You?
- Where in Seoul?

1050
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,520
In Seoul... I was born
at Soonchunhyang University.

1051
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,960
- What?
- Soochunhyang Hospital.

1052
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,790
So, which neighborhood?
Why do you keep talking...

1053
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,830
- about hospitals? That's useless.
- Stop talking about hospitals.

1054
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,330
I lived in Cheonho-dong
for a long time.

1055
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,700
- Cheonho-dong.
- Cheonho-dong.

1056
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,100
- Aren't you...
- Cheonho-dong.

1057
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,730
- He suddenly approached us.
- Yes, hello.

1058
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,270
Sir, this is Cheonan, right?

1059
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,240
- Asan.
- It's between Cheonan and Asan.

1060
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,970
- It's the border.
- Oh, I see.

1061
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,710
- It's the border.
- We're between Cheonan and Asan.

1062
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,040
- Cheonan and Asan.
- Let's go!

1063
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,110
So, are you filming here?

1064
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,810
Gosh, what is this?

1065
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,950
Goodness, thank you, sir!

1066
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,050
He's acting like he's happy.

1067
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,880
- Happily
- What is he doing?

1068
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,650
- Dancing along
- He's a liar.

1069
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,920
- Stop right in place
- What a liar.

1070
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,360
The song is so old.

1071
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,860
I know. "Happily dancing..."
Gosh, that song is seriously...

1072
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,920
I'm happy.

1073
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,930
(Just a minute ago)

1074
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,290
(Whining that it's hot)

1075
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
(You can tell he's pretending
to be energetic.)

1076
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,870
- Dancing along
- What's up with him?

1077
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,870
Stop right in place

1078
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,770
- I'm happy.
- That's because...

1079
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,240
- he had a cold during the opening.
- Oh, you're right.

1080
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,910
He wants to show people
that he is still going strong.

1081
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,380
- He wants to show people.
- That's right.

1082
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,880
(Showing people
that he's still going strong)

1083
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,780
Seok Jin. Because of your cold,

1084
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,750
- you're pretending...
- Yes, to show that you're healthy.

1085
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,350
- That he's still alive and well.
- But...

1086
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,690
to show people
that he's still healthy...

1087
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,220
- Gosh, it's so hot.
- We're in Cheonan.

1088
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,330
Okay, we've finally arrived
in Cheonan.

1089
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,230
We're in Cheonan.

1090
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,230
This is Cheonan.

1091
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,000
Now, we'll decide the part...

1092
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,870
- for the blank that says "How."
- "How."

1093
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,900
Gosh, but this is no joke.

1094
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,500
- Where will we decide "How?"
- What will go in "How?"

1095
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,610
- We have to choose well.
- Please reveal the "How" blank.

1096
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,010
- Reveal it.
- What is it?

1097
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,140
Hey, but right now...

1098
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,210
- "Dress up like blank?"
- What?

1099
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,210
- "Dress up like blank?"
- What?

1100
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,880
Gosh, the characters...

1101
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,650
- Earlier, you had...
- We wrote it down earlier.

1102
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,120
the pink question.

1103
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,380
- The pink question was,
- The cartoon?

1104
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,490
"Who's a character from
a recent movie or drama..."

1105
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,320
- "that left an impression on you?"
- That's right.

1106
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,990
- I said Yang Se Jong's Hee Dong.
- Right.

1107
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,660
- If I dress up like Brad Pitt,
- I have to do my hair like a lion.

1108
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,830
- I said Brad Pitt.
- I'll have to wear a racing suit.

1109
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,860
So, you'll pick a character
out of the answers you wrote down...

1110
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,270
and dress up as that character...

1111
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,100
- to walk around Cheonan.
- This is...

1112
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,000
- My goodness.
- We can't pick mine.

1113
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,640
- What will happen?
- To this question,

1114
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,110
Jae Seok said...

1115
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,670
Hee Dong from the drama, "Low Life."

1116
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,810
- Yang Se Jong's character.
- Hee Dong.

1117
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,880
- The 1970s look.
- Who is he?

1118
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,910
Who is Hee Dong from "Low Life?"

1119
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,980
- It's Yang Se Jong's character.
- It's the 1970s style.

1120
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,280
- Oh, I know.
- Ji Hyo,

1121
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,410
you wrote Rumi from
"KPop Demon Hunters,"

1122
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,020
- the girl from Huntrix.
- Gosh, Rumi is...

1123
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,250
- How will you dress up as Rumi?
- Gosh, Rumi?

1124
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,450
- That's what you wrote.
- Rumi has that hairstyle too.

1125
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,490
Oh, Rumi?

1126
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,960
- I haven't seen it yet.
- Seok Jin and Jong Kook,

1127
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,360
- you wrote Brad Pitt from "F1."
- I saw that movie recently.

1128
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,660
If you wear a racing suit now,

1129
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,090
- you'd boil to death.
- Seriously.

1130
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,360
- You won't be able to walk around.
- In that case,

1131
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,960
you'd have to wear
a leather jacket...

1132
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,830
- and a jumpsuit.
- But you'd have to wear it.

1133
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,870
- What else can you do?
- That's right.

1134
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,200
Next, Daniel wrote Peter.

1135
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,240
- Which Peter did you mean?
- Who's Peter?

1136
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,470
I meant Peter from "Spider-Man."

1137
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,640
Then, you'd have to wear
the spider suit.

1138
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,140
- I know.
- But when you say Peter,

1139
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,380
he wears regular clothes.

1140
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,040
- Yes. He's a photographer at first.
- Yes, that's Peter.

1141
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,610
- A photographer's outfit.
- Yes, a photographer.

1142
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,410
- A photographer.
- That's perfect for him.

1143
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,120
Ye Eun, you wrote Gwan Sik from...

1144
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,550
- "When Life Gives You Tangerines."
- Gwan Sik.

1145
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,720
- Gwan Sik.
- Gwan Sik is easy.

1146
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,920
- Gwan Sik is the most comfortable.
- A tracksuit.

1147
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,490
- A tracksuit.
- From the 1960s.

1148
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,790
Se Chan, you wrote down
The Saja Boys...

1149
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,430
- from "KPop Demon Hunters."
- The Saja Boys.

1150
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,060
Oh, the Saja Boys.
Don't you have to...

1151
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,230
- wear a beanie?
- What is that?

1152
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,960
- There is a beanie and... Yes.
- The Saja Boys?

1153
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,330
And Haha,

1154
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,630
you wrote down Lee Kwang Soo
from "Karma."

1155
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,470
For "Karma,"
it's that plastic surgeon...

1156
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,870
- It'll be hot, though.
- He's a Korean medicine doctor,

1157
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,940
- but a thug.
- A Korean medicine doctor.

1158
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,540
The drama is set in winter.

1159
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,470
- Right.
- You have to wear a coat.

1160
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,140
- You may choose how to dress up...
- Daniel, you should choose.

1161
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,580
- and like which character.
- Shall I choose?

1162
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,580
Daniel.

1163
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,680
- I have good luck with this stuff.
- Daniel, you choose.

1164
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,880
- I have good luck in draws.
- You can do this.

1165
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,620
- Let's choose Gwan Sik.
- For real.

1166
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,650
- Let's pick Gwan Sik.
- Who?

1167
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,690
- Gwan Sik?
- Gwan Sik.

1168
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,420
- Gwan Sik?
- We came all the way to Cheonan.

1169
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,720
- Gwan Sik?
- He's good at picking things.

1170
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,160
Just don't pick Brad Pitt.

1171
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,560
- Gwan Sik.
- We'll be in leather jackets.

1172
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,260
Who else should I pick
besides Gwan Sik?

1173
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,630
- There's Peter too.
- Actually,

1174
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,000
- Gwan Sik is the best.
- Hee Dong isn't bad either.

1175
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,300
- Peter is good too.
- Peter is okay.

1176
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,360
- Hee Dong is okay too.
- Peter, Hee Dong, and Gwan Sik?

1177
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,470
- And Hee Dong.
- Hee Dong.

1178
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,800
- 1970s outfits are all right.
- Yes.

1179
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,100
Yes, they're all right.

1180
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,640
- Hey, why is he sweating so much?
- Just go for it.

1181
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,310
Gosh, look at his sweat. Darn it.

1182
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,570
- Hey, why is he sweating so much?
- Just go for it.

1183
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,940
Gosh, look at his sweat. Darn it.

1184
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,380
- Let's go for it.
- I'm anxious.

1185
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,580
Hee Dong is all right.

1186
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,710
(Which look did he choose?)

1187
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,280
Did he choose Lee Kwang Soo?

1188
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,220
(In this sweltering heat,)

1189
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,490
(the outfits they'll be wearing
to walk around in downtown Cheonan)

1190
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,860
- Darn it.
- The Saja Boys.

1191
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,430
- What's the Saja Boys?
- It's okay.

1192
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,400
(The Saja Boys)

1193
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,960
Then, please fill in the blank
with the Saja Boys.

1194
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,470
- What do they look like?
- The Saja Boys?

1195
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,900
- They wear gats or beanies.
- It's all right, though.

1196
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,070
- Oh, really?
- They wear button-up shirts.

1197
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,570
- Like an idol group.
- Yes, the Saja Boys are idols.

1198
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,340
They're summer clothes.

1199
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,370
I like retro, though.

1200
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,180
- Wigs and beanies.
- What is this?

1201
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,440
- The Saja Boys.
- Soda pop

1202
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,750
- We're dressing up like idols.
- Right.

1203
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,510
Silver wigs...

1204
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,480
- Gosh, it's hot.
- It's so hot.

1205
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,580
So, we won't be...

1206
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,190
making everyone dress up.

1207
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,290
Only five of you will dress up.

1208
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,420
Five?

1209
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,560
- You can pick the five yourselves.
- Ourselves?

1210
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,990
We have a car ready for you to buy
the items that you'd need...

1211
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,530
to transform yourselves.

1212
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,630
- You can drive yourselves around.
- Okay.

1213
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,530
- Let's go first and then decide.
- How about we go first?

1214
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,630
- Let's get in the car first.
- How about that?

1215
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,170
Okay, we'll move to the car.

1216
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,970
But we have to buy the items?

1217
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,100
- The items...
- Gosh, this will be...

1218
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,440
- Do we have to go to a market?
- Then,

1219
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,270
- should we buy wigs?
- Should we buy a wig or something?

1220
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,580
- I guess we'll have to go shopping.
- I know.

1221
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,180
But we'll have to go to a market
or something to shop.

1222
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,580
- Right.
- We have to buy them?

1223
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,310
Goodness, we have to buy them.

1224
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,620
Shall we go to a market?

1225
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,980
- A market?
- We always go to markets.

1226
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,990
But this is...

1227
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,890
- Will they sell clothes for us?
- So,

1228
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,220
- A department store.
- they won't have the exact look...

1229
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,290
for the Saja Boys.

1230
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,430
- We just need idol clothes.
- They're bright idol clothes.

1231
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,860
- I think...
- Vintage would be good too.

1232
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,730
- Like button-up shirts and stuff.
- What should we buy?

1233
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,900
- Shouldn't we buy wigs first?
- So, right now, which of us...

1234
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,400
I think we'll decide
which five of us it will be.

1235
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,100
Today, Seok Jin seems to be
in great condition.

1236
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,000
- That's right. You should.
- I know. Seok Jin.

1237
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,170
- Right.
- Their Grim Reaper look...

1238
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,770
They're supposed to be Grim Reapers,
you know?

1239
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,110
- No, but this is...
- No, a gat.

1240
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,410
- You have to wear a gat.
- Just wear a gat.

1241
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,480
- Wear something pretty.
- Dark circles under your eyes.

1242
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,780
- But you know...
- Yes, you should wear pretty stuff.

1243
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,510
Something like a summery,
Hawaiian shirt.

1244
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,920
That'd be nice.

1245
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,980
You have to wear a Hawaiian shirt.

1246
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,720
- There's a guy in a Hawaiian shirt?
- First of all,

1247
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,490
you can wear a beanie with it.

1248
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,020
- A wig.
- Also,

1249
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,160
- tinted glasses.
- Okay.

1250
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,560
- Jae Seok wants to do it,
- Yes, tinted glasses.

1251
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,190
- the two of them should dress up.
- No, not me.

1252
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,390
- We've decided that now.
- No, we should choose.

1253
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,700
- It's like...
- Jae Seok...

1254
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,660
- If you give us a benefit...
- We should decide who it will be.

1255
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,170
- I'll do it with a benefit.
- Seok Jin, the benefit is that...

1256
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,330
- people will give you attention.
- No, it's not that.

1257
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,940
You could guarantee lunch or...

1258
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,470
No, we can't do that.

1259
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,610
- I'll do it if you guarantee lunch.
- There are no guarantees.

1260
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,840
Then, I won't do it either!

1261
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,940
- Then, get out right here!
- Why should I get out?

1262
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,080
- Get out right here.
- Why should I get out?

1263
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,780
If you're not going to do anything,
why did you come along?

1264
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,680
I'm not doing nothing.
But why should I do it?

1265
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,120
You have to give me a reason.

1266
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,420
- You're the most spunky among us.
- Also,

1267
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,350
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Ji Hyo...

1268
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,190
Ji Hyo and Ye Eun
should be included too.

1269
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,760
- That's right.
- Okay, Jae Seok.

1270
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,060
- If one of us is chosen...
- Include us.

1271
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,430
Hey, there's a gun here
for playing rock-paper-scissors.

1272
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,600
What is that?

1273
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,100
(A new item provided by the staff)

1274
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,730
- Paper.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors...

1275
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,870
and decide that way.

1276
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,900
(If you release the trigger,
you get a random shape.)

1277
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,170
- That's so fascinating.
- That's not bad.

1278
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,340
- What is that?
- Paper.

1279
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,570
- Scissors...
- It won't give me scissors.

1280
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,610
- Scissors.
- Oh, there you go.

1281
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,810
Play rock-paper-scissors with this.

1282
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,980
- But...
- How many guns are there?

1283
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,540
- it won't give you scissors often.
- There are lots of guns.

1284
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,680
- It happens sometimes.
- Well...

1285
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,850
It won't give you scissors.

1286
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,350
That's why we should just play
rock-paper-scissors...

1287
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,680
- since it won't give you scissors.
- Let's just...

1288
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,890
go in order of age
and make the youngest five dress up.

1289
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,090
How old are you, Seok Jin?

1290
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,590
Me?

1291
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,260
Do you need me to tell you?

1292
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,790
All right.

1293
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,930
(As they keep having
a childish argument)

1294
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,960
Hey, there's a walnut cake shop.

1295
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
(A walnut cake shop is by the road,
a specialty of Cheonan!)

1296
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,760
If we come to Cheonan
and not eat walnut cakes,

1297
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,270
- it would be a huge shame.
- We can eat some.

1298
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,200
We're still in Cheonan.
What are you talking about?

1299
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,770
- But he's a senior...
- You fool.

1300
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,440
- You fool.
- What's wrong with him?

1301
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,640
(Seok Sam is
in such a weird mood today.)

1302
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,970
- Excuse me, Seok Jin.
- What?

1303
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,940
That song you sang earlier to show
that you're still going strong...

1304
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,280
- Happily
- You suddenly started...

1305
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,850
The song was just too old.

1306
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,920
- I...
- Going strong...

1307
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,320
- I was surprised myself.
- Yes.

1308
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,750
He said, "Going strong."

1309
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,290
I was suddenly so happy.

1310
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,620
Gosh, this is a busy area.

1311
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,090
This really looks like Gangnam.

1312
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,720
- There are many shops on the right.
- Gangnam Station.

1313
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,060
- Hey, this place is nice.
- That's pretty.

1314
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,130
- Look.
- It's a bustling area.

1315
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,600
There are lots of clothing shops.

1316
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,800
- My goodness.
- It's like Gangnam Station.

1317
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,470
- Look at all the alleyways.
- Is this like a vintage district?

1318
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,470
- There's a lot of stuff.
- What is all this?

1319
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,540
Gosh, this must be downtown Cheonan.

1320
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,100
Goodness, it's a bustling area.

1321
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,610
This is Cheonan.

1322
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,070
- Cheonan.
- Hello.

1323
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,810
- Cheonan is so nice.
- Hello.

1324
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,810
- The cafe is pretty.
- Hello.

1325
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,840
- Hello.
- This is pretty.

1326
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,010
- Hi.
- It's a pretty cafe.

1327
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,280
You're so handsome.

1328
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,510
This is Cheonan.

1329
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,550
As if.

1330
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,250
- Hello.
- Congratulations on your wedding.

1331
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,950
Jong Kook, they congratulated you
on your wedding.

1332
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,060
- Thank you!
- Congratulations on your wedding.

1333
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
- This calls for a celebration.
- A celebration.

1334
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,130
- This calls for a celebration.
- This calls for a celebration.

1335
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,590
They're happy for you.

1336
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,200
Thank you.

1337
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,430
- This must be...
- This is so nice.

1338
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,900
the place. I mean...

1339
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,870
- This calls for a celebration.
- A celebration.

1340
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,270
Anyway...

1341
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,770
Okay!

1342
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,880
- Jong Kook keeps glaring at me.
- Se Chan, come here.

1343
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,310
- Superholic? This sounds decent.
- I'm too scared to tease him.

1344
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,580
- Jong Kook keeps glaring at me.
- It's a big store.

1345
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Jong Kook gives me a bit of leeway.

1346
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,820
I'm too scared to tease him.

1347
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,290
(The pranksters are in a good mood
after teasing Jong Kook.)

1348
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,460
We're "KPop Hunter Boys."

1349
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,520
(He switches his target
to the weaker Seok Jin.)

1350
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,060
One's really in a good mood,
but the other is faking it.

1351
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,360
- Soda pop
- You know, right?

1352
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,460
- He's for real. He's faking it.
- Soda pop

1353
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,370
(Fake madness, True madness)

1354
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,200
There's a vintage store.

1355
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,840
This is the place.

1356
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,440
- Here are the clothes.
- That's perfect for "Soda Pop."

1357
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,270
Aren't these K-pop-inspired outfits?

1358
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,910
- These are perfect.
- These...

1359
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,180
- We can dress exactly like that.
- No way.

1360
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,410
Wait, isn't this Haha?

1361
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,780
- It is.
- Haha, it's you.

1362
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,050
I don't dress like that anymore.

1363
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,220
He really looks like Haha.

1364
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,280
Isn't this how we need
to dress today?

1365
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,720
It's too hot outside. Let's go in.

1366
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,620
- I didn't expect a place like this.
- It's pretty.

1367
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,090
Look at these stylish clothes.

1368
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,060
- Really?
- The clothes are incredible!

1369
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,830
- This is so nice.
- It's such a stylish place.

1370
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,690
It's really cool.

1371
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,800
(Inside the shop...)

1372
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
- No way.
- This place is amazing.

1373
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,960
What is this place?

1374
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,200
- This place is so stylish.
- This embodies "Soda Pop."

1375
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,530
Vintage clothes?

1376
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,670
Everything's so pretty.

1377
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,000
This is what the group wore
for "Soda Pop."

1378
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,340
Aren't these perfect for "Soda Pop?"

1379
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,940
This is what the group wore
for "Soda Pop."

1380
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,240
- Hello.
- This t-shirt is so good.

1381
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,480
Yaman.

1382
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,550
Isn't this what the group wore
for "Soda Pop?"

1383
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,350
- Guys, hold on.
- Yes?

1384
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,780
- Gather around.
- Why?

1385
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,320
- Guys.
- Yes?

1386
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,320
- Let me be clear.
- Sure.

1387
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,560
We're not choosing outfits
for the TV rating notice.

1388
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,460
Don't be confused.

1389
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,190
(The theme for the TV rating notice
was spring clothes.)

1390
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,000
I had to keep that on.

1391
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,630
(From the blowfly
that Se Chan created)

1392
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,540
(He's dressed like a woman
going to the supermarket.)

1393
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,910
(Kook returned
as the hottie from LA.)

1394
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,940
(They gave each other a penalty
without being told to.)

1395
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,050
(Self-destruction is off-limits
for them today.)

1396
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,580
- Don't be confused.
- We're dressing for "Soda Pop."

1397
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,720
- "Soda Pop?"
- Yes.

1398
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,150
- "Soda Pop."
- "Soda Pop."

1399
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,090
Let's divide into 2 groups
of 5 and 3 members...

1400
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,850
and pick clothes for each other.

1401
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,560
Here's what I want us to do.

1402
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,790
- Five of us should pose as models.
- Exactly.

1403
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,930
- The three will choose clothes.
- Three will be the stylists.

1404
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:44,990
That's the best plan.

1405
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,460
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Don't try to be funny.

1406
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,030
- Let's do it right.
- Let's get it done.

1407
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,670
- Rock...
- Will this work?

1408
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,570
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1409
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,770
- Scissors.
- I have scissors.

1410
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,300
- I have rock.
- There's paper.

1411
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,710
- Paper.
- There's paper.

1412
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,970
- All right.
- Go.

1413
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,240
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1414
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
- Rock.
- Rock.

1415
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,610
- Paper.
- There's paper.

1416
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,310
- We have scissors.
- Scissors.

1417
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,480
What did I tell you?

1418
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,580
- Was it rock?
- We should do it...

1419
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,420
- one at a time.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1420
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,080
- Paper.
- Rock.

1421
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,550
- Paper.
- Paper.

1422
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:13,090
- Paper!
- I have scissors.

1423
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,460
- Let's go one by one.
- This will never work.

1424
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,760
- When will it end?
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1425
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,290
- Exactly.
- Let's just do it.

1426
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,160
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

1427
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,860
- I want to win.
- Do you get to be the stylist?

1428
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,570
- Sure.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1429
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,130
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1430
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,740
- Scissors!
- Nice!

1431
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,370
(Ji Hyo, Daniel, Haha
will be Saja Boys.)

1432
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,610
- Scissors!
- Scissors!

1433
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,840
- Go again.
- There are two spots left.

1434
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,610
- There are two spots left.
- Two and two.

1435
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,910
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1436
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,980
(Seok Sam wins.)

1437
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,010
Again.

1438
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,380
He has to be dressed up.

1439
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,680
Why me?

1440
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,250
Let's play Sit or Stand.

1441
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,390
He's right.

1442
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,750
- Let's go again.
- He has to be dressed up.

1443
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,090
- Exactly.
- I know.

1444
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,320
You need to dress up as Saja Boys.

1445
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,460
- Why does it have to be me?
- It has to be you.

1446
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,660
Please be in Saja Boys.

1447
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,060
You're close to meeting Death...

1448
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,560
- compared to us.
- Come on.

1449
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,130
Please give me a reason.

1450
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,860
- You'll get lunch instead.
- Let's give him lunch.

1451
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,800
(After 20 minutes
of repeated rematches)

1452
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,200
- Let's play again.
- The group needs a leader.

1453
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,140
All eight will dress up
as Saja Boys!

1454
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,770
- We'll draw straws.
- No, just five.

1455
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,540
- Let's draw straws.
- All eight will dress up.

1456
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,240
- That doesn't make sense.
- Get eight name tags.

1457
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,880
- Let's draw names.
- What?

1458
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,410
It never gets resolved quietly.

1459
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:14,550
Never have you allowed
it to be a clean game.

1460
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,390
Only three are marked with an X.

1461
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,250
- X is good, right?
- X means...

1462
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,420
- you won't dress up.
- Please.

1463
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,620
- Okay.
- Give it a shuffle.

1464
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,990
- You want the X.
- Shuffle them.

1465
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,330
You'll be slapped...

1466
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,990
- if you argue about the result.
- This is for real.

1467
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,430
- This is it.
- This will be final.

1468
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,760
- This has to be final.
- No backsies this time.

1469
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,230
- In the front...
- I'll hand them out.

1470
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,030
- Were we always this bad?
- I'll hand them out randomly.

1471
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,370
- Hand them out.
- Go ahead.

1472
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:34,870
This will be final.

1473
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,770
I'll punch anyone
who challenges this too.

1474
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,910
- Okay.
- Got it.

1475
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,540
- Punch us good.
- Can I open mine?

1476
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,810
- Open.
- You want the X.

1477
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,140
- I'll accept my fate.
- Let's start with you.

1478
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,280
- Open them one by one.
- This will be final.

1479
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,910
- This will be final.
- You want the X.

1480
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,220
Do I want an X?

1481
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,380
One, two, three.

1482
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,120
- Okay.
- Step aside.

1483
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,750
(Those dressing up)

1484
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,020
- You've been chosen.
- Okay.

1485
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,760
- He needs to dress up.
- Okay.

1486
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,060
- You've been chosen.
- Okay.

1487
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,530
- Check out the odds.
- The odds.

1488
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,400
- Let's see.
- Please...

1489
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,730
It's too hot outside.

1490
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:02,970
Jong Kook's quite lucky, so...

1491
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,130
(Jong Kook is exempt.)

1492
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,070
- No way.
- Jong Kook...

1493
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,400
- But it'll suit him.
- He's been lucky...

1494
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,670
ever since he announced his wedding.

1495
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,670
Jong Kook had to dress up.

1496
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,740
Please let it be an X.

1497
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,880
(Bachelor Daniel opens his card.)

1498
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,280
- It's an X.
- No way.

1499
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,150
- Only one of you will be exempt.
- There's only one spot left.

1500
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,450
Let's see.

1501
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,620
Okay, it's between you and me now.

1502
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,620
Let's open it together.

1503
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,790
(Only one of the bucktooth brothers
will make the cut.)

1504
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,460
Is it me? I have the X!

1505
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,830
(Jae Seok will dress up
as Saja Boys.)

1506
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,970
I chose the one
that fell on the floor.

1507
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,070
- This won't be easy.
- It won't be.

1508
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,040
Okay, we're good.

1509
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,340
It's settled.

1510
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,110
- I can't believe it.
- I'll dress Jae Seok up.

1511
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,740
Jong Kook, can you choose my outfit?

1512
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,080
Daniel, you can choose my outfit.

1513
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,550
Just so you know,
we have prepared...

1514
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,610
- some wigs for you.
- That sounds great.

1515
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,720
We should wear a wig and a beanie.

1516
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,320
This is nice.

1517
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,620
It has my name written on it.

1518
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,090
Aren't I the one
with hair over his eyes?

1519
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,060
- We need five members.
- Someone wears a beanie.

1520
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,590
I'll be the one
with hair over his eyes.

1521
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,390
(Mystery)

1522
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,700
(The mysterious Seok Sam tries
covering his eyes with his hair.)

1523
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,300
Seok Jin, that suits you.

1524
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,430
It seems like your own hair.

1525
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,440
(With his glasses off...)

1526
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:16,770
Do I look weird?

1527
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,440
(He looks like a guru.)

1528
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,140
- I covered my eyes.
- Be flashier.

1529
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,680
(Revealing the whites of his eyes)

1530
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,810
Seok Jin, you look
like Kim Kyung Ho.

1531
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,650
(Appearing on the right,
appearing on the left)

1532
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,520
- You startled me.
- How do I look?

1533
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,350
(Instead of Saja Boys,
he turned into the Nine-tailed Fox.)

1534
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,590
You're scaring me.

1535
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,860
- I should try another wig.
- I never wear crop tops.

1536
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,260
I think this will look good on you.

1537
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,460
Actually,
I should look stylish today.

1538
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,070
I want to look pretty and stylish.

1539
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,730
- This isn't even funny.
- How about this?

1540
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,240
I'll look good in this.

1541
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,600
- I think it'll suit you.
- That's why I want...

1542
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,170
to look stylish today.

1543
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,070
- Daniel, how about this?
- I don't know what Saja Boys is.

1544
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,210
Can I see a photo?

1545
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,510
In yellow?
You want to dress like Tae Jin Ah.

1546
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,180
Isn't this what Saja Boys wore?

1547
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,750
Personally, I love this.

1548
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,110
Isn't this what Saja Boys wore?

1549
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,680
This is what Saja Boys would wear.

1550
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,850
I heard that the members...

1551
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,290
- wore Hawaiian shirts.
- That's right.

1552
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,690
- That's good.
- This one?

1553
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,420
I like how light the colors are.

1554
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,060
I could pair this with shorts.

1555
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,460
Haha, wear something like this.

1556
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,260
It'll look good with a pink cap.

1557
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,700
- Right?
- Choose the items for me.

1558
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,830
Isn't this it?

1559
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,170
I heard that the members
wore Hawaiian shirts.

1560
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,640
(They're serious
about transforming into Saja Boys.)

1561
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,570
Jae Seok, would this fit you?

1562
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,310
- Would this fit Jae Seok?
- Hold on.

1563
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,640
(A dress?)

1564
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,050
- Are you kidding me?
- It's a romper.

1565
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,780
This isn't what Saja Boys wore.

1566
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,820
- Let's see it.
- Are you kidding me?

1567
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,120
I think it'll work.

1568
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,450
- Hey.
- I mean it.

1569
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,920
This is what Saja Boys wore
to perform "Soda Pop."

1570
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,590
- Come on.
- My little soda pop

1571
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,930
This isn't
what Saja Boys would wear.

1572
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,600
- This will suit you.
- How does this scream Saja Boys?

1573
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,860
Hold on. I'll pick out an outfit.

1574
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,300
You? Jong Kook!

1575
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,970
- Yes?
- Saja Boys...

1576
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:53,900
Seriously?

1577
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,770
- This is just wrong.
- Got it.

1578
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,810
Why would Saja Boys wear that?

1579
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,680
Hold on a second.
I'll create an outfit for you.

1580
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,940
Who are you, mister?

1581
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,750
(He has on a different wig.)

1582
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,850
Aren't you Choi Bae Dal?

1583
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,420
I'm a member of Saja Boys.

1584
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:11,990
Mr. Choi Bae Dal!

1585
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,220
I'm a member of Saja Boys.

1586
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,420
Jae Seok, check this out.

1587
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,060
Try this on.

1588
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,460
- Are you kidding me with this?
- Jae Seok.

1589
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,590
(He recommends a wig
with bushy hair to Jae Seok.)

1590
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,030
- How is this Saja Boys?
- It is.

1591
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,570
Trust me and try it on.

1592
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,270
Are you kidding me?

1593
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,970
What on earth is this?

1594
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,870
I look like a beggar.

1595
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:29,910
(It looks like a lion's mane.)

1596
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,210
There's a member
with hair covering his eyes.

1597
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:35,340
(Embodying the master
of transformation)

1598
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,550
You look like someone's pet.

1599
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,750
- Hold on.
- I can't see clearly.

1600
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,680
- Aren't you an Afghan Hound?
- I'm not.

1601
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,780
I like this.

1602
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,920
I love it. I'll keep this on.

1603
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,150
(The pet dog is satisfied
with his look.)

1604
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,420
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok
has lost his way.)

1605
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,430
How on earth do I look
like a member of Saja Boys?

1606
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,230
Jae Seok, here you go.

1607
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,470
Just trust me on this.

1608
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,070
I'm only seeing how this looks.

1609
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,600
- Hey.
- I'm just seeing how it is.

1610
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,000
We're Saja Boys, the boy band.

1611
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,040
I'm looking for something
that'll work.

1612
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,570
At least get me something
that fits the concept.

1613
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,040
That's what I've been doing.

1614
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,780
By the way,
why is Se Chan my stylist?

1615
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,010
The others are getting
what they want.

1616
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,150
- I know you better than anyone.
- Help Seok Sam out.

1617
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,380
Don't you worry.

1618
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,050
Okay.

1619
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,190
(Creative freedom was finally given
to Mr. Yang.)

1620
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,260
Where are women's skinny jeans?

1621
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,020
- White skinny jeans?
- For women.

1622
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,560
Something tight.

1623
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,560
Something tight?

1624
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,930
- This is good.
- Right.

1625
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,000
(Whatever Mr. Yang collects)

1626
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,600
Let me accessorize you...

1627
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,240
with bracelets and stuff.

1628
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:41,310
(Items that don't seem
to go together.)

1629
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,050
(Inside the fitting room)

1630
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,650
- Just try it on.
- What is this?

1631
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,780
You're dressing for "Soda Pop."

1632
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,680
"Soda Pop."

1633
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:51,320
Try that on already.

1634
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,590
How is this for "Soda Pop?"

1635
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,120
Will this fit you in the waist?

1636
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,420
- Which one?
- It's 28 inches.

1637
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,430
These are women's pants.

1638
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,530
They fit you though.
Check out the size.

1639
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,900
- This embodies "Soda Pop."
- But...

1640
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,170
You've taken it too far.

1641
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,670
Jae Seok, I see a possibility.

1642
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:06,970
Why don't I try on this wig?

1643
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,540
- This is the right color.
- Of course.

1644
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,010
Help Ye Eun out.

1645
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,210
Ye Eun, come here and try this on.

1646
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,010
- Daniel chose this for me.
- It's cute.

1647
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,380
Come here. It's okay.

1648
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,840
Gosh, look at Seok Jin.

1649
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,980
(But...)

1650
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,510
Hey, Seok Jin. Wait, this is it.

1651
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,650
- Wait, Seok Jin!
- Seok Jin looks good.

1652
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,380
- You've become younger.
- Is this okay?

1653
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,490
I think it looks okay.

1654
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,850
- You really look different.
- Why is it so...

1655
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,460
- The Saja Boys.
- All of us...

1656
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,360
Hey, but this looks too much
like a bob cut.

1657
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,590
Just go with this!

1658
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,060
- Hey!
- Look at this!

1659
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,130
- This is it!
- I love it!

1660
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,130
How is this the Saja Boys?

1661
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,860
(Right then,
Jae Seok is done getting changed.)

1662
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:38,800
That's nice.

1663
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,300
This is a middle-aged woman.

1664
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,100
Jae Seok, this is great.

1665
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,070
Come on.
This is a middle-aged woman.

1666
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,370
- What in the world...
- This is it.

1667
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,210
Hey, try this on.

1668
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,350
- How is this the Saja Boys?
- No, just try it.

1669
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,520
Hey,
this is the owner of a hair salon.

1670
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,320
(Following the S-S collection
that was full of floral scents)

1671
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,920
This is it. It's so nice.

1672
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,260
- What in the world...
- Come on.

1673
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,290
Seriously?

1674
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,730
- Just get a move on.
- Hey!

1675
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,070
Just try it. No.

1676
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,070
On top of that.

1677
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:12,930
Do I take this off?

1678
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,300
(And another masterpiece)

1679
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,040
My gosh. I'm so embarrassed.
I can't walk around like this.

1680
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,140
Hey, but what's up with you?

1681
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,210
Mister... I mean, lady.

1682
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,550
By the way, which salon do you own?

1683
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,980
I own a salon out in Cheonho-dong.

1684
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,390
Is he a Sapsal dog or what?
I mean...

1685
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,390
- I mean, this is...
- What is this?

1686
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,360
- We look like a troupe of actors.
- I mean...

1687
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:37,960
Seok Jin, you're the best.

1688
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,330
- My gosh.
- I mean, what is this?

1689
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,330
- Weren't we going to look cool?
- Seok Jin, you look great.

1690
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,360
It looks so nice.

1691
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,830
- I mean, is this the Saja Boys?
- You look better than Ji Hyo...

1692
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,170
- at the opening, Seok Jin.
- Right.

1693
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,140
How is this "Soda Pop?"

1694
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,940
Gosh, seriously!

1695
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,970
Is he Chucky or something?

1696
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,810
- Hey, why does he look so normal?
- Look at him.

1697
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,680
- Jong Kook made me wear this.
- Wear the belt.

1698
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,050
- Let me see.
- This won't do.

1699
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,350
- This won't do. He's too normal.
- Haha, that won't do.

1700
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,610
- Hey, that's cute.
- He's too normal.

1701
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,050
Why not?
Jong Kook made me wear this.

1702
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,780
- It's so cute.
- It's too normal. No.

1703
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,420
- That won't do.
- My goodness.

1704
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,990
- Hey, Haha. You look cute.
- My goodness.

1705
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,320
- Haha, that won't do.
- See? It's cute.

1706
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,760
- Come here.
- You're so cute.

1707
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,360
- Hey, I'm going to kill you.
- Hurry up.

1708
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,590
- Hurry up and change.
- You...

1709
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,400
Wear this on top.
Haha, this is "Soda Pop." Try it.

1710
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,100
- Hurry up and wear it.
- Se Chan!

1711
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,670
Go and put it on. Try it. Hurry.

1712
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,670
- Take this off?
- No, on top of that.

1713
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,340
Yes, Ji Hyo.

1714
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,310
- I thought it was "Demon Hunters."
- But this looks fine.

1715
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,670
I mean... My gosh.

1716
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,040
- Where did you get these pants?
- Look at that.

1717
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,610
Let me see. That's nice, Haha.

1718
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,080
Let's get you some more accessories.

1719
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,350
- That's nice.
- It's pretty, but...

1720
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,880
- Nice, that's not bad.
- What is this?

1721
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,780
I mean, this looks bad enough...

1722
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,990
- Oh, Ji Hyo!
- That looks so good on you!

1723
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,890
- Ji Hyo.
- Oh, Ji Hyo!

1724
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,460
(Ji Hyo steps out
dressed in rags and tatters.)

1725
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,620
- That's nice, Ji Hyo.
- Let me see.

1726
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,960
Hey, you're like the pigeon lady
from "Home Alone."

1727
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,130
- My goodness.
- I've seen her in Dongducheon.

1728
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,760
The lady who owns the hamburger
steak place looked like this.

1729
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,660
- Ji Hyo! Look at Ji Hyo!
- Yes!

1730
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,770
(The identity of the person who gave
them a strange sense of deja vu)

1731
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,940
Why didn't you take off your clothes
underneath? It'll be so hot.

1732
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,970
That's true.

1733
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,110
Gosh,
I feel so bad for the Saja Boys.

1734
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,880
Hey, how is this the Saja Boys?

1735
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,980
It's fine. I look the most like
"Demon Hunters."

1736
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,050
Right? It's less embarrassing
thanks to me, right?

1737
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:07,620
At least one of us should
look like this.

1738
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,150
- No, Haha. Take off the hat.
- He must be jealous.

1739
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,690
- Why?
- Don't try to be cool. Take it off.

1740
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,590
- What are you doing?
- We're trying to be cool, you fool!

1741
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,260
- No. It's because of the hat.
- Why can't I do that?

1742
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,060
- Take off the hat.
- Just take it off.

1743
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,390
- No, take off the hat.
- I also wore what he told me to.

1744
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,330
- But...
- Haha, here.

1745
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,260
- Please.
- No, you have to do this.

1746
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,570
- Take off the hat.
- Please don't.

1747
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,870
No, the hat looks like
you're trying too hard to be cool.

1748
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,470
- Of course I'm trying to be cool.
- Ji Hyo, earlier...

1749
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:29,470
- No.
- Gosh, this is...

1750
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,940
Aren't we trying to be cool today?

1751
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,970
- Hang on a minute, Haha.
- The Saja Boys...

1752
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,480
No, this isn't the Saja Boys.

1753
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,850
- So, they can be funny. I can...
- Who gave you this?

1754
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,680
I mean,
I feel like I should do something.

1755
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,850
How is this "Demon Hunters?"

1756
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,790
- Why is he a Demon Hunter?
- What is he...

1757
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,390
- Is he Song Yi?
- Is he a Demon Hunter?

1758
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,620
Isn't he just a monster?

1759
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,620
- Just a monster.
- Is he Song Yi or something?

1760
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,530
- What are you?
- Are you Song Yi or something?

1761
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,230
- Are you a present?
- What's he supposed to be?

1762
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,860
- What...
- I'm a "Demon Hunter."

1763
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,000
- How is that...
- "Demon..."

1764
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,100
"Demon Hunters."

1765
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,070
- What? "Demon Stars?"
- Anything is "Demon Hunters?"

1766
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,800
- "Demon Hunters."
- "Hunters." Right.

1767
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,270
- So, I... The picture...
- One second.

1768
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,540
You know by the wig, don't you?
The guy on the very right.

1769
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,680
Yes, this is better.

1770
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,680
You were so funny without that.

1771
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,950
- That's good. Nice.
- Let me see.

1772
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,280
- Hey, that's good.
- Let's see it.

1773
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,750
Let me see.

1774
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,850
- Hang on.
- What is this?

1775
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,290
- No, just go with it.
- Don't laugh.

1776
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,420
- What in the world...
- Is she a caveman?

1777
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,320
She's dressed up as a caveman.
"Tirano's Claw."

1778
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,530
Ooga-ooga.

1779
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,560
- She's a caveman.
- Hey, you're just a caveman.

1780
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,100
- Ye Eun is from "The Flintstones."
- Look at her.

1781
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,370
- I don't know about this.
- Wear the wrap skirt.

1782
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,270
- No.
- Wear it.

1783
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,370
- Don't do it.
- Wear the wrap skirt.

1784
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,510
- That's gross.
- Tie it in the front.

1785
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,040
- Oh, that's nice.
- But this isn't "Demon Hunters."

1786
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,040
Nice.

1787
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,940
It feels like "Soda Pop."

1788
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,680
This is "Soda Pop," Seok Jin.

1789
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:46,410
Nice.

1790
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,220
(We didn't mean to disgrace
the name of the Saja Boys.)

1791
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,850
(The rookies who appeared
in the pop world like a disaster)

1792
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,690
(Baby)

1793
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,890
My gosh.

1794
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,630
(Mystery)

1795
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,530
(Romance)

1796
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,730
(Abby)

1797
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,870
(Jinu)

1798
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,570
(Sajja Boys)

1799
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,240
- Darn it.
- Okay.

1800
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,370
Haha.

1801
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,410
How is this "Soda Pop?"

1802
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,840
No way. This isn't...

1803
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,910
What did you say? "Demon Hunters?"

1804
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,310
Gosh, but I guess we are getting
one blank done at a time.

1805
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,220
- It's time for "What" now, right?
- Right.

1806
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,780
- Yes, please reveal...
- We have three left now.

1807
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,090
the "What" blank.

1808
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,860
(Eat blank)

1809
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,790
- "Eat blank?"
- Eat. I'm eating like this?

1810
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,160
How can we eat like this?

1811
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,630
- My gosh.
- All right.

1812
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,530
I can't go with these people.

1813
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,100
I can't go with you either.

1814
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,600
I can't go with that lady.

1815
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,770
- You're from the same salon, right?
- "Dam Da Di."

1816
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,440
- It's. "Dam Da Di."
- It's Lee Sang Eun.

1817
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,570
- You're the owner and co-owner.
- I'm the owner. She's the co-owner.

1818
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,910
Seriously, you look like it.

1819
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,410
Okay, so the blank for "What" was
about eating something.

1820
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,980
The purple question was...

1821
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,990
"Which food would you choose
if you had to eat only one thing..."

1822
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,390
- "like in the movie, 'Old Boy?'"
- Gosh, I can't even...

1823
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,160
- I said sundaeguk.
- Your answers were...

1824
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,760
- Jae Seok said ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

1825
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,690
- Gosh, ramyeon.
- Ji Hyo said doenjang jjigae.

1826
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,100
Seok Jin said
kimchi stir-fried pork.

1827
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,860
Se Chan said bibimbap.

1828
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,970
Jong Kook said sundaeguk.

1829
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,370
- Daniel said pork cutlet.
- Pork cutlet.

1830
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,170
Haha said a course meal.

1831
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,940
And Ye Eun said hot pot.

1832
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,880
Except for the course meal,
we've checked all the locations.

1833
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,810
We can't go in to eat a course meal
like this anyway.

1834
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,280
(Hitting the nail on the head)

1835
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,580
- Hey, I know that too.
- They won't let you in.

1836
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,320
Hey, you dressed us up.
How can you say "like this?"

1837
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,590
If you get a course meal,
we'll quickly find a spot.

1838
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,760
- Nice.
- But you have to wear this...

1839
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,090
and take your time to eat there.

1840
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:40,330
- This is driving me crazy.
- We're going with Demon Hunters.

1841
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,560
Then, if you pick one,

1842
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,300
- we'll go ahead with that.
- Sundaeguk sounds good.

1843
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,940
- All right, then.
- It would be perfect.

1844
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,740
Gosh, sundaeguk would be perfect.

1845
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,870
- All right, then. Song Yi can pick.
- It would be perfect.

1846
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,240
Gosh, sundaeguk would be perfect.

1847
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,610
- Song Yi, pick a good one.
- Song Yi...

1848
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,840
- Song Yi, do a good job.
- Song Yi, please do this well.

1849
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,810
- Please, Song Yi. Let's have pork.
- Song Yi.

1850
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,880
- The pork is good too.
- Let's have stir-fried pork.

1851
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,250
- Everything sounds good today.
- They're all good.

1852
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,250
(Anything would be good
except for a course meal.)

1853
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,180
- Ramyeon would be okay too.
- They're all good.

1854
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,620
- Hey, what is it?
- Sundaeguk!

1855
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,850
(Sundaeguk, just the meat)

1856
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,090
(Sundaeguk)

1857
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,620
- All right, then.
- That's good.

1858
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,860
You will eat sundaeguk,

1859
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,890
- Nice.
- and we'll move on to 4 and 5.

1860
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,960
- Yes.
- Okay!

1861
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,100
- Let's go.
- What will the next one be?

1862
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,170
I'm so relieved. I wanted to have
sundaeguk so badly.

1863
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,470
Gosh, but how will I walk around
like this? I'm so embarrassed.

1864
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,470
- Thank you.
- Have a good day!

1865
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,670
How is this the Saja Boys?

1866
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,210
My gosh.

1867
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,310
- All right. Let's get in, troupe!
- Okay!

1868
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,940
Here comes the event crew!

1869
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,480
- Come on, troupe!
- Oh, dear.

1870
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,450
It's open.

1871
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,480
- Oh, dear. Let's get going.
- I'll go in the back.

1872
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,150
- The first show is over.
- Be careful.

1873
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,580
Let's go to the second...

1874
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,020
I'm so glad I wasn't chosen.

1875
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,360
- That's...
- What?

1876
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,230
Hey, seriously. People will avoid us
if we walk around like this.

1877
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,460
- By the way, Ji Hyo,
- Grim Reapers.

1878
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,730
- you look like a good fighter.
- You know?

1879
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,030
- Do I look like a good fighter?
- You do. You look strong.

1880
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,300
You look like you own
a clothing store in Itaewon.

1881
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,970
- This is the main street, right?
- It's so big, isn't it?

1882
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,240
- Hello!
- Don't open the window.

1883
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,980
- Hello.
- This is the leader of Saja Boys.

1884
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,680
- Yes.
- Hello!

1885
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,180
- Don't open it.
- Hello.

1886
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,310
- Oh, boy.
- Yes.

1887
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,350
They're shocked.

1888
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:08,750
You're scaring them.

1889
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,350
No, we're just saying hello.

1890
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,850
- You have to say hello.
- Why did you open it?

1891
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,890
I mean...

1892
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,120
I wasn't ready. Why did you open it?

1893
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,120
(The rookie Saja is still shy
about meeting the fans.)

1894
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,460
- Gosh, seriously.
- I was just so glad to see them.

1895
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,690
I'm so embarrassed.

1896
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,400
I want to show off.

1897
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,030
- I want to show off too.
- Right.

1898
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,930
It's not showing off.
We look gross right now.

1899
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:25,970
- Seok Sam.
- Gosh, Cheonan is...

1900
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,900
- Hello!
- Don't open it. My gosh.

1901
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,870
- Yes, we're the Saja Boys.
- Yes.

1902
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:30,870
(What is that?)

1903
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:32,970
- Thank you!
- She was so shocked right now.

1904
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,240
- Bye. Hey.
- She was shocked.

1905
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,580
- It's not that.
- Ask if it's okay...

1906
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,480
- before you open the window.
- No, but...

1907
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,750
- My gosh. Why did you open it?
- He wasn't ready.

1908
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,980
I wasn't ready.

1909
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,480
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Come on, Seok Jin.

1910
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,890
This is our...
They're so happy to see us.

1911
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,390
Gosh, okay.

1912
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,890
- We should be grateful.
- It'll all be a good memory.

1913
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,760
- I'm so thankful.
- We should be grateful.

1914
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,390
Gosh, this is so funny.

1915
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:55,830
- Hey, so Cheonan is...
- Yes?

1916
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,430
well known for their sundae.

1917
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,000
It's Byeongcheon.

1918
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,570
- Oh, Byeongcheon sundae?
- Byeongcheon sundae.

1919
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,040
- Is it like blood sausage?
- Gosh, my wig is so itchy.

1920
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,110
Yes, mine itches too.

1921
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,340
- You have to endure it.
- Hey, it's...

1922
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,110
Gosh, this is
the Byeongcheon Sundae Street.

1923
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,680
- Hey, there it is.
- There it is.

1924
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,680
Hey, there are so many
sundae restaurants here.

1925
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,280
- My goodness.
- Byeongcheon Sundae Street.

1926
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,680
It would taste great
even if you go into any restaurant.

1927
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,380
Byeongcheon sundae is so famous.

1928
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,950
This is
where Byeongcheon sundae is from.

1929
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,120
(Cheonan's Byeongcheon sundae
is one of the top 3 in the country.)

1930
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,390
Is this a sundae town?

1931
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,890
It would taste great
even if you go into any restaurant.

1932
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:24,830
Hey, are we going to
a sundaeguk restaurant like that?

1933
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:25,990
That's great.

1934
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,860
- I'm sure it'll taste great.
- Please.

1935
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,930
- The sundae here is no joke.
- All sorts of sundae.

1936
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,670
- Gosh, thank you.
- Sundae is the best.

1937
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,200
- My gosh. They're all here.
- They're all here.

1938
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,970
- They have everything here.
- It sounds so delicious.

1939
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,270
- That's it. It's Auntie's.
- It's Auntie's Sundae.

1940
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,310
- Gosh, Auntie.
- We're here at your restaurant.

1941
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:40,540
Gosh, yes.

1942
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,080
- Thank you for driving!
- All right!

1943
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,480
- Let's go!
- Thank you.

1944
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,410
I wonder if I should really
go in like this, but...

1945
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,320
- My goodness.
- This reminds me of my auntie.

1946
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,150
Gosh, I look like a beggar.

1947
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:51,850
(The circus troupe gets out shyly.)

1948
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:52,990
- I look like a beggar.
- We're at my place.

1949
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,060
Okay!

1950
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,260
It smells delicious.
Nice and pungent.

1951
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,260
My goodness.

1952
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,400
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- Hello.

1953
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,800
- Yes, hello.
- Hello!

1954
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,230
- We have to say hi like this?
- Oh, my!

1955
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,470
- Hello!
- I am embarrassed, but...

1956
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:05,570
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

1957
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,270
(Song Yi gets out
while looking around furtively too.)

1958
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,670
Let's go in.

1959
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,210
It's hot.

1960
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:17,650
(They quicken their steps
out of embarrassment.)

1961
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,810
- Are you certain?
- It'll be very tasty.

1962
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,250
- I'm embarrassed.
- This is nice.

1963
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,450
- Jae Seok, sit in the middle.
- Song Yi.

1964
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,450
Song Yi, sit here.

1965
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:25,890
- I'll sit in the middle.
- I'll sit here.

1966
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,860
It's cool in here.

1967
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,960
It's so hot today.

1968
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,730
How is it so hot?

1969
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,160
- It's so hot today.
- Still,

1970
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,700
the hot weather doesn't affect us
too much.

1971
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,760
We get in the van right away.

1972
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,130
You're so optimistic.

1973
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,330
Seriously. You've changed.

1974
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,400
- You've become optimistic.
- Yes.

1975
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,170
- Isn't it true?
- But...

1976
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,200
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1977
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,340
- Your eyes are clear.
- You know...

1978
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,110
- What?
- You must be in a good mood.

1979
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,140
- You're smiling a lot.
- Well,

1980
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,140
why wouldn't I be in a good mood?

1981
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,380
(Kim Jong Kook is crazy
in a positive way.)

1982
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,750
This restaurant is called
Auntie's Sundae, right?

1983
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,420
- Lee Hyo Ri's aunt runs it.
- Who?

1984
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,850
- Lee Hyo Ri's aunt.
- Her actual aunt?

1985
01:01:58,850 --> 01:01:59,890
- Yes. So...
- Who?

1986
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,420
- Lee Hyo Ri of Fin.K.L.?
- Since her aunt is too old now,

1987
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,830
- her cousin runs the restaurant.
- Her cousin.

1988
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,290
- Really?
- Hyo Ri's actual aunt and cousin.

1989
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,400
- Her actual aunt and cousin.
- Is that why...

1990
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,230
- there are photos of Hyo Ri?
- Yes.

1991
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:11,870
Really?

1992
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:12,930
I see.

1993
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,170
The food will be tasty.

1994
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,700
Her aunt is here.

1995
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,370
My goodness.

1996
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,070
How did we get so many celebrities?

1997
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,680
I came belatedly
since I had to wash my hands.

1998
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,740
You're Hyo Ri's aunt.

1999
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,780
- Yes.
- Lee Hyo Ri.

2000
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,350
- Lee Hyo Ri's aunt.
- Hello, sir.

2001
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

2002
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,950
You came a long way.

2003
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,220
I heard that this restaurant was run
by Hyo Ri's family.

2004
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,250
Yes.

2005
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,490
Does her aunt run the restaurant?

2006
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,590
- My mom is her aunt.
- Okay.

2007
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,860
- I'm her aunt's son.
- You're the son.

2008
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,630
- You're her cousin.
- You're Hyo Ri's cousin.

2009
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:42,130
Earlier, I called her and said
that you were coming.

2010
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:44,030
- Did you do that?
- Yes, I did.

2011
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,770
I'll try calling her later.

2012
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,770
- He resembles her a bit.
- I see the resemblance.

2013
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,940
- I see the resemblance in his face.
- I see it. I really do.

2014
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,880
- He resembles her.
- Especially when he smiles.

2015
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,040
How does he resemble her?

2016
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,380
- His eyes.
- For goodness' sake.

2017
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,810
- His eyes look similar.
- Seriously.

2018
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,280
- Seok Jin, she's your colleague.
- Seriously.

2019
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,980
What's his problem?

2020
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,050
She's your colleague.

2021
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,150
(He doesn't understand.)

2022
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,450
(Messaging Hyo Ri)

2023
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:07,020
- I messaged Hyo Ri
- Really?

2024
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,660
- How you guys look in real life...
- Okay.

2025
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:10,290
is different from TV.

2026
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,430
You guys look like babies.

2027
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,330
You mean that we look young.

2028
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,470
- My goodness.
- I see.

2029
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,900
We're Saja Boys.

2030
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:20,600
Sir,

2031
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,300
you put us in a good mood.

2032
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,940
- I bet we look different.
- Yes.

2033
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,070
(Unable to read the room,
Seok Jin is happy by himself.)

2034
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:26,570
I'm in your care.

2035
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,480
- He was born in 1966.
- Yes.

2036
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,810
How old are you?

2037
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,080
I was born
in the year of the horse as well.

2038
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,180
- My friend!
- Really?

2039
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,850
(It's nice to meet you, my friend!)

2040
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,650
- Stay seated.
- My friend!

2041
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,390
- Please make us tasty food.
- For goodness' sake.

2042
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,420
The year of the horse.

2043
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,190
That's so funny. What's going on?

2044
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,390
I can't believe it.

2045
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,960
- You graduated in 1985, right?
- Yes.

2046
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,060
- Seriously.
- Give me your number before you go.

2047
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,160
Okay then.

2048
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,400
He uses a Chungcheong dialect.

2049
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,870
He's Hyo Ri's cousin.

2050
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,400
- Sir, I just want sundae in mine.
- Okay.

2051
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,210
- All right.
- I want only meat.

2052
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,610
- I want only meat.
- Raise your hand...

2053
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,110
- if you want only meat.
- I want only meat.

2054
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,310
I want extra meat.

2055
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,080
I want meat
that doesn't have a lot of fat.

2056
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,180
Fat makes it tasty.

2057
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,480
- Stop it already.
- Fat makes it savory.

2058
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,550
He's Hyo Ri's cousin.

2059
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,750
Hyo Ri, I'm sorry.

2060
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,120
- I want them mixed.
- Raise your hand for the mixed one.

2061
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,890
- I want them mixed.
- Two mixed ones.

2062
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,190
I want the spicy one.

2063
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,790
- The spicy one?
- It's a good idea.

2064
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,890
- Shall we order an assorted sundae?
- We need sundae.

2065
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,200
- All done.
- We're in your care.

2066
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2067
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,600
- Please give us plates first.
- Okay.

2068
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,570
- Excuse me?
- What?

2069
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:27,970
You're making many mistakes today.

2070
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,300
Which mistakes did I make?

2071
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,970
He has her eyes, okay?

2072
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,340
- He does.
- He has her eyes.

2073
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,780
- He resembles Hyo Ri.
- Does he?

2074
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:35,880
He does.

2075
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,710
Thank you.

2076
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,450
Thank you.

2077
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,080
(They get side dishes
and an assorted sundae right away.)

2078
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,720
This is no joke.

2079
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,990
The guts next to sundae.

2080
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:45,550
Please give us one more.

2081
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:46,650
It's sundae made of blood.

2082
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,820
I want the guts, not sundae.

2083
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,830
It looks so tasty.

2084
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:53,290
- This is the small size.
- Look at this.

2085
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,930
- We need another one.
- Let's order one more.

2086
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,130
Why didn't you order the large size?

2087
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,470
Let's order one more.

2088
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,470
Let's eat sundae.

2089
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,940
- Cheers.
- Thank you for the food.

2090
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,240
- Byeongcheon sundae.
- In this situation,

2091
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:05,510
most people will share.

2092
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,070
Right? Most people will do that.

2093
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,840
Most people with common sense...

2094
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,410
will say, "Let's eat together."

2095
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,750
- Let's order one more sundae.
- Can we order just the guts?

2096
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,750
(The meat enthusiast,
Jong Kook eats the guts first.)

2097
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,680
- The guts.
- Let's order one more sundae.

2098
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,090
(Oh, my!)

2099
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,290
Byeongcheon sundae.

2100
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,590
You should try kkakdugi
at a restaurant like this one.

2101
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,090
Kkakdugi is tasty.

2102
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,030
(Impressed)

2103
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,470
(Even kkakdugi tastes great.)

2104
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,630
Their kkakdugi is tasty.

2105
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:34,970
Kkakdugi is tasty too.

2106
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,840
- It's sundae made with blood.
- These chopsticks are new.

2107
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,040
It's really tasty. Try it.

2108
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,070
- Let me try it.
- You're right.

2109
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,270
It's really tasty.

2110
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,380
(The rich and savory flavors
fill the mouth.)

2111
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,880
(It suits Food Fighter's tastes.)

2112
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,450
- Sundae is tasty.
- I'm not joking when I say this.

2113
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,980
Sundae is really tasty.

2114
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,650
I got a reply from Hyo Ri.

2115
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,120
She said that we should eat up...

2116
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,790
since we visited
her aunt's restaurant.

2117
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:56,760
Seriously, tell Hyo Ri
that the food is so tasty.

2118
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,060
It's really tasty.

2119
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,560
- You can message her yourself.
- Is it because I'm hungry?

2120
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,360
- What?
- You can tell her that it's tasty.

2121
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,630
Well,

2122
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,430
we've never talked on the phone.

2123
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,340
To be honest,

2124
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,700
I have Hyo Ri's number.

2125
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,970
- But I've never called her.
- Why not?

2126
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,270
Why don't you try it?

2127
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,980
She's scary.

2128
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,750
He finds her scary.

2129
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:18,980
(Seok Jin becomes timid
around superstars.)

2130
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,180
Do I have the correct number?

2131
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,880
(Rummaging)

2132
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,980
It's really tasty.

2133
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,390
I usually don't eat sundae.

2134
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:27,560
Should I try calling Hyo Ri?

2135
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,860
(Will he try calling Lee Hyo Ri
for the first time in his life?)

2136
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,890
You should use this opportunity
to call her.

2137
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:30,960
No, I won't do it.

2138
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,930
Try calling her.

2139
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:34,630
- Try calling her.
- This might be her old number.

2140
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,960
Try calling her.

2141
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,230
See if this number is correct.

2142
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,330
(Please check.)

2143
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:40,430
(Could it be incorrect?)

2144
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,200
- Is it correct?
- It's correct. It really is.

2145
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,270
(Thankfully, she gave him
the correct number!)

2146
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,410
- She seems to be free, so call her.
- No.

2147
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,540
Tell her that you're filming a show.

2148
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,280
(His long silence means
that he can't do it.)

2149
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,410
It's really tasty.

2150
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,120
(When Seok Jin is feeling
flustered,)

2151
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,220
Thank you.

2152
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,290
(sundaeguk gets served.)

2153
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,290
- Mine has extra meat.
- It has extra meat.

2154
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,860
Look at this.

2155
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:03,920
(The pork bone broth gives it
a clean and deep taste.)

2156
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,090
This is...

2157
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,930
- Look at this.
- This is insane.

2158
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:08,860
- It looks so tasty.
- This is insane. It looks so tasty.

2159
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,300
This is...

2160
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,070
(He tries a spoonful of soup
as it is.)

2161
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,070
- I'll add perilla seed.
- It's tasty.

2162
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,170
The taste is clean.

2163
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,840
- Try it.
- It's nice.

2164
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,780
- It's really tasty.
- Is it tasty?

2165
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,810
It's amazing.

2166
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,350
You should add rice.

2167
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,950
(Jong Kook's answer:
Sundaeguk, only meat)

2168
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:29,750
This is soul food for Koreans.

2169
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,550
Look at the extra meat. It's insane.

2170
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,550
(He adds a bowl of rice.)

2171
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,650
It's tasty.

2172
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,290
(He eats enough
to burn the top of his mouth.)

2173
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:37,090
It's nice
that the taste is too strong.

2174
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,230
It isn't too salty.

2175
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,460
The quality is insane.

2176
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,170
(In his bachelor days,)

2177
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:47,440
(he ate sundaeguk 3 days in a row.)

2178
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,000
(He inhales the dish
as it's his last time.)

2179
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,240
This is insane. Seriously.

2180
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,710
This is insane.

2181
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,210
Oh, my.

2182
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:56,340
It's like a fine dish.

2183
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,780
(The taste makes them glad
that they're in Cheonan.)

2184
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:58,950
Seriously.

2185
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,080
This restaurant makes tasty food.

2186
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,450
The meat is different.

2187
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,550
(The three members
who didn't dress up enjoy the food.)

2188
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,020
There is no Coca-Cola Zero,

2189
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,290
- so we ordered a regular one.
- Okay.

2190
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,060
I need Coca-Cola.

2191
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,060
It'll wash down the food.

2192
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,960
The wig keeps entering my mouth.

2193
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:17,230
Tuck it behind your ears.

2194
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,070
Where's my hat?

2195
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:23,240
I feel bad because it's so tasty.

2196
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,540
(Yu Jinu with unkempt hair)

2197
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,570
I feel bad.

2198
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:29,180
(He's sweating under the wig.)

2199
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:30,880
- It's tasty.
- Is it tasty?

2200
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,250
(Pumbaa Boys eat
to the best of their abilities.)

2201
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,450
It's really tasty.

2202
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,880
It's really tasty.

2203
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,650
It's really nice to come
to an unexpected city...

2204
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,420
very suddenly.

2205
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:43,860
- It's charming.
- The trip was unplanned.

2206
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,560
We almost couldn't eat sundaeguk.

2207
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,760
Nothing was planned today.

2208
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,060
- Exactly.
- It's really nice.

2209
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,400
I'm glad we came to Cheonan.

2210
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,630
(They inhale
the remaining sundaeguk.)

2211
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,570
Please continue to eat comfortably,

2212
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:56,470
but the current time is 1:36 p.m.

2213
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,670
- We need to hurry up.
- What?

2214
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:58,710
- By when did we need to finish?
- By 3 p.m.

2215
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,510
- By 3 p.m. Let's eat fast.
- By 3 p.m.

2216
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:02,210
- I can't eat fast since it's hot.
- I can't do it.

2217
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:03,640
Which items remain?

2218
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,510
Two remain.

2219
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:07,980
- With whom and what.
- Why.

2220
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,820
- Why.
- With whom and why.

2221
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,990
- Let's eat fast.
- What happens if we fail?

2222
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,450
- Eat in ten minutes.
- There will be a group penalty.

2223
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,190
- We need to hurry up.
- Let's hurry up.

2224
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,820
Shall we have a draw as we eat?

2225
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,260
Shall we have a draw as we eat?

2226
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,590
- Let's think as we eat.
- Yes.

2227
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,860
- Peel it off. Yes.
- This one?

2228
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,230
What is it?

2229
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:24,400
(The orange section,
"With whom" gets revealed.)

2230
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,070
As it says, it's "With whom."

2231
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,770
One of the questions you got was,

2232
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:32,870
"If you could change your name,
what would it be?"

2233
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,280
- That's right.
- That question...

2234
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,240
- was in orange.
- I think it'll be hard.

2235
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,010
You'll pick one of the names
you wrote down...

2236
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,780
and find a citizen with that name.

2237
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,250
Name? Which name should I pick?

2238
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,550
I haven't thought about changing it.

2239
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,950
(He writes something down.)

2240
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,960
(Laughing)

2241
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,520
- Be quiet.
- Isn't it a Chinese restaurant?

2242
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,490
(They didn't imagine finding
a citizen with that name.)

2243
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,260
I think it'll be hard.

2244
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,730
I'll read the names you wrote.
Jae Seok wrote, "Yu Bin."

2245
01:09:58,730 --> 01:09:59,770
Yu Bin.

2246
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:01,000
- Yu Bin is pretty common.
- And...

01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,610

2252

2253

- Yeon Hui is a good one.

2254

- Yeon Hui.

(Ji Hyo's answer: Celestial Woman)

2258
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,490
- "Celestial Woman."
- What's that?

2259
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,630
- No one will have that name.
- We can't choose that one.

2260
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:31,870
(There are some insane names.)

2261
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:35,270
Please pick a name.

2262
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,470
Who should pick it?

2263
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,940
The new groom should do it.

2264
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:39,570
Okay.

2265
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:41,310
Jong Kook finally got married.

2266
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,310
You were holding it tight.

2267
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,550
You can switch it.

2268
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,080
- Go ahead.
- Switch it.

2269
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,080
- She was holding it tight.
- Go with the initial hunch.

2270
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,090
- Switch it.
- Shall I switch it?

2271
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,820
- She was holding it tight.
- Okay.

2272
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,660
Check it later.

2273
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,790
I'll check it later.

2274
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,630
Which one was it? Celestial Woman?

2275
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:58,930
I rooted for the initial hunch.

2276
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:00,890
I'll check it later.

2277
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,700

- Jee Seong Bin.

2280
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:07,840
Jee Seong Bin.

2281
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,940
It's too hard.

2282
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,940
- Is it hard?
- It's a bit hard.

2283
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,570
(They succeeded in
eliminating one difficult name.)

2284

(Which name do they need to find?)

2287
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,050
There'll be someone named Yeon Hui.

2288
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,350
Jong Kook is a bit...
Yu Bin is pretty common, right?

2289
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,750
- Yu Bin is common.
- Yeon Hui is a good one.

2290
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:28,520

- Yu Bin is a good one.

2295

(Yu Bin)

2296
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,160
- Yu Bin is a good one.
- Yu Bin is a good one.

2297
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,730
- We can find Yu Bin.
- Yu Bin is a good one.

2298

The last name doesn't matter, right?

2299
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:41,770
That's right.

2300
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,770
My old manager's name was Yu Bin.

2301
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:46,070
I'll remove the sticker for why.
Here I go. Why.

2302

gets revealed next.)

2305

"What is your own way
of making memories with Jong Kook?"

2306
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,550
What was my answer?

2307
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,320
- What was my answer?
- You'll pick one of the answers...

2308
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,060
and do it with Yu Bin...

2309
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,890
- in order to get off work.
- Mine was drinking coffee.

2310
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,360
Mine won't work.

2311
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,100

01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,190
They can do it to each other.

2337
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,520
Slapping Jong Kook
will be memorable.

2338
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,760
- It'll be memorable.
- Right?

2339
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,190
He punched me 30 times once.

2340
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,990
Really? "Slap once."

2341
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,530
"Slap each other once."

2342
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,360
Jong Kook's answer is nice.

2343
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,900
- Mine is nice too.
- What is it?

2344
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:20,270
- Slapping.
- "Slap..."

2345
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:21,840
"while giving words of blessing."

2346
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,070
That isn't half bad.

2347
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,510
- It can be done.
- It'll end quickly.

2348
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,710
Ye Eun, pick one.

2349
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:26,910
Will we do this with Yu Bin?

2350
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:28,880
- Yes, it's the last one.
- We'll do this with Yu Bin.

2351
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,480
- Ye Eun, pick well.
- Okay.

2352
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,110
(A list of activities
that can be done with Yu Bin)

2353
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,580
- This one.
- Okay.

2354
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,180
- Good.
- Let's see.

2355
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,890
(Will it be a doable one?)

2356
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:40,920
Please.

2357
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,490
Please.

2358
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,760
"Slap while giving
words of blessing."

2359
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,360
- All right.
- Slapping.

2360
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,530
(They get a realistic mission!)

2361
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:49,960
- It's doable.
- Yes.

2362
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,370
- It's a simple one.
- It's a simple one.

2363
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:53,930
You'll need to meet Yu Bin...

2364
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,740
and give words of blessing
as you slap him or her.

2365
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,610
Yu Bin should slap hard.

2366
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,910
We'll do it too.

2367
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,140
Where will we meet Yu Bin?

2368
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,380
We'll need to go downtown.

2369
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,550
- Yu Bin is a common name.
- It won't be someone our age.

2370
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,020
It can be someone my age.

2371
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,620
- Let's find Yu Bin. Let's hurry.
- Let's do it.

2372
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,650
- Let's hurry.
- The current time...

2373
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:16,320
- is 1:50 p.m.
- Let's go.

2374
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,090
You must complete the mission
before 3 p.m...

2375
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,630
- in order to avoid the penalty.
- Let's do it.

2376
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,760
Thank you for the food.

2377
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,030
- Thank you for the food.
- It's 1:50 p.m.

2378
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:26,300
We have 1 hour and 10 minutes left.

2379
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:28,040
We'll need to take the van.

2380
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,170
- We'll need to go downtown.
- We'll need to go downtown.

2381
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:31,540
Earlier, we passed downtown.

2382
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,610
Let's go.

2383
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,070
We don't have much time.

2384
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,640
We need to hurry up.
We have about an hour.

2385
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,780
- Finding Yu Bin...
- Yu Bin.

2386
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,350
- I think...
- You know...

2387
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,520
we should go to the place
we were at earlier, downtown.

2388
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,850
I saw many people
who looked like Yu Bin.

2389
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:47,890
Now that we're here,

2390
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:50,090
- it'll be nice to look around.
- Hey.

2391
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:51,560
Let's eat a walnut cake.

2392
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,060
- Seok Jin.
- We don't have time for that.

2393
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,560
- It's right here.
- Stop trying to eat...

2394
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,800
- using the TV station's money.
- It's right here.

2395
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,230
- Wake up.
- It's right here.

2396
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,430
Buy it with your own money.

2397
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:01,570
- Please, Seok Jin.
- Do it just once.

2398
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,040
- Buy it with your own money.
- I mean... Hey.

2399
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,370
- Seriously.
- Sweet bean paste and butter.

2400
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:05,840
- For goodness' sake.
- How could we not eat...

2401
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,040
walnut cake in Cheonan?

2402
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,340
Let's eat a walnut cake.

2403
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,410
Fried soboro bread.

2404
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,910
- Our schedule is tight.
- It's too far.

2405
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,910
- If it's where we were...
- Still,

2406
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,180
- We traveled a long way to eat.
- we need to go downtown...

2407
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:17,720
to find Yu Bin.

2408
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,090
I think it'll be hard
to find Yu Bin.

2409
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,190
We don't have much time.

2410
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,590
- How will we find Yu Bin?
- This is bad.

2411
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:23,960
We need to hurry up.

2412
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,890
- We're here.
- This is downtown.

2413
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,730
- Yu Bin.
- We need to find Yu Bin.

2414
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:29,930
- We only have 30 minutes.
- Yu Bin.

2415
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:31,970
- But the mission isn't hard.
- Yu Bin.

2416
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,530
- We just need to find Yu Bin.
- It's hard.

2417
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,640
- How about an internet cafe?
- There was a fashion street.

2418
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,370
- Let's ask the employees.
- There was...

2419
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,240
a main street at the intersection.

2420
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,640
Let's go.

2421
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,780
- Let's go.
- We must find Yu Bin.

2422
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,780
- Let's do this.
- Let's not give up.

2423
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,780
- It won't be easy.
- We only have about 30 minutes.

2424
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,110
- It won't be easy. Thirty minutes.
- We don't have much time.

2425
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,110
Hello.

2426
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,720
- What?
- What's your name?

2427
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,180
- Ji Hyun.
- Ji Hyun.

2428
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,150
Do you have a friend named Yu Bin?

2429
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:53,890
- Yu Bin? No.
- No?

2430
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,720
- Yu Bin.
- We need to find Yu Bin.

2431
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,060
- Yu Bin is a common name.
- Really?

2432
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,360
- Take care. Thank you.
- Okay.

2433
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,630
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2434
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:00,760
It won't be easy.

2435
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,600
- Shall we spread out?
- Yes, let's look for Yu Bin.

2436
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,930
- Let's spread out in groups of two.
- All right.

2437
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:05,530
- Let's look for Yu Bin.
- Ji Hyo, come with me.

2438
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:07,330
- Yu Bin.
- Ma'am, come with me.

2439
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,640
- Okay.
- Yu Bin.

2440
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,870
(The hair salon sisters
make up a team.)

2441
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,640
Is your name Yu Bin by any chance?

2442
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,210
- What's your name?
- What?

2443
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,610
- What's your name?
- Min Seo.

2444
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:17,040
Min Seo. Are you okay
with being filmed?

2445
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,250
- What's this?
- Running Man.

2446
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,950
- What's your name?
- Aren't you Yu Bin?

2447
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,680
- No, I'm Hyo Jin.
- Hyo Jin.

2448
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,980
- What's your name?
- Min Woo.

2449
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,490
- Min Woo.
- In Kang.

2450
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,350
- In Kan?
- In Kang.

2451
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,760
(The camera is turned off.)

2452
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,660
(Reporter Jee's interview is a mess
with the turned-off camera.)

2453
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,590
- This is incredible.
- That's cool.

2454
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,700
Don't you have a friend named
Yu Bin?

2455
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,630
We had someone with that name
until two weeks ago.

2456
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,070
- Where?
- She was a part-timer.

2457
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:40,930
- Where? At this restaurant?
- Yes.

2458
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:42,500
(They missed Yu Bin
of the pork belly restaurant.)

2459
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,540
For goodness' sake.

2460
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,840
What's your name?
Is your name Yu Bin?

2461
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,140
- No.
- No?

2462
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,510
Do you have a friend
or an acquaintance named Yu Bin?

2463
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,650
No?

2464
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:55,020
Yu Bin is a pretty common name.

2465
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,250
It isn't easy to find Yu Bin.

2466
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,490
- Are you Yu Bin?
- She's Yu Bin.

2467
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,120
- Who? Really?
- Is she Yu Bin?

2468
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,320
Did you find Yu Bin?

2469
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,120
- Who? Really?
- Is she Yu Bin?

2470
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:06,890
- Are you Yu Bin?
- She's Yu Bin.

2471
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,060
- Who?
- Is she Yu Bin?

2472
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,560
Who?

2473
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,500
- Who? Really?
- Is she Yu Bin?

2474
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,530
You're lying!

2475
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:15,870
(Did they find Yu Bin
3 minutes upon arrival?)

2476
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:17,370
What's your name?

2477
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,240
- I'm sorry.
- Was it a joke?

2478
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,270
Yes.

2479
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:21,510
(It was a joke.)

2480
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,180
You're lying! It's a lie, right?

2481
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,540
Yes, it's a lie.

2482
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,180
- Is it a lie?
- It's a lie.

2483
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,310
She startled me.

2484
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,950
- Why...
- You're more handsome in real life.

2485
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,850
- Why did you lie?
- We've just met.

2486
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,850
- We met others...
- Suddenly...
and they asked for Yu Bin.

2487
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,620
- Really?
- I see.

2488
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,220
- What's your name?
- I'm Seo Yu Jin.

2489
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,360
- Yu Jin?
- Yu Jin?

2490
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:39,890
- What's your name?
- Min Ji.

2491
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,890
Min Ji.

2492
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,630
Do you have a friend named Yu Bin?

2493
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,630
(No.)

2494
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:46,900
All right. Thank you.

2495
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,100
- You're pretty.
- Thank you.

2496
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,000
- You're so pretty.
- Do you find this pretty?

2497
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,410
Where are you going?

2498
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,040
We're just looking around.

2499
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,080
- I see.
- Okay.

2500
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,880
- You're more handsome in real life.
- Go around once more.

2501
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,610
This is...

2502
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,520
"Demon..." What was the title?

2503
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,580
- "Demon Hunters."
- Saja Boys.

2504
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,680
- Next week...
- Congratulations on your wedding.

2505
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,720
- Thank you.
- Next week, he'll get married.

2506
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,720
- Take care.
- Be quiet.

2507
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:10,820
- Hold on. Yu Bin.
- Let's go this way.

2508
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,930
- Yu Bin is a common name,
- Is your name Yu Bin?

2509
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,260
Yu Bin is a common name,

2510
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,000
Yu Bin is a common name,

2511
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,630
Hello. Do you have an acquaintance
named Yu Bin?

2512
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,400
- No.
- No? It's too bad.

2513
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,070
- Yu Bin is a rare name.
- That way.

2514
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,670
(They walk around
with no luck for 5 minutes.)

2515
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,510
A part-timer named Yu Bin quit...

2516
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:29,580
- not too long ago.
- Really?

2517
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,080
- Where?
- That restaurant.

2518
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,450
- Really?
- They said Yu Bin quit recently.

2519
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,420
Where does this Yu Bin live?

2520
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:38,590
It must be somewhere around here.

2521
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,020
- That's right.
- Right?

2522
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,460
- It must be this neighborhood.
- But we don't have time.

2523
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,060
We can travel.

2524
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,420
- But we don't have time.
- There are...

2525
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,630
- so many people inside.
- It's a cafe.

2526
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,590
- Let's go inside.
- There are so many people.

2527
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,330
- Shall we go inside?
- There are so many people.

2528
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:50,630
There are so many people
in this cafe.

2529
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:51,700
There are so many people.

2530
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:52,930
- Hello.
- Hello.

2531
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,230
(Perhaps someone named Yu Bin
will be inside!)

2532
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,670
I'm sorry, but...

2533
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:57,140
- What?
- Hello.

2534
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,970
- Hello.
- Is someone named Yu Bin here?

2535
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:01,940
- Is someone named Yu Bin here?
- Yu Bin.

2536
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,310
(Did Yu Bin...)

2537
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:06,410
(raise her hand?)

2538
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,520
- Yu Bin?
- Yu Bin?

2539
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:10,650
- Bin.
- Min.

2540
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:11,750
- Yu Min.
- No?

2541
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,220
(She's Yu Min.)

2542
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,890
- She's Yu Min.
- Yu Min.

2543
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,990
- Is someone named Yu Bin here?
- Is there no Yu Bin?

2544
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,490
- Is there no Yu Bin?
- Is there no Yu Bin?

2545
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,830
- This cafe is so popular.
- This place...

2546
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:23,600
- Everyone on that side...
- What a popular cafe.

2547
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,300
- is filming us.
- We're filming each other.

2548
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,970
(The 1st and last meet-and-greet
for Sajja Boys)

2549
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,810
- What a popular cafe.
- Is there no Yu Bin?

2550
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:35,040
- This place is so...
- No?

2551
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,710
Don't you have
an acquaintance named Yu Bin?

2552
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:37,880
- Yu Bin.
- Is there no Yu Bin?

2553
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,680
- No?
- She's Yu Min.

2554
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,480
- Are you Yu Min?
- So close.

2555
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,180
- Don't you have a friend...
- I'm really craving coffee.

2556
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,650
- named Yu Bin?
- Coffee smells amazing here.

2557
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,650
- Ma'am.
- May we have a cup of coffee?

2558
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,020
- What?
- Aren't you embarrassed?

2559
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,260
- I'm a bit embarrassed.
- A cup of coffee.

2560
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,320
- We don't have time.
- Do you want a cup of coffee?

2561
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,730
- A cup of coffee.
- We need to hurry up and leave.

2562
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:54,290
- Why?
- Hurry up.

2563
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,360
- Okay.
- Thank you. Have a good day.

2564
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2565
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,630
- Bye!
- But this place...

2566
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,370
- Have a nice day.
- The cafe here is doing well.

2567
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:01,600
- It's a nice cafe.
- We passed by it earlier.

2568
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,240
It's so hot today.

2569
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,640
- It's totally...
- Hello.

2570
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,740
Are you Yu Bin?

2571
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:08,440
- I'm not.
- You aren't?

2572
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,240
- It's so hot.
- Yu Bin...

2573
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,550
- Unexpectedly,
- Hey,

2574
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:12,950
- why did you write Yu Bin?
- there might be a Yu Bin...

2575
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:13,980
among mothers.

2576
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,650
That's statistically not easy.

2577
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:17,350
- Listen to the cicadas.
- Finding Yu Bin is hard.

2578
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,620
Finding Yu Bin isn't easy.

2579
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:20,850
- It's not easy.
- Are you Yu Bin?

2580
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,790
- I'm not.
- She's not.

2581
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,820
It's so hot today.

2582
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,790
But Yu Bin
isn't a totally random name.

2583
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:27,790
- It's not.
- It's actually not.

2584
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,530
- Over there...
- It's possible to find a Yu Bin.

2585
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:31,530
- Right.
- There are many people. Let's go.

2586
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,070
- I don't think this place will do.
- Hurry up and come.

2587
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:34,970
This is so embarrassing.

2588
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,340
Hurry up, Haha.

2589
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,940
I don't think
I can walk around here.

2590
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:38,940
(They reach the main road
with many people.)

2591
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,040
Hurry up.

2592
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,810
- We're looking for Yu Bin.
- Are there any Yu Bins?

2593
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:45,380
Yu Bin. We're looking for Yu Bin.

2594
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,550
Are there any Yu Bins?

2595
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,720
- Yu Bin. Hello.
- Yu Bin.

2596
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,020
(Walking by)

2597
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,450
(Walking by again)

2598
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,190
I think people don't know
who we are.

2599
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,220
Hello.

2600
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,960
- Are you Yu Bin?
- Are you Yu Bin?

2601
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,330
- You're not?
- Are you Yu Bin?

2602
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:00,360
(The citizens don't react so much.)

2603
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,530
(Se Chan didn't even wear
any costume.)

2604
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,700
Haha.

2605
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:05,900
What? You...

2606
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,200
I should move with a camera.
It's so embarrassing.

2607
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,240
- Haha.
- Yes?

2608
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,340
- People don't care about us.
- Right.

2609
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,970
- I guess we look scary.
- Yes.

2610
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,340
Let's go over here.

2611
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,940
Haha.

2612
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,280
Hello. Are there...

2613
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,050
(He takes off his glasses
just in case they recognize him.)

2614
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:23,050
Are there any Yu Bins here?

2615
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,250
Yu Bin?

2616
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,990
(They're silent.)

2617
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:29,320
Yu Bin. Are there any Yu Bins here?

2618
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:31,120
Are there any Yu Bins here?

2619
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,330
They don't know who he is.

2620
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,130
Are there any Yu Bins
at the bus stop?

2621
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,160
Be healthy.

2622
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:40,230
- They don't know who you are.
- Hello.

2623
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:41,800
They don't know who you are.

2624
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,410
Come here. Let's stand here
and look for Yu Bin.

2625
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,870
- Are you Yu Bin?
- Is your name Yu Bin?

2626
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,010
This is so difficult.

2627
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,050
How do we find Yu Bin?

2628
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,150
(The two kids are wandering around
on the main road.)

2629
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,580
May I ask you something?

2630
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,820
What's your name?

2631
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,320
We're looking for someone
with a certain name.

2632
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,620
We were wondering if your name
matches it.

2633
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:04,620
What's the name?

2634
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,630
Yu Bin.

2635
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:08,360
- Yu Bin.
- We have a friend named Yu Bin.

2636
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,330
You have a friend named Yu Bin?

2637
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:12,230
- Would it be hard to call her here?
- Really?

2638
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:13,330
Yu Bin...

2639
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:15,000
- Then...
- Where...

2640
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,240
Where does she work?

2641
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:19,470
I didn't recognize them.

2642
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:20,910
I'm sorry.

2643
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,910
- We're...
- We look like this now.

2644
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,210
Where does she work from?
Is it near?

2645
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:26,450
- Is it near?
- No, it's far.

2646
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:28,650
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

2647
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:29,750
Thank you.

2648
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:33,620
Jong Kook. There's a bus stop
that way.

2649
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,220
- You didn't find Yu Bin, right?
- There were all mothers.

2650
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,690
- There was no one.
- Mother...

2651
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:39,330
Why don't we write it
on a white sketch book,

2652
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:41,360
"We're looking for Yu Bin,"

2653
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,530
- and walk around?
- That would be better.

2654
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:43,600
- Wouldn't that be better?
- Yes.

2655
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,270
- Let's just write it.
- Yu Bin...

2656
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,400
Let's hope for a miracle.

2657
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:48,540
- We're looking for Yu Bin.
- Yu Bin.

2658
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,940
"We're looking for Yu Bin."

2659
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,440
Yes. That's not bad.

2660
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,740
- Yu Bin?
- No, I'm not.

2661
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,380
You have a BCG vaccination mark.

2662
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,850
Something got on my skin.

2663
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:02,480
Are there any Yu Bins?

2664
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,950
We're looking for Yu Bin.

2665
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:08,090
It's hot. It's so hot.

2666
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,990
We don't have much time left.

2667
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,130
This is the main street.

2668
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:14,290
- Yu Bin?
- Yu Bin.

2669
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:15,730
- Do you know any Yu Bins?
- You're Yu Bin, right?

2670
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:17,330
- Pardon?
- I'm Da Bin.

2671
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:19,330
- Da Bin?
- Da Bin.

2672
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:22,200
Are there any Yu Bins?
Many men are also called Yu Bin.

2673
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,540
- Are you Yu Bin?
- Yu Bin!

2674
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,040
- I'm Seon Bin.
- Seon Bin!

2675
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:27,110
What a shame.

2676
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,310
- Yu Bin!
- Yu Bin!

2677
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,780
- Yu Bin?
- Please.

2678
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,350
- What?
- Mister!

2679
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:34,810
- Yu Bin?
- Yu Bin!

2680
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:36,720
- Mister!
- He's Yu Bin?

2681
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,450
Are you Yu Bin?

2682
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,420
- Yu Bin?
- Yes.

2683
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,720
That's me.

2684
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,760
- Yes.
- Pardon?

2685
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,790
That's me.

2686
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,890
What's your name?

2687
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,690
What's your name?

2688
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:48,700
- What's your name?
- Could you show us your ID?

2689
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,630
- Is your name Yu Bin?
- I'm more than...

2690
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:53,730
(Patting)

2691
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:55,700
I'm more than 60 years old.

2692
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:58,000
- No, that's not...
- That's not what we asked.

2693
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,240
- What?
- Wait...

2694
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:02,540
"I'm more than 60 years old."

2695
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,610
- What is this?
- I feel so let down.

2696
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:06,280
Yu Bin!

2697
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,350
- Anyone named Yu Bin?
- Yu Bin.

2698
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,850
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is standing
in front of a jewelry store.)

2699
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,090
Excuse me, are you Yu Bin?

2700
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,590
- Are you Yu Bin?
- It's Yu Jae Seok!

2701
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:20,930
Really?

2702
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:23,130
Are you Yu Bin?

2703
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,030
- There's no Yu Bin here.
- No?

2704
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:26,830
Can I take a picture with you?

2705
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,540
We have to find someone
within a time limit.

2706
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:30,800
Please come next time.

2707
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,040
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

2708
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,070
Have a nice day.

2709
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:35,110
(I didn't recognize them!)

2710
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:39,080
(The people of Cheonan
didn't recognize the other members.)

2711
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:41,450
- Yu Bin.
- Hello.

2712
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:46,050
(This happened even when
Se Chan was in his normal clothes.)

2713
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:49,120
- Yu Bin?
- I'm not her.

2714
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,160
- Are you Yu Bin?
- No.

2715
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:52,690
Jae Seok.

2716
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:55,030
- Are you Yu Bin?
- I'm not.

2717
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:56,900
Are you Yu Bin?

2718
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,000
- I'm Yu Gyeong.
- Yu Gyeong?

2719
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,470
(He keeps finding people
with similar names.)

2720
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,100
This isn't easy.
Are there no Yu Bins?

2721
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,170
- Are there no Yu Bins?
- But that name...

2722
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:06,870
wouldn't be common...

2723
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:08,210
- among very young people.
- This...

2724
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:09,380
Very young people...

2725
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:11,340
- Congratulations on your marriage!
- Thank you.

2726
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:14,080
- Live kindly.
- Thank you.

2727
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,650
- She told you to live kindly.
- Yes.

2728
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,620
Kindly?

2729
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,790
"Congratulations on your marriage!
Live kindly."

2730
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,790
- So...
- Yes?

2731
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:23,920
- Have you so far...
- It's not like I've been living...

2732
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,020
like a gangster until now.

2733
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,890
- Right.
- Yes.

2734
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:29,530
Yu Bin. Anyone named Yu Bin?

2735
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:30,800
- "I'm Yu Bin!"
- Yes. I'm Yu Bin.

2736
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,830
Yu Bin!

2737
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:32,930
- "I'm Yu Bin!"
- Yes. I'm Yu Bin.

2738
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:34,070
Yu Bin!

2739
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,600
- I'm...
- Yu Bin.

2740
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,970
I wanted my nickname to be Yu Bin.

2741
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:38,200
It's Yu Bin.

2742
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,240
- There are no Yu Bins. We failed.
- What do we do?

2743
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,340
- Yu Bin...
- We still have time.

2744
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,240
- Let's keep looking.
- You still have 18 minutes left.

2745
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,010
- Eighteen minutes.
- She's Da Bin.

2746
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,010
Da Bin?

2747
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,220
- Da Bin and that's Seon Bin.
- It's really hard.

2748
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,120
- Seon Bin?
- Seon Bin.

2749
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,850
There are no Yu Bins.

2750
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,620
- It was a shame.
- Let's go.

2751
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,360
But...

2752
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,060
- it's not easy.
- Yu Bin.

2753
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:00,160
Let's go this way together.

2754
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,230
(They've searched through
the street, but they search again.)

2755
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:02,530
Yu Bin.

2756
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,830
We're looking for Yu Bin.

2757
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:06,670
Anyone whose name is Yu Bin.

2758
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,700
- Are you Yu Bin?
- No, I'm not.

2759
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,370
Yu Bin?

2760
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,910
No.

2761
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,240
Are there no Yu Bins in Cheonan?

2762
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,640
Can we use a boyfriend chance?

2763
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,650
- Pardon?
- Her boyfriend's name is Yu Bin.

2764
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:22,680
Where is he?

2765
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:26,620
(If her boyfriend is nearby...)

2766
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:29,620
- But...
- Where?

2767
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:30,720
- Yeoju.
- In the military.

2768
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,330
Yeoju in Gyeonggi Province?

2769
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:33,360
(He's flustered.)

2770
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:35,530
He joined the military?

2771
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:39,700
He can't get out now.

2772
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:43,040
What a shame.

2773
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,910
Are there any Yu Bins?

2774
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,740
- Are you not Yu Bin?
- I guess not.

2775
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,180
Are there any Yu Bins?

2776
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,610
- Anyone whose name is Yu Bin.
- Yu Bin.

2777
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,350
- Is your name...
- I don't think it is.

2778
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:54,610
- Yu Bin.
- Have a nice day.

2779
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,720
- You know...
- What?

2780
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,750
Her name was Yu Bin.

2781
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,150
- We can't see him?
- Where is he?

2782
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:03,120
- He's in Yeoju now.
- Goodness. Why is he in Yeoju?

2783
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,460
- He joined the military.
- The military?

2784
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:07,190
- The military?
- That can't be helped.

2785
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,430
Live kindly.

2786
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,960
- You still...
- Is anyone's name...

2787
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,330
- Yu Bin here?
- Yu Bin.

2788
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:13,830
- I should live kindly.
- At this rate...

2789
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,870
- It's me.
- What?

2790
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,140
- Who?
- Really?

2791
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:19,040
- You're lying.
- Really? You're lying.

2792
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,270
- Really?
- It's me.

2793
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,340
- What?
- Who?

2794
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,280
(A citizen claims to be Yu Bin!)

2795
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,480
- For real?
- Really?

2796
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,550
- Yu Bin.
- Really?

2797
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:31,780
- May we check your ID?
- Are you really Yu Bin?

2798
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:32,790
Goodness.

2799
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,820
- Is she really Yu Bin?
- Is this true?

2800
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:38,020
(Number of times
people impersonated Yu Bin)

2801
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,530
(1. The girls who cried wolf)

2802
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:45,370
(2. Person with a name
with a similar pronunciation)

2803
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:51,840
(3. Boyfriend
in the military called Yu Bin)

2804
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:57,280
(4. An attack of
the Chungcheong Province joke)

2805
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,610
- Just the name.
- We just need to check that.

2806
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:01,480
(Would she really be Yu Bin?)

2807
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,380
- Only the producers should see it.
- Is it true?

2808
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,890
(Her name is...)

2809
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,590
Yes. Her name is Jang Yu Bin.

2810
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:12,990
(Her name is Yu Bin.)

2811
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:15,400
- We found Yu Bin!
- Goodness.

2812
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,100
- We looked everywhere for you.
- Yu Bin.

2813
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,430
- Yu Bin...
- Mother.

2814
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,770
- They found Yu Bin.
- They found Yu Bin? Let's go.

2815
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:21,270
(The good news was delivered.)

2816
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,270
We found Yu Bin!

2817
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:23,900
- We looked everywhere for you.
- Yu Bin.

2818
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,610
(They finally found Yu Bin,
the name Jae Seok mindlessly wrote.)

2819
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:27,210
- Mother.
- I wasn't so sure.

2820
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:29,240
- Come this way.
- Yu Bin.

2821
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:31,810
Where were you going?

2822
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:32,810
We got a massage.
- Massage?
- You got a massage?

2823
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:34,810
- Yu Bin...
- How...

2824
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,020
How did we find Yu Bin here?

2825
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,520
Thank you so much.

2826
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,550
- Did you find her? This is great.
- Goodness.

2827
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:39,920
- We found her!
- We found her!

2828
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,920
- This is Yu Bin.
- Yu Bin.

2829
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,290
- It's really Yu Bin.
- She's Jang Yu Bin.

2830
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:44,560
Yu Bin. This is touching.

2831
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,290
Thank you for being born as Yu Bin.

2832
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:47,590
Thank you.

2833
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:48,960
You need you
to do a mission with us.

2834
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,460
It's a very simple mission.
It will take a short time.

2835
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:53,330
We will continue
in the clothing store over there.

2836
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:54,530
- We asked them.
- Did they say okay?

2837
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:56,000
- Please come with us, Yu Bin.
- Please.

2838
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,140
- Please come with us, ma'am.
- Okay.

2839
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:59,040
- Thank you.
- This will be a happy memory.

2840
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,140
- Thank you.
- My gosh. This is really...

2841
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,680
We found Yu Bin.

2842
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:04,840
Yu Bin.

2843
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,850
We really found her.

2844
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,110
We found Yu Bin.

2845
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:08,850
Congratulations.

2846
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:11,650
- Her boyfriend is in the military.
- My gosh.

2847
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:13,190
Where is Madam Jee Seok Soon?

2848
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:14,390
He will come.

2849
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:16,120
Gosh, Cheonan.

2850
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:18,620
(What?)

2851
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,390
I'm sorry.

2852
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,660
Excuse me, but may I have your name?

2853
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:25,000
(He's coming back
with unintentional laughter.)

2854
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,170
- Here...
- We finally found her.

2855
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:28,670
- I know.
- After we searched for a while,

2856
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,740
Yu Bin suddenly showed up
and said she was Yu Bin.

2857
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,340
- How did we...
- How did you know?

2858
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:34,210
- We were about to give up.
- I was passing by.

2859
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,940
And I talked to you just in case.

2860
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:37,210
I enjoy watching Running Man.

2861
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,510
That's amazing.

2862
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,280
- Seriously, this is a miracle.
- Right.

2863
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,580
So, your name is Jang Yu Bin.

2864
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:42,620
And what is your name?

2865
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:44,120
Me? I'm Yang Eun Hye.

2866
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,590
- Eun Hye.
- Eun Hye.

2867
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:48,120
Yu Bin, may I ask what you do?

2868
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,660
I do ballet.

2869
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,490
- I see.
- Really?

2870
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,560
Madam Jee, we found her.

2871
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,330
- My goodness.
- We found Yu Bin.

2872
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,430
Which one is Yu Bin?

2873
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:58,230
- Here's Yu Bin.
- Nice to meet you.

2874
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:00,370
When Eun Hye first saw you...

2875
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:01,700
(Startled)

2876
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

2877
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,770
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2878
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:05,910
- Are you her mother?
- Yes.

2879
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:07,170
I see. Nice to meet you.

2880
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:10,110
For your information,
you are supposed to do something...

2881
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:11,810
- after finding Yu Bin.
- Right.

2882
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:13,380
You have to finish the mission
to succeed.

2883
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,380
- We have a mission.
- It is 2:47 p.m. now.

2884
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:17,220
- We have to hurry.
- Let's hurry.

2885
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,280
We can interview them
after finishing it first.

2886
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,550
Only one of us...

2887
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:20,920
- should do the mission, right?
- Yes.

2888
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:23,060
- I think Ye Eun should do it.
- My gosh.

2889
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,360
Who do you want to do it with?

2890
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,390
Right. Who?

2891
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:26,430
- I'd love to do it with you.
- She should know what it is.

2892
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:27,530
All right.

2893
01:30:27,530 --> 01:30:29,960
- How would I do that?
- The president of Gen Z.

2894
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:31,460
- Thank you, Yu Bin.
- All right.

2895
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,400
- Today, we are doing...
- We should explain first.

2896
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,600
Let me explain what we're doing.

2897
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,270
We should find Yu Bin and...

2898
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:40,370
"In Cheonan, dress as Saja Boys,
eat sundaeguk,"

2899
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:42,210
"and slap each other in the face
with Yu Bin..."

2900
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:46,210
"while exchanging
well-wishing remarks to go home."

2901
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:48,210
(Slap in the face?)

2902
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,780
- It's not like we should slap hard.
- It doesn't have to be hard.

2903
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:52,520
- Right.
- Something cute.

2904
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,290
- But they just met today.
- About this hard.

2905
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:56,160
- About this hard.
- About this hard.

2906
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,320
All right. Ye Eun, you go first.

2907
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,890
- Ye Eun, we should hurry.
- Ye Eun.

2908
01:30:58,890 --> 01:30:59,930
- Yu Bin.
- Say well-wishing remarks.

2909
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:01,790
- Yu Bin does ballet.
- Well-wishing remarks.

2910
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:04,700
- Ballet.
- I hope you will become...

2911
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:07,670
- the best ballerina...
- She's not a ballet athlete.

2912
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,540
and the talk of the town.

2913
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,170
- I hope you'll be famous.
- A world-class ballerina.

2914
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:12,570
A world-renowned ballerina.

2915
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:14,440
- Right.
- You have the potential.

2916
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,580
Call her a hero.

2917
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:16,680
Hero.

2918
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:18,140
Hero.

2919
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,380
(Touching her cheek
while wishing her good luck)

2920
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:21,750
Someone
who will shine brightly in Korea.

2921
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:23,850
I hope to see you for a long time.

2922
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:25,620
(To Ye Eun)

2923
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:29,160
(A loving word,
hoping for her long-running career)

2924
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,160
This is nice.

2925
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,290
- All right.
- That's nice.

2926
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:33,660
It is 2:49 p.m. now.

2927
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:34,760
(A dramatic success
with 10 minutes left)

2928
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,530
- This is crazy.
- It was so close.

2929
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,860
- This is a gift.
- We have Onnuri gift certificates.

2930
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:40,430
Yu Bin, this is our gift for you.

2931
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,000
- This is for you.
- Congratulations.

2932
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Thank you so much.

2933
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,440
We are very grateful.

2934
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:45,810
Who found Yu Bin?

2935
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:47,340
We walked around for a long time.

2936
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:48,880
Her mother came to us.

2937
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,040
- If she didn't come...
- Otherwise, we would've failed.

2938
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:52,780
They showed up right on time.

2939
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:55,620
We'd like to thank
the citizens of Cheonan.

2940
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2941
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:59,650
You finished performing
what the sentence said before 3 p.m.,

2942
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:01,850
so you may go home
without getting a penalty.

2943
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,720
That was so dramatic.

2944
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,130
- It was really dramatic.
- Thank you.

2945
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:07,560
(We thank the citizens of Cheonan
for their love and support.)

2946
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,730
Okay.

2947
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,530
(A grand party on a national scale)

2948
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:13,770
(The loudest
and fanciest party ever)

2949
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:14,830
You have everything...

2950
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:16,000
- that Jong Kook hates.
- He might swear.

2951
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,670
(There's one more thing
that he hates.)

2952
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:19,740
(A man behind the celebratory party)

2953
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,270
(The man who upsets Jong Kook,
Cha Tae Hyun)

2954
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:22,710
As soon as I picked up
the microphone...

2955
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:24,340
(As his best friend, Tae Hyun
reveals stories about his wedding.)

2956
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,310
(He's drawing the face.)

2957
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,450
What are you doing?

2958
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:29,080
(The montage of Jong Kook's wife
is revealed for the first time.)

2959
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,750
(He has to stop this party.)

2960
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:32,250
(I'll give you a chance to get rid
of the celebration set.)

2961
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:33,690
(They all have to work together
to avoid a loud party.)

2962
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:35,320
(The man who is determined
to win and stop the party)

2963
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,720
(It's even harder for the ones
who are holding him.)

2964
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,020
(We have to get it wrong
with ridiculous answers.)

2965
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,530
(The people who try to celebrate it
to the fullest by failing)

2966
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:40,760
(He goes into the water
on the first attempt.)

2967
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,890
(The plan succeeds
in a pathetic way.)

2968
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,360
(Will they celebrate it
without any balloons and banners?)

2969
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:46,070
(Will they keep all the props
by any means possible?)

2970
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:47,400
(Do you want us to get rid of it?)

2971
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,830
(What kind of party
will they end up having?)

2972
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:50,500
(Congratulatory Delegation
With Kook's Patience)
