1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,110
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,810
(Running Man)

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,280
We're finally here.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,650
(The place that welcomes them with the scent of the ocean)

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,650
So, this is the Tongyeong I've only heard about.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,760
(Tongyeong)

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,019
This is my first time here.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,260
For me, Tongyeong is...

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,590
- The weather is nice. - Okay!

10
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,760
(The members are gathered at a port in Tongyeong.)

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,599
The weather is amazing today.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,429
- Hello. - Hello.

13
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,899
Hello.

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,569
- We're finally here. - So this is Tongyeong.

15
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,439
My gosh. I want to eat some raw fish.

16
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,110
The weather is beautiful.

17
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,339
- Seriously... - It's picturesque.

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,779
It's a lot warmer than Seoul here.

19
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,210
(The port city of Tongyeong is still warm in November.)

20
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,679
- It's like a painting. - The sky is...

21
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,250
- The air is so clean. - It's like a painting.

22
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,810
Why am I seeing the moon?

23
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:44,179
It's like the sky of LA. Seriously.

24
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,919
- The sky of LA. - This is Tongyeong.

25
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,590
(Mr. LA can't stop talking about LA when he is in Tongyeong.)

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,389
- Tongyeong. - But the sky looks like LA.

27
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,889
It's so blue over there.

28
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,060
- I know. - Look. This is crazy.

29
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,320
(Seok Sam is seeing the blue sky for the first time.)

30
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,420
It's picturesque.

31
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,330
- Isn't that obvious? - It's picturesque.

32
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,299
Of course, the sky is blue.

33
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,730
(Suspicions of habitual reactions)

34
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,659
I don't know. I think Seok Jin is strange these days.

35
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,830
- What? - Obviously, the sky is blue.

36
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,229
- Seok Jin is... - Hey.

37
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,840
- Don't get upset. - Have you ever seen such a blue?

38
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,039
- Have you seen it before? - Of course, it's blue.

39
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,309
- We can't see this blue in Seoul. - It's rare.

40
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,139
- Be honest. I'm right. - Yes. We can't see it.

41
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,180
(Mr. LA is the only one who can relate.)

42
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,639
- By the way, Ye Eun. - Yes?

43
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,279
- Look at your outfit. - You...

44
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,650
- It looks like the Himalayas. - It looks like...

45
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,349
- Are you here to climb mountains? - you're in Siberia.

46
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,550
(The Eskimo is completely geared up.)

47
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,419
- You remind me of "Family Outing." - Really?

48
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,119
- Yes. - By the way, Seok Jin...

49
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,549
- What? - looks like Subway.

50
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,690
- Seok Jin. - Subway?

51
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,759
I heard it would be cold.

52
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,529
- Really? - Because of the colors.

53
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,290
Are they dressed like this?

54
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,360
- I've only had it delivered. - I was surprised to see you.

55
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,260
("Would you like to remove any veggies?")

56
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,070
You're a part-timer.

57
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,900
A part-timer at Subway.

58
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,970
- A part-timer at Subway. - Welcome.

59
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,069
Daniel just came back from filming a movie,

60
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,440
and he's playing the role of a man in his twenties.

61
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,010
What?

62
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,050
(A bold casting choice)

63
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,349
- I was also a little... - That doesn't sound right.

64
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,149
- Isn't that too much? - I'm worried.

65
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,150
I don't understand why the director...

66
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,349
There will be a lot of post-filming work.

67
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,090
- That's why I got my hair permed. - Yes.

68
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,520
It's a man in his twenties,

69
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,790
(His character)

70
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,319
and he's a thug's henchman who wants to live...

71
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,430
a life in the dark.

72
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,890
A henchman suits him well.

73
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,400
(Now they understand why he was cast.)

74
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,330
- That sounds about right. - A henchman sounds good.

75
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,100
- A henchman. - The perm is a little...

76
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,070
- All right. - It doesn't suit him.

77
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,030
- I know. - You got a perm,

78
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,040
but you don't seem as lively as men in their twenties.

79
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,339
- A real man in his twenties... - The perm...

80
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,469
and a man in his forties with a perm are different.

81
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,209
- The perm doesn't look lively. - I asked the hairdresser...

82
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,880
(Feeling wronged)

83
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,310
- to make me look like Gen Z. - I know you did,

84
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,249
but the curls in your hair and the feel itself...

85
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,780
(The youthful bounce of the 20s can't be replicated by a perm.)

86
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,579
- Haha looked like that with a perm. - His hair is a lot thinner.

87
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,679
- Right. - That's why.

88
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,920
- That's why it looks different. - I got a perm and looked like this.

89
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,590
His hair is limp.

90
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,529
This is Junghwa Harbor in Tongyeong.

91
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,690
(This is Junghwa Harbor in Tongyeong.)

92
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,460
It's been a really long time since we've been to Tongyeong.

93
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,229
Tongyeong!

94
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,859
Let's first meet the guest who comes to mind when you think of Tongyeong.

95
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,429
- Kyeong Hwan? - You punk.

96
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,940
(Which guest comes to mind when you think of Tongyeong?)

97
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,500
I've been seeing him every week.

98
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,340
- Really? - Kyeong Hwan is popular now.

99
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,540
Hello? Hey.

100
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,310
- Yes, Mr. Mayor. - He's faking it again.

101
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,910
(The setup is excessive from the start.)

102
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,509
- What? He's faking things. - My gosh.

103
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,280
He's like that only for the opening.

104
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,049
Mr. Mayor, the members of Running Man will be there.

105
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,120
(Going on)

106
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,349
- All right. - Please get things ready.

107
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,990
- By the way... - By the way...

108
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,050
(I am calling the mayor of Tongyeong.)

109
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,820
- All right. - I'm worried.

110
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,559
I spoke with the mayor of Tongyeong.

111
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,820
(The son of Tongyeong, Heo Kyeong Hwan)

112
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,219
- With the mayor? - He's faking it.

113
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,489
This is the fun of it.

114
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,330
(He's always enthusiastic at the beginning.)

115
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,400
I forgot what to do today.

116
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,500
(But he's not so funny when he's on Running Man.)

117
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
"I will never go back there!"

118
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,199
Why am I so bad when I'm on Running Man?

119
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm really funny on other shows.

120
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,610
(Will he be funny in Tongyeong, his home ground?)

121
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,739
- Hello. Yes. - Hey.

122
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,969
- I've known... - Yes.

123
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,680
Kyeong Hwan for a long time.

124
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
But this is my first time...

125
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:25,979
- to be in his hometown. - It's the first time.

126
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,749
- That's true. - You should've come with your dad.

127
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,350
(The social butterfly of Tongyeong)

128
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,619
- My dad can come right away. - Really?

129
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,749
- But please take care of me first. - I'd like to meet your dad.

130
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,419
- Kyeong Hwan is popular these days. - Why do you look short today?

131
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,490
He got shorter, right?

132
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,220
(Short and fat)

133
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,860
Why is that?

134
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
- This is funny. - My legs...

135
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,729
- The shoes are low. - Are you tired?

136
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,829
(Sneakers without heels, )

137
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,829
- They have low heels. - You are a lot shorter today.

138
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,059
Is it because of the influence of gravity?

139
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,830
(and he happens to be placed next to the tall one.)

140
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,669
- Kyeong Hwan. - He looks a lot shorter.

141
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,229
- Is he a regular? - Yes.

142
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,039
- Right away... - Kyeong Hwan, you look so short.

143
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,940
(The small titan manages to be funny with his physiques.)

144
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,569
- He looks really short. - I'm always short.

145
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,369
- All right. - Welcome to Tongyeong,

146
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,839
the city of beautiful harbors.

147
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,509
- Where's your mom? - What?

148
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,680
(Now they ask about his mother.)

149
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,080
- Your mom. - Actually,

150
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,950
I got a call from her as soon as I got here.

151
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,549
- What did she say? - I stopped by somewhere.

152
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,050
(Before coming)

153
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,120
And the person called my mom right away.

154
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,050
I can never have a secret date here.

155
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,260
- Are you that famous? - My ex-girlfriends wanted to come,

156
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,860
(They will have to meet the in-laws if he brings anyone.)

157
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,789
but they couldn't. We'd get caught right away.

158
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,689
I recently talked with Kyeong Hwan on a TV show.

159
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,359
He dropped out of elementary school.

160
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,700
His highest level of education completed is kindergarten.

161
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,469
- Right. - Who?

162
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,800
(Did he drop out of elementary school?)

163
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,570
- You? - The thing is...

164
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,739
- He wasn't toilet-trained. - Really?

165
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,800
Toilet...

166
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,070
It's not like I wasn't toilet-trained.

167
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,839
(Outraged)

168
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,340
He peed in class. So they thought he wasn't ready.

169
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,740
(Fake news)

170
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,909
He entered elementary school early...

171
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,280
(That's not it.)

172
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,710
- at the age of seven. - And you wet your pants?

173
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,110
He wanted to go home,

174
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,379
- so he scratched... - He kept scratching.

175
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,449
at the classroom door.

176
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,149
He did that for three months, so they sent him home.

177
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,319
Right. They told me to come back the next year.

178
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,590
(He ended up coming back the next year.)

179
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,259
- At the age of eight. - So Ji Hyo and I are friends.

180
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,559
- Is that why? - Yes.

181
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,589
- Are you two friends? - Yes. We're the same age.

182
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,260
(Born in 1981, born in the early months of 1981)

183
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,659
If I didn't scratch the door,

184
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,559
- she would've been a year below me. - Right.

185
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,900
You're right.

186
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,730
Is there a mural of you here?

187
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,269
- This is... - Did you draw it?

188
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,340
(A mural of Kyeong Hwan in Tongyeong?)

189
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,139
How would I draw it?

190
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,740
- You're amazing. - There's a place called Dongpirang.

191
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,239
- It's famous for its mural village. - Who drew it?

192
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,609
It was there for several years.

193
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,209
- What about now? - Now...

194
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,680
They forgot?

195
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,320
They got rid of it.

196
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,050
They change the murals every few months.

197
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,319
"They got rid of it."

198
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,319
- He's the son of Tongyeong. - I know.

199
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,490
(Today's race will be with the Tongyeong Prince.)

200
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,690
- He's here as a guest. - Yes.

201
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,129
- He's famous here. - Have you been here before?

202
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,900
(Junghwa Harbor)

203
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,359
I've been here a lot.

204
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,699
You can get to many islands,

205
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,400
including Yokji Island, through here.

206
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,930
Tongyeong has 570 islands.

207
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,000
(President of Tongyeong)

208
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,069
(The reason they gathered at Junghwa Harbor, )

209
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,940
(which connects the islands of Tongyeong)

210
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,009
(Tongyeong, Junghwa Harbor, Yokji Island)

211
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,709
Is this Yokji Island?

212
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,250
(Today's destination, Yokji Island)

213
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,079
- I want to eat raw fish. - We should go more.

214
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,750
- We should go more? - Go a little more.

215
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,819
My gosh. This is beautiful.

216
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,350
(Embraced by emerald seas, )

217
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,550
This is Yokji Island!

218
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,790
(Tongyeong's hidden gem, Yokji Island)

219
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,390
We've come to Yokji Island! This is so romantic!

220
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,320
(The coastal roads that open up your mind)

221
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,520
I love Tongyeong.

222
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,160
(A place where you can savor freshly caught seafood)

223
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,760
I want to eat some raw fish.

224
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,859
Let's go and board the ferry to Yokji Island.

225
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,270
(Departing for Yokji Island, the island of romance)

226
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,629
- Okay. - Let's go.

227
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,270
- Let's go. - This is really nice.

228
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,699
- The sky looks amazing. - My gosh.

229
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,270
(They get on the boat to Yokji Island.)

230
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,040
The weather is perfect.

231
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,510
Kyeong Hwan.

232
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,840
Why have you gotten so short?

233
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,610
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

234
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,710
- What if I got even smaller? - These days...

235
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,380
Have you been lifting weights?

236
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,120
- It looks like you're pressed down. - No.

237
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,490
That's because I slept curled up in the car.

238
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,519
Darn it. I would've been taller if I had slept at home.

239
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,590
I know.

240
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,560
- You look shorter today. - What's wrong with me today?

241
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,160
This is beautiful.

242
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,300
- This is crazy. - It's so pretty.

243
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,270
Look at the shimmering of the ripples.

244
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,370
(They take in the grand view of Junghwa Harbor.)

245
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,570
This is beautiful.

246
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,940
- This is so pretty. - It's pretty.

247
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,710
Look at the glitter of the sea. It's sparkling.

248
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,210
(They can smell the ocean as soon as they step on the deck.)

249
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,879
- My gosh. This is the best. - It's lovely.

250
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,310
- Look at that. - My gosh.

251
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,580
(Seok Sam is so excited.)

252
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,480
- It's so pretty. - This is the best.

253
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,350
- Look over there. - It's pretty.

254
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,460
My goodness. It's beautiful.

255
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,090
(Tons of small islands surround Tongyeong.)

256
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,690
It's stunning.

257
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,659
- It's so pretty. - This place is pretty.

258
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,629
- Look at the glitter. - The glitter of the sea.

259
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,660
The glittering water.

260
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,570
(The glitter of the sea shines on the water's surface.)

261
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,570
- It's like a painting. - The Naples of the East.

262
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,830
This is the Naples of the East, Tongyeong.

263
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,839
My goodness. Tongyeong is amazing.

264
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,240
- This is so nice. - I've seen this my entire life.

265
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,740
(The son of Tongyeong was blessed with the sea.)

266
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,039
- Tongyeong is amazing. - I grew up looking at this.

267
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
The Naples of the East.

268
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,310
- This is crazy. - Yes.

269
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,909
- It's so pretty. - This is nice.

270
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,749
- Let's go to the lounge. - The lounge.

271
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,349
- This is so pretty. - Let's take a picture.

272
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,620
(All together)

273
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,490
No. You can't.

274
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,749
- What? - You can't.

275
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,459
- Why do you have to... - You can't.

276
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,690
- You surprised me. - Tongyeong is nice.

277
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,129
The younger ones should take a picture.

278
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,899
- Let's take a picture. - Only the young members.

279
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,459
- The young members. - Younger ones.

280
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,070
- Come here. - The young members.

281
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,200
All right. One, two, three.

282
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,570
(Young Forty Ha and the young members take a picture together.)

283
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,340
- Two, three. - Young members.

284
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,780
Raise your arms.

285
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,780
(The joyous days of our youth)

286
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,080
(They take a forced dose of youth.)

287
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,849
- We're young! - One, two, three.

288
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,919
- Go! - Go!

289
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,019
- We're young! - The young members.

290
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,179
- We're young! - We're young!

291
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,720
Ask Haha if he's happy that we're hanging out with him.

292
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,190
Okay.

293
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:06,590
You're young, Haha!

294
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,829
With our shoes on?

295
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,790
- You should take off your shoes. - Take them off?

296
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,700
(The room is quite spacious.)

297
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,930
Gosh, this is...

298
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,599
The floor is warm.

299
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,270
- My goodness. - Gosh, this is...

300
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,969
The floor is heated.

301
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,470
(The warm heated floor)

302
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,199
- Is it? - Yes.

303
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,239
- Oh, dear. - Let's sit.

304
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,339
- Let's sit. - This is nice.

305
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,940
- You know, I served in the Navy. - What?

306
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,879
I was on a ship for about three years.

307
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,809
So I don't get seasick...

308
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,750
- on a ferry like this. - He said, "Sesick."

309
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,209
- I'm "sesick." - Sesick?"

310
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,620
- I'm "sesick." - I'm "sesick."

311
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,420
(Seok Sam's tongue is already seasick.)

312
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,589
- "Sesick." - I don't get seasick.

313
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,920
- "Sesick." - Don't worry.

314
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,260
(Noticing something)

315
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,019
- If you're seasick... - Wait, Seok Jin.

316
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,890
The director wants to talk.

317
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,660
If he talks, I'll stop talking.

318
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,129
- I'll stop once he starts. - He stopped because of you.

319
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,760
(Sullen)

320
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,870
- Elders talk again and again. - Director.

321
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,569
- Director, start. - Yes.

322
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,799
It will take about an hour to get to Yokji Island.

323
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,539
- Yes. - Kyeong Hwan...

324
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,709
has prepared something...

325
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,080
(What did Kyeong Hwan prepare early in the morning for them?)

326
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,369
for you early in the morning.

327
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,479
- Really? What is it? - Yes.

328
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,539
- What did you prepare? - Is this why...

329
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,609
- What is it? - Right.

330
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,909
Gosh, Kyeong Hwan...

331
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,449
- My goodness. - Come on, Kyeong Hwan.

332
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,579
What's that, Kyeong Hwan?

333
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,120
- I was hungry. - Kyeong Hwan.

334
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,519
- What's that? - This is what you know.

335
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,519
- This is Chungmu gimbap. - Yes!

336
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,530
- I love it. - Did you buy it?

337
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,330
You look younger now.

338
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,729
(At 8:20am, Kyeong Hwan's favorite gimbap place)

339
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,500
- I'm wearing makeup. - Right.

340
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,330
- Is everything all right? - Yes.

341
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,530
(Friendly)

342
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,130
She's a friend of my dad.

343
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,670
And she's her daughter.

344
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,640
Give me that.

345
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,240
- Look at this. - The devoted son of Tongyeong.

346
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,609
(Owner)

347
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,010
Na Mi got married, so we need to change that picture.

348
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,010
(He took a picture with his former date.)

349
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,549
Please add baby octopus.

350
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,949
- Okay. - Yes, because...

351
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,319
- I asked people in Seoul. - Yes.

352
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,219
They don't know much about gimbap with baby octopus.

353
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,919
They think all Chungmu gimbaps are the same.

354
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,090
So we need to add baby octopus.

355
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,329
(He went to buy baby octopus Chungmu gimbap...)

356
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,029
- This is Chungmu gimbap. - Did you buy it?

357
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,190
(for the members to taste.)

358
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,789
We will get to eat again later.

359
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,029
- Right. - So, this is like an appetizer.

360
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,799
- I'm really grateful. - Thank you so much.

361
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,270
- Thank you. - Hey.

362
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,829
- I really wanted... - This is really nice.

363
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,769
- to eat Chungmu gimbap here. - Right.

364
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,199
Did you buy it with your own money?

365
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,809
- Of course. Have some. - Thank you.

366
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,869
It doesn't cost much.

367
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,339
With your own money?

368
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,679
- Oh, dear. - By the way,

369
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,179
it looks like Ji Hyo and you...

370
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,510
- are a married couple. - They're married.

371
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,449
- Come here. - Hurry and give this to them.

372
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,079
- Give them the food. - Sit here.

373
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,450
(They are like a married couple starting their life in Tongyeong.)

374
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,249
- Come over here. - Go ahead and eat.

375
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,949
- You two look good together. - Yes.

376
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,119
Thank you for the food, Ji Hyo.

377
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,889
- Enjoy. - Ji Hyo.

378
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,090
- This isn't much, but... - Ji Hyo, Kyeong Hwan is nice.

379
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,630
He lives with Ji Hyo's family, right?

380
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,399
- Yes. - Right?

381
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,459
- Kyeong Hwan is nice. - How should we eat this?

382
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,029
(The newlywed groom from Tongyeong prepared...)

383
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,600
- This? - Yes.

384
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,100
- It looks delicious. - It looks great.

385
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,369
(baby octopus Chungmu gimbap.)

386
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,400
- Thank you, Kyeong Hwan. - Thank you so much.

387
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,400
(This is the baby octopus.)

388
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,540
This must be delicious.

389
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,480
(How will the Chungmu gimbap taste with baby octopus instead of squid?)

390
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,269
- Is this baby octopus? - How should we eat this?

391
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,480
- This? - Yes.

392
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,580
- Do you see the baby octopus here? - Yes.

393
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,080
(It is called "horegi" in the Gyeongsang Province area.)

394
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,379
It's called horegi in Tongyeong.

395
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,419
Horegi.

396
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,520
It tastes different with the baby octopus in it.

397
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,620
This is something you can eat only in Tongyeong.

398
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,920
(He tries the gimbap first.)

399
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,260
(Then he eats the baby octopus and fishcake.)

400
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,230
This is something you can eat only in Tongyeong.

401
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,560
This is really good.

402
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,570
This is so good. It's delicious.

403
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,899
This is my first time trying baby octopus.

404
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,470
We usually eat it with squid.

405
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,640
I've seen it a lot before.

406
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,080
This is...

407
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,579
a popular restaurant I've visited for a long time.

408
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,910
(A refreshing spiciness spreads through your mouth.)

409
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,280
- The food is really good. - It's delicious.

410
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,850
- Hey. - Baby octopus.

411
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,979
It's really good.

412
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,590
(Unlike squid, it has a chewy texture.)

413
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,750
This is something you can eat only in Tongyeong.

414
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,220
(Ssaebssaeb tries it with seokbakji.)

415
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
Kyeong Hwan.

416
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,699
- Kyeong Hwan, this is good. - It's good, right?

417
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
Is this a baby octopus?

418
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,299
It's really good with baby octopus.

419
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,769
- And... - This is so good.

420
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,230
It's even better with this.

421
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,170
It's dried radish greens soup.

422
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,809
- What's this? - Even dried radish greens soup?

423
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,070
This is a set.

424
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,009
- What is this? - It's dried radish greens soup.

425
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,410
(The gimbap comes with dried radish greens soup.)

426
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,110
They are served together as a set meal.

427
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,950
- Honey, I'll do it. Give me that. - Kyeong Hwan.

428
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,679
Father would be watching this. Let me do it.

429
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,320
- I'll do it. - Oh, dear.

430
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,060
(Kyeong Hwan brought it in a tumbler for the members.)

431
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,790
- It's so good. - It's tasty.

432
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,690
This is really good.

433
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,090
(How does the steamy dried radish greens soup taste?)

434
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,390
Your wife is so nice.

435
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,430
- This is so good. - I like it.

436
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,900
(The savory taste freshens your stomach.)

437
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,730
It tastes really good with the soup.

438
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,800
Gosh, the dried radish greens soup.

439
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,640
- The soup is amazing. - It's so good.

440
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,369
- This is good. - This is perfect.

441
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,440
(It is a perfect combination with the gimbap.)

442
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,239
The gimbap with dried radish greens soup.

443
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,279
- Yes. - It's the best.

444
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,939
- It's better with the soup. - It's a special treat.

445
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,510
This is really good.

446
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,119
- Hey. - It's good, isn't it?

447
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,380
(Proud)

448
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,519
- This is... - Isn't it delicious?

449
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
It's perfect with the soup.

450
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,020
(Feeling warm)

451
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,190
The sea looks beautiful.

452
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,520
It's so beautiful outside.

453
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,190
(Now that their stomach are warm, they appreciate the scenery.)

454
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,429
- Look at the sea. - Have one more.

455
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,400
(She's busy eating, so she can't see anything.)

456
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,700
- I ate it. - It's pretty.

457
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,070
- Ye Eun, look outside. - Okay.

458
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,540
(Lie)

459
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,200
I...

460
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,410
- It's automatic. - Seriously...

461
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,410
I used to do this magic trick a lot.

462
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,580
This magic trick.

463
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,810
- This. - Right.

464
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,310
It's really delicious.

465
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,550
(Floating)

466
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,950
This is the magic trick.

467
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,350
(After eating and feeling good, Jong Kook does a hat trick.)

468
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,789
Ye Eun, do you know this?

469
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,259
- My goodness. - This magic trick.

470
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,290
- Show her. - Do you want me to try it?

471
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,430
(Encore)

472
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,860
(What is that?)

473
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,389
He's an old man.

474
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,630
- My gosh. That's amazing. - Ye Eun.

475
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,200
(Satisfied)

476
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,300
Is it fun?

477
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,570
(Laughing)

478
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,669
- That's amazing. - That's a good one.

479
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,670
Kids love this.

480
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,339
They love this when I do it.

481
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,510
- They like it. - He's such a clown.

482
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,170
(Jong Kook, who's in a great mood, finishes his talent show.)

483
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,639
Tongyeong Bomber, Heo Kyeong Hwan said...

484
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,540
(Today's race was inspired by the Tongyeong Bomber.)

485
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,479
in a pre-interview with the production team...

486
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,449
- that Tongyeong was romantic. - It's romantic.

487
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,049
- It is. - So we prepared this race.

488
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,119
It's called This Is the Romance of It.

489
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,879
- This Is the Romance of It. - This Is the Romance of It.

490
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,749
This Is the Romance of It.

491
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,519
Tomorrow morning, at least one of you...

492
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,189
will be getting a penalty.

493
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,789
- One of us? - Yes, at least one of you...

494
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,359
- will get a penalty. - I guess the penalty is harsh.

495
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,959
Also, if you spend more than the basic budget,

496
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,630
one more member will get a penalty for every 50 dollars.

497
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,870
- You have to spend money on a trip. - Right.

498
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,699
But if you enjoy the romance,

499
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,240
you can have the extra money you spend deducted.

500
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,239
(Romantic Spots, Tongyeong, Yokji Island)

501
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,609
Today, you will be enjoying...

502
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,280
(There are 3 spots.)

503
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,840
three romantic courses.

504
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,109
For each course, we'll pick...

505
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,179
a photo and phrase you think is romantic...

506
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,119
(They need to take a picture of a romantic spot...)

507
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,649
and post them on SBS's official social media.

508
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,919
(and post it with a romantic phrase on SBS's official social media.)

509
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,849
We'll have people vote on whether it's romantic or not.

510
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,050
(Voting screen)

511
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,120
Whether it's romantic or not?

512
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,960
If it's officially recognized as romantic,

513
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,959
we'll deduct a portion of your expenses.

514
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
- Okay. - Good.

515
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:17,559
So, even if we spend a lot, we can still get a deduction?

516
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,660
(Bingo)

517
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,360
Romance? It's romantic.

518
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,099
And one thing you can't miss on a Running Man trip...

519
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,299
is the matching T-shirts.

520
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,699
You will change into the matching T-shirts...

521
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,339
and start the mission to earn the basic budget.

522
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,499
Do we have matching shirts today?

523
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,979
- My goodness. - They got something tacky again.

524
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,940
(What is the new version of the tacky matching shirts?)

525
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,280
- Is this it? - I bet it says "Romance."

526
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,210
- It says "Tong." - That's cute.

527
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,249
(Tong)

528
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,680
- The back. - It says "Tongyeong."

529
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,780
(Yeong)

530
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,190
(So simple)

531
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,520
- It should be on one side. - I know.

532
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,049
That's not so bad.

533
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,590
(He likes it, since it's simple.)

534
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,719
- It's simple. - It should be on one side.

535
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,489
It has good words on both sides. "Tong" has a good meaning.

536
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,030
(Writer)

537
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,830
And "Yeong" means you're young.

538
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,530
- I see. - "Young?" Seok Jin would love it.

539
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,260
(His face lights up after hearing "young.")

540
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,399
- Right. - Doesn't it mean "Old Man?"

541
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,069
It means "The young energy shines through."

542
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,230
(A stern face)

543
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,199
Old Man?

544
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,939
- Seok Jin. - Old Man.

545
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
(He's mad!)

546
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,299
Excuse me, Old Man.

547
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,369
- You... - Excuse me, Old Man.

548
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,740
(Jae Seok hit Young Fifty Seok Sam's pride.)

549
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,310
That's not it. It means "soul."

550
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,710
- What? - "Yeong" means...

551
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,179
These days, Seok Jin gets worked up right away.

552
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,309
Things don't go back and forth. He gets angry right away.

553
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,579
He doesn't play along with you.

554
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,819
He doesn't play along.

555
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,519
(He won't play along with any attacks on his age.)

556
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,020
- Should we get changed? - Yes.

557
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,220
(They are all changed.)

558
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,950
I'll explain the rules of the mission.

559
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,519
- Yes. - For the basic budget,

560
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,460
(The mission for their budget will be revealed.)

561
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,159
you'll have the mission, By the Way, the Ball Is Rolling.

562
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,800
(Thank you.)

563
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,530
- What? - Five members will try it first.

564
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,169
Starting with the first player, you'll relay a table tennis ball...

565
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,469
in a water cup on your forehead...

566
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,039
and place it in the bucket at the end.

567
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,199
- Okay. - I see.

568
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,709
For each table tennis ball going into the bucket,

569
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,610
(10 dollars)

570
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,570
an additional ten dollars will be added to the basic budget.

571
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,440
- I see. - That's a lot.

572
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,179
The time limit is three minutes,

573
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,009
and there will be a total of three rounds.

574
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,519
You can't pick up the ball that falls to the ground.

575
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,220
You must restart from the first player.

576
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,019
Please divide the members into 2 groups of 5.

577
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,459
(They will pick 5 players to play for each round.)

578
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,960
- This is difficult. - One member will play twice.

579
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,589
- Then... - Yes, five members...

580
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,490
(They need to choose the first 5 players.)

581
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,959
Divide into 2 teams of 5.

582
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,229
I think I have to watch it done first.

583
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,660
I didn't understand the rules.

584
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,059
I think I have to watch it done first.

585
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,400
I didn't understand the rules.

586
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,269
(Ddochi with the pure brain will play later.)

587
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,970
I don't understand the rules.

588
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:04,469
- She will skip it. - Hey, you should...

589
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,339
(Round 1)

590
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,299
- Shouldn't Ji Hyo play? - She should.

591
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,740
(The first 5 members are chosen!)

592
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,399
- I'll do it. - Because Ji Hyo is...

593
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,609
We should take off our socks.

594
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,639
We don't have that thing.

595
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,770
- Pour the water now? - Go ahead.

596
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,480
(They fill the cups with water first.)

597
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,009
- Up to the black line. - Up to the black line.

598
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,010
Hang on.
- That's a lot. - That's a lot.

599
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,680
(It needs to be filled up until the black line.)

600
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:16,450
- This is a lot of water. - Is that how we do it?

601
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,119
- That's a lot. - Is this it?

602
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
- That's a lot of water. - Like that?

603
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,420
(Pressing)

604
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,619
Can you see ahead?

605
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,850
- I can. - Can you?

606
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,590
This is a lot.

607
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,090
(Pressing)

608
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,489
- It's pressing down on my nose. - It's pressed flat.

609
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,589
- Hey. - Can you see?

610
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,830
(Their noses are squished.)

611
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,330
My nose... My goodness.

612
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,299
Your nose is pressed.

613
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,070
(They can't see, and they look ugly.)

614
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,760
- It touches my nose. - Yes.

615
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,929
You look funny.

616
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,799
- My nose is pressed flat. - My nose is flat.

617
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,499
You need enough water to move the ball easily.

618
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,040
(The water is being filled up.)

619
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,699
- This is... Hang on. - Because it floats.

620
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,010
Is the captain sailing like this on purpose?

621
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,040
(Dripping)

622
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,740
- Oh, no. - You punk!

623
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,910
- Oh, no. - You punk!

624
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,809
The ferry was shaking.

625
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,780
(Sorry)

626
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,119
- It didn't shake. - It was shaking.

627
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,650
(Seok Sam ended up getting a face wash.)

628
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,119
- Pour some more. - What's wrong with you?

629
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
All right.

630
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:57,520
- That's enough. - It's done.

631
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,159
- Can you see? - It's coming down.

632
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,619
Isn't this too much?

633
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,060
(Already whining)

634
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,229
The cup should be fixed tightly so it won't come down.

635
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,400
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo are finished preparing!)

636
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,959
It's a little loose for you.

637
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,259
- It's ten dollars per ball. - What's ten dollars?

638
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,699
Let's do it right. I want to eat ramyeon...

639
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,340
(They will get 10 dollars with each ball.)

640
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,969
when we get there.

641
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,269
Let's begin!

642
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,669
Let's do this.

643
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,170
You know the name of the game, right?

644
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,570
(My catchphrase)

645
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,839
- What's this? - By the Way,

646
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,979
- the Ball Is Rolling. - The Ball is Rolling.

647
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,009
Let's begin.

648
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,280
- Ready. - How...

649
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,380
(The 3 minutes begin.)

650
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,809
- How do they move the ball? - You should go lower.

651
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,849
Over there.

652
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,979
- How do they move the ball? - You should go lower.

653
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
Over there.

654
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:26,449
Did it go in?

655
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,150
(Falling out)

656
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,350
- It's gone. - No. Again.

657
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,019
Did it go in?

658
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,990
(The first attempt fails.)

659
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,819
- It's gone. - No. Again.

660
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,719
- My goodness. - Bring more water. The kettle!

661
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,159
- Water. - We need more water.

662
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,289
- It's done. - You got it.

663
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,200
(Luckily, they succeeded on the second try.)

664
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,329
It went in.

665
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,359
- It went in? - Yes.

666
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,499
- Give him the ball. - Send the ball.

667
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,100
- Oh, no. - It didn't go in?

668
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,930
(Missed)

669
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,099
- Oh, no. - It didn't go in?

670
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,100
(They need to start over if the ball falls out.)

671
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,269
- This isn't easy. - No.

672
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,199
- There's no ball. - No.

673
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,369
Again.

674
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,869
- Okay. - It didn't go in.

675
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,910
(Time is passing, but they keeping making mistakes.)

676
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,340
- Ball. - We should go like this.

677
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,839
- Oh, no. - It didn't go in.

678
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,909
Give me the ball.

679
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,949
- Squat down. - Give me the ball.

680
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,280
- Squat down? - Jong Kook should be lower.

681
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,850
(Their strategy is to have the receiver come down lower.)

682
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,750
Go lower. Lower than that.

683
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,290
- Good. - We should pour more water.

684
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,419
(He passed it!)

685
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,019
- Okay. It's done. - We should pour more water.

686
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,290
(Now, he needs to give it to Kyeong Hwan!)

687
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,419
- Put it here. - You should hurry.

688
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,459
- Where? - Hurry and give him the ball.

689
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,360
- At the end here. - Slowly.

690
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,160
- At the end here. - Slowly.

691
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,289
That's it. No need to rush.

692
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,600
No. It's working.

693
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,259
(Missed again)

694
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,059
You dropped it.

695
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,469
- What was that? - You pushed it out.

696
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,570
(He only poured a lot of water.)

697
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,169
- It's so cold. - It's for ten dollars.

698
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,229
Hang on.

699
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,299
- My nose... - It's done.

700
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,800
- My nose... - It's okay.

701
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,769
- Here. - You should make a bow.

702
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,770
Make a bow?

703
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,840
(They suggest passing it as if he is bowing.)

704
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:23,839
- Make a bow. - Make a bow.

705
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
That's better.

706
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:26,139
- Good. - My nose is twisted.

707
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,179
- That's it. More. - Bow.

708
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,209
- Go down. - You should go lower.

709
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,210
(Total chaos)

710
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,249
- Go lower. - He has too much water.

711
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,309
- That's it. - Good.

712
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,379
- Pass it. - Go lower.

713
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,419
- Lower. - He has too much water.

714
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
- Good. - It's done.

715
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,020
(He somehow passed it, but...)

716
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,719
- He got it. - Move on.

717
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,949
- Do the same thing. - Make a bow.

718
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,749
- Make a bow. - Bow.

719
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,259
- To whom? - To me.

720
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,019
- Go! - Good.

721
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,920
(He can hardly open his eyes.)

722
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,189
- Bow to me. - Bow.

723
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,190
- Hello. - Bow.

724
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,299
- Yes. - It's done.

725
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,700
(The bowing strategy is successful.)

726
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,360
Right away.

727
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,459
- Make a bow. - Squat down.

728
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,670
- You should squat down. - Squat down.

729
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,170
(Now, he should give it to Ji Hyo, the last player.)

730
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,369
- You should squat down. - Squat down.

731
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,870
- Wait. My nose is squeezed. - Give it to her.

732
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,799
- It's done. - Okay.

733
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,840
(He passed it.)

734
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,869
It's working.

735
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,169
- Take it easy. - We're doing it at a good pace.

736
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,270
Nice.

737
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,339
(With 1 minute and 40 seconds left, )

738
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,239
- Take it easy. - We're doing it at a good pace.

739
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,939
- Nice. - Lower than that.

740
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,210
(they won 10 dollars!)

741
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,979
- Nice. - It's done.

742
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,049
- Right away. - Pass it.

743
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,449
- You should squat down, you punk! - Squat down.

744
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,719
- Go lower. - Squat down.

745
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,079
- Pass it. - Kyeong Hwan's nose is flat.

746
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,189
My nose is...

747
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,219
- Okay. - It's done.

748
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,519
- Pass it. - It's working.

749
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,959
- We should make a bow. - We're doing it at a good pace.

750
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,459
- Go lower. - Lower.

751
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,490
One more.

752
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,659
- Go lower. - Lower.

753
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,759
- Oh, no. - No.

754
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,230
(They drop the ball again.)

755
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,230
You should sit down!

756
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,929
- Oh, no. - No.

757
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,099
You should sit down!

758
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,269
Why are you so bad at this?

759
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,369
He should go lower.

760
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,800
(Even lower?)

761
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,799
- Come here. - Hey.

762
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,039
- That was Jong Kook's fault. - I know, right?

763
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,339
Jong Kook messed it up, but why...

764
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,210
I'm all seated.

765
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,339
(Feeling wronged)

766
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,640
(The Tongyeong Prince feels wronged.)

767
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,179
I'm all seated.

768
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,910
- Sit down as much as possible! - You're the one messing this up.

769
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,409
Squat.

770
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,380
(It is Jong Kook's turn again.)

771
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,849
How can he sit further down from there?

772
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,880
Tell me about it.

773
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,120
- Jong Kook, lower your chin. - Bring the romance!

774
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,950
(What in the world?)

775
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,719
- Seriously? - Come on!

776
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Close the distance.

777
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,190
(Jong Kook messed up again during a ball game.)

778
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:45,120
- Come here. - I'll check the distance for you.

779
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,219
- Just watch. - Unbelievable.

780
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,029
- Squat like this. - Squat down.

781
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,959
- Nice. That's perfect. - Yes!

782
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,830
(A clean pass from Jae Seok)

783
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Squat down.
- Nice. - Yes!

784
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,400
(The problem lies between Jong Kook and Kyeong Hwan.)

785
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,129
That's perfect.

786
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,499
- Nice, Jae Seok. - You're great at this.

787
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,029
- Check the distance. - You're doing fine.

788
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,140
(Will they be able to pass it on this time?)

789
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,669
- Move back a little. - Move back a little.

790
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,499
- Should I move back? How's this? - Yes, this looks good.

791
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,040
- Looking good. Drop the ball. - Pour it in.

792
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,169
- Drop your chin more. - Bend your neck.

793
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,679
- Drop your chin more. - More.

794
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,910
(He barely manages to pass the ball!)

795
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,109
- More. - Drop your chin more.

796
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,779
- There. - You did it.

797
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,949
More water!

798
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,179
- Give me more water. - This is heavy.

799
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,119
- What about me? - You're in place.

800
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,350
(He heads toward his target with a crumpled face.)

801
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,949
- All right. Go for it. - Wait, not yet.

802
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,419
- Hurry! - Kyeong Hwan, you should stand.

803
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,819
- Kyeong Hwan, stand. - You should stand.

804
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,329
- Hold on. - You need to stand.

805
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,160
- He's standing too straight. - Bow!

806
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,830
- You need to stand. - He's standing too straight.

807
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,800
(They give him conflicting advice.)

808
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,300
- He's standing too straight. - Just bow.

809
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,729
(Standing awkwardly)

810
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,769
- Kyeong Hwan... - He's standing too straight.

811
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,670
(The Tongyeong Prince is broken.)

812
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,869
- Move just your neck. - That's right.

813
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,969
- Kyeong Hwan, hurry up! - Just drop the chin.

814
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,169
- What are you doing? - Come on!

815
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,339
- Hurry up! - Drop the chin!

816
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,399
What are you doing?

817
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,269
- You need to stand up. - He shouldn't.

818
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,080
- Just drop the chin. - He forgot how he did it earlier.

819
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,650
- He shouldn't stand too straight. - Just drop the chin.

820
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,950
(Jong Kook grabs his chin and starts moving it around.)

821
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,910
Are you kidding me?

822
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,279
- More. - That's it.

823
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,750
(He barely made it, thanks to Jong Kook's assistance.)

824
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,389
- I can't believe him. - What did I tell you?

825
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,950
Squat down!

826
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
All right.

827
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,759
- I'm not in the best of shape. - Keep going.

828
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,520
- Squat down. - I'm not feeling my best.

829
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,630
All right.

830
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,389
- I'm not in the best of shape. - Keep going.

831
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,530
- No! - Darn it.

832
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,860
(But Seok Sam dropped it.)

833
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,699
- Seok Sam, what's wrong with you? - Just hold still.

834
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,100
The ball rarely reaches me.

835
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,030
(We're back to the part with Jong Kook and Kyeong Hwan.)

836
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,969
- It's done. - Wait, that's enough!

837
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,500
(Dripping)

838
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,510
- You did it. - Okay, that's done.

839
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,909
Seok Jin, I know the best way to do it.

840
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,910
- Look. - Squat down.

841
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:14,780
Let the rims of the cups touch.

842
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,610
(Sneezing)

843
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,180
(Performing an old-fashioned slapstick act)

844
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,379
Seriously, Seok Jin?

845
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,489
Isn't that too old-fashioned?

846
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,619
- Unbelievable. - Come on.

847
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,260
- What's there to learn here? - Let the rims touch.

848
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,859
Kyeong Hwan, stand back up!

849
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,690
(They have 15 seconds left.)

850
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,429
- Lift your butt. - You should stand.

851
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,329
- Yes, you should stand. - Let the rims touch.

852
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,759
- That's it. Move back a little. - Good. Move back.

853
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,899
- Done. - Okay!

854
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,700
(They only have Ji Hyo left!)

855
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,230
What did I tell you?

856
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,469
- Let's just get one more, okay? - Let's do it.

857
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,900
- Let's just get one more, okay? - Five,

858
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,500
(Last 5 seconds)

859
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
four, three,

860
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
(Fail)

861
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,809
- two, - Seok Jin can't be playing.

862
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,909
- one. - Seok Jin, come on!

863
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,610
(Time is up.)

864
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,010
- It's not my fault. - Unbelievable.

865
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,179
- I can't believe it. - You got one in the bowl,

866
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,510
(They only got 1 during the 3 minutes.)

867
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,110
- so you earn ten dollars. - Darn!

868
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,820
(All they got is 10 dollars.)

869
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,279
Just so you know...

870
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,079
- Seok Sam's terrible at this. - I'll call it.

871
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,989
Jae Seok and Jong Kook should stay.

872
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,119
- Yes, we'll keep playing. - What good were they?

873
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,660
(Sudden rage)

874
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,489
- They did great. - We were doing just fine.

875
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,619
The three of you, get lost.

876
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,589
- We did well. - As if you performed any better.

877
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,130
(Kyeong Hwan, Seok Sam, and Ji Hyo are changed out.)

878
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,829
- Get lost. - We kept the game going.

879
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,359
- Anyone could do what you did. - Just get lost.

880
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,759
Kyeong Hwan, you get lost too.

881
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,799
Kyeong Hwan, move.

882
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,900
(Feeling wronged)

883
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
- Seok Jin, you too. - I only did as told.

884
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:08,899
Jae Seok's good at this game.

885
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,929
- Jae Seok and Jong Kook. - Mr. Half-dried Pollack, get lost.

886
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,029
We'll continue right away.

887
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,670
- Seok Jin, move. - We don't need you, Seok Jin.

888
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,299
I'll be the one to drop the ball in.

889
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,110
(Hunchback Ye Eun gets the last spot.)

890
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,009
Se Chan, you'll pass it to Ye Eun.

891
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,070
- Got it. - Good.

892
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,809
(Young Blood Se Chan is in front of her, )

893
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,079
Now, he has me worried.

894
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,640
(and so is Daniel.)

895
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,079
Jong Kook, I'm going to do my best.

896
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,879
- Ye Eun, come here. - Do your best, okay?

897
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,480
- I'm worried about him. - Hold on.

898
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,480
(Filling up Ye Eun's cup too)

899
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,020
Ji Hyo, that's perfect.

900
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,419
(Her nose isn't touching the cup.)

901
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,590
(She's built perfectly for this game.)

902
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,060
Focus, guys.

903
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,690
- Okay, pass. - Take it seriously.

904
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,189
- Okay. - Focus, guys.

905
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,429
- I'm good at games like this. - Okay, we'll now begin.

906
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,059
(Ye Eun has the potential to be great, )

907
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,960
(thanks to her hunched back and small nose.)

908
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,529
Squat when it's your turn to receive it.

909
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,499
- I'm good at games like this. - Okay, we'll now begin.

910
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,070
(Will they be able to get a lot with this team?)

911
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Squat when it's your turn to receive it.

912
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:44,699
- I'm good at these things. - Stay low.

913
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,900
- Here we go. - Ready...

914
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,270
(3 minutes begin.)

915
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,970
- Nice. - Okay, let's go.

916
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,939
- There. These guys are good. - Stay seated.

917
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,509
- They know what they're doing. - Okay!

918
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,840
(The experienced members pass in one shot.)

919
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,510
Just keep going.

920
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:53,779
- I'll stay seated. - They're good.

921
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,809
Sit all the way down.

922
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,380
- We can do this. - Okay, we're good.

923
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,149
- Daniel, drop your chin. - Nice!

924
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,550
(Even Daniel passes it on smoothly!)

925
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,619
- They did it. - Looking good.

926
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,620
- Nice. - Here I go.

927
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,389
- Here I go. - Daniel...

928
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,520
(Totally focused)

929
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,490
- I'm right here. - Here I go.

930
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,959
- Look how stable Jae Seok is. - More water!

931
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,689
- Kyeong Hwan, more water. - Give us more water.

932
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,859
- There isn't enough water. - Okay, good.

933
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,990
(He passed it at once!)

934
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,889
- More water! - Give us more water.

935
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,229
- There isn't enough water. - Okay, good.

936
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,430
(He has to pass it to Ye Eun now.)

937
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,299
More water!

938
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,070
- Sit all the way down. - Sit.

939
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,869
Ye Eun, you got it.

940
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,830
(Again, without failing!)

941
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,930
- Check the distance for me. - The distance.

942
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,869
(Without making any mistakes, )

943
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,470
(they delivered the ball in 30 seconds!)

944
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,110
- Wait. - These guys are good.

945
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,110
They're good at this.

946
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,010
Nice. Jae Seok's perfect.

947
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,950
(Their skills are totally different from the previous team.)

948
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,479
Jae Seok is the best.

949
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,579
- More. Okay, you got it. - You have it.

950
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,250
(With perfect pass plays, like Spanish soccer matches, )

951
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,350
- Sit down. - Yes, sit down.

952
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,990
- Done. - Ye Eun, you got it.

953
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,820
- Do they have it? - They got it.

954
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,320
(the balls gather one by one.)

955
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,319
This team is on fire.

956
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,020
- Can you help us out? - Sit all the way down.

957
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,589
- There. - You got it.

958
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,629
(Flat Nose's final delivery especially stands out.)

959
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,729
Do they have it?

960
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,959
Se Chan and Ye Eun...

961
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,529
(30 dollars added)

962
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,159
Wait, I need more water.

963
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,329
- Done. - They're really good.

964
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,060
(40 dollars added)

965
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,499
- Here. - You're doing great.

966
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,799
- Nice. - You have ten seconds left.

967
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,330
(Last 10 seconds)

968
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,070
- Okay. - Okay, good.

969
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,199
- Are we done? - You have it!

970
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,840
- Ye Eun, pour it in. - Four, three,

971
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,969
- You got it. - two,

972
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,209
- Nice. - one.

973
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,969
- No way. You guys were awesome. - We did it.

974
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,040
(They got 5!)

975
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,179
- Amazing. - Ye Eun, we did great.

976
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,479
- They're so good. - This was perfect.

977
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,250
(They earned 50 dollars.)

978
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,279
- How many did we get? - Was that perfect?

979
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,750
- Nicely done. - We got five.

980
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,980
- Good job. - You managed...

981
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,480
(They managed to get 3 in the last round.)

982
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,819
to get 9 balls in the bowl, so you win 90 dollars to spend.

983
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,519
- Ye Eun did great. - We got 90 dollars.

984
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,959
- That was perfect. - However,

985
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,429
we'll now subtract what you've spent so far.

986
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,459
- What? - What do you mean?

987
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,030
(The money they spent?)

988
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,890
The ferry ride is free,

989
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,459
but we'll take off 45 dollars for the Chungmu gimbap...

990
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,169
Kyeong Hwan bought.

991
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,699
- What? Why? - Why?

992
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,969
- We'll take off 45 dollars. - What? Why?

993
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,499
- Why? - He paid for it himself.

994
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,769
He charged it to the company credit card.

995
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,210
- You said you paid for it yourself. - Darn.

996
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,609
Did you pay for this yourself?

997
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,279
- Yes, of course. It's not much. - Thank you so much.

998
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,180
- You paid for it yourself? - That's nice of you.

999
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,150
(He charged it to the company credit card.)

1000
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,820
- You said you paid for it yourself. - Darn.

1001
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,020
(Interrogating)

1002
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
I guess that's how I put it.

1003
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,719
- That's how you put it? - Unbelievable.

1004
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,720
(Why, that...)

1005
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,989
- No way. - I didn't know they'd reveal that.

1006
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,019
Then we wouldn't have eaten it.

1007
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,159
- That's so cheap. - Still,

1008
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,259
- it's a good thing... - I wasn't even hungry.

1009
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,330
I only got five portions.

1010
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,129
You would've been shocked if I got one for everyone.

1011
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,699
That's why we didn't have enough rice.

1012
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,259
I know, but you didn't eat it all.

1013
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,199
Enough with the excuses.

1014
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,270
Sorry about that.

1015
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,140
He just apologized. Is that it?

1016
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,270
(A composed apology)

1017
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,969
From your in-game earnings,

1018
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,009
(The money they earned, 90 dollars, minus the food, 45 dollars, )

1019
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,009
you're left with 45 dollars after charging the food.

1020
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,950
(equals the money left, 45 dollars)

1021
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,439
- That's not good. - Just 45 dollars?

1022
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,609
What can we eat in Tongyeong with that money?

1023
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,610
How can we enjoy a trip only on 45 dollars?

1024
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,719
- We came all the way to Tongyeong. - We're a big group of people.

1025
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,680
We'll have to eat after we fish.

1026
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,689
- If only we did better at the game. - This is insane.

1027
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,219
You can win more money by taking good photos.

1028
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,190
(They can still win money with the romantic pictures.)

1029
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,559
Right, we still have the photos.

1030
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,960
- Got it. - We'll have to do a good job.

1031
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,159
- This is all part of the romance. - Did you have to be so cheap?

1032
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,499
(Will they be able to take good pictures...)

1033
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,930
- I didn't think this would happen. - Unbelievable.

1034
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,200
(and make it an abundant trip?)

1035
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,230
I would've paid for it if I had known.

1036
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,869
This ferry is huge.

1037
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,030
(They get free time on the ferry.)

1038
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,500
Is this the room we booked?

1039
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,570
- I want to take a look around. - The ferry is huge.

1040
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,910
Seok Jin, did you go outside?

1041
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,240
- Yes. - How is it?

1042
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,040
- It's awesome. - Can you come with me?

1043
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,810
- What? - Join me.
But I just got here. You want me to go again?

1044
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,810
Yes.

1045
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,650
(The daughter asks him to come along.)

1046
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,250
- Lead the way. - Can't you come with me?

1047
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,980
Seok Jin, are you annoyed?

1048
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,250
- Can't you come with me? - Lead the way.

1049
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,820
(Speechless)

1050
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,790
I'm just saying.

1051
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,320
(No dad ever wins against his daughter.)

1052
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,820
(They look like father-daughter from behind.)

1053
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,320
Don't tell me it's your first time on a ferry.

1054
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,589
I took one from Jeju to Udo Island once.

1055
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,000
(A Heartwarming Father-Daughter Vacation, Part 1)

1056
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,499
Really? Udo Island's great!

1057
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,830
- Chungju, cross. - Ji and Jee, cross.

1058
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,299
This is insane.

1059
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,039
(Ji Ye Eun, 31, "This is crazy.")

1060
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,370
Seok Jin, it looks awesome from here.

1061
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,700
How amazing is this?

1062
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,600
(Jee Seok Jin, 50-something, "How amazing is this?")

1063
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,710
Seok Jin.

1064
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,540
So much for enjoying it together.

1065
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,180
(They went outside together but are filming separately.)

1066
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,039
- Check this out! - The father-daughter duo...

1067
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,280
is enjoying the view separately.

1068
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,849
How awesome is this?

1069
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,949
The father makes a wish as he looks out at the vast sea.

1070
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,719
I wouldn't mind taking off somewhere.

1071
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,890
(A Heartwarming Father-Daughter Vacation, Part 1, The End)

1072
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,960
Seok Jin!

1073
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,790
You can't. Don't even think about it.

1074
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,389
I'll take your romantic photo.

1075
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,360
(A Heartwarming Father-Daughter Vacation, Last Episode)

1076
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,200
- Are you taking mine for me? - Yes.

1077
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,129
- In front of the Korean flag. - No looking at cameras, right?

1078
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,230
That's right. Don't look this way.

1079
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,240
(Seok Sam strikes a pose his daughter's friends would do.)

1080
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,740
This looks great!

1081
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,410
This is proper romance, you know.

1082
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,450
(She got him the best shots with that zoomer vibe.)

1083
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,109
- Seok Jin. - How was that?

1084
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,480
This is how zoomers do it.

1085
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,119
- This is how zoomers do it. - Sweet.

1086
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,519
Father Jee is thrilled with his photo.

1087
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,720
Should I take yours too?

1088
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,589
- Do your thing. - Can you take it...

1089
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,490
while I stand next to the Korean flag?

1090
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,160
(For his daughter, the apple of his eye)

1091
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,160
Here we go.

1092
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,360
That's it. I like that.

1093
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,630
If this isn't romantic, I don't know what is.

1094
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,629
Left arm down, right arm up.

1095
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,370
Left arm down, right arm... That's it!

1096
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,110
For his daughter, he crouches down.

1097
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,240
Smile. Keep smiling.

1098
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,650
(What's the result of him wearing down his joints?)

1099
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,640
Nice!

1100
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,880
- How do I look? - Check it out.

1101
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,710
Aren't they good?

1102
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,310
Aren't they good?

1103
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,180
Not the full body shot.

1104
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,050
The full body shots aren't that good.

1105
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,990
Once again, it's a disaster.

1106
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,890
Gosh, I'm tired.

1107
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,220
(A Heartwarming Father-Daughter Vacation, It's really over.)

1108
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,059
Soon, we'll arrive at Yokji Island.

1109
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,030
(After some silliness, they arrive at Yokji Island.)

1110
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,460
We're here.

1111
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,400
Guys, I just took my romantic photos.

1112
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,930
We won't be using those.

1113
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,640
(He just became a person who took keepsake photos.)

1114
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,539
We won't be using those.

1115
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,770
You arrogant punk.

1116
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,980
By the way, we have great weather today.

1117
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,840
(They get ready to disembark.)

1118
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,539
Look how clear the sky is.

1119
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,409
- The weather is making our day. - Tell me about it.

1120
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,910
Good weather makes up half the trip.

1121
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,560
(His prankster mode switches on when he sees the shoes.)

1122
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,519
See? It's beautiful outside.

1123
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,289
Seok Jin, the view outside is amazing.

1124
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,290
(As it turns out, the shoes belong to...)

1125
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,560
- Tell me about it. I know. - This is it.

1126
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,099
Where are my shoes? Oh, they're here.

1127
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,130
- Where did my shoes go? - I'm going outside.

1128
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,700
I left them here.

1129
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,199
It's beautiful outside.

1130
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,440
(Seok Sam gets pranked yet again.)

1131
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,469
Did someone take my shoes?

1132
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,000
Can you see me?

1133
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,440
(We'll be getting off the ferry soon.)

1134
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,510
Did someone take my shoes?

1135
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,540
Come on. Bring them back.

1136
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,080
(The shoes are getting further away.)

1137
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,940
Bring back my shoes.

1138
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,910
Seok Jin, get out here. This is incredible.

1139
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,579
(Barefoot)

1140
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,820
Hey, I can't find my shoes.

1141
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,820
(At this rate, he'll be walking barefoot for his health.)

1142
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,720
Darn it. Who...

1143
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,790
Who was it? You punks!

1144
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Who was it?

1145
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,390
(Spotting Jae Seok)

1146
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,430
Yu Jae Seok, you! Hey.

1147
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,160
Yu Jae Seok, you!

1148
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,960
(Even the staff is in on it.)

1149
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,500
Hey.

1150
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,030
You little grasshopper. I saw you with my shoes.

1151
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,240
(The barefoot pursuit begins.)

1152
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,569
Darn, my shoes.

1153
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,170
Bring them back here.

1154
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,040
(Another cutthroat battle between them breaks out.)

1155
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,710
Bring them back here.

1156
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,380
My shoes! Darn it.

1157
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,840
Hand them over.

1158
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,709
- You jerk. - Apologize.

1159
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,249
- Apologize for what? - For yelling at us this morning.

1160
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,679
Sure, I'm sorry.

1161
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,319
Haha, get over here!

1162
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,790
- Apologize to me. - Apologize to us.

1163
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,049
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

1164
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,719
You punks.

1165
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,660
(Tom and Jerry's battle comes to an end for now.)

1166
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,390
- "You punks." - You imbeciles.

1167
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,329
- Imbeciles? - What?

1168
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,460
Seriously?

1169
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,760
(The cultured man insults them right after apologizing.)

1170
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,699
He was only joking.

1171
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,100
Where did it go?

1172
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,099
Please don't get the wrong idea. I was only joking.

1173
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,340
He called us imbeciles.

1174
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,640
(He's finally able to make it out.)

1175
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,300
"You imbeciles."

1176
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,809
- Gosh. - The weather's amazing.

1177
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,439
- It's beautiful. - It's so pretty.

1178
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,840
(They finally pay attention to the scenery.)

1179
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,279
- It's lovely. - It's an incredible day.

1180
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,780
- It's really pretty. - This is great.

1181
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,820
(Yokji Island, the island of healing)

1182
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,949
- It's like a fairy tale. - This place...

1183
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,410
Is this Yokji Island, Kyeong Hwan?

1184
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,749
Yokji Island... Yes, this is Yokji Island.

1185
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,790
Deep in nature

1186
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,790
Tongyeong is great.

1187
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,820
(Abundant with mackerels, cats, and sweet potatoes, )

1188
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,119
- This is Yokji Island. - Especially today.

1189
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,360
(it's an island with three cute specialties.)

1190
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,490
- It's a great day. - It's extra clear today.

1191
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,629
It feels like we're in New Zealand.

1192
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,360
(The sky is like LA's, while the sunlight is like New Zealand's.)

1193
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,760
Yes, it's like the New Zealand sunshine.

1194
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,770
We're on Yokji Island!

1195
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,100
(Arrived at Yokji Island)

1196
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,169
This is Yokji Island.

1197
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,899
Deep in nature

1198
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,199
There's a beautiful cliff with weirdly-shaped rocks.

1199
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,070
- I've been here before. - Se Chan looks weird in his shades.

1200
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,609
He has decent-looking eyes.

1201
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,580
(A monkfish has appeared in the coastal waters of Yokji Island.)

1202
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,339
- You're right. - Pretty eyes, an ugly mouth.

1203
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,409
- His eyes are pretty. - He should wear a mask.

1204
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,649
(His eyes alone are first-class.)

1205
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,220
- Put it back on. - Se Chan.

1206
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,879
(When he covers them, he becomes a fish.)

1207
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,019
- You look funny. - You look weird.

1208
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,790
(The art of transformation that crosses species)

1209
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,750
- What's that look? - You look weird.

1210
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,950
What a sight.

1211
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,959
Se Chan, you look middle-aged...

1212
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,520
- with sunglasses on. - He looks decent with a mask on.

1213
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,090
- Daniel, I'll be honest. - Okay.

1214
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,359
My gosh.

1215
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,330
You're wearing a hat made for kids.

1216
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,530
(Next to the fish is General Big Head.)

1217
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,970
- It's small at the top. - That's a kid-sized hat.

1218
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,399
Swap with me.

1219
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,469
Shall we swap?

1220
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,769
Yes, Ji Hyo wears my size.

1221
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,640
(Exchanging with Ji Hyo's stretchy beanie)

1222
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,840
Yes.

1223
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,969
- With a perm, - That works.

1224
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,940
- the hair in the back... - That suits you, Ji Hyo.

1225
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,009
- Ji Hyo. - You look good. How about me?

1226
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,410
- You look better in that. - Do I?

1227
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,610
Let's disembark.

1228
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,110
(They finally set foot on Yokji Island's ground.)

1229
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,149
- We reached Yokji Island. - Yes.

1230
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,689
We'll head over to the first Romantic Spot...

1231
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,819
- where you can eat fresh seafood. - Okay!

1232
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,090
- For real? - Really?

1233
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,419
(Romantic Spots)

1234
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,219
- Let's go! - Let's go. But we have no money.

1235
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,690
(Yokji Island, Tongyeong)

1236
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,360
How romantic.

1237
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,559
- They rented a nice vehicle. - Will they charge us for the gas?

1238
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,430
(They get in the van.)

1239
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,700
Yokji.

1240
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,259
Do we have to pay the rental fee?

1241
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm worried.

1242
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,069
- What got into you? - What was that?

1243
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,169
- What's wrong? - Seok Jin is...

1244
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,439
I thought he was coughing up phlegm.

1245
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,569
He used to get chewed out for being useless at comic skits.

1246
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,740
I'm worried.

1247
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,010
(The other members feel more anxious.)

1248
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,379
- Was that weird? How so? - Yes.

1249
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,810
- It's too... - It's too much.

1250
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,850
- I wish you'd stop. - Really?

1251
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,720
(Pleading)

1252
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,219
I'm worried.

1253
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,289
Is this a team mission?

1254
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,850
(The romantic photo mission)

1255
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,420
Is this a team thing?

1256
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,390
Here's a romantic scene. You get a fishing stool...

1257
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,689
and get Se Chan to sit on it topless...

1258
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,590
- That's the best. - and eat ramyeon.

1259
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,800
(The romance of going shirtless in early winter)

1260
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,459
- That's a romantic scene. - That's romance.

1261
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,799
A romantic scene from my day...

1262
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,099
would be all of us stripping and jumping into the sea.

1263
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,639
- A snapshot of us in the air. - That's romantic.

1264
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,799
- In my day. - Jumping simultaneously.

1265
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,669
It's truly romantic if we show the top of our bum crack.

1266
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,809
- Yes, but... - Can you do that?

1267
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,240
- I did that. - Right.

1268
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,579
Don't we have to post it?

1269
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,350
(Just when they were wallowing in that weird romance)

1270
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,150
- Send a few of his photos. - With a caption?

1271
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,780
Here's a romantic scene. You get a fishing stool...

1272
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,449
Look, I have a really nice one.

1273
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,450
What is it? Let me see.

1274
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,249
(A romantic photo that Jae Seok had just taken?)

1275
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:56,749
I'll show it to you.

1276
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,849
What's that?

1277
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,860
- What is it? - What is it?

1278
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,260
(What kind of photo is it?)

1279
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,660
That romantic guy from back then.

1280
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,330
That romantic guy from back then.

1281
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,500
It's part of a series.

1282
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,200
(The 2nd place photo of the Photographers Special)

1283
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,830
- I like it. - Isn't it great?

1284
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,470
(Touching all members, it met both the photo and caption criteria.)

1285
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,469
- This is funny. - That romantic guy from back then.

1286
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,870
(That Romantic Guy from Back Then)

1287
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,569
That's hilarious.

1288
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:15,770
(Upload complete)

1289
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,740
He's reminiscing.

1290
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,939
Se Chan really looks dreadful in sunglasses.

1291
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,580
(Will the photo of Se Chan's face pass the romantic vibe check?)

1292
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,309
- How so? - Your face.

1293
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,709
You need to cover your lower half.

1294
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,010
I look best with a mask on.

1295
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,179
- Yokji Island is so pretty. - It really is.

1296
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,120
Raw fish would taste great here.

1297
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,259
(A picturesque coastal town)

1298
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,889
- Isn't the view amazing? - It's like a painting.

1299
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:34,290
- My word. - It's such a lovely day.

1300
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,090
(The first romantic spot is right next to it?)

1301
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,729
- This is a great restaurant. - Raw mackerel?

1302
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,830
That sounds great.

1303
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,929
(The first romantic spot is...)

1304
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,400
(a haenyeo restaurant fresh from the sea.)

1305
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,630
This is insane.

1306
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,530
The sea pineapple sounds good.

1307
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,969
This is crazy.

1308
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,139
- We must have sea pineapple. - Sea cucumber.

1309
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,199
What's important is...

1310
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,210
- Can we afford to eat this? - Sea pineapple.

1311
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,440
We come to a nice place where we can't...

1312
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,210
The budget is stressing me out.

1313
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,110
(They don't have enough to eat with the remaining balance.)

1314
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,710
You shouldn't talk about money when on a trip.

1315
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,720
- My gosh. This is... - Let's enjoy ourselves.

1316
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,280
(For now, they sit in front of the side dishes.)

1317
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,419
Why is the seating... There's more.

1318
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,789
- Scoot this way. - Okay.

1319
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,819
- Okay. - Good.

1320
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,760
- You know, guys... - What?

1321
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,759
Kyeong Hwan and Seok Sam are my direct juniors.

1322
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,789
- You're right. - We started at KBS.

1323
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,330
(KBS Comedian Batch 10, 22, and 7)

1324
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,499
- That's right. - Wasn't Kyeong Hwan parachuted in?

1325
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,229
- I was not. - He passed the interview.

1326
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,669
- He took the test? - I walked in.

1327
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,840
(A joke?)

1328
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,769
- You passed? - Yes.

1329
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,599
- Kyeong Hwan actually... - Weren't you a special hire?

1330
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,669
- When I hosted "X-Man," - Yes.

1331
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,010
(They first met on "X-Man.")

1332
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,939
- he was at Shin Dong Yeob's agency. - That's right.

1333
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,109
Before Kyeong Hwan took the comedian test,

1334
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,439
- we tested him. - I see.

1335
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,649
He asked for our advice.

1336
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,650
- What did you perform? - Was it you and Oh Na Mi?

1337
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,780
It was a long time ago, but Kyeong Hwan...

1338
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,750
gave me the impression that he'd struggle.

1339
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,490
He said to me,

1340
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,759
"Even if you don't pass this time, don't give up."

1341
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,560
(Born withered from the beginning)

1342
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,430
- He didn't think you'd pass. - It was because...

1343
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,400
I opened the door and strode in,

1344
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,069
and there were a load of seniors. Were you there, Haha?

1345
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,229
- No, I wasn't. - No?

1346
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,240
Anyway, there were so many seniors.

1347
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,769
- I was extra nervous. - Right.

1348
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,410
- That's why it was like that. - I see.

1349
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,810
Okay. This haenyeo restaurant...

1350
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,879
- They waited for you to stop. - Why say "okay?"

1351
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,409
As soon as he said "it was like that..."

1352
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,050
(His story is shockingly boring.)

1353
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,620
- "It was like that..." - He's our special guest.

1354
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,219
- He was telling a story, - As if you were waiting...

1355
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,020
- by the way. - By the way.

1356
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,760
- Don't cut it out. You can't. - You can't.

1357
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,220
- Don't mock him with his phrases. - He's not even saying them.

1358
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,889
(Avoided being cut out with his buzzwords)

1359
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,760
This haenyeo restaurant serves seafood that the divers...

1360
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:19,930
(Continuing on)

1361
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,630
caught in the Tongyeong sea as well as raw mackerel.

1362
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,430
(The first romantic spot: Haenyeo restaurant)

1363
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,069
It was fresh.

1364
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,770
(From seafood pulled out every morning...)

1365
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,830
- It looks good. - It looks good.

1366
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,769
- I saw the mackerel. - I like raw mackerel.

1367
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,240
(to fresh mackerel available only in the area)

1368
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,969
It's really alive.

1369
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,409
You're free to order what you want,

1370
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,779
(Remaining balance: 45 dollars)

1371
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,779
and of course, we'll deduct it from your expenses.

1372
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,880
(The cost will be deducted based on what they order.)

1373
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,710
- Can I have seafood ramyeon? - It was fresh.

1374
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,910
Let's eat first.

1375
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,879
Order seafood ramyeon and eat that outside.

1376
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,749
(Targeting the cheap instant noodles first)

1377
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,979
Yes, that's romantic.

1378
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,850
- I'll have one too. - By the sea.

1379
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,820
(Seafood ramyeon: 10 dollars per portion)

1380
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,189
I want seafood ramyeon too.

1381
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,689
One ramyeon for every two people.

1382
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,959
Should I order...

1383
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,019
- five seafood ramyeon? - Yes.

1384
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,030
What about raw mackerel?

1385
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,259
(Mackerel: 20 dollars per fish)

1386
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,759
- Raw mackerel. - Seafood...

1387
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,100
(5 ramyeon is already over the balance.)

1388
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,359
- It's a must when we're here. - Yes.

1389
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,859
There's no reason to scrimp.

1390
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,130
(Mackerel is a must when they're all the way out on Yokji Island.)

1391
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,959
You should order some fish.

1392
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,900
But if we order too much, the total...

1393
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,299
- Two raw mackerel. - Will two plates be enough?

1394
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,369
(5 seafood ramyeon, 2 raw mackerel, Total: 90 dollars)

1395
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,299
- We must order three. - That's so much.

1396
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,609
(5 seafood ramyeon, 3 raw mackerel, Total: 110 dollars)

1397
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,609
Sea pineapple, please.

1398
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,569
Three mackerel, three ramyeon,

1399
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,439
(Ordering more without thinking of the consequences)

1400
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,639
- Yes. - three sea pineapple.

1401
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,510
- Three ramyeon? - Sounds good.

1402
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
(3 seafood ramyeon, 3 raw mackerel, 3 stone sea squirt, )
(Total: 120 dollars)

1403
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,710
- One more just for me. - Four ramyeon?

1404
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,879
(Ordering another portion of instant noodles for Jae Seok)

1405
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,810
There's no way he wants to share his ramyeon.

1406
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,820
(The total is 130 dollars.)

1407
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,179
I hope we get a nice romantic photo.

1408
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,519
(At this rate, another member will face a penalty.)

1409
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,380
- Yes. - Seriously.

1410
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,490
We need a nice one.

1411
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,220
(Only the romantic photos can make up for the meal cost.)

1412
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:19,020
Two losers at rock-paper-scissors can go topless.

1413
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,859
- What? - Today,

1414
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,159
it looks like you're the lead.

1415
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,329
Shall I pose outside?

1416
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,459
- Topless? I don't mind. - Yes.

1417
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,160
- You can swim. - Or pose with seaweed...

1418
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,660
as if you're leaving the water.

1419
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,129
- No. That and romance... - Haha.

1420
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,499
Your ideas are contrived.

1421
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,969
How so? It's perfect.

1422
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,509
- Posing with seaweed... - Yes.

1423
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,370
(Young Forty Ha is clueless about the current trend.)

1424
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,339
- Is that fun? - That's not romantic.

1425
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,879
There's your kind of romance,

1426
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,579
and there's my kind too.

1427
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,279
- Yours is old-fashioned. - What's yours, then?

1428
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,249
You're going back to the mid-2000s.

1429
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,750
This is insane. I'm really flustered now.

1430
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,589
What photo should we take, then?

1431
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,720
(Wanting to avoid the unnaturalness of the past)

1432
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,150
You're going back to the early days of Twitter.

1433
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,119
- Were you on Twitter? - No.

1434
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,830
(While the former street member is bickering)

1435
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,219
Are you on Instagram?

1436
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,589
- No. - Young Forty.

1437
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,429
How about a photo of you and your plummeting stocks?

1438
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,500
Isn't that romantic?

1439
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,860
You're all smiles...

1440
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,200
when you lost money.

1441
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,430
(The romance of the blue stock screen)

1442
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,070
- I like that. - That's funny.

1443
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,839
Him like this. That works.

1444
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,640
That's way better than a strand of seaweed.

1445
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,210
Because the KOSPI fell significantly...

1446
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,740
(Upset)

1447
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,539
- Let's do that. - Did you lose some hair?

1448
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,639
Are you okay with that?

1449
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,410
- With what? - Playing a guy in his 20s.

1450
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,809
You don't look that young.

1451
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,979
- Already, he looks like... - I like that he's a minion.

1452
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,879
he aged three more years.

1453
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,250
(Already)

1454
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,249
My mustache grew a bit, right?

1455
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,650
- My mustache grew. - That short boat ride...

1456
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,720
(His jaw area has become dark.)

1457
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,490
aged you by three years.

1458
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,719
- This is... - What guy in his 20s...

1459
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
has hair growing on his neck?

1460
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,429
He has hair on his neck.

1461
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,060
You have hair growing on your neck.

1462
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,459
- They could use AI. - Yes.

1463
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,100
Or maybe they'll use a filter app.

1464
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,630
The food's here.

1465
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,740
(At that moment, the Yokji Island lunch arrives.)

1466
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,769
Its stone sea squirt.

1467
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,239
- What is this? - Stone sea squirt.

1468
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,570
It's stone sea squirt.

1469
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,309
(Picked and prepared in person, )

1470
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,509
They harvested it themselves.

1471
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,810
(stone sea squirt exploding with flavor)

1472
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,640
It's stone sea squirt.

1473
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,280
It tastes best with chojang.

1474
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,839
- Raw mackerel. - Raw mackerel.

1475
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,780
(Raw mackerel that's chewier because it's cut fresh)

1476
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,479
- My gosh. - Raw mackerel.

1477
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,579
This is amazing.

1478
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,219
- This is true romance. - This is romance.

1479
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,220
(The romance that can only be experienced on Yokji Island)

1480
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,380
This is romance.

1481
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,520
It's stone sea squirt.

1482
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,560
(A feast of romantic Yokji Island)

1483
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,050
This is romance.

1484
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,460
Let's taste the stone sea squirt.

1485
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,120
- It's romance. - Right?

1486
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,030
(Tongyeong Bomber tries the stone sea squirt first.)

1487
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,329
It's stone sea squirt.

1488
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,960
- This is just... - Let's enjoy.

1489
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,659
People drink soju from the shell.

1490
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,800
- This was alive just now. - It's really savory.

1491
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,130
(Dipping it in the sweet and tangy chojang)

1492
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,970
It was caught here.

1493
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,369
It's so good.

1494
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,640
(Amazed)

1495
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,200
- What's good? - The stone sea squirt.

1496
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,940
Try the stone sea squirt with just a little chojang.

1497
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,910
(The flavor of the ocean explodes in the mouth!)

1498
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,679
I've never tried stone sea squirt.

1499
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,810
(The food fighter's first stone sea squirt experience)

1500
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,650
You haven't? It has a really deep flavor.

1501
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,310
This is great.

1502
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,220
Is this mackerel? It's nice.

1503
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,550
(Impressed)

1504
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,490
- It's good. - With this...

1505
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,089
(Refreshing yet flavorful, )

1506
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,050
Stone sea squirt.

1507
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,130
(it's the charm of stone sea squirt.)

1508
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,120
Even with just a little sauce...

1509
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,960
The stone sea squirt is good.

1510
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,629
- The flavor of the sea. - It's almost sweet.

1511
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,760
(Touched)

1512
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,790
- It's the sea. - Isn't it great?

1513
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,630
- Is this mackerel? - Because we came to Yokji Island...

1514
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,570
- Hey. - This is romance.

1515
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,070
(He's not angry.)

1516
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,170
It's fragrant.

1517
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,970
This is the sea.

1518
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,470
- Isn't it flavorful? - It's good.

1519
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,880
If you mess up the raw mackerel just a little,

1520
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,240
(It's time for the raw mackerel.)

1521
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,480
- it smells bad. - Raw mackerel...

1522
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,480
(What does the raw mackerel, prepared fresh, taste like?)

1523
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,350
- If it's not fresh... - Is it good?

1524
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,919
It was caught here.

1525
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,980
- It was alive just now. - It's really savory.

1526
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,219
It's really fresh.

1527
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,820
- This is romance. - This is the sea.

1528
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,190
(A one-line review)

1529
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,620
- Isn't it really savory? - It's great.

1530
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,260
(It literally tastes fresh from the ocean!)

1531
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,689
- It's so savory. - Yes.

1532
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,830
Isn't it savory?

1533
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,060
The mackerel...

1534
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,629
Ordinary sea pineapple...

1535
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,100
(Wide-eyed)

1536
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,899
The mackerel's good.

1537
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,240
- Is it good? - It's so fresh.

1538
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,769
It's nice and fatty.

1539
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,769
- The mackerel isn't fishy at all. - It's not?

1540
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,009
- Trust me and eat it. - Is it tasty?

1541
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,080
(It's flavorful and not fishy at all.)

1542
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,010
It's so fresh.

1543
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:28,409
It's nice and fatty.

1544
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,180
- The mackerel isn't fishy at all. - It's not?

1545
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,849
- It's not fishy. - Is it good?

1546
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,680
(Try it right now!)

1547
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,020
It's so savory.

1548
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,149
The fattiness is so...

1549
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,289
Why is it so savory?

1550
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,220
(It's a taste worth visiting Yokji Island for.)

1551
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,450
- It's so delicious. - The thing is...

1552
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,890
It's so fresh.

1553
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,489
If it isn't fresh...

1554
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,790
- It's so tasty. - It was alive earlier.

1555
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,760
- It's good, right? - The raw mackerel is so good.

1556
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,560
It's really tasty.

1557
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,760
- It's so savory. - Eat up.

1558
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,700
It melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

1559
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,930
Because we came to Yokji Island...

1560
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,040
- It's so good. - Gosh, it's so savory.

1561
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,310
- It's savory, right? - It melts your mouth.

1562
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:59,580
(The black cat is also devouring it.)

1563
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,249
Gosh, Ssaebssaeb, you're eating the raw mackerel so well.

1564
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:07,920
(Ssaebssaeb makes a ssam out of it.)

1565
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,779
You can hear the crunch when you chew.

1566
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,579
Is mackerel always this savory?

1567
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,749
You can hear the crunch.

1568
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,849
- It's so savory. - Gosh, this is so nice.

1569
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,820
(While everyone is captivated by the taste of Yokji Island, )

1570
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,250
It's nice and fatty.

1571
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,660
(the son of Tongyeong feels satisfied even without the food.)

1572
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,120
This is Tongyeong.

1573
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,130
- Why aren't you eating, though? - I ate.

1574
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,959
You're not eating.

1575
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,059
- I ate. - You just bragged about Tongyeong.

1576
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
He just ate.

1577
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,970
(The senior of KBS spoils the mood.)

1578
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,099
I know that he ate,

1579
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,699
- but be more enthusiastic. - Okay.

1580
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,139
- Here, I'm eating. - Be enthusiastic...

1581
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,900
Gosh, it's so savory.

1582
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,339
- It's so delicious. - It's so good.

1583
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,940
(Just when everyone is enjoying the food)

1584
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,539
This mackerel is...

1585
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,270
Gosh, the ramyeon is here!

1586
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,509
How long have you liked it?

1587
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:38,750
(The seafood ramyeon they've been waiting for has arrived.)

1588
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,880
Gosh, it's huge!

1589
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,749
- The ramyeon is so big. - Why is it so big?

1590
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,780
It's really big.

1591
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,380
Hey, there are scallops.

1592
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,050
(An ultraluxury seafood ramyeon with octopus and scallops)

1593
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,950
Octopus is a source of protein too.

1594
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:44,989
It looks delicious.

1595
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,720
- It looks so good. - Gosh, seriously.

1596
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,520
(It's finally time for Jae Seok to dig in.)

1597
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,460
- Is that two servings? - Let's share.

1598
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,090
- It's full of seafood. - You're right.

1599
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:54,030
(Taking a piece of the plump octopus leg)

1600
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,930
It's so tasty.

1601
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,530
(Eating in a bite)

1602
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,930
Octopus is a source of protein too.

1603
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,300
(The octopus leg breaks off softly.)

1604
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,840
Hey, but this octopus...

1605
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,870
They steamed it really well.

1606
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,110
(Seok Sam also tries the octopus.)

1607
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,239
- The seafood ramyeon is so good. - Yes.

1608
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,710
The owner here is an expert.

1609
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,179
(An instant noodle must-eat place...)

1610
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,350
(approved by the instant noodle lover)

1611
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,220
This is so good.

1612
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,860
Gosh, the ramyeon is amazing.

1613
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,160
The seafood is really fresh,

1614
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,130
(Full of praises)

1615
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,560
and it's just so tasty.

1616
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,130
Compared to the seafood ramyeon we eat in Seoul...

1617
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,499
You can hear the crunch when you chew.

1618
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,000
(Without finishing his sentence, he drinks it down from the plate.)

1619
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,470
The octopus really tastes different.

1620
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,440
(Old Haha takes a photo first.)

1621
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,540
This is delicious.

1622
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,409
(With kimchi on top, )

1623
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,150
It's so good.

1624
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,080
(Yokji Island is practically paradise.)

1625
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,980
- It's delicious. - It's so good.

1626
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,290
Hey, I'm in love with this.

1627
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,559
- Your total order is 130 dollars. - Yes.

1628
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,830
Even after spending your remaining 45 dollars in travel expenses,

1629
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,730
you spent an extra 85 dollars.

1630
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,329
At this rate, another person will get the penalty for sure.

1631
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,770
Now, we will end the first romantic photo vote.

1632
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,800
(If they fail the romantic photo mission, )

1633
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,330
If you're not seen as romantic,

1634
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,140
(1 more member will receive a penalty.)

1635
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,400
one person will be added to get the penalty right away.

1636
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,570
I'll read some of the responses out loud.

1637
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,599
(Revealing some of the replies first)

1638
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,210
(That Romantic Guy from Back Then)

1639
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,940
"This isn't romantic."

1640
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,280
"Romance only begins when you're with a handsome man."

1641
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,579
They just insulted me.

1642
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,410
(It can't be romantic by nature.)

1643
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,680
It's your photo.

1644
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,520
That's true.

1645
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,119
And this one also said it wasn't romantic.

1646
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,349
"Just Mr. Teeth."

1647
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,919
Gosh, the teeth... "Mr. Teeth."

1648
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,220
Can we catch that person?

1649
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,789
Also, "The romance was rolling in,"

1650
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,260
"but it bounced off of his front teeth and left."

1651
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,660
(Before they can feel the romance, people can only see his teeth.)

1652
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,799
- That's funny. - Nice one.

1653
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,329
Those who say it is romantic said,

1654
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,330
"It's romantic."

1655
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:38,329
"The wrinkles on his chin and by his eyes show the time..."

1656
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,899
"and the shining sea express the contrast,"

1657
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,139
- "which is romantic." - Yes, that's romance.

1658
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,110
(The photo's intention has been clearly delivered.)

1659
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,639
- That's romantic. - Romance is about time gone by.

1660
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,339
And, "The kind of romance of a handsome middle-aged guy..."

1661
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,880
"who went on a fishing trip after retiring."

1662
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,579
- I'm at that age too. - That's it.

1663
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,210
- That was your concept, right? - Yes, it was.

1664
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,010
We've had many comments on whether it was romantic or not.

1665
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,220
("That Romantic Guy from Back Then" received 782 replies.)

1666
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,180
- I'll announce the result. - Okay.

1667
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,320
So, the result of the romantic vote is...

1668
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,960
(If they succeed, there won't be any more members penalized!)

1669
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,450
The result is?

1670
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,320
It's romantic.

1671
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,689
With a ratio of 8 to 2,

1672
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,259
people said it wasn't romantic.

1673
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,600
(It is not romantic: 632, It's romantic: 150)

1674
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,799
- My gosh. - See, Jae Seok?

1675
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,900
(Romance mission failed)

1676
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,829
- Why did you go with that photo? - You didn't ask our permission.

1677
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,670
(Another member gets a penalty for failing to deduct expenses.)

1678
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,030
Who are you to decide?

1679
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,340
This happened to us because he's ugly.

1680
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,200
Can't you say that when I'm not around?

1681
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,510
I'm officially sorry about this.

1682
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,539
Because Se Chan was wearing sunglasses,

1683
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,340
many people asked if it was Haha.

1684
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,979
(It's romantic.)

1685
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,120
(Young Forty Ha has finally found his age and seems at ease.)

1686
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,180
Sorry, Haha.

1687
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:30,349
- You guys look the same. - You and I are the same.

1688
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,620
(The body-shaming comment backfired on him.)

1689
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,789
- You look the same. - You're the same type.

1690
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,219
- The same kind. - Well,

1691
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,320
(Currently, 2 members are to be penalized.)

1692
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,689
we should really post a good photo.

1693
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,629
- Yes, let's get a good one. - Let's make it very romantic.

1694
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,029
(They can eliminate those members...)

1695
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,590
What about you, Ye Eun? A romantic photo.

1696
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,560
(only when they succeed in the next photo mission.)

1697
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,759
I think a photo of Ji Hyo holding a seashell...

1698
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,670
on the beach is romantic.

1699
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,370
(Booing)

1700
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,400
- Gosh, come on. - She could hold the seashells...

1701
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,470
- That's awful. - Hey.

1702
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,270
(The criteria for romance have become strict.)

1703
00:42:46,471 --> 00:42:47,539
- Why would she hold seashells? - Just holding seashells?

1704
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,669
- She could hold the seashells... - How is that romantic?

1705
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,009
Or we could string these together...

1706
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,710
and make a seashell necklace.

1707
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,240
(Laughing)

1708
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,639
- String the seashells together - String the seashells together

1709
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,279
(Which photo will get the romantic seal of approval?)

1710
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,709
What do you think?

1711
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,680
- Here's what we're doing next. - Okay.

1712
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,650
(The second romantic spot)

1713
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,549
On Yokji Island, there is Korea's first-ever tuna farm,

1714
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,779
which is something Tongyeong is known for.

1715
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,819
- Really? - My gosh.

1716
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,490
It's here because the environment is so clean here.

1717
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,750
(The second place to enjoy romance)

1718
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,560
I've never heard of tuna farming.

1719
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,560
(The nation's first tuna farm on Yokji Island)

1720
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,260
They say it's feeding time for the tuna now,

1721
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,030
(You can feed the tuna!)

1722
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,299
so we'll get to feed the fish and take a look around.

1723
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,799
Let's head to the farm.

1724
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,600
- That's awesome. - Nice.

1725
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,799
- That sounds amazing. - I'm curious.

1726
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,969
So, tuna farming has been around...

1727
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,270
for quite a bit,

1728
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,669
but ever since it started,

1729
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,769
we've been able to eat good tuna...

1730
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,269
(President Tong's useless sea facts:)

1731
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,739
and even the innards in Korea as well.

1732
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,509
(Since Korea started farming tuna, )

1733
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,879
- Really? - You know so much.

1734
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,650
(people can enjoy fresh tuna and its entrails.)

1735
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,279
- Yes, of course. - Hey, Tongyeong.

1736
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,449
Before, we used to eat Japanese tuna...

1737
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,880
- that were frozen. - That's right.

1738
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,480
(Explaining smoothly)

1739
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,480
- We couldn't eat the innards. - But now, we have fresh tuna.

1740
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,050
I'm sorry, but are you the mayor here?

1741
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,549
- This is so nice. - Since you're here,

1742
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,120
(President Tong knows everything about Tongyeong.)

1743
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,989
- I'll tell you what I know... - Are you entering an election?

1744
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,959
- You can also have tuna in Korea. - I mean,

1745
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,659
are you entering the local election next year?

1746
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,289
Hey, man. You're the Boss of Tongyeong.

1747
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,730
- This is nice. - This is tuna we're talking about.

1748
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,199
At the tuna farm,

1749
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,940
(The members can upload a romantic photo at the tuna farm.)

1750
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,299
you'll give us a romantic photo with a caption.

1751
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,699
Then, we'll post it on social media and put it to a vote.

1752
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,969
Let's get a good romantic photo from now on...

1753
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,970
(Desperate to cut down on expenses as they've eaten a lot)

1754
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,369
- so we can make money somehow. - We have to make money.

1755
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,709
- "Romance is just tuna-tural." - We should make money.

1756
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,770
(A romantic phrase)

1757
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,639
- Can we take photos with the tuna? - Then, let's go.

1758
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,379
- Let's get going. - I'm curious about the tuna.

1759
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,610
(Off to Port Deokdong, where the tuna dock is)

1760
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,180
Me too. I've never seen live tuna before.

1761
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,780
It really feels like we're on a school trip.

1762
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,850
By the way, it's so pretty here.

1763
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,880
(They must succeed in the next romantic photo.)

1764
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,250
It's so pretty. It looks like a fairy tale.

1765
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,689
- Hey, Haha. - Back then...

1766
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,090
This is romantic.

1767
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,489
- My gosh! - Gosh, that's pretty.

1768
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,160
- This! - Gosh, this place is nice too.

1769
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,889
Hey, as we go up, the right side looks incredible.

1770
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,330
(A blue ocean that clears the mind)

1771
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:17,959
Hey, look at the view here!

1772
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,700
- This is insane. - Isn't this romantic?

1773
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,129
Gosh, this is nice.

1774
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,870
(Used to it)

1775
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,870
- Yes, look at the island. - It's so pretty.

1776
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,429
- In Tongyeong... - When would we get to see this?

1777
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,500
(A small island within an island)

1778
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:25,669
I feel like I'm on a plane.

1779
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,540
- This is so beautiful. - It really is.

1780
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,870
The view is incredible.

1781
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,540
Hey, look to the left. The left side is...

1782
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,509
Gosh, that's amazing.

1783
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:38,410
(Everywhere they look, it's a superb scenery.)

1784
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,510
It's so different.

1785
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:38,950
- Gosh, it's so pretty! - This place is like...

1786
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,779
Hey, you could say this was Italy, and I'd believe it.

1787
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,020
- Seok Jin. - That horizon...

1788
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,949
This is Korea. Why do you keep saying...

1789
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,719
- it's Italy? - I mean, look at the view.

1790
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,089
- Everyone, Korea is this pretty. - Seriously, is this Korea?

1791
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,020
(President Tong)

1792
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,189
- It's this beautiful. - Yes.

1793
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,830
Why would you go so far?

1794
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,499
- This is insane. - I can see so far.

1795
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,630
It's incredible.

1796
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,469
- The photo doesn't do it justice. - The sun shining on the water.

1797
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,470
(A blue horizon unfolds along the seaside road)

1798
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,739
Hey, it'll be over if Se Chan goes shirtless here.

1799
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,839
Why would he go shirtless?

1800
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,740
You can see all the way out there!

1801
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,110
(Enjoying the romance of the endless ocean)

1802
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,009
This place is nice.

1803
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,139
It's unbelievable.

1804
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,909
- Gosh, this is so cool! - It's awesome.

1805
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,510
- It's so cool. - This place is beautiful.

1806
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,750
It's so touching.

1807
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,779
Guys, those islands out there...

1808
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,379
aren't visible when the weather is bad.

1809
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,090
- But we're lucky today. - We can see them today.

1810
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,519
(President Tong's useless sea facts:)

1811
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,219
Hey, the weather really did it all, don't you think?

1812
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,889
(The islands can be seen...)

1813
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,019
(thanks to the good weather.)

1814
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,690
Isn't that a floating fish cage?

1815
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,120
(Is that the farm?)

1816
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,260
Isn't that a floating fish cage?

1817
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,829
- That round... - There's tuna!

1818
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,129
That round thing is for the tuna.

1819
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,229
The round one is for tuna?

1820
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,229
(Mackerel, tuna)

1821
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,130
Next to the tuna, they farm mackerel as well.

1822
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,529
(President Tong's useless sea facts:)

1823
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,799
The small ones are mostly for mackerel.

1824
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,870
(Tuna and mackerels are farmed together.)

1825
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,969
They farm mackerel too?

1826
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,040
You farm the mackerel and feed it to the tuna, right?

1827
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,669
- The tuna eats the mackerel. - That's right.

1828
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,509
- Mackerel? - But not those. Frozen ones.

1829
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,139
- Oh, frozen ones. - I see.

1830
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,209
(President Tong's useless sea facts:)

1831
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,809
- Frozen ones? - Frozen ones.

1832
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,380
(Tuna is fed with frozen mackerels.)

1833
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,550
- Frozen ones. - Frozen ones.

1834
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,020
You ride that small boat in from over there.

1835
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,120
(President Tong's "Tongyeong Expedition" will continue.)

1836
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,350
Gosh, the water is so clear.

1837
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,490
I've never heard of tuna farming.

1838
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,320
Let's get on.

1839
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,320
(Getting on the boat to the romantic spot, the tuna farm)

1840
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,420
All right. I'll hold your hand for you.

1841
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,489
- No joking around on the boat. - Watch out.

1842
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,960
(They've changed into work outfits.)

1843
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,060
- You'll hurt your knees. Careful. - Watch out.

1844
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,729
- Watch out. - This is short.

1845
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,130
Hello.

1846
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,570
(It'll be a 15-minute boat ride.)

1847
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,899
- Yes, hello. - Hello.

1848
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,499
- We'll be back! - Hello.

1849
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,770
- See you later. - We'll catch a lot of fish!

1850
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,839
- Okay! - Hey, they're already caught.

1851
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,310
(Already caught)

1852
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,310
What are you going to catch?

1853
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,069
- Hey, this is kind of romantic. - The water is so clear.

1854
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,340
- It's romantic. - It is.

1855
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,680
Hey, isn't this romantic? Sitting here like this?

1856
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,210
Gosh, seriously...

1857
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,449
My goodness. Those crows and...

1858
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,650
We should take a photo of this.

1859
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,719
- How nice. Look at the sunlight. - We should take a photo of this.

1860
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,890
That's so nice.

1861
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,520
The sunlight looks incredible on the water.

1862
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:29,290
(A sun shower stretches across the open sea.)

1863
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,390
It's dazzling.

1864
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,560
- This is romance itself. - This is literally crazy.

1865
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,660
(It's already romantic as they set off.)

1866
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,759
This is incredible.

1867
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,259
- The sunlight is dazzling. - What an amazing sight.

1868
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,099
- Hey, this is it. - It's so beautiful.

1869
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,330
This feels therapeutic.

1870
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,870
Gosh, it's so beautiful.

1871
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,870
Hey, look at that!

1872
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,010
(In awe)

1873
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,180
Now, this is what I call life!

1874
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:49,010
(Fascinated)

1875
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,179
This is how you enjoy life!

1876
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,920
What more is there to life?

1877
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,849
(The fatal dose of romance...)

1878
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,790
(makes the mission photographer start working.)

1879
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,220
Okay, stay right there.

1880
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,850
Yes, take a photo.

1881
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,359
- Gosh, that's nice. - That's romantic.

1882
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,459
- Se Chan, sit. - Hey, get in.

1883
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,790
(Pouring his heart and soul to avoid the penalty)

1884
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,489
Get in here.

1885
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,459
- We have a backlight, right? - Kind of, yes.

1886
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,130
It looks cool with a backlight.

1887
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,099
- Let me see. - Hey, this is romantic.

1888
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,500
(It's a nice photo, but the poses are too 1990s.)

1889
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,130
Hey, this photo is...

1890
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,170
- This photo is amazing. - We could write something there.

1891
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,529
- Is it okay? - Hey, this is romantic.

1892
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,439
- Everyone, get in. - Let's all get in.

1893
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,770
(This time, it's a group photo.)

1894
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,569
- Come here. - Everyone, get in.

1895
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,109
- Sit down. Shall we sit? - Yes.

1896
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,269
- Sit here. - We're almost there.

1897
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,309
- So, - Hey, this is incredible.

1898
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,409
the title should be Boat-TS.

1899
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,050
(The photo)

1900
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,179
- Boat-TS! - Boat-TS.

1901
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,809
Yes, Boat-TS...

1902
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:27,520
(The plan is to get likes by using the world star.)

1903
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,619
- What about you, Kyeong Hwan? - I'm fine.

1904
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,050
- But what about Kyeong Hwan? - Get closer.

1905
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,650
(Their expressions are like those of current idols.)

1906
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,919
That's nice. One second.

1907
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,990
It's nice, right?

1908
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,630
(From far away, it looks like a group smuggling operation.)

1909
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,090
Are we going to make a V?

1910
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,059
Hey, how nice would it be to have a seagull in the shot?

1911
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,530
- Oh, the backlight. - That's so nice.

1912
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,429
Seagull incoming!

1913
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,899
(At that moment, a seagull interrupts.)

1914
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,859
- Come on, seagull! - It's in.

1915
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,969
I got it!

1916
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,170
(Satisfied)

1917
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:45,269
- Did you get the seagull? - I got it in the shot.

1918
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,039
Seagulls

1919
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,599
- The seagull. - Hey, nice!

1920
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,200
(Showing off)

1921
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,669
- The seagull. - You got the seagull.

1922
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,169
- That's romantic. - You took great photos!

1923
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,939
(Title: "BTS: Boat to the Sea")

1924
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,269
- Hey, this is really romantic. - I got the seagull.

1925
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,340
(A tiny seagull)

1926
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,739
- It's romantic. - It really is.

1927
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,879
- This is really romantic. - Hey.

1928
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:59,410
(The members are excited, cosplaying as idols.)

1929
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
- This is... - You took good photos.
- so beautiful. - The photos are great.

1930
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,880
It's romantic.

1931
00:47:57,881 --> 00:47:58,950
Hello

1932
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,419
My adorable friend

1933
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,450
(Singing)

1934
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,520
- Young Forty. - This is romantic. Dancing.

1935
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:05,749
(Haha is in a dance fever.)

1936
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,920
Young Forty.

1937
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,260
(But the moves are bad.)

1938
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,360
Seriously, why did he end up like that?

1939
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,660
"Why did he end up like that?"

1940
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,559
He used to know how to be cool.

1941
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,000
(Making it worse)

1942
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,700
Yes, back in the day.

1943
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,030
(Haha continues to dance as if he's not hurt.)

1944
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,929
I used to like Dong Hoon and his fashion.

1945
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,069
Isn't that an old dance?

1946
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,300
- Right. - It is, right?

1947
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,440
This one.

1948
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,940
(The chief and assistant manager are out on a picnic.)

1949
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,580
This is what Haha was doing.

1950
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,579
- It was this. - I wasn't copying him.

1951
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,119
- You weren't doing it right. - I wasn't doing the same move.

1952
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,919
Your moves were all over the place.

1953
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,450
I was dancing the way I felt.

1954
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,250
(Shameless)

1955
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,890
(His random dance becomes more intense.)

1956
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,430
He seems to be in a great mood.

1957
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,500
(Chief Jee is fired up.)

1958
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,860
- He's in the best mood. - Right.

1959
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,560
He's in a good mood as long as we don't mention his age.

1960
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,030
(Singing)

1961
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,330
Seok Jin, are you in a good mood?

1962
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,340
(Dancing with his hips while singing)

1963
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,769
- Just don't mention his age. - You're like Mr. Tong.

1964
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,139
Seok Jin, you're like Mr. Tong.

1965
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,539
Look at him go.

1966
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,370
(A bounce that's unbelievable for his age)

1967
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,040
Just don't mention his age.

1968
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,010
Se Chan, join us.

1969
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,180
(Assistant Manager Yang joins.)

1970
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,849
(Ji Hyo, who hasn't been invited, jumps in.)

1971
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,590
- Nice. - This is what romance is!

1972
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,820
(Laughing)

1973
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,089
- This is what romance is. - Nice!

1974
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,330
(Going all out on the deck without any music)

1975
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,889
- Join us if you're jealous. - Ji Hyo...

1976
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,129
- has changed a lot. - Tell me about it.

1977
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,830
- Go, Ji Hyo. - She's changed so much.

1978
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,300
- Yes! - Nice!

1979
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,559
(Just when a dance party, one that even the Dragon King...)

1980
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,800
(would be shocked by, is going on)

1981
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,330
- This is what romance is. - I love it.

1982
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,569
This is great.

1983
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:26,770
We're here.

1984
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:30,710
There's a whole lot of tuna in there.

1985
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,569
I haven't been to a place like this before.

1986
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:36,580
(The second romantic spot: Tuna farm)

1987
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,109
- It's in the middle of the sea. - I've only been...

1988
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,540
- What's this? - to an abalone farm before.

1989
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,650
- No way. - My gosh.

1990
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,849
(Korea's first tuna farm in the coastal waters...)

1991
00:49:37,651 --> 00:49:39,919
- Look at the water swirling. - They swim really fast.

1992
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,550
(of Yokji Island)

1993
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,719
- Is there tuna in there? - Over there.

1994
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,289
(Each enclosure contains...)

1995
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,819
They're going wild over there.

1996
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,319
- No way! - They're black!

1997
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,090
(around 400 tuna that weigh 40 to 50kg.)

1998
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,549
- Anyway, - My gosh.

1999
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,059
just so you know, tuna are very sensitive.

2000
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,930
(The tuna are swimming in the water.)

2001
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,429
- There are fish everywhere. - They are everywhere!

2002
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,260
- Is it half water, half fish? - No way.

2003
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,800
They swim really fast.

2004
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:54,859
I can see them.

2005
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,670
- No way. - Look how fast they are.

2006
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,529
- Se Chan, you can ride on those. - They're really fast.

2007
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,169
- They're huge. - Are they dolphins?

2008
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,370
(Ignoring)

2009
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,239
- No way. - They look like dolphins.

2010
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,269
- My gosh. - I can see them.

2011
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,410
- What if we fell in there? - It scares me too.

2012
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,009
- Here, - Yes?

2013
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,639
they raise as many as 400 tuna.

2014
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,879
- Did you say 400? - Seriously?

2015
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,549
You'll be scooping up 600 mackerel...

2016
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,519
with plastic buckets and feeding them.

2017
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,050
They eat only once a day.

2018
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,690
(The writer)

2019
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,449
- Are we feeding mackerel? - Only one meal per day?

2020
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,049
- Yes, they eat only once a day. - Really?

2021
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,719
Apparently, tuna feed on mackerel.

2022
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:23,690
(The mackerels are fed 1t of food every day.)

2023
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,759
- Mackerel. - Right.

2024
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,490
They'll be hungry if they only eat once a day.

2025
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:24,929
- I... - They eat a lot.

2026
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:27,759
Why don't I take a photo while I feed the tuna?

2027
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,560
- Are they in here? - That'd be fun.

2028
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,769
- Is that mackerel? - Isn't that mackerel?

2029
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,039
- Those are mackerel. - There's mackerel and tuna.

2030
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,400
(President Tong)

2031
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,069
- The water is splashing like crazy. - Tuna wouldn't be that small.

2032
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,839
(Tuna farm, Mackerel farm)

2033
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,309
Isn't it mackerel?

2034
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:42,180
(Mackerels are also farmed alongside the tuna.)

2035
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,669
Do you see the tuna under there?

2036
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,739
- Wait, those are mackerel. - Jae Seok!

2037
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,980
- That's mackerel. - There are so many of them!

2038
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,680
(Getting off the boat to start work)

2039
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,409
- Please get off slowly. - Do we get off?

2040
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,650
- How can we... - Watch your step.

2041
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,349
I can see them. Look.

2042
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,049
- No way. - I can see them.

2043
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,950
- Are you kidding me? - I see them.

2044
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,159
- No way. - My gosh!

2045
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,890
- Look how fast the tuna are. - No way.

2046
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,830
(Huge)

2047
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,129
- They're huge. - And they're fast.

2048
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,160
- No way. - I thought they were dolphins.

2049
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,370
(The tuna is over 1m long.)

2050
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,100
I honestly thought they were dolphins.

2051
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
This is insane.

2052
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,969
No way.

2053
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,770
- My gosh, they're huge. - This is no joke.

2054
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,039
- Come this way. - Unbelievable.

2055
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:17,080
(The tuna whirlpool moves grandly.)

2056
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,709
- I'm scared. - Shall we?

2057
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,779
- They're huge. - They're massive.

2058
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,309
- I can't believe it. - My gosh.

2059
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,049
Ji Hyo, they will be about this big.

2060
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,109
- I bet they're huge. - This is no joke.

2061
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:23,350
(The romantic spot)

2062
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,149
- I'd love to see one. - This is the spot.

2063
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,179
This is fascinating.

2064
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,749
- This is a first for me. - Daniel, this is the spot.

2065
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,249
I've never seen this in person before.

2066
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,490
- Same here. - This...

2067
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,519
- They're huge. - How can they be this huge?

2068
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,889
- Jae Seok. - They're huge.

2069
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,929
You won't believe how fast they are.

2070
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,960
Look!

2071
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,959
- What was that? - Throw them far away from you.

2072
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:39,069
(For safety, throw the feed far away.)

2073
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,700
- Throw the fish as far as you can. - Far away.

2074
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,669
- No way. - Three people to a crate.

2075
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,730
I'm scared.

2076
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,100
(Fearless Ji Hyo starts.)

2077
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,639
- Three people to a crate. - That's right.

2078
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,900
Jong Kook, come this way.

2079
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,969
- Three people to a crate. - That's right.

2080
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,169
(As soon as the bait hits the water, )

2081
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,270
Jong Kook, come this way.

2082
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,139
(the tuna snatches it.)

2083
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,080
What is it?

2084
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,949
(Amazed)

2085
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,779
This is wild!

2086
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:53,080
(They start feeding the tuna.)

2087
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,810
- No way. - Unbelievable.

2088
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,619
Throw them as far out as you can.

2089
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,150
They're going wild.

2090
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,460
(Going wild)

2091
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,390
They're huge.

2092
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,220
- My gosh. - Are they sharks?

2093
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,919
- Seriously. - No way.

2094
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,790
- My gosh. - Unbelievable.

2095
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,660
This is crazy.

2096
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,960
(A monster movie–like scene)

2097
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:08,629
Throw them far away from you.

2098
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,030
This is a new experience.

2099
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,070
- This is crazy. - They're going wild.

2100
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,370
(As far away as possible)

2101
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,400
No way.

2102
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,809
Unbelievable.

2103
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,010
- What's up with them? - They're excited.

2104
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:23,850
(A tuna show unfolds right before their eyes.)

2105
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,779
This is unbelievable.

2106
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,550
- They eat only once a day. - They're like dolphins.

2107
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,849
It's like a dolphin show at a theme park.

2108
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,019
- They're huge. - They look like jumbo mackerel.

2109
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,049
My gosh.

2110
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,290
- Throw them even farther away. - This is crazy.

2111
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,159
I'm scared.

2112
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,620
(Meanwhile, one worker seems quite used to it.)

2113
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,490
Like this.

2114
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,760
("Experience, The Scene of Life" in 1999)

2115
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,730
Throw them high with both hands!

2116
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,899
Jae Seok and Seok Jin keep up...

2117
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:43,130
(With Seok Sam, who already had a lazyboy face, )

2118
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,270
their exhausting watermelon-throwing relay.

2119
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,999
(they've already experienced actual labor.)

2120
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,400
- Hey! - Take that!

2121
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,599
(A tiny bit, a huge amount)

2122
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,940
This is unbelievable.

2123
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,810
(They're still the same even 26 years later.)

2124
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,640
(Thanks to the two members, the tuna are getting full.)

2125
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,480
Go on, kids. Eat up.

2126
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,780
This is so much fun.

2127
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,250
Look how big this one is.

2128
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:03,290
(Jong Kook and Haha are enjoying it.)

2129
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,880
Here you go. Someone have that huge mackerel.

2130
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,779
- Look at them eat. - They look like dolphins.

2131
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,349
This is insane.

2132
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,550
This is fun.

2133
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,590
I'm having a blast.

2134
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,359
No way.

2135
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,759
(His forearm muscles are being used properly...)

2136
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,499
They're like sharks.

2137
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,130
- This is fun. - Tell me about it.

2138
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,060
(for the first time in a while.)

2139
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,730
There's something enjoyable about feeding animals.

2140
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,400
There.

2141
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,270
All done.

2142
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,009
(The feed container is already empty.)

2143
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,679
(The feeding finished so quickly...)

2144
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,939
- Here we go. - They're like dolphins.

2145
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,050
- No way. - This is like a dolphin show.

2146
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,350
(that the tuna could've gotten upset stomachs.)

2147
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,850
I'm too scared to do this!

2148
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,690
(Meanwhile, it's a first for the scaredycat worker.)

2149
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,890
Se Chan, I'm scared.

2150
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,220
- These are gross. - They're not.

2151
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,090
- Can I... - Where's your scoop?

2152
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,060
(Helping her)

2153
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,419
- That's too much. - Hardly.

2154
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,960
Se Chan, that's too much!

2155
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,830
- There you go. - Throw them far away from you.

2156
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,160
(She barely throws some in with the help of Pouty Mouth.)

2157
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,300
They're going crazy.

2158
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,629
Look how excited they are.

2159
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,699
- Can I just have a few? - No way.

2160
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,469
(Excited)

2161
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,699
Look, they're like sharks.

2162
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:57,670
(Ye Eun has already gotten used to it.)

2163
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,140
They could pass as sharks.

2164
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,240
My gosh.

2165
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,879
- No way! - That's a shark.

2166
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,239
They're huge.

2167
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,709
It ate one right away.

2168
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,580
It flipped in the air.

2169
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,650
It's as if they're our pets.

2170
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,290
Hey, it's raining.

2171
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,090
It's raining.

2172
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,360
(It's raining out of the blue?)

2173
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,090
How so? What do you mean?

2174
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,859
- The mackerel are going crazy. - They're going wild.

2175
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,389
They must be feeding the mackerel.

2176
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,960
(Just in time, it's feeding time for the mackerel farm.)

2177
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,260
- That's so pretty. It's romance. - They're feeding the mackerel.

2178
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,700
It's raining over there.

2179
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,700
(The mackerels are given small fish as feed!)

2180
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:27,570
Look. It's like they're being deep-fried.

2181
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,540
It's what you'd expect to see in a fryer.

2182
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,010
(A boisterous feeding time like being deep-fried)

2183
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,610
What a sight.

2184
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,509
Right from here...

2185
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:37,280
They're raising the mackerel here just to feed the tuna.

2186
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,650
(By the way)

2187
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,750
They'll be able to see each other underwater, right?

2188
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,620
It's kind of cruel to have them right next to the tuna.

2189
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,390
Right?

2190
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,190
You poor souls.

2191
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,860
(Suddenly feeling bad after happily feeding the tuna)

2192
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,890
They go from being raised to...

2193
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:53,900
This is incredible.

2194
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,969
Look like you're having fun.

2195
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,199
Smile, everyone.

2196
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,300
- Sure. - One, two, three.

2197
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,339
(But the mission must continue!)

2198
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,910
(Taking romantic photos with bright smiles)

2199
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,609
I love it.

2200
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,369
Anyway, every day... Okay, let's do it.

2201
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,180
- Look like you're enjoying it. - Okay.

2202
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,840
(Laughing)

2203
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,650
(A forced direction, a forced smile)

2204
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,050
Nice.

2205
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,479
Se Chan, let's take a conceptual photo.

2206
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,549
How so?

2207
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,580
- Take a mackerel. - Sure.

2208
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,490
(The photographer's specialty is giving unnatural directions.)

2209
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,519
Look like you caught them. There we go.

2210
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,160
(Pretending to have caught big catches with frozen fish)

2211
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,960
Nice. I love it.

2212
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:27,200
All right. That looks great.

2213
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,430
(Satisfied)

2214
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,659
- Enjoy! - Enjoy!

2215
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,070
(Are the romantic photos by the intentionalist photographer useful?)

2216
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,029
- Grow big and healthy. - Enjoy!

2217
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,470
Who has some mackerel left?

2218
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,470
Can you give us some?

2219
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,180
(Having fun, he volunteers to work more.)

2220
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,009
Have you thrown all of yours?

2221
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,339
- We're all done. - Really?

2222
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,669
- Take these. - Take them. We have a lot left.

2223
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,939
The two of us emptied that crate.

2224
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,380
- You're done with yours? - It was so much fun.

2225
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,750
- The two of us emptied it. - Enjoy.

2226
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,720
(A refill of the feed)

2227
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,720
- Take some with you. - Okay.

2228
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,380
Enjoy!

2229
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,219
Jong Kook, take some of ours.

2230
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,919
Here you go.

2231
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:56,990
(The scene of life where everyone is having fun)

2232
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,319
All right. Take some.

2233
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,890
- Nice. - Thanks.

2234
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:01,959
(As all the members enjoyed it, )

2235
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,099
- How cool is this? - They're like dolphins.

2236
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,599
This is so much fun.

2237
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,429
- It's really fun. - Isn't this amazing?

2238
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,770
(they soon finished feeding the tuna 600 mackerels.)

2239
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,829
Kids would love to do this too.

2240
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,139
- Exactly. - This was fun.

2241
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,600
They say tuna never stop swimming.

2242
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,600
(Suddenly)

2243
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,870
- What? - What was that?

2244
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,810
- What did you say? - Tuna never stop?

2245
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,679
Tuna never stop swimming.

2246
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,980
(Accurate)

2247
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,879
- Really? - Don't keep it bottled in.

2248
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,509
Do they keep swimming without ever sleeping?

2249
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:20,850
(Sharing knowledge out of the blue to secure air time)

2250
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,549
They don't sleep.

2251
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,350
- They keep swimming. - They don't sleep?

2252
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,319
You're now done feeding the tuna.

2253
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,490
(Just in time, the romantic spot activity has ended.)

2254
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,889
You'll head out to keep taking romantic photos.

2255
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,149
- Shall we? - I wouldn't mind feeding them...

2256
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,519
- another crate. - Thank you.

2257
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,720
- Nice. This was so much fun. - Let's go.

2258
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,719
- Let's head back. - It's not easy being a tuna.

2259
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,930
(Leaving the stuffed tuna, )

2260
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,929
I'd love to throw them some more.

2261
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,289
They say that tuna never stop swimming.

2262
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,360
This was so much fun.

2263
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,560
- Romance... - That was a blast.

2264
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:38,970
(they're off to the last romantic spot.)

2265
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,969
- That was fun. - That was a lot of fun.

2266
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,269
- Seriously. - I had a great time.

2267
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,400
That was a blast.

2268
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,470
The dolphins kind of scared me though.

2269
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,240
I mean, the tuna. They kept popping up like dolphins.

2270
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,609
Will they eat us if we fall into the water?

2271
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,779
- Oh, dear. - Will they eat us?

2272
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,280
He mistook the tuna for dolphins.

2273
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,649
(Enraged)

2274
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,020
(Laughing)

2275
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,649
Would you like to have a go at it?

2276
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,049
- Sorry about that. - Bring it on.

2277
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,190
- You're being too serious. - Seok Jin, do this for us.

2278
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,519
(Calm down.)

2279
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,660
(Smiling as soon as Senior Yu cheers him up)

2280
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,190
I can't believe Seok Sam.

2281
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,429
(After 10 more minutes on the boat, )

2282
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,359
- All right. - Thank you.

2283
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,270
(they're back at the dock.)

2284
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
What's this?

2285
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,300
The back, the belly...

2286
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,870
(What welcomes the workers after the labor...)

2287
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Really?

2288
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:13,470
- What's this? - "Back and the belly."

2289
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,670
(is packaged tuna meat.)

2290
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,099
Tuna belly is pretty expensive.

2291
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,509
- Oh, this? - Yes, the belly.

2292
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,639
- We should pay for this. - The belly.

2293
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,979
We got some packages of tuna...

2294
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:23,210
(The writer)

2295
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,310
- as your dinner ingredient. - Let's have sushi.

2296
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,350
The tuna belly is usually very expensive at sushi restaurants.

2297
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,580
(Raw tuna that has been fermented for a day in advance)

2298
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,749
(From tuna belly that melts in the mouth)

2299
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,550
The belly has the most fat.

2300
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,559
(Back meat along with abdomen and spinal line)

2301
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,390
Let's eat sushi.

2302
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,260
(To light and clean-tasting meat)

2303
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,519
Then, the staff will pay for this.

2304
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,360
(As they've worked hard, the tuna is provided for free.)

2305
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,960
You can cook it nicely and enjoy.

2306
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,630
- Thank you. - Let's have braised tuna and sushi.

2307
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,259
(With tuna)

2308
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,260
(Tuna)

2309
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,229
- Sushi sounds delicious. - It does, right?

2310
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,269
- Sushi is great. - Or bibimbap is good too.

2311
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,599
- Raw fish bibimbap. - Yes!

2312
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,470
(Excited about eating fresh tuna)

2313
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,239
- Raw tuna rice bowl. - That sounds good.

2314
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,440
- The blood... - Se Chan is good at that.

2315
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,440
(The preparation)

2316
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,470
- We can do it. - Se Chan...

2317
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,440
It'll be good if I do this shirtless, right?

2318
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,740
That's romantic.

2319
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:56,580
- Shirtless, with an apron on? - The apron. Yes.

2320
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:57,880
That's romantic.

2321
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,549
We'll get on the boat to Tongyeong now.

2322
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:02,680
(Off to get on the boat to Tongyeong)

2323
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,349
- Okay, let's get going. - All right.

2324
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,390
- Okay, are we leaving now? - We're leaving?

2325
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,190
(Where's the last romantic spot?)

2326
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,989
- Are we going to Tongyeong now? - But it's nice here.

2327
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,120
Seagulls

2328
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,930
(Before leaving, they check the romantic photos.)

2329
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,130
- We made good short rib soup. - I hate this.

2330
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,260
- What is it? - I was going to eat it, but...

2331
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,929
The ones where our faces are in the shadow...

2332
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:18,170
(The photo taken on the tuna boat)

2333
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,069
- are better. - I don't know.

2334
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,469
- But this looks kind of unnatural. - It's good if you add that.

2335
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,900
- Ye Eun, your pose looks unnatural. - Why?

2336
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,240
(The cute peace sign shows the misinformed photo concept.)

2337
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,509
She was too conscious of the camera.

2338
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,240
This is a bit... Gosh, Ye Eun and Ji Hyo...

2339
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,240
- Me, Jae Seok? - Ye Eun is a phony.

2340
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,449
- But it's so tough. - The seagull is in this.

2341
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:33,410
(The romantic vibe check)

2342
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,450
But why did you look into the camera?

2343
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,320
(What's more, Niel is making eye contact with the camera.)

2344
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,419
- Really? You can't do that. Who? - You guys looked into the camera.

2345
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,449
- Really? - Who looked into the camera?

2346
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,050
- Ye Eun and Niel. - Who told them to do that?

2347
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,760
(The photographers are on edge as it's the last chance.)

2348
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,820
- It wasn't me, Haha. - Me either.

2349
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,889
On the way there, give us a photo and caption.

2350
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,730
(It's the last social media voting chance.)

2351
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:46,929
We'll tell you the result...

2352
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,729
- when we get to Tongyeong. - All right.

2353
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,330
But they're too harsh.

2354
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:51,969
- Earlier, that place. - It's fine.

2355
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,270
Or should we take one at the spot with the nice view?

2356
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,169
Shall we? Hey, shall we take one...

2357
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:59,010
(Se Chan asks to take another photo with the beautiful scenery.)

2358
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,769
- at the top there? - Yes.

2359
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,009
- On the way? - Let's take one.

2360
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,979
- The pretty spot. It was totally... - The highest point with the view.

2361
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,039
- Yes, right. - The totally pretty spot.

2362
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,050
- Shall we take one there? - Let's have one guy go shirtless.

2363
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,449
- Gosh, come on. - Se Chan.

2364
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,619
- Se Chan. - Hey, I'm fine.

2365
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,750
- Why do you keep undressing me? - That's not it.

2366
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,490
(The obsession will end only when the top is off.)

2367
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,990
Hey, Young Fo.

2368
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,959
- Young Fo. - Young Fo.

2369
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,859
Mr. Ha Young Fo.

2370
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,829
- This place is nice too. - This looks good.

2371
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:19,830
- It's romantic. - It's so pretty.

2372
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:23,300
(A must-see scenery spot discovered on the way)

2373
00:59:19,831 --> 00:59:21,960
- My goodness. - This spot, right here.

2374
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:26,230
Gosh, Jae Seok! The background here is awesome!

2375
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,069
- Gosh, that's nice. - Over there.

2376
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,140
That's the background.

2377
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,640
(They get off at the scenic spot!)

2378
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,009
- Gosh, it looks so cool. - What is this place?

2379
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,310
This place is incredible.

2380
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,080
Jae Seok, we should take a group photo here.

2381
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:38,010
(Will they be able to take a truly satisfying romantic photo here?)

2382
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,450
- Get a snapshot, by the way. - By the way.

2383
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:42,980
(Discussing the final concept to avoid penalizing more members)

2384
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,849
- Okay, so... - If you think you're healthy,

2385
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:41,850
get down.

2386
00:59:41,851 --> 00:59:44,689
Isn't there something trendier than the human pyramid?

2387
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,019
- The one where you hold hands. - Jae Seok.

2388
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,689
- The one where you make a star. - Right, something like that.

2389
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,960
(Old idea 1: Form a star)

2390
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,960
- Shall we make a star? - Oh, making a star?

2391
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,829
- Or like... - Or this is a bit old, but this...

2392
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,959
- Shooting wind with your palm? - Shooting wind and blowing away.

2393
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,430
(Old idea 2: Shoot an energy blast)

2394
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,859
- Or what about this? - We could all lie down...

2395
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,629
- in a circle and do an aerial shot. - No, that won't show the sea.

2396
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,770
(Old idea 3: A bird's-eye view lying-down shot)

2397
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,669
What about linking arms and standing side by side?

2398
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:03,100
(Despite all the brainstorming, every idea feels unnatural.)

2399
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,099
- Oh, where you stand like this? - Yes.

2400
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,400
But will people think that's romantic?

2401
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,539
I think, counting to three...

2402
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,610
- and jumping to the back is best. - How?

2403
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,510
(Eventually, another poor idea is brought about.)

2404
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,439
Oh, right. Let's try that.

2405
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,609
- Romantic? That stinks. - Let's just...

2406
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,749
- Hang on. - try taking one of each.

2407
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,849
- Let's try them. - Try all of them.

2408
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,749
Let's turn around and try to make...

2409
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,250
(Then...)

2410
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,219
- a shape. - Right.

2411
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,089
- Put your arms around each other. - Yes, let's do that.

2412
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,349
- Yes, arms around the shoulders. - As you do that...

2413
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:20,690
- Right. - Our names should be visible.

2414
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,290
(After all the discussion, this is the pose they actually go with?)

2415
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,259
- Ye Eun, come this way. - You should go here.

2416
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,360
- In the end, this is it. - Kyeong Hwan, come here.

2417
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,160
(Adding camaraderie for show in the classic pose)

2418
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,759
Should we squat down?

2419
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,200
Are we marines or what?

2420
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,100
Ready, go!

2421
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,929
- I'll take it. - Okay.

2422
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,140
- Act with your backs. - That's right.

2423
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,570
- Act sad. - Kind of like...

2424
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,840
(Trying to make their backs look happy)

2425
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:37,840
I'm taking it now.

2426
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,169
- One, two, three. - That's it.

2427
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,979
- Two, two, three. - Yes.

2428
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,009
- One, two... - That's good.

2429
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,210
(Looking back)

2430
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,309
Seok Jin, your face is slightly...

2431
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:47,650
- Why do you keep turning your face? - Wait, after 2-2-3, it should...

2432
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,080
- I wanted to try something. - Let's see.

2433
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,690
(Seok Sam still has to be the star of the show.)

2434
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,219
That could become the highlight.

2435
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,150
- But why keep turning around? - I mean...

2436
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,419
- Let's see. - You can't see my name tag.

2437
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,589
- Hey! Only Seok Jin turned around. - Yes?

2438
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,790
The title is "Grim Reaper."

2439
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,730
- He's the only one looking back. - Why? Just because...

2440
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,330
(The Grim Reaper has come for Seok Sam again.)

2441
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,530
Gosh, you're the only one looking back.

2442
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,569
- Gosh, I'm the only one... - Isn't that better? With just...

2443
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,939
Hey, there were plenty of times I wasn't looking back.

2444
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,340
Why did you only take photos when I was looking?

2445
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,210
Here's one where I'm not looking! This is all right.

2446
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,980
(Found a photo without the Grim Reaper)

2447
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,909
- The director takes good photos. - Right.

2448
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,209
- It sure is different. - Okay, let's go with this one.

2449
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,379
- Let's go with this one. - We don't have time.

2450
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,650
- Let's go! - That was fun.

2451
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,250
Could you take one of me?

2452
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,050
Take a photo of me.

2453
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,190
(Seok Sam wants a solo shot.)

2454
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,989
- Take your bags, guys. - Whose is this white one?

2455
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:26,089
Seok Jin.

2456
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,890
(Just then, an uninvited guest appears.)

2457
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,720
Gosh, what's romantic anyway?

2458
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,829
(Increased by two)

2459
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:32,429
This one.

2460
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,960
Hey, get out of the way.

2461
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,630
(He finally spots them.)

2462
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,329
Take it. You can see my name tag, right?

2463
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:37,470
One, two...

2464
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:41,439
- Let's go! - It looks good.

2465
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,470
(Working together)

2466
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,840
- Hey, Seok Jin. - Gosh, romantic...

2467
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,840
- I'll put this on my social media. - Okay.

2468
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,610
My gosh.

2469
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,380
(Yu Jae Seok's solo photo)

2470
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,450
Gosh, seriously...

2471
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,979
Gosh, you're infuriating.

2472
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,250
(They get back in the van after taking a romantic photo!)

2473
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,519
Hey, send me that photo for now.

2474
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,620
You took one of me, right?

2475
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,889
By the way, we should come up with a good title.

2476
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:03,760
(The members must decide on a title for the group photo.)

2477
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,889
Yes, I think the title is important.

2478
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,559
For the photo, we should write... We need a good title...

2479
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,960
- for it. The title. - I know.

2480
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,300
"We Will Fly Into the Blue Sky."

2481
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,469
Hey, is that a jab aimed at Seok Jin?

2482
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:11,730
- Into the sky? Hey. - Hey.

2483
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,200
Come over here, you...

2484
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,370
I'll teach her a lesson.

2485
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:16,370
You seriously...

2486
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,510
("Paradise" and "netherworld" are banned.)

2487
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,570
He was about to come at you.

2488
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,679
Good. You should be grateful...

2489
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,910
that Haha stopped me.

2490
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,979
That's funny.

2491
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,580
(Seok Sam holds back, thanks to Haha.)

2492
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,410
It's so pretty over there.

2493
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,050
How about "Sweet Little Hometown?"

2494
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,680
(Suddenly...)

2495
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,449
- Oh, right. - I love my hometown so much,

2496
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,920
and as we think about your hometowns, a view of us from behind.

2497
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,749
- What are you saying? - The photo is too weak.

2498
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,890
It's too long.

2499
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,760
By the way, Kyeong Hwan...

2500
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,490
- Kyeong Hwan is... - Yes?

2501
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:41,800
He's so funny on "Hangout With Yoo."

2502
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:45,000
(But he's not really funny here.)

2503
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,660
- But here... - But on Running Man...

2504
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,769
Well, on Running Man, you guys just talk about anything.

2505
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:48,970
- There's no context. - Right.

2506
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,039
- No context? - So, it's kind of tough.

2507
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,239
Hey, was that a jab aimed at us?

2508
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,369
You think I talk with no context?

2509
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,510
I was talking about Yokji Island, but you kept talking about Hawaii.

2510
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,549
- See? There's no context, - Hey.

2511
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:02,349
(Kyeong Hwan still struggles with how Running Man members chat.)

2512
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,149
- so it makes no sense. - That was just between us.

2513
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,580
But the show makes sense on TV.

2514
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,379
So many guests have come to Running Man,

2515
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:06,790
(Jokingly, the members say they've raised many guests.)

2516
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,820
and we talk about guests who have become popular through us.

2517
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,059
Kyeong Hwan was on our show a lot too,

2518
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,489
- We couldn't make Kyeong Hwan... - but we've never once been able...

2519
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,329
- to say that about Kyeong Hwan. - We can't make him popular.

2520
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,900
- How many times have you been here? - He must not be a good match.

2521
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,500
(Blaming the teamwork)

2522
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,960
- How many times has he been here? - Quite a lot.

2523
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,599
- About 6 or 7 times? - No.

2524
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,730
- He's been here over ten times. - Hey, really?

2525
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,339
- He has been here so many times. - I've been on this show...

2526
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,470
(He's been on 16 episodes.)

2527
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,800
pretty consistently since it started.

2528
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,469
- He comes on the show every year. - Gosh, that's a lot.

2529
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,540
Whenever Kyeong Hwan goes home after joining us,

2530
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:27,940
he leaves bitterly.

2531
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,910
- Why won't things go smoothly? - I feel kind of...

2532
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,310
(Every day)

2533
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,220
When I call him on my way home, I say, "Kyeong Hwan, good work."

2534
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,450
(In every call after the show)

2535
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,850
"Hey, why won't things go smoothly?"

2536
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,350
I say, "No, you did well." And he goes, "Did what well?"

2537
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,490
"Gosh, I just can't pull it off!"

2538
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,659
"I won't go on that show."

2539
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,559
- "Don't ever call me again." - Then, he comes on the show again.

2540
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,590
- Then, he comes back, - And the next time...

2541
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:48,360
(He has repeated it 16 times.)

2542
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:47,030
- and goes, "You punk!" - The same thing.

2543
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,559
- Right from the opening. - I mean,

2544
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,729
- the opening is fine. - The opening is great for him.

2545
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,900
(Bitter)

2546
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,069
- He's great during the opening. - It's fine.

2547
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,310
(His 17th appearance is going similarly.)

2548
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,869
- But that keeps building up, - It's because...

2549
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,139
and now, it's funny.

2550
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,309
- He's so funny. It drives me crazy. - My goodness.

2551
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,739
He loses the fight every time too.

2552
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,680
I don't think I can stay the night.

2553
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,540
(I'm leaving.)

2554
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,610
I'll take the early morning bus...

2555
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:06,680
(Hoping to go home early)

2556
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,009
- Even if I disappear... - "What's wrong with you?"

2557
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,149
"What's wrong with you?"

2558
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,349
Don't look for me.

2559
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,050
Should we hurry up and send the photo now?

2560
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,190
Should we hurry up and send the photo now?

2561
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:12,949
- Let's send it... - I thought you meant me.

2562
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:14,260
- The one of us from behind? - I was so surprised.

2563
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,719
"Hurry up and send..."

2564
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:17,429
(To Kyeong Hwan, who is struggling, )

2565
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,720
- "Kyeong Hwan home." - Should we send the photo?

2566
01:04:16,721 --> 01:04:17,790
Yes, the photo.

2567
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:20,530
(Jae Seok plays a consolation song)

2568
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,830
You are not

2569
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:25,230
("You Are Not Alone" by Michael Jackson)

2570
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:25,170
- You are not alone - Is this "One Candle?"

2571
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,470
I'm not

2572
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:28,770
I'm not alone!

2573
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:31,270
- You're not lonely? - How about "I'm Not Alone?"

2574
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,140
(The photo title)

2575
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,139
- "You're Not Alone." - "You Are Not Alone."

2576
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,239
- "You Are Not Alone." - It should be "We Are Not Alone."

2577
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,240
(Since it's us.)

2578
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,939
- "We Are Not Alone." - That's good! "You Are Not Alone."

2579
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,010
(As if by divine inspiration, the title popped into his head.)

2580
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,350
- "We Are." - "We Are Not Alone?"

2581
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,710
- "We Are Not Alone." - "We Are Not Alone."

2582
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,249
Hey, that's good.

2583
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,979
Indeed, listening to a song gives us ideas.

2584
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,590
(And with that, the last romantic photo's title is decided.)

2585
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,779
- "We Are Not Alone" sounds good. - That's why I played music.

2586
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,889
Hey, that's good. Let's go with that.

2587
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,049
- "We Are Not Alone." - In English?

2588
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,489
- "We Are Not Alone." - "We Are Not Alone" sounds good.

2589
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,519
Because we have our arms around each other...

2590
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:50,560
(Upload complete)

2591
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,690
and looking in the same direction. That's good.

2592
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:53,659
(Will their romance be approved, )

2593
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,089
Shall we get going?

2594
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:53,590
- Shall we go? - Okay!

2595
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:56,600
(and will 1 member be spared from the penalty?)

2596
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,960
- Okay! - All right!

2597
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,429
- Oh, dear. - Gosh, that's nice!

2598
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:00,970
(They're on the boat heading back to land.)

2599
01:04:58,430 --> 01:04:59,900
- Oh, my. - Put your coat on the floor.

2600
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,200
- Hey, what's there to happiness? - It's nothing much.

2601
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,610
(Planning to rest on the way back)

2602
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:04,969
Oh, man.

2603
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,239
Gosh, I'm tired.

2604
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,080
By the way, they gave us way too much tuna.

2605
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,210
What should we do with all that?

2606
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,450
(Cooking)

2607
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,280
Seok Jin, let's have some tuna as sushi,

2608
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,079
- and raw tuna rice bowls. - Hey, for sushi,

2609
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,950
- do you know how to make the rice? - Yes.

2610
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,590
Can't you make braised fish with tuna too?

2611
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:21,819
Braised fish is good too.

2612
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:25,660
(Excited for dinner since the ingredients are top-class)

2613
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,689
- We could braise the big piece. - Hey, braised tuna sounds good too.

2614
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,090
- With some radish... - That sounds delicious.

2615
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,630
But you know, with fresh tuna, you should just eat it raw.

2616
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,770
- Yes, I want sushi. It sounds good. - That's right.

2617
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,069
So, we'll have some raw too.

2618
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,070
- That's romantic. - Yes, it is.

2619
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,140
I hope the romantic vote goes well this time.

2620
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,740
(Lying down)

2621
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,679
I know, right? We should...

2622
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:48,620
(The guys, talking endlessly about food, start lying down.)

2623
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,980
Let's take a shirtless photo.

2624
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,150
The waves have died down, for sure.

2625
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:53,690
(Even Se Chan)

2626
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,030
(Awake)

2627
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:03,830
(The talkative member, who rarely naps, )

2628
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:06,870
Ji Ye Eun is so good at taking naps in the corner.

2629
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:11,540
(starts talking to himself.)

2630
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,640
Sadly enough...

2631
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,710
We will soon be arriving at Yeonhwa Island.

2632
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,140
(Haha wakes up to the transit announcement.)

2633
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:15,979
Daema Island?

2634
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,580
- Yeonhwa Island. - Yeonhwa Island. My goodness.

2635
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,350
(Jae Seok finally has someone to talk to.)

2636
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,210
Gosh, that was a great nap.

2637
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:25,589
(Except for the youngest, Ye Eun, who isn't feeling well, )

2638
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,720
Ji Ye Eun looks like a corpse.

2639
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,820
Oh, you're up, Seok Jin.

2640
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,690
(everyone starts waking up.)

2641
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,320
- You're up, Seok Jin. - Oh, man.

2642
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,520
- Why are you all saying that? - You're up, Seok Jin.

2643
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,890
Gosh, I'm awake because I'm still alive.

2644
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,499
- Seok Jin, are you doing that now? - How...

2645
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,970
- Comments like that? - How nice is that?

2646
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,370
- How nice is it? - Well...

2647
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,239
- Congratulations, Seok Jin. - You know,

2648
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,300
I couldn't get any sleep. I thought you might not wake up.

2649
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,210
Why is life so long?

2650
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,839
Hey, you're so open-minded now.

2651
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,009
- Are you now... - No, really. Life is endless.

2652
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:56,120
(Seok Sam tries to expand his jokes to the netherworld.)

2653
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,049
- Seok Jin, are you now... - Gosh, suddenly...

2654
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,220
Ever since you were in nature, your mindset has...

2655
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,289
His mindset is... He must be happy.

2656
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,319
- He sounds... - You don't carry snacks on you,

2657
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,320
do you, Ji Hyo?

2658
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:02,419
- Snacks? - Snacks? Don't you have any?

2659
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,260
I'm awake because I'm still alive.

2660
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:05,030
(Ji Hyo has some snacks with her.)

2661
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:06,890
Do you have some? My gosh.

2662
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,760
From now on

2663
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,630
(Snatching)

2664
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,470
(Jae Seok takes the snack.)

2665
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,970
It will be

2666
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,440
(Bored for a while, Prankster Yu pulls a prank.)

2667
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,240
Give that here.

2668
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,299
Give it to me.

2669
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,510
Seok Jin, here.

2670
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,940
- Throw it. - Throw it.

2671
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,040
Hey, you...

2672
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,540
(A 2nd steal)

2673
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,109
Why did you throw it that way when you saw what happened?

2674
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,510
(This time, he gives it to the writer.)

2675
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:25,449
Throw it.

2676
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,110
- Ji Hyo, throw it this way. - I don't have any more.

2677
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,849
(Writer)

2678
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,519
Come on, Hyo Im.

2679
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,520
I don't have it.

2680
01:07:31,521 --> 01:07:32,620
Don't lie! I saw you take it.

2681
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:33,690
(Yelling)

2682
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,760
(The writer decides to throw it.)

2683
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:34,890
Thank you.

2684
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:40,860
(He jumped like tuna, but he's not as energetic.)

2685
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,190
- Seok Jin. - Let's share it.

2686
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,630
- Let's share it. - Seok Jin.

2687
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,060
Is it a cheese cracker?

2688
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,730
- Gosh, Seok Jin. - It isn't a cheese cracker.

2689
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:48,600
It's warm in here.

2690
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:51,540
(The oldest member succeeds in raising his blood sugar level.)

2691
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,970
It's tasty.

2692
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:53,509
- It's tasty. - Ye Eun, do you want a snack?

2693
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,680
(The snack)

2694
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:54,540
No.

2695
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:55,610
Ji Hyo, do you want it?

2696
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,310
(Here.)

2697
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,210
(He shyly raises his hand.)

2698
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,980
Eat it.

2699
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,549
- I'll give it to you. - It's okay. Eat it.

2700
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:03,320
(He's the most honest in front of a snack.)

2701
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,750
That was so cute, Seok Jin.

2702
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,920
It's okay. Eat it.

2703
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,450
Gosh, Seok Jin.

2704
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,989
In the evening,

2705
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,220
all my KBS juniors should gather around.

2706
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:10,930
What?

2707
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,930
(KBS Comedian Batch 7, 10, and 22)

2708
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,829
Thank goodness.

2709
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,600
(Se Chan is exempted as he's from SBS.)

2710
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:15,159
- You got recruited by SBS, - That's right.

2711
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,659
- so this doesn't apply to you. - Okay.

2712
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,729
- All my KBS juniors... - I'll be on the lookout.

2713
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:20,230
should see me for a second.

2714
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,069
- I mean... - It has been a while.

2715
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,100
(Struggling)

2716
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:24,369
- It has been a while. - Yes.

2717
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,969
- This is fun. Have a meeting. - Normally,

2718
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,079
- I only have one KBS junior here. - Yes.

2719
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,409
- Have a meeting. - So I haven't done this before.

2720
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:30,879
- It'll be a genuine meeting. - Yes.

2721
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,650
(Luckily, there are two.)

2722
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,479
- We're in Tongyeong, so... - For goodness' sake.

2723
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,079
- KBS... - Why don't you plan a comedy skit?

2724
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,749
(The two juniors are disturbed as they're summoned...)

2725
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,179
- Yes. I have my KBS juniors here. - I can't believe it.

2726
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,890
(for the first time in a while.)

2727
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,589
That's right. Kyeong Hwan,

2728
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:39,389
- you should plan a comedy skit. - Okay.

2729
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,620
- It has been a while. - I have two KBS juniors here.

2730
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:42,690
Which term are you from?

2731
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,289
- I'm from the 22nd term. - Before going to bed?

2732
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,029
- Are you from the 10th term? - I'm from the 10th term.

2733
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,330
(Correct)

2734
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,089
- You're from the tenth term. - Yes.

2735
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,759
- You're from the 7th term. - I'm from the 7th term.

2736
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,130
(Correct)

2737
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,300
I used to memorize this.

2738
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:53,669
When a senior wanted the juniors to gather around,

2739
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:55,300
he told 1 junior 1st.

2740
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,770
Let's say all of us were from the same term.

2741
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:59,710
You couldn't say, "We have a gathering today."

2742
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,580
"We have a gathering in the evening."

2743
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:03,740
"We have a gathering in the evening."

2744
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,519
You couldn't say it loudly.

2745
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,720
(How it should be shared)

2746
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,080
You had to keep it a secret from other seniors.

2747
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,489
So when I became a senior,

2748
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,490
(The culture from then is no longer with them.)

2749
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,990
I thought seniors didn't do that anymore.

2750
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,150
But I was wrong.

2751
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,489
- It was done quietly. - It was done quietly.

2752
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:17,260
- Was it done quietly? - So when I give my order later on,

2753
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,759
- relay it to Seok Jin that way. - Okay.

2754
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,960
- There are no other juniors. - We have a gathering.

2755
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,760
(Whispering)

2756
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,900
(Message sent)

2757
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,899
- It's just the two of us. - That's how you do it.

2758
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,199
- That's how you do it. - Nice.

2759
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,569
- It'll be funny. - Other members shouldn't find out.

2760
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,440
(Will they actually be summoned in the middle of the night?)

2761
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,239
- For goodness' sake. - It'll get messy if they find out.

2762
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,140
I just want the KBS juniors to come.

2763
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:32,870
(Tapping)

2764
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,339
- We're here. - In a moment, we'll reach...

2765
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,979
- Junghwa Harbor, Tongyeong. - We're here.

2766
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:38,609
(It took them 50 minutes from Yokji Island.)

2767
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,250
We're here.

2768
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,250
- Seok Jin, let's get off. - We're here.

2769
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:42,080
(They finally arrive at the land.)

2770
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,980
Let's get off.

2771
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,450
(They board a bus right away.)

2772
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:43,350
I'm hungry.

2773
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,319
Seok Jin, may I sit here?

2774
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,390
No.

2775
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,090
Why does it have to be this seat?

2776
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,329
- He doesn't listen to his senior. - Later on,

2777
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:54,760
- I'll discipline the rude juniors. - Seriously.

2778
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,530
- Teach them a lesson. - I'm not joking.

2779
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,070
(The senior of the 7th batch decided to discipline today.)

2780
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,030
Kyeong Hwan, you'd better be ready.

2781
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,239
Thank goodness I'm not included.

2782
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,840
- Where did you bump your head? - I'm sorry.

2783
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,539
- What is it? - I'm sorry.

2784
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:07,840
(Daniel bumped his head into the door of the bus.)

2785
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,940
- Daniel is so clumsy. - Are you okay?

2786
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,210
Gosh, I didn't have that problem.

2787
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:12,150
Hey, Kyeong Hwan jumped as he walked through the door.

2788
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,880
(It's Kyeong Hwan's wish to bump his head.)

2789
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,050
I didn't have that problem.

2790
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,080
Ji Hyo didn't have that problem either.

2791
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,250
(Ji Hyo gets on the bus as well.)

2792
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,150
- No problem. - Ye Eun.

2793
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:20,989
- How about Ye Eun? - As for Ye Eun...

2794
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:22,059
Where did Ye Eun go?

2795
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,359
- She got sick. - She's under the weather,

2796
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,389
- so she'll visit a hospital nearby. - Okay.

2797
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,429
- Okay. - She'll get IV fluids.

2798
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:32,670
(Ye Eun was recovering, but her condition got worse.)

2799
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,059
After all, we're here for an overnight trip today.

2800
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,060
- Okay. - That's right.

2801
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:31,699
- She has a fever. - That's right.

2802
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,900
Her condition isn't at 100 percent.

2803
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:39,170
(She'll join them after getting treated at a nearby hospital.)

2804
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,639
She has had...

2805
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,739
- multiple shoots back-to-back. - That's right.

2806
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,510
- She has had multiple shoots. - My goodness.

2807
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,079
All right. Now, you'll go to the lodging...

2808
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,449
and make dinner with tuna.

2809
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,509
- Okay. - That sounds good.

2810
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:47,049
We'll give you the basic ingredients...

2811
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:49,350
(Revealing the 3 menus that the crew decided)

2812
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:49,120
so that you can make three dishes.

2813
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,789
The first dish is the fresh tuna and kimchi stew.

2814
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,349
That sounds very delicious.

2815
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,889
The second dish is tuna sushi.

2816
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:56,190
- Okay. - We can make that.

2817
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,459
The third dish is tuna steak.

2818
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,860
Tuna steak sounds great.

2819
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:02,199
Members, can you make sushi?

2820
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,260
(Dinner menu: Tuna and kimchi stew, tuna sushi, tuna steak)

2821
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,630
Of course. We can make sushi.

2822
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,129
Seok Jin is good at making rice.

2823
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,229
- Okay. - He's good at making rice.

2824
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,969
- Seok Jin is good at making rice. - Okay.

2825
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,969
How do you make fresh tuna and kimchi stew?

2826
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,669
- I don't know. - Usually, tuna and kimchi stew...

2827
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:13,639
Can't we just season the fish to make fresh tuna and kimchi stew?

2828
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,640
But tuna...

2829
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:16,179
- will break. - Usually, you use canned tuna.

2830
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,150
(Normally, tuna and kimchi stew is made with canned tuna.)

2831
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,780
- That's right. - It'll be the same once you add it.

2832
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:21,380
(No one has made tuna and kimchi stew with raw tuna.)

2833
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,349
The dish will be high-quality if we use fresh tuna.

2834
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,980
- Seriously. - How will kimchi stew taste...

2835
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,919
- if we use fresh tuna? - That sounds incredible.

2836
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,620
- It'll taste amazing. - I'm curious.

2837
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,189
- How about braised tuna and radish? - It will be spicy...

2838
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,560
(Suggesting)

2839
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:30,059
Kyeong Hwan wants to make braised radish.

2840
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,359
Braised radish.

2841
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,529
- That sounds good. - Braised fresh tuna and radish.

2842
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:35,660
(Kyeong Hwan, a good cook, recommends a menu.)

2843
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:34,329
- A braised dish. - Braised fresh tuna and radish.

2844
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:35,560
- A braised dish is tasty. - Braised tuna.

2845
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,859
I bet we can make it.

2846
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,470
(Confident)

2847
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,299
A braised dish sounds good, right?

2848
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,729
Kyeong Hwan, let's make braised radish.

2849
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:42,000
(They add an additional menu, relying on Chef Heo.)

2850
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:41,670
I'll check the recipe for braised radish.

2851
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,939
It sounds good.

2852
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,709
(While they're heading toward the last romantic spot of the day)

2853
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,970
Braised tuna and radish sounds tasty.

2854
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,569
- It sounds tasty. - I'm excited.

2855
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:48,840
(The sky at dusk)

2856
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,680
I suddenly feel hungry.

2857
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,210
I'm hungry.

2858
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,309
(How will the accommodation for the members look?)

2859
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,479
- This is unique. - What's this place?

2860
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,919
(Camping)

2861
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,950
- A campground? - What?

2862

(Romantic Spots, Tongyeong, Yokji Island)

2863
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:56,319
I see what it is.

2864
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,190
- There are two buildings. - Glamping.

2865
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,289
A Gen Z resort.

2866
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:00,889
- What's this? A Gen Z resort. - Yes.

2867
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:02,090
(It's more beautiful at sunset.)

2868
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:01,960
- What's this? - Thank goodness.

2869
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,319
- It's nice. - What?

2870
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,530
- It's nice. - It's pretty.

2871
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,229
(A campsite located on Haegan Island, )

2872
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,460
It's nice.

2873
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:08,100
(a little island in Tongyeong)

2874
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,500

2885
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,879
Seok Jin, this place is romantic.

2886

Six.

01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:16,929
- Yes, Ma'am. - Let's see.

2923
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,969
Kyeong Hwan is the son of Tongyeong.

2924
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,199
(The locals welcome Kyeong Hwan before they welcome Jae Seok.)

2925
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,069
- All right. - Hello.

2926
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:22,570
- Hello. - My goodness.

2927
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,300
(That's impressive.)

2928
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,739
- Hold on. - He's the son of Tongyeong.

2929
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:24,810
- Yes. - That's right.

2930
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:27,009
That's him.

2931
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,110
"That's him."

2932
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,810
(Feeling a little proud)

2933
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,210
- There are oysters. - Oysters are in season.

2934
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,479
- Hello. - Oysters look good.

2935
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,410
There are so many oysters.

2936
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,749
Kyeong Hwan is the son of Tongyeong.

2937
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,490
(Bragging)

2938
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,949
Oh, my.

2939
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,620
- Hello. - He's Tongyeong Bomber.

2940
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:41,590
(Despite being embarrassed, he enjoys his fame.)

2941
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,259
Stop it.

2942
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,720
- I'm not running for mayor. - We have to do this.

2943
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,389
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

2944
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:50,660
(The local)

2945
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:47,159
This is the place!

2946
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,359
- I took photos with your father. - Really?

2947
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,600
This is the place!

2948
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:52,569
He's the son of Tongyeong.

2949
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:56,639
(He wasn't kidding when he said he was the prince of Tongyeong.)

2950
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,570
- Hello. - Hello.

2951
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,199
- He's the son of Tongyeong. - Hello.

2952
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,240
Kyeong Hwan, I saw you back in the day.

2953
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,910
(The local)

2954
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,010
- Hello. - He's the son of Tongyeong.

2955
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,580
- Hello. - Hello.

2956
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,310
(It's as if he's in Hollywood.)

2957
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,280
Yes, I'm in Tongyeong.

2958
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,110
Kyeong Hwan is popular.

2959
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,050
- Tongyeong High, let's go! - Tongyeong High!

2960
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,020
(Tongyeong High)

2961
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,920
- Tongyeong High! - Tongyeong High!

2962
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,520
- By the way! - By the way!

2963
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,950
- By the way! - By the way!

2964
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,520
- By the way, I'm popular. - By the way...

2965
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,700
- By the way, Kyeong Hwan is here. - By the way...

2966
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:23,900
(He regains the confidence he lost from the guys' mistreatment.)

2967
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,899
Kyeong Hwan, get married.

2968
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:26,830
(The local)

2969
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,070
Okay.

2970
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:30,000
(Thanks to the son of Tongyeong, they begin shopping happily.)

2971
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:29,069
What do we need to buy? Hello.

2972
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:30,100
Hello.

2973
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:31,539
What do we need to buy?

2974
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,110
There's tuna.

2975
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,809
- That's right. - What do we need to buy?

2976
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,640
(The basic ingredients are given for the 3 tuna dishes.)

2977
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,710
- We don't need to buy fish. - What do we need to buy?

2978
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,609
Jae Seok, how about cuttlefish?

2979
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:39,649
Cuttlefish sounds good.

2980
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:41,319
- Let's eat one as sashimi... - Okay.

2981
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,320
and fry two.

2982
01:14:42,321 --> 01:14:43,379
Just three, please.

2983
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,189
- Thank you. - Is it 30 dollars?

2984
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,350
(Excited, they bought 3 cuttlefish.)

2985
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,619
Jae Seok, it'd make no sense to skip the oysters...

2986
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,959
- in Tongyeong. - You're right.

2987
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,119
Shouldn't we make oyster gukbap?

2988
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,390
(Tongyeong is famous for its oysters.)

2989
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,430
Ma'am, are these oysters fresh?

2990
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,229
(They buy 20 dollars' worth of oysters on impulse, )

2991
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,589
How much is that?

2992
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,330
- It's 20 dollars. - Is it 20 dollars?

2993
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:56,000
(which has nothing to do with the tuna dishes.)

2994
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,130
- Give us 20 dollars' worth. - Give us 20 dollars' worth.

2995
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:58,569
- There's honey bread. - Who wants honey bread?

2996
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,929
- Can't we eat some? - There's honey bread.

2997
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:01,099
- Let's eat it. - Let's eat it.

2998
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,270
It's 12 dollars.

2999
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,270
(They forget about the penalty and buy the 12-dollar honey bread.)

3000
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,700
- We'll take one. - Hold on.

3001
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:08,109
- Fried food looks good. - Shall we eat some tteokbokki?

3002
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:10,209
- Let's eat tteokbokki. - Tteokbokki.

3003
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:11,309
- I want fried vegetables. - This one.

3004
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:12,749
- It's tasty. - Fried vegetables.

3005
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,509
This one too. Do you want fried shrimp?

3006
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,349
(Snacks purchased: Veggie and shrimp fritter, 10 dollars)

3007
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,520
- Fried sweet potato. - Fried sweet potato too.

3008
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,349
(Sweet potato fritter, 10 dollars)

3009
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,690
We need to eat dinner later.

3010
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:21,689
(Fishcake skewer, 10 dollars)

3011
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:21,390
But we can't say no to this.

3012
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:24,730
(Tteokbokki, 10 dollars)

3013
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,420
We need to eat dinner later.

3014
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,290
Fishcake is delicious.

3015
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,429
(They overspent 50 dollars on snack foods alone.)

3016
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:27,730
This is a warmup.

3017
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:28,959
We should buy some fruit.

3018
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:32,700
(They spent 189.38 dollars in total.)

3019
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,799
- Two pears. - Tangerines are in season.

3020
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,600
Seok Jin, you like barley hardtack.

3021
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,139
- My goodness. - All of us will get the penalty.

3022
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:36,000
(They ended up with 6 people who will take the penalty.)

3023
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,399
The result of the vote for the photo you posted earlier is out.

3024
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,469
(Announcing the result of the romantic photo vote...)

3025
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,869
- We'll reveal the result. - Let's lower the number.

3026
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:40,139
(that will reduce the number of penalty takers to 5)

3027
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,679
- It was romantic. - Let's deduct 50 dollars.

3028
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,110
(A chance to reduce at least one penalty taker)

3029
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,139
- We'll read some comments. - I'm nervous.

3030
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,179
"It's 100 percent romantic. It's insane."

3031
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,549
"This photo almost made me shed tears."

3032
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,220
"The backs of the members are romantic."

3033
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,879
- That's right. - The backs.

3034
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,489
"It's romantic. If the members date and break up..."

3035
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:54,390
"and make the group disband, that'll be romantic as well."

3036
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,260
- That'll be romantic as well. - It's a touching photo.

3037
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:58,860
Maybe we should've held hands in the back.

3038
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,659
"It's romantic. The phrase is touching."

3039
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,060
It's a good phrase, right?

3040
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:04,100
(Jae Seok's pick)

3041
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,799
"It isn't romantic."

3042
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,199
"The word 'Young' on the back..."

3043
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,300
"makes it look like they're trying hard to be young."

3044
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,570
That wasn't what the word meant.

3045
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,009
- It's your fault. - It's "Yeong" from Tongyeong.

3046
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:13,139
It's "Yeong" from Tongyeong.

3047
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,509
- It's "Yeong" from Tongyeong. - And...

3048
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:16,979
"The phrase is something old people say."

3049
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,280
- "It isn't romantic at all." - You came up with the phrase!

3050
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,449
- The phrase? - Some people liked it.

3051
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:23,780
(He named it.)

3052
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:23,179
- Hold on. - Yes. Some people liked it.

3053
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,489
- We combined these opinions. - "We're not alone."

3054
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,250
(What's the result of the final vote?)

3055
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:26,919
- We'll announce the result. - All right.

3056
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,689
- Okay. - We need a deduction.

3057
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,889
(They can only reduce the number of penalty takers to 5...)

3058
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:29,960
We had many positive comments.

3059
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,160
(if there are more votes on "It's romantic.")

3060
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,429
I have confidence.

3061
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:32,690
It was a good idea to put our arms around each other's shoulders.

3062
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,960
What's the ratio?

3063
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,730
Votes for "It's romantic..."

3064
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:37,600
Some people liked it.

3065
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:41,170
(Writer)

3066
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:39,330
Let's deduct 50 dollars.

3067
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,299
(They can only reduce the number of penalty takers to 5...)

3068
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,599
I have confidence.

3069
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,939
It was a good idea to put our arms around each other's shoulders.

3070
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,910
(if there are more votes on "It's romantic.")

3071
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,239
What's the ratio?

3072
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,870
Votes for "It's romantic..."

3073
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:47,740
(Writer)

3074
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,810
Some people liked it.

3075
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,610
Let's deduct 50 dollars.

3076
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,850
Surpassed the other by a landslide. So we'll say that it's romantic.

3077
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,780
(They succeed in getting a romantic photo!)

3078
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,819
- Showing the backs was a good idea. - The backs.

3079
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,119
- Good. - The frontal shot...

3080
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,159
- doesn't work. - No frontal shots.

3081
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,129
- The frontal shot doesn't work. - No, it doesn't.

3082
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:07,290
(They succeed in the mission right away after covering their faces.)

3083
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:06,329
- No faces. - The frontal shot doesn't work.

3084
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,799
We'll deduct 50 dollars from the amount you've used.

3085
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,329
- Five people. - Since the number decreased by one,

3086
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:11,770
- five people will take the penalty. - That's great.

3087
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,599
Let's deduct more in the evening.

3088
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,339
Let's do that. Let's do something in the evening.

3089
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:18,270
(They still have a chance to reduce the number of penalty takers.)

3090
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,539
- That's right. We're good at games. - We can win in games.

3091
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,209
You'll have a chance after eating the meal you've cooked.

3092
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:22,640
(They'll seek that chance after their dinner.)

3093
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,579
- That sounds good. - Okay.

3094
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,480
- Let's hurry up and eat. - Okay.

3095
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,779
This is great.

3096
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,510
(A short break before dinner)

3097
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,009
May I go in here?

3098
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:27,749
This caravan is nice.

3099
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,319
It's really luxurious.

3100
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,880
- Is it great? - Yes.

3101
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,349
I didn't know such a thing existed.

3102
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:34,620
- This place... - We can eat outside, Seok Jin.

3103
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,960
- We can eat outside. - That's right, Seok Jin.

3104
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,530
(His eyes went wide after using the bathroom.)

3105
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,890
- In here... - There's a restroom inside.

3106
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,289
It's like a house, Seok Jin.

3107
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,959
- Did you use the restroom? - Yes.

3108
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:43,460
(The condition of a house for Kim Bag)

3109
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,359
- It's like a house. - It's so nice.

3110
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,429
- It's like a house, Seok Jin. - My goodness.

3111
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,140
(It only needs a bed and a bathroom.)

3112
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:46,770
It's like a house.

3113
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,199
- Seriously. - It's insanely nice.

3114
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,299
There are short caravans and long caravans.

3115
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,509
It's practically a house.

3116
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:53,309
This one is totally long.

3117
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,409
Is there a long one?

3118
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:57,139
- This one is long. - It must be a suite.

3119
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:58,209
It must be more expensive.

3120
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:00,079
- This one is long. - Do you like the lodging?

3121
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,879
Gosh, it's like a hotel.

3122
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,819
(The 50-year-old city boy thought there were only tents...)

3123
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,349
Is it for two people?

3124
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,619
It's like a hotel.

3125
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:05,890
(when it came to camping.)

3126
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,549
- Look. It has a room. - My goodness.

3127
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,719
It's nice and long.

3128
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,289
- It has a room. - It's really nice.

3129
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:11,960
(A suite with a bedroom)

3130
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,619
Everything is new.

3131
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,789
The other caravan looks the same.

3132
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:14,289
- It's clean. - But the front part must be long.

3133
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,660
(Peeking)

3134
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,960
Let's check out this caravan.

3135
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,969
- How much is it per night? - Let's check out the long one.

3136
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:19,600
(Feeling excited, he starts checking out the caravans.)

3137
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:20,869
- There's a terrace as well. - It must be the best room.

3138
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,739
- It must be the best room. - This room is incredible.

3139
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,039
It must be the best room.

3140
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:27,510
(The best one with a terrace)

3141
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,239
The view must be nice on this side.

3142
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,540
There's a terrace as well.

3143
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:29,140
This one. We need to check out this one.

3144
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:32,550
This one has a living room.

3145
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,850
Seriously, this one...

3146
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:36,320
(Striding in)

3147
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,319
It's warm.

3148
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,649
It's incredible.

3149
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:39,649
- This one is incredible. - You're right.

3150
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:41,960
- How does it have everything? - It's practically a house, right?

3151
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:44,020
It's practically a house.

3152
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:46,930
The TV is on standby.

3153
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,700
(Jong Kook wouldn't have a problem living here.)

3154
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:53,400
(He checks out the place thoroughly as if he's purchasing a house.)

3155
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,969
My goodness.

3156
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:57,540
It's practically a house.

3157
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,840
(Will he be able to sleep in the caravan of his choice?)

3158
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:59,540
It's practically a house.

3159
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:02,240
Haha, isn't this romantic?

3160
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,279
Hey, this is romantic.

3161
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,350
My goodness.

3162
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:07,580
If you take off your top and lie down...

3163
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,980
- I'll catch a cold. - It's romantic.

3164
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:11,320
(It'll be like Naples.)

3165
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,389
- Is it romantic? - Look.

3166
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,620
The sunset is insane, Jong Kook.

3167
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,419
- Isn't this place beautiful? - It's romantic.

3168
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,719
(In front of the caravans, )

3169
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,460
My goodness.

3170
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,959
- We could lie down here. - Yes.

3171
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,090
(the golden sea unfolds.)

3172
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,090
After taking off the top?

3173
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,559
- It's so pretty. - It's really pretty, right?

3174
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:24,200
(A beautiful view that's too good to keep to themselves)

3175
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,330
- It's romantic. - It's unbelievable.

3176
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,429
I'll need to take a photo.

3177
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,629
Gosh, it's so pretty.

3178
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,439
- Hey. - You know what it's like.

3179
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:32,040
(He wants to capture the scenery even if it isn't for a mission.)

3180
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,140
It's really pretty. Something like this...

3181
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,140
Something like this...

3182
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,710
Let's not eat.

3183
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,880
That's right.

3184
01:19:36,881 --> 01:19:38,809
- Let's just make a bonfire and cry. - The scenery makes me full.

3185
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,850
Let's just stare at the fire.

3186
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,480
(Trying to be lazy using romance as an excuse)

3187
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:42,749
- Starving is romantic. - Let's eat...

3188
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,379
the fried food the owner gave us.

3189
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,850
Jae Seok, starving is romantic.

3190
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:47,250
This is incredible.

3191
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:49,260
(They don't care.)

3192
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:48,660
What's this?

3193
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,489
It's pretty, right?

3194
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:53,289
Let's build a fire first.

3195
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,860
(Before it gets too late)

3196
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,029
- Okay. - We have Team Fire.

3197
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,030
(They come to their senses and move to make dinner.)

3198
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:56,499
- We need to build a fire. - We need to do it quickly.

3199
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,600
Seok Jin.

3200
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,200
- Yes? - Please make some rice.

3201
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,039
(Main menus: Tuna and kimchi stew, tuna steak, tuna sushi)

3202
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,499
How about tuna steak and tuna sushi?

3203
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,639
Make kimchi stew.

3204
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,569
(Additional menus: Braised tuna and radish, )

3205
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,299
Kyeong Hwan wants to make braised radish.

3206
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,470
Let's eat 1 cuttlefish as sashimi and fry the other 2.

3207
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:06,610
(raw oysters, fried oysters, fried cuttlefish)

3208
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:09,040
- Here comes the fire. - These days,

3209
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,440
(They get ready to make dinner.)

3210
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,139
I cook so much.

3211
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,250
What's this?

3212
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,180
(They start with a wood fire instead of a campfire.)

3213
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,909
- What's this? - You're on...

3214
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,250
- a camping show these days. - What's this?

3215
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,720
- You put a cauldron on the top. - You put it on the top.

3216
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:20,720
(A high-tech brazier equipped with a cauldron stand)

3217
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,550
- That must be it. - That explains it.

3218
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,960
That's it.

3219
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,920
(Satisfied)

3220
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,720
It'll be steadier.

3221
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:29,100
(He lays the firewood in an experienced way.)

3222
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,330
It'll be steadier.

3223
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,830
Hold on.

3224
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:31,159
We're building a fire.

3225
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,029
There are so many good stoves. Why are you using firewood?

3226
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:35,899
Mister, go away.

3227
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,339
It'll look good.

3228
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,439
That's what it's for, right?

3229
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:40,840
(The middle-aged man ruins the camping vibe.)

3230
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,469
- Of course. - It's required for a camping trip.

3231
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:40,609
It's required for a camping trip.

3232
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:42,139
- It's a performance. - I can't believe him.

3233
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:44,539
(Gosh)

3234
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:44,009
- A performance. - He's ridiculous.

3235
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,379
Seriously.

3236
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:49,150
(Laughing)

3237
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,509
Seok Jin, please make some rice.

3238
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:48,050
- You can't hear Jong Kook. - No.

3239
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,890
Jong Kook was complaining, but you went, "A performance."

3240
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:56,290
(Seok Sam lives his life without stress.)

3241
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,389
- You weren't affected. - This is...

3242
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,620
I can't hear him.

3243
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:01,060
("Family Outing" members begin to build a fire.)

3244
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,630
Okay.

3245
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,970
- I missed this smell. - Right?

3246
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,640
This smell is a must on a camping trip.

3247
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:11,939
It's nice.

3248
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,110
I feel so happy when I build a fire.

3249
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:16,909
It has been a while.

3250
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:18,039
(The fire enthusiast Jong Kook reunites with firewood...)

3251
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:20,010
There's a feeling of providing vitality, right?

3252
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,010
(after a long time.)

3253
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,880
- Of course. - There's...

3254
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,350
a sense of giving life to something that's dead.

3255
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,720
(This again...)

3256
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,950
It won't take long.

3257
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,960
There must be another torch.

3258
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,460
(The fire enthusiast puts on his signature goggles.)

3259
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:31,790
Right.

3260
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:35,130
Okay.

3261
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:39,530
(He gives up on the solo shot and makes a firewood tower.)

3262
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:37,960
That's it. All done.

3263
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,800
- Jong Kook, use this. - Okay.

3264
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:42,840
Good. That's it.

3265
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:45,840
How nice. You're Fire Jong Kook.

3266
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:48,210
There we go.

3267
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:52,410
(He gives life to the firewood in no time.)

3268
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,140
Nice.

3269
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:53,809
We'll make kimchi stew.

3270
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,549
No one else will make kimchi stew, right?

3271
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:57,479
- We'll make kimchi stew. - That's right.

3272
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,650
(As he's started a fire, he will be in charge with the stew.)

3273
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,090
- Let's do it together. - Okay. You and I can make it.

3274
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,690
This is the back meat.

3275
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,890
(Meanwhile, Kyeong Hwan...)

3276
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,430
(is unboxing the fresh tuna from Yokji Island.)

3277
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:07,430
What are we supposed to do with this?

3278
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:11,160
(Today's main ingredient, 3 cuts of tuna)

3279
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,160
This belly meat is nice.

3280
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,900
(Tuna belly meat: Fattiest, soft and savory)

3281
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,630
Gosh, what's this?

3282
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:14,970
- It's the belly meat. - It's well-marbled.

3283
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,969
(Tuna back meat: Solid meat that has the clean taste of tuna)

3284
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,599
This is the back meat.

3285
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,769
It's so big.

3286
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:20,539
This is insane.

3287
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,209
(Back meat along with abdomen and spinal line:)

3288
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:23,010
(Fattiness and lightness coexist, making its taste balanced)

3289
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:23,080
Gosh, what are we going to do with this tuna?

3290
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,550
(Dividing the menus)

3291
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:25,249
I'll use the back meat.

3292
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,809
Will you use the back meat? Which dish are you making?

3293
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:27,979
- Which dish are you making? - A braised dish.

3294
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,279
- A braised dish? - Then you need the back meat.

3295
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,219
- Then you need the back meat. - I need the back meat.

3296
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,390
(Kyeong Hwan is in charge of braised tuna and radish.)

3297
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,149
How about the steak?

3298
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,760
- Should it be the back meat? - The back meat will be good.

3299
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:38,730
(Daniel is in charge of tuna steak.)

3300
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,189
Like sirloin steak, we should make...

3301
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:38,929
- the back meat steak. - We have the middle section.

3302
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:40,260
My goodness.

3303
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:42,630
(Gasping)

3304
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,330
My goodness.

3305
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:44,900
Jae Seok, look at this.

3306
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,400
(Revealing the best part of tuna, fatty belly)

3307
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:46,969
- Isn't it incredible? - What is it?

3308
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,440
- My goodness. - It's the belly meat.

3309
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,469
- My goodness. - It's for sashimi.

3310
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,200
(Hefty)

3311
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:51,909
It's huge.

3312
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,939
- This one... - I'll slice it.

3313
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,910
Hey, open the lid.

3314
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:57,509
(The chef of Running Man, Se Chan, is in charge...)

3315
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,880
We need to cut the tuna.

3316
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,780
(of raw tuna and tuna sushi.)

3317
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,579
- Hey, that's... - Yes.

3318
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,049
- This one... - This one looks incredible.

3319
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:02,380
(Following)

3320
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:02,380
It looks incredible.

3321
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,919
- You can't taste it anywhere else. - You're right.

3322
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,989
Raw tuna.

3323
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,589
- I need to slice it. - Raw tuna.

3324
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:10,290
(He needs to cut the whole tuna, which is a rare sight.)

3325
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,820
Sashimi and sushi.

3326
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,459
We need to cut off this part.

3327
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,359
- Let's cut through here. - It's the bloodline.

3328
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,659
- Okay. - This part is the tastiest.

3329
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,200
(Se Chan knows how to cut fish.)

3330
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,130
- This part is the tastiest. - Yes.

3331
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:19,800
(The most expensive and delicious part of tuna, fatty belly)

3332
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:18,970
This is incredible.

3333
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,330
- Here. - Okay!

3334
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,640
(Determined)

3335
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,039
Hey, take a photo.

3336
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,069
- My goodness. - Take a photo and send it to me.

3337
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:29,579
- Okay. Put it up. - It's romantic.

3338
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:30,639
I'll take a photo.

3339
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,150
This is incredible.

3340
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:35,680
(They're all excited to see the rare fresh tuna.)

3341
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,409
Shouldn't we take photos?

3342
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,779
It's more precious than beef.

3343
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:36,850
Be careful.

3344
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:39,590
(Taking a photo before cutting)

3345
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,450
- My goodness. - One, two, three.

3346
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:42,120
- Se Chan, it's insane. - Move for a second.

3347
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,059
- Who is he talking to? - Hold on.

3348
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,559
- Hold on. Move for a second. - What?

3349
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,929
- Hold on. - Why?

3350
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,430
(Rushed)

3351
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,900
Let's take turns taking photos with the tuna.

3352
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,799
- What is he doing? - Unbelievable.

3353
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,600
(Dumbfounded)

3354
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,299
- You want the spotlight. - Come on.

3355
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:55,270
(He steals the knife so that Se Chan won't slice the tuna.)

3356
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,399
You aren't even cooking this tuna.

3357
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,039
- You want the spotlight. - Come on.

3358
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,769
You aren't even cooking this tuna.

3359
01:23:57,770 --> 01:23:59,570
- You're obsessed with romance. - One, two, three.

3360
01:23:58,370 --> 01:24:01,210
(Selfie mode)

3361
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:03,710
Did you wash your hands before touching it?

3362
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,340
(Posing seriously after washing his hands)

3363
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,579
One, two, three.

3364
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:05,949
(Click)

3365
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,080
- Come here if you want a photo. - Okay.

3366
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:08,450
(Satisfied)

3367
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,579
- Be careful. - "Come here if you want a photo."

3368
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,949
- Why would you take photos? - My turn.

3369
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:11,380
- Come here. - I'll do this.

3370
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:14,120
(It's time for a group photo.)

3371
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:13,950
One, two...

3372
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,160
What are they doing?

3373
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,920
- Two, three. - What are they doing?

3374
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:21,059
- They lack style. - Come here for a photo.

3375
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,730
- It's romantic. - Here. Kyeong Hwan.

3376
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,159
Come here for a photo.

3377
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,299
(Unlike the other members who are making a fuss, )

3378
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,570
Come here.

3379
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,900
(Jae Seok is especially calm.)

3380
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:27,769
No one can resist the belly meat.

3381
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,100
It's totally...

3382
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:33,340
Haha.

3383
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,310
(Laughing)

3384
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:36,839
- Haha, Jae Seok wants a photo. - What?

3385
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,339
He came all the way here.

3386
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,750
- What? - Take a photo of me.

3387
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,120
(Grabbing)

3388
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,619
Didn't you call us a nuisance?

3389
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,679
Didn't you complain?

3390
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,820
- Didn't you call us a nuisance? - Take a photo of me.

3391
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:49,060
(Embarrassed)

3392
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:48,959
- I just need one. - For goodness' sake.

3393
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,919
I wondered why Jae Seok was putting on gloves.

3394
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,130
(He must've been very jealous.)

3395
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,230
Didn't you complain?

3396
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,129
One, two...

3397
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:57,060
(Taking a photo with the fish in an old-fashioned pose)

3398
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:55,660
Was that why you put on those gloves?

3399
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,599
For goodness' sake. I can't believe him.

3400
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,830
(Happy)

3401
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,629
Is that it?

3402
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:01,369
- All right. Thank you. - Okay.

3403
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:02,469
- Thank you. - I can't believe him.

3404
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,970
That was so funny.

3405
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,510
- You know... - You guys lack style.

3406
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,140
(Talking about himself)

3407
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,410
I'll slice it...

3408
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,810
(Cutting the fish in earnest after taking photos)

3409
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,340
here.

3410
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,520
(Cutting easily)

3411
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:16,420
- The knife goes in so easily. - This is incredible.

3412
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,450
This is no joke.

3413
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:22,460
(The soft meat gets sliced like butter.)

3414
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,019
The knife goes in so easily.

3415
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:23,190
This is incredible.

3416
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:25,430
- My goodness. - My goodness.

3417
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:26,690
Here.

3418
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:31,260
(He removes the scales smoothly.)

3419
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:29,899
Even if I lose some meat...

3420
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,400
- The knife goes in so easily. - Yes.

3421
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:34,930
This is incredible.

3422
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:36,100
(Gulping)

3423
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:36,539
It's a waste, but it can't be helped.

3424
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:39,640
(He looks like a stray cat at a fish store.)

3425
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,800
I can't slice that well.

3426
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,010
Now...

3427
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:44,310
(Careful)

3428
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,880
I'll slice this.

3429
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,680
- That's right. - He's good.

3430
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:50,080
(Se Chan calmly goes through the standard procedure.)

3431
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:49,019
- Se Chan is good. - Se Chan is good.

3432
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:50,080
Is that how you do it?

3433
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:51,749
There are bones.

3434
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,020
- So that's the belly meat. - Yes.

3435
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,560
I want to taste it.

3436
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,960
- Do you want a slice? - Can't we eat this?

3437
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:01,030
- If there's salt... - We can eat this.

3438
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,429
There's salt. But it's coarse salt.

3439
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:05,100
(He goes to make a sauce right away.)

3440
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,929
- It's okay. It doesn't matter. - Seok Jin.

3441
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,429
- Do you dip it in salt? - Salt.

3442
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:08,069
- Do you dip it in soy sauce... - Today...

3443
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:10,139
- and wasabi? - Don't you dip it in soy sauce?

3444
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:13,040
(The stray cat wants to eat it deliciously while he's at it.)

3445
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:11,500
- It's soy sauce, right? - Yes.

3446
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,210
You dip it in soy sauce.

3447
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,140
(The tuna belly has undergone the initial prepping.)

3448
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,810
Check how the knife is going in.

3449
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:20,310
(It has a beautiful color.)

3450
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,850
- This... Seok Jin. - Yes?

3451
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,580
- Are you going to taste a piece? - Can I try a piece?

3452
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,620
(He's already ready.)

3453
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,020
Have you ever worked with tuna before, Ssaebssaeb?

3454
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:28,250
I'm just working on it.

3455
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:30,290
We have to make it like sushi.

3456
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:34,090
(Even though it's his first time, Mr. Tuna King slices it well.)

3457
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:32,460
You're amazing.

3458
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,130
- Do we eat that raw? - We can eat it raw.

3459
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:40,599
- This... - You can eat some raw...

3460
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,370
(It's as fresh as tuna sold at tuna restaurants.)

3461
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,970
- and some as sushi. - Yes.

3462
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,070
- Here. - Could you...

3463
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,470
give me a plate that's at least this size?

3464
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,439
- Why? - For these.

3465
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,880
- Why? - A plate?

3466
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,040
(Cold)

3467
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:49,979
- Why? - Why?

3468
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,640
- Why? - That's cold.

3469
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,550
We're cooking together, but he asks, "Why?"

3470
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,980
"Why" was really funny.

3471
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:57,820
(Seok Sam is only thinking of enjoying raw tuna.)

3472
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,450
- "Why?" - "Why?"

3473
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:59,950
Why else? To make the dish.

3474
01:26:57,850 --> 01:27:01,250
(He's done quietly making oil sauce.)

3475
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,260
- "Why" was really funny. - Should I give you a piece?

3476
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,760
- I'll just... - Yes.

3477
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:05,490
Could I try a piece?

3478
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:08,029
- I'll taste it... - This is crazy.

3479
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:10,329
Tuna belly sushi costs 5 to 7 dollars per piece.

3480
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:10,500
(Cutting a piece for the eldest, the taster)

3481
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,429
- That's right. - Yes.

3482
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,470
One costs 5 to 7 dollars, or even 10 dollars.

3483
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,000
(How does it taste?)

3484
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:16,070
You have to slice a lot.

3485
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:17,240
(Crunchy)

3486
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,439
I should just...

3487
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,909
Is it crazy?

3488
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:21,410
(Ecstatic)

3489
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:20,070
Do you want to taste it?

3490
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:21,710
- Hey. - How is it?

3491
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:26,380
(The next customer is Haha.)

3492
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:24,839
Is it crazy?

3493
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,250
It's no joke.

3494
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:27,710
It looks tasty.

3495
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:29,020
(Dipping it in the oil sauce)

3496
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,390
- Camera. - Here.

3497
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,290
- It's really tasty. - How is it?

3498
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,560
It's crunchy.

3499
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,690
Is it good?

3500
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:40,230
(The waters of Yokji Island spread in his mouth.)

3501
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:39,889
Does it melt?

3502
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:41,130
- It's crazy. - Give me just a little.

3503
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,460
(How good must it be?)

3504
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:44,160
- Even this one. - Okay.

3505
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,130
(Mr. Tuna King's raw tuna is a huge success.)

3506
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,229
- This... - What is this?

3507
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:47,469
What is this?

3508
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,700
- It's so good. - Come here. Jae Seok.

3509
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,900
(President Tong takes a bite as well.)

3510
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,840
(This is the taste!)

3511
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,869
- Stay there. I'll... - Line up.

3512
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:56,309
Stay there. I'll...

3513
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:58,109
- Is it that good? - I'll bring a piece to you.

3514
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:59,209
How does it taste?

3515
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:01,210
- It's amazing. - Is it that good?

3516
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:03,920
(The true reactions make them want to eat it.)

3517
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,419
- Jae Seok. - This...

3518
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,520
Stay there.

3519
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:06,220
Let me taste it.

3520
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:10,819
Goodness!

3521
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:12,759
- Amazing, right? Give me one more. - It just wraps around your palate.

3522
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,630
- Goodness. - Slice it thicker.

3523
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,159
Amazing, right? Give me one more.

3524
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,700
- Here. - It's amazing.

3525
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,929
- Goodness. - Slice it thicker.

3526
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:22,340
- That's too thin. - Should I slice it thicker?

3527
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,839
Did you come here to eat?

3528
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,369
- No, I'm... - If it gets thicker...

3529
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:27,410
Try one too.

3530
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:28,510
(Shutting him up with tuna)

3531
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:29,539
- It's really tasty. - Is it good?

3532
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,309
- Goodness. - It's amazing.

3533
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,040
(Greasy)

3534
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,850
(With just one piece, his lips get coated.)

3535
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,680
- Should I taste it as well? - Should I slice it thicker?

3536
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,610
- It would be better with wasabi. - Okay.

3537
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,749
- How is it? - It's really awesome.

3538
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:38,020
It's brilliant.

3539
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:40,850
- It's really good. - It's crazy, isn't it?

3540
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,590
(Exclaiming)

3541
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:42,959
Goodness. This...

3542
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,660
- Should I give you more? - How is it so good?

3543
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,890
(Grabbing)

3544
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,160
It was caught just now, right?

3545
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:48,730
It was just caught. Fresh tuna.

3546
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:51,500
(The regular customer is having his third piece already.)

3547
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:52,930
- This is really good. - Right.

3548
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:55,169
It's really tasty.

3549
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:57,240
- It's just great. - Is it good?

3550
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:58,840
(Feeling proud)

3551
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,909
- This... - We caught this earlier.

3552
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:01,269
You're like Mr. Sushi King.

3553
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:03,240
I look forward to working with you!

3554
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:05,340
"I look forward to working with you."

3555
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:07,850
(Mr. Tuna King is approved by everyone.)

3556
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,110
This is really insane.

3557
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,150
This is the tastiest part.

3558
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,720
(Cutting tuna for tuna sushi without a problem)

3559
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,319
We have a reliable chef.

3560
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:15,020
(Super focused)

3561
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,389
I feel reassured.

3562
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,119
It's amazing.

3563
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:20,560
(A dish is filled with glossy fatty belly in no time.)

3564
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,560
This is going to be crazy.

3565
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,559
- You have to make rice. - Rice?

3566
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,429
- I have to make rice? - Yes. You should make rice.

3567
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:26,630
(Asking Seok Sam to make rice for tuna sushi)

3568
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,599
- Then... - I'll make rice, then.

3569
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,770
- I'll make rice. - Okay.

3570
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:29,670
Seok Jin is good at making rice. I have to admit.

3571
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,570
(Rice is as important as the raw fish when making sushi.)

3572
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,170
- Would this be enough? - Where is it?

3573
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:33,910
This much would be fine, right?

3574
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:37,280
(He measures the amount of rice roughly with his eyes.)

3575
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:35,840
This is nice.

3576
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:40,180
Please turn on the water.

3577
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,710
This much would be enough, right?

3578
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:43,820
- How many cups are those? - I don't know.

3579
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,889
- Just do it then. - I'll just do it.

3580
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:48,520
(The source of his confidence...)

3581
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:47,050
Isn't this too much?

3582
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,289
- We're in trouble. - Don't stir it.

3583
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:52,490
(Seok Sam was always in charge of making rice.)

3584
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:52,629
- Don't stir it. - It's okay. I've always stirred it.

3585
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:55,630
- Why are you pouring so much water? - It's a bit undercooked.

3586
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:56,159
(He measured with his middle finger...)

3587
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:58,460
This is bad. Things are bad with the rice.

3588
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:59,100
(and opened the lid countless times.)

3589
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,730
I saved it.

3590
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:05,170
- It's tasty, though. - It's tasty. It's amazing.

3591
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:06,209
(Compared to the messy process, )

3592
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,769
The rice is amazing.

3593
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:07,840
(the end result was always great.)

3594
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:09,140
The rice was cooked well.

3595
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,910
(Pouring)

3596
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:16,450
(He measures with his middle finger again.)

3597
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,850
I'm making the rice.

3598
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:19,850
(For sushi rice, controlling the water is everything.)

3599
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,019
The burner is looking good.

3600
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,660
(Will he cook perfect rice again?)

3601
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:22,160
We should make rice to make sushi.

3602
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,630
(Ji Hyo is doing something in the corner.)

3603
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:29,430
- What are you doing, Ji Hyo? - I'm washing the vegetables.

3604
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,199
- Vegetables... - I'm...

3605
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,900
Don't wash vegetables that could serve 100 people.

3606
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:32,930
(Laughing)

3607
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,629
- I won't. - Seriously.

3608
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:38,570
(1st warning to the generous cook)

3609
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:35,739
- No... - Right, Ji Hyo.

3610
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,139
- Don't overdo it. - Don't wash 100 servings.

3611
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,610
I'm washing just enough. I'm serious.

3612
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,270
Could you give me the chopsticks for frying?

3613
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:43,139
- This one? - The chopsticks for frying.

3614
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,010
(The master of cooking starts making batter for fried cuttlefish.)

3615
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:44,710
- Thank you. - It's coming.

3616
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:46,180
It's okay.

3617
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,820
(After adding batter mix by feel, )

3618
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,650
There's chili pepper.

3619
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:50,919
Nice.

3620
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,350
(he adjusts the consistency by adding water.)

3621
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,050
But this...

3622
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:55,150
(He makes the batter in no time.)

3623
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,720
Why are you making fried squid?

3624
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,320
It's a local specialty.

3625
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,890
Why are we making so many dishes?

3626
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:07,100
(The crew only asked for 3 dishes.)

3627
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:04,899
- Hey. - Why are there so many dishes?

3628
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:05,970
- Now... - Cuttlefish?

3629
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,229
- Yes. - Now, tuna.

3630
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:13,810
(From something like poke to braised radish)

3631
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,040
Tuna? There's a lot of tuna there.

3632
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:11,699
How many chefs do we have today?

3633
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:12,769
Daniel is also good.

3634
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:13,839
Chop it.

3635
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,210
There were three dishes originally.

3636
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:17,080
(Everyone is making something.)

3637
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:20,009
- What is that? - I'm making skewers. I'll roast it.

3638
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:21,079
This...

3639
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:24,279
- What dishes are we making? - Let me tell you.

3640
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,389
Sushi, kimchi stew with tuna,

3641
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,750
- Okay. - tuna steak,

3642
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:31,519
raw oysters, fried oysters,

3643
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,730
fried cuttlefish,

3644
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,430
and braised radish.

3645
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,459
(Fried cuttlefish, tuna sushi, braised tuna and radish, )

3646
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:35,959
- Three... - Why are there so many?

3647
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,359
- There used to be three. - Three hundred people could eat it.

3648
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,269
It's worth 4,000 dollars.

3649
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:39,969
(raw tuna, raw oyster, fried seafood, tuna steak, )

3650
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:40,370
Let's eat everything.

3651
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:41,630
(tuna and kimchi stew)

3652
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:41,830
Goodness. This...

3653
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,400
(The number of dishes for dinner has grown to 9.)

3654
01:31:41,831 --> 01:31:43,669
We have more people coming other than us, right?

3655
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:45,400
Are we cooking for the production crew as well?

3656
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:47,770
(Will they be able to finish all of them today?)

3657
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:47,640
Okay. It would take about four hours.

3658
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,440
I'm so nervous.

3659
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,049
- Pour water. - One oyster dish is ready.

3660
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,810
(The Running Man chefs volunteered to start cooking endlessly.)

3661
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,050
- All of it. - Let's eat.

3662
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:55,209
(The full-course meal of Tongyeong is finally complete.)

3663
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:55,980
- Clear. - Which is the best?

3664
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:57,120
(Production crew)

3665
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,920
So far, it's the raw tuna.

3666
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,589
How can two people sleep there?

3667
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:01,550
(Sleeping is more important than eating for them.)

3668
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:01,550
Two adults can't sleep in such a small space.

3669
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,189
The two Empty Heads will create the quiz.

3670
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,929
(They'll have an unusual quiz created by two Empty Heads.)

3671
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,790
- Blueberry type? - On "The King of Fighters."

3672
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:07,589
(It's a berry, and you feel drowsy when you eat it.)

3673
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:08,559
It's a berry, and you feel drowsy when you eat it.

3674
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:10,560
(Answer: Bernard Werber)

3675
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,460
Let me answer! Bernard Werber.

3676
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:13,070
- Goodnight. - Let's sleep with a smile.

3677
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:13,099
(The troublesome night deepens in Tongyeong.)

3678
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,200
(Something wakes it up.)

3679
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:16,370
Seriously. That rooster crows too much.

3680
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:19,010
I can't even sleep. It's bothering me.

3681
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:19,040
(A hidden mission that came at night like the rooster)

3682
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:21,039
If you want to avoid getting the penalty...

3683
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:21,069
(If they want to avoid getting the penalty, )

3684
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,140
Where is the car going to come?

3685
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:22,210
(they have to solve the mystery.)

3686
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,340
We should be able to hear the car, right?

3687
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:24,840
I think I should go now.

3688
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,939
(To escape from the penalty, )

3689
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,450
(they make a bolder final struggle.)

3690
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:27,449
I'll run when I see it.

3691
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:28,780
Come here.

3692
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:31,550
(Even the elders fight, blinded by the lust for victory.)

3693
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:32,720
He lost.

3694
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:32,690
(He fails.)

3695
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,119
- It's here! - That's the car, right?

3696
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,889
(A night of intense battles)

3697
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:36,060
(Who will be the ultimate winner?)

3698
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,159
It's here!

3699
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,620
- What's going on? - It's here!

3700
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:39,160
(This Is the Romance of It)

3701
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:44,460
(Running Man)
