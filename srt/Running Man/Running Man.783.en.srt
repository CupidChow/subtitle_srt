1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,180
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,910
(Running Man)

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,120
Christmas is coming.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,080
(The time of the year when your heart flutters without any effort)

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,180
It's Christmas.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,180
Merry Christmas.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,690
- Hello. - Hello.

8
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,890
(A day in December, just before Christmas)

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,060
- It's Christmas. - It's Christmas.

10
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,820
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,960
- It's Christmas already. - Okay!

12
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,200
(The members arrived in Christmas outfits.)

13
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,100
How time flies. It's Christmas already.

14
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,560
- Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

15
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,430
(He's pretending to be hip.)

16
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,800
How time flies. It's Christmas already.

17
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,830
(She's acting cute.)

18
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Christmas.

19
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,200
The production crew told us to dress up for Christmas,

20
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,170
- but what's with him? - Hey, you're really...

21
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,670
- When I'm on screen alone... - He's just wearing a sweatshirt.

22
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,910
- This is totally Christmas. - Look at his pants.

23
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,880
Only the top has a Christmas vibe. The bottom is...

24
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,210
(He roughly decorated his top...)

25
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,180
What's that?

26
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,620
- This is totally Christmas. - Look at his pants.

27
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,080
(with his usual black pants.)

28
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,020
He's just wearing a sweatshirt.

29
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,020
What's that?

30
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,590
This is your usual outfit. You just put on some dolls.

31
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,120
These are his everyday clothes.

32
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,360
(Without the pins, it's just his sweatshirt.)

33
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,260
- Totally... - He's just wearing gloves.

34
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,490
- I look legit when I'm alone. - As I've always said...

35
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,060
- As I've always said, - He stands out alone.

36
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,860
Ji Seon has been your stylist for a long time.

37
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,200
(For Jong Kook)

38
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,600
She suffers from depression.

39
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,200
- Because... - Cheer up, Ji Seon.

40
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
She can't experience the joy of dressing him.

41
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,810
- But... - Wait. You know what?

42
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,310
- He won't wear anything nice. - He's dressed up in "I Am Boxer."

43
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,080
(A different show)

44
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,080
- Right. On the show... - He looks great.

45
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,710
Did you wear Chanel on the show?

46
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,450
(Jong Kook dresses up for a different show.)

47
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,680
- He wore low-cut tops. - You know it, right?

48
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,050
- Wearing a low-cut top... - It was crazy.

49
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,690
(There are rumors that he even shows some skin.)

50
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,050
- I know. - I just need to talk in the studio.

51
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,690
But we do various things here.

52
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,720
- So I wear comfortable clothes. - But what is all this?

53
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,090
(But here...)

54
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,390
- This thing here. - It's Christmas.

55
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,160
You look just as fashionable as Dex on "I Am Boxer."

56
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,200
He looks a lot better than I do.

57
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,400
- No. - That's not true.

58
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,100
- He looks great there. - I just dress up.

59
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,570
(The monochrome enthusiast has his own principles about style.)

60
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,330
He's sexy.

61
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,770
Why would he celebrate Christmas looking like that?

62
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,170
- He's the only one... - By the way, today is...

63
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,570
- Ssaebssaeb's birthday. - It's his birthday.

64
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,140
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

65
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,340
(It was Se Chan's birthday on the day of the shoot.)

66
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,450
(Shy)

67
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,080
- I hate it. Thank you. - Look at Seok Sam.

68
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,210
He's really...

69
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,720
He didn't know it was Se Chan's birthday.

70
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,250
- He didn't know. - I didn't know.

71
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,190
(So cool)

72
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,050
Today is Se Chan's birthday, so we prepared...

73
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,020
(The birthday cake comes in.)

74
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,860
- birthday cake for him. - No!

75
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,060
- What's with Jong Seo? - Jong Seo.

76
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,060
(The professional extra assistant director brings in the cake.)

77
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,790
- Jong Seo. Thanks. - He looks cute.

78
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,930
- Jong Kook. - The cake is so good.

79
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,400
You should at least wear this. Seriously.

80
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,300
- At least wear this. - Why...

81
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,870
(He steals Santa's beard and forces it into a gift.)

82
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,440
- Good. - At least wear it for Christmas.

83
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,640
(His Christmas look is finally complete.)

84
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
This is totally Christmas.

85
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,070
- It's totally Christmas. - It's Christmas.

86
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,570
- Ssaebssaeb - It's Christmas.

87
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,610
Ssaebssaeb.

88
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,440
- Happy birthday. - This is a strawberry cake.

89
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,480
(It feels more like a birthday with the candles.)

90
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,210
It has a lot of strawberries on it.

91
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,250
- How nice. - Thank you.

92
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,250
- Ssaebssaeb. - All right.

93
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,820
- Stand here. - You should wear this.

94
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,790
(He even puts on the cone hat.)

95
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,520
- Right. - Put this on.

96
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,250
- But why... - You're putting it on backwards.

97
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,150
Why are we being so nice to him?

98
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,620
- Why... - He's a member.

99
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,790
I mean, we could just get him a cake right before the ending.

100
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,830
(With the cake)

101
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,690
- But why... - Why are you jealous?

102
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,330
(Is he jealous?)

103
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,800
- The thing is... - Seok Jin doesn't seem to like it.

104
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,200
(Se Chan feels hurt to hear that.)

105
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,670
- I know. Why are you... - Do you not like my birthday?

106
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,870
It's not that I don't like your birthday.

107
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,200
It won't even last long.

108
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,200
It's not fair. We usually do this right before the end of the shoot.

109
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,270
(Baffled)

110
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,570
It's not fair?

111
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,810
Why are we doing this during the opening?

112
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,070
- We don't usually do this. - So what?

113
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,310
Do you want us to throw your 60th birthday party?

114
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,810
I'll make myself clear about it right here. On my birthday,

115
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,510
- don't do anything. - His 60th birthday party?

116
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,180
- We should do it. - With the number 60.

117
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,080
- Don't do anything. - It will be a special episode.

118
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,220
(The eldest one's 60th birthday is 2 months away.)

119
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,850
- Don't do it. - It's a special episode.

120
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,250
- Go ahead. - I'll blow out the candles.

121
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,560
(Before that, they go on with Se Chan's birthday.)

122
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,320
One, two, three.

123
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,460
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

124
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,230
- Happy birthday! - Congratulations.

125
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,630
(Congratulations!)

126
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,190
- Like this. - Hey.

127
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,460
(Carrying)

128
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,330
Why did you...

129
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,530
(The prankster gets rid of the cake right away.)

130
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,670
- We get rid of it right away? - By the way,

131
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,900
- aren't we going to talk about... - Just like that?

132
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,270
(Satisfied)

133
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,140
By the way, aren't we going to talk about our new head director?

134
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,410
- We should. - Hyung Seon.

135
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,510
We have Director Hyung Seon.

136
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,140
(Producer Hyung Seon newly joined.)

137
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,580
- Hyung Seon! - Welcome!

138
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,610
- She was in charge of me. - She was in charge of Jong Kook.

139
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,510
(She used to be the assistant director in charge of Jong Kook.)

140
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,350
- Yes, she was. - How interesting.

141
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,120
As Jong Kook mentioned, she worked with him for a long time.

142
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,520
- It was when Jong Kook was wild. - Right.

143
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,620
(Many years ago)

144
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,320
- No one could control him. - She went through a lot.

145
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,220
- She tried to calm him down a lot. - When no one could stop him,

146
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,030
(She has a history of going against Jong Kook back then.)

147
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,320
- Hyung Seon tried to calm him down. - She did.

148
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,330
- She calmed him down. - Hyung Seon made me into a human.

149
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,590
- She took good care of me. - Yes.

150
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,430
Hyung Seon... Everyone has their own personality.

151
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,260
(Seok Jin tells another story related to Producer Hyung Seon.)

152
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,770
- Hyung Seon is very energetic. - Right.

153
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,700
I was invited to "Same Bed, Different Dreams."

154
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,440
(Hyung Seon)

155
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,200
I turned it down a couple of times, so she called me.

156
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
What did she say?

157
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,440
"Why do you not want to appear on our show?"

158
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,040
(Hyung Seon: Why do you not want to appear on our show?)

159
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,140
- She doesn't hold back. - Right.

160
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,340
- Hyung Seon is... - She says what she needs to say.

161
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,410
- She fights back. - Hyung Seon doesn't hold back.

162
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,820
- She doesn't hold back. - Right.

163
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,950
(With the new producer who won't hold things in,)

164
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,150
(they will be starting today's race.)

165
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,950
Happy birthday, Se Chan.

166
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,790
Before the shoot, we asked you to prepare a Christmas gift...

167
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,520
- for one of the members. - Right.

168
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,920
- That's right. - Yes.

169
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,260
(A Christmas gift?)

170
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,460
- Right. - Did you all bring your gifts?

171
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,560
- Yes. - Sure.

172
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,660
(A few days before the shoot, Sangam SBS)

173
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,460
(Making a phone call)

174
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,660
Hey, Hyung Seon.

175
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,700
Hello, Jong Kook.

176
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,200
- Oh, hello. - Yes.

177
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,810
- All right. - Yes. For the upcoming Christmas,

178
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,140
(He's done reading the room.)

179
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,940
we prepared a special episode.

180
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,910
- Okay. - Yes.

181
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,110
(He sounds gentle suddenly.)

182
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,150
- Okay. I see. - Yes. So,

183
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,980
we'd like you to choose one member you'd like to give a gift to...

184
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,020
Okay.

185
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,620
buy them a gift...

186
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,660
that they absolutely need and you don't need,

187
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,660
and bring it next Monday.

188
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,590
My goodness.

189
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,800
- Something I don't need... - Yes.

190
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
- but the receiver does? - Yes.

191
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,200
- When you heard about this, - Yes.

192
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,370
did you have a member in mind whom you'd like to give a gift to?

193
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,510
(Which member would Jae Seok give his gift to?)

194
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,910
It should be something I don't need but the receiver does.

195
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,050
I think I'll need to think about it.

196
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,080
(Being cautious)

197
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,110
Okay.

198
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,080
There are a lot of things I can give.

199
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,450
But I can't give them my handsomeness, right?

200
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,190
- Unfortunately, no. - I see.

201
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,620
Today, we will have the May You Reach the Christmas Gifts Race,

202
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,660
(A mission to find the owners of the gifts the members prepared)

203
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,790
where you will find out which gift the members have prepared for you.

204
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,430
(May You Reach the Christmas Gifts)

205
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,430
- To find a gift for me? - I can see that.

206
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,330
- A gift for me. - A gift for me.

207
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,530
(Oh, it's finding my own gift!)

208
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
So, those who brought the gifts will have to...

209
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,070
(The crucial point is finding the gift that is meant for me.)

210
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,370
- keep their gifts a secret, right? - Yes.

211
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,500
First, we will reveal...

212
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,110
(The actual Christmas gifts will be revealed.)

213
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,210
- the gifts you've prepared. - I'm curious.

214
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,410
- I'm excited. - I'm curious.

215
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,740
- What would it be? - There should be one for me.

216
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,750
What's that big thing?

217
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,250
(Gift boxes of various sizes labeled from 1 to 7)

218
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,510
- This looks great. - By the way...

219
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,020
- Number six is big. - My goodness.

220
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,050
- Number six looks good. - It's so big.

221
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,620
- What? - What is that? It's so big.

222
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,960
We have seven gifts here.

223
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,090
(Among the 7 gifts,)

224
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,130
You must guess which of these gifts is yours...

225
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,830
(they need to guess all of the ones that are theirs.)

226
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,190
to avoid penalties and receive the gift.

227
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,400
- All my gifts? - All of them?

228
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,660
- What does that mean? - Yes. I'll give you an example.

229
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,960
- There could be more than one? - Let's say...

230
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,500
- there are two gifts for Seok Jin. - For me...

231
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,900
Then Seok Jin has to find...

232
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,340
- the two gifts. - All two of them?

233
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,070
And he will avoid the penalty and receive the gifts.

234
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,210
What if there's no gift for me?

235
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,440
- I don't think I'll get anything. - That's too hard.

236
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,910
If you think there's no gift for you,

237
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,310
you should go to the Alone Zone during the final selection.

238
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,710
(If they think they have 0 gifts, they need to choose the Alone Zone.)

239
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,320
- The Alone Zone. - The members who guessed...

240
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,250
their gifts incorrectly will get the penalty.

241
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,150
- All of them get the penalty? - Yes.

242
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,160
Then, some of the members might not receive any gifts.

243
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,420
- That's right. - Is that possible?

244
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,430
(They may not have a gift to receive.)

245
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,690
- It must be upsetting. - That will be sad.

246
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,100
- Right. - What kind of Christmas is this?

247
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,170
- I'm worried about something. - Okay.

248
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,930
This isn't just a gift.

249
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,600
- It would be useless? - It's something I don't need.

250
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,300
- That's right. - That's the condition.

251
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,640
(A deeply unsettling clause)

252
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,710
- You're right. - It's something I don't need.

253
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,810
- It's something I don't need. - I see.

254
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,440
Gosh, this could be...

255
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,310
- That's where you get a hint from. - That's right.

256
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,520
So, we have placed the gifts...

257
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,880
in order of price.

258
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,290
(It is in the order of the price of the gift.)

259
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,420
- I see. - Please open the boxes in order,

260
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,950
- starting from the left. - Is this cheaper?

261
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,720
(The higher the number, the more expensive the gift.)

262
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,790
- Is this the cheaper one? - Yes.

263
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,360
(They open the cheapest gift, number 1.)

264
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,020
- Open? - Open it?

265
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,390
- You should open it. - Are we supposed to open it?

266
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,490
- But it's beautifully wrapped. - It looks so nice.

267
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,800
- It looks pretty. - When I get a gift,

268
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,170
I feel really bad tearing the wrapping off.

269
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,400
- Right. I feel the same. - I know. It's wrapped beautifully.

270
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,870
(Bag Man feels bad about wasting the wrapper.)

271
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,500
- It feels good, though. - Just open it roughly.

272
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
He's right.

273
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,610
- Right. This is... My gosh. - You should open it roughly.

274
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,270
(Tearing right away)

275
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,170
- Gosh, this is... - What is this?

276
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,440
- Whose is it? - What's that?

277
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,310
- What... - I know what it is. It's too much.

278
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,050
- What is this? - It's for callused skin.

279
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,920
- It's an electric foot file. Gosh. - I see.

280
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,080
(What is the first gift?)

281
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,120
Come on!

282
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,120
- It's an electric foot file. Gosh. - I see.

283
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,150
(No. 1: An electric foot file)

284
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,720
- Come on! - Yang Se Chan!

285
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,620
(How did you know, Se Chan?)

286
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,090
- My gosh. Yang Se Chan! - Hey.

287
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,560
(Did he bring the gift, since he knew what is was?)

288
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,490
- It's what Se Chan brought. - No.

289
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,300
- I have one at home. - Hey.

290
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
- I have one. - You're overreacting.

291
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,800
(It's true.)

292
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
- I have one at home. - This is...

293
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
(That's not it.)

294
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,400
- It's not for me. - The thing is,

295
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
he noticed it right away when we opened only this much.

296
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,070
(Suspicious)

297
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,700
- Right. - It's you.

298
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
- Because... - It's you.

299
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,210
- I recently bought this. - Did you bring this?

300
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,510
- Did you buy this? - No.

301
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,370
- Did you buy it? - It's a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

302
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,710
It's Se Chan.

303
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,080
- No, it's not me. - So, it's an electric foot file.

304
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,150
(The first gift seems to be a clearance item.)

305
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,180
- It's not me. - I don't know who bought this,

306
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,450
but I do know who this is for.

307
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,350
- Who? - But...

308
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,620
- It's for Seok Jin's feet. - The tough skin.

309
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,790
The tough skin.

310
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,960
- Isn't that it? - To buff away his skin?

311
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,030
- Or... - Hey, my feet are so smooth.

312
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,760
(It's not me.)

313
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,190
- Have you seen my heels? - At your age,

314
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,260
things that shouldn't grow...

315
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,030
(Who is the foot file for?)

316
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,300
- grow on your skin. - Right.

317
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,760
That's not true. They're very smooth.

318
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,870
- Next. The second one. - What's this?

319
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,630
(Gift No. 2 is revealed.)

320
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
It's from Ji Hyo.

321
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,200
They are just getting rid of things they don't need. Please.

322
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,180
(What's the second gift that seems useless?)

323
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,340
It's from Ji Hyo.

324
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
They are just getting rid of things they don't need.

325
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,510
- Please. - My gosh.

326
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,580
(No. 2: A set of shot glasses)

327
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,180
- This is pretty. - What?

328
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,510
- These days, this is... - My gosh.

329
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,350
- What's this? - Didn't we get this in Gyeongju?

330
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,820
It's from Gyeongju.

331
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,920
- In Gyeongju... - It's Jae Seok!

332
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
- This is the NMK merchandise. - It's from Jae Seok!

333
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,790
- You got this in Gyeongju. - You got this in Gyeongju.

334
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,360
(See Episode 761 for reference.)

335
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,520
- No. - You got this in Gyeongju.

336
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,820
- This isn't it. - Isn't it what you got in Gyeongju?

337
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,690
- This is the NMK merchandise. - I got it!

338
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
- Who got this back then? - You went with me.

339
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,800
- When? - On "Hangout with Yoo."

340
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,570
(Jae Seok went to the National Museum of Korea...)

341
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,100
- We went to the museum. - I didn't buy this.

342
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,570
- On "Hangout with Yoo?" - No.

343
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,200
(in another show.)

344
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,340
- No. - It's Jae Seok.

345
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,970
- No. - It's him.

346
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,440
(Who will receive the shot glasses...)

347
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,440
- What? - It's Jae Seok.

348
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,410
(with the antique drawings?)

349
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,770
- This is... - It's Jae Seok.

350
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,580
- Who is this for? - It's for Ji Hyo.

351
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,080
- It must be for Ji Hyo. - You're right.

352
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,180
- They are shot glasses. - The color changes.

353
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,850
- Is this really for me? - The color changes.

354
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,750
(Is it for Ji Hyo, who loves to drink?)

355
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,950
- It's probably for Ji Hyo. - I think it's for Ji Hyo.

356
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,820
- Or it could be for me and my wife. - Right.

357
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,090
They might want me to drink with my wife and do something.

358
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,790
(Or is it for the newlywed groom, Jong Kook?)

359
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,490
- Right. - Don't you think this is for me?

360
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,730
- Next. - They are too cheap.

361
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,000
(Gift No. 3 is revealed.)

362
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,770
- Come on! This is too much. - Seriously, this is...

363
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,470
- I think this is for me. - Hair?

364
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,040
- Come on! This is too much. - Seriously, this is...

365
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,000
(No. 3: Hair-styling tongs)

366
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,840
- I think this is for me. - Hair?

367
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,570
This is to get rid of what you don't use.

368
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,580
- That's a used one. - Is it a used one?

369
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,910
- It looks new. - Jae Seok.

370
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,510
This is from Ye Eun.

371
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,780
(This is for Ye Eun.)

372
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,910
- No. - I see.

373
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,780
I think this is for me.

374
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,520
(Is it for the youngest one, who styles her hair often?)

375
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,520
No. I think...

376
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,180
this is for Ji Hyo.

377
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,520
- For me? - Is this a bungeoppang machine?

378
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,790
- This is... - I think it's a gift for me.

379
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,420
- What is this? - To get my hair done.

380
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,460
It's a hair curler.

381
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,820
- Like this. - That's not it.

382
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,390
Did you not watch Ji Hyo's YouTube channel?

383
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,790
- Yes. - Her hair was a mess.

384
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,460
- I was really surprised. - Really?

385
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,100
(Seok Sam's guess: It's a gift from a member...)

386
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
- On my channel... - It was really...

387
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,170
(who was shocked after seeing the show.)

388
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,970
- On my channel... - It's a gift for Ji Hyo.

389
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,500
(That's right.)

390
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,970
I see.

391
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,070
- I think... - It could be from me.

392
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,810
(A reasonable guess)

393
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,340
- I bet it's for Ji Hyo. - Maybe it's for Ji Hyo.

394
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,410
Her hair.

395
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,540
- It's for Ji Hyo. - Because...

396
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,780
(Is it for Ji Hyo, so she can say goodbye to her messy hair?)

397
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,010
her hair was a real mess.

398
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,280
Because my hair was a mess,

399
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,780
they want me to get my hair done?

400
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,380
This is useless, seriously.

401
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,720
(Who is this useless hair curler for?)

402
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,150
Please stop giving away useless things.

403
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,680
- Seriously... - By the way,

404
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,280
this is what the director said.

405
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,720
It's something I don't need.

406
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,550
- Right. - That's it.

407
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,120
Numbers 1 to 3 are priced under 100 dollars.

408
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,190
- Under 100 dollars. - I see.

409
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,190
Numbers 1 to 3 are priced under 100 dollars.

410
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,330
(The gifts they are opening now are on the expensive side.)

411
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,330
- Under 100 dollars. - I see.

412
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,100
- What's this? My goodness. - My gosh.

413
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,200
(Gift no. 4 draws admiration right away.)

414
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,200
- What? - What's this?

415
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,260
- Perfume. - What?

416
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,300
That's expensive.

417
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,630
- I think this is genuine. - Is it genuine?

418
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,270
- This is genuine. - It is.

419
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,300
- This is for me. - Is it genuine?

420
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,740
(They all claim it.)

421
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,600
- It's for me. - It's for me.

422
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,670
- I need perfume. - It's for me.

423
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,040
(The gift that made all of them claim that it is theirs)

424
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,610
Let me see. This is body lotion.

425
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,510
- It's for the body. - It's body lotion.

426
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,010
- This is for me. - It's for me.

427
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,310
(No. 4: Premium body lotion)

428
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,280
- Body lotion. - It's genuine.

429
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,710
I really like this brand.

430
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,280
I only use this brand.

431
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,120
(They all want the expensive gift.)

432
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,850
- It's body lotion. - It's for me.

433
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,150
- Body lotion. - It's genuine.

434
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,290
(Staring)

435
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,290
- Really? - Yes.

436
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,350
- Is it genuine? - It's genuine.

437
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,120
- What's that? Is there a note? - What?

438
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,720
It says the product exchange date.

439
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,430
(The popular product was purchased at a store.)

440
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,190
- Someone bought this. - It's new.

441
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,930
This must be Ye Eun.

442
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,460
(Is this for Ye Eun?)

443
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,330
- No. - It's Ye Eun.

444
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,400
Someone who's not used to Running Man.

445
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,970
- No. - When she was told to buy a gift...

446
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,200
- This is Ye Eun. - Body lotion.

447
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,600
- Body lotion. - It's not me.

448
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,400
- The body lotion is for me. - I think Jong Kook...

449
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,140
- I'll go for the body lotion set. - The luxury body lotion set.

450
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,840
(He always showed his love for the body lotion.)

451
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,540
You rascal!

452
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,580
(Is it a gift for Jong Kook?)

453
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,380
The body lotion!

454
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,180
- This is for me. - It's for me.

455
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,580
This is for me. I love body lotion.

456
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
It's for me.

457
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,390
It's for me. Someone bought this for me.

458
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,490
It's someone who knows that I love body lotion.

459
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,790
(He might cry if it is not for him.)

460
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,420
I think the body lotion is for me.

461
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,960
- I love body lotion. - Right.

462
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,130
Reuse.

463
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,190
Is this 100 dollars?

464
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,230
(Their expectations are raised by the premium gift.)

465
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,860
- The other gifts... - Is it 100 dollars?

466
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,500
Is there anything that's more expensive than this?

467
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,100
- What is this? - What is it?

468
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,270
(They open gift no. 5, which is more expensive.)

469
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,700
- Underpants? - It's underwear.

470
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,200
- What? - Underwear?

471
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,900
(Enthusiasm going cold)

472
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,540
- Underwear? - This is annoying.

473
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
What is it?

474
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,240
(The identity of the gift that makes everyone sigh?)

475
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,810
- Underpants? - It's underwear.

476
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,270
- What? - Underwear?

477
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,510
- Underwear? - This is annoying.

478
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,810
(No. 5: Leopard print underwear)

479
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,980
- It's underwear. - This is for Haha.

480
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,010
- This is... - Haha.

481
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,380
- By the way... - Haha.

482
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,480
This isn't about the price.

483
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,580
- It's just unpleasant. - It's provocative.

484
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,180
- It's disgusting. - It's underwear.

485
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,320
(As soon as it is revealed, they all pour out criticism.)

486
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,380
- It's not me. - The price...

487
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,920
I don't like things like this.

488
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,550
They're throwing this away because they don't need it.

489
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,590
It's disgusting.

490
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,690
- It's you, right? - Let me see.

491
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,560
(It feels like it was given away because they couldn't wear it.)

492
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,690
- I think it's Haha. - It must be you.

493
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,790
- I bet it's Haha. - I swear it's not me.

494
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,560
The leopard print is really...

495
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,460
I'm wearing what Se Chan gave me.

496
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,530
- Are they underpants? - Haha.

497
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,200
We're wearing the same thing.

498
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,270
(Showing off the matching underpants all of a sudden)

499
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,400
- Se Chan and I exchanged them. - Right.

500
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,470
(Touched)

501
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,470
- It must be Se Chan. - No, it's not me.

502
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,910
(Is the gift for one of the underwear brothers?)

503
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,840
- And it's not me. - This is from Se Chan.

504
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,910
I'm sure this is what they got as a gift and kept for a while.

505
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,150
You know what? What if they tried them on...

506
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,980
and packed them back up?

507
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,880
- That would be horrible. - Come on!

508
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,320
- Maybe they tried them on... - Why would they do such a thing?

509
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,320
(The thought alone is dizzying.)

510
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
- and didn't like them, so... - My goodness.

511
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,160
If that's the case, we should test it.

512
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
- Let's open it. - We should test it.

513
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,590
This isn't wrapped professionally.

514
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,460
(Going into underwear profiling mode)

515
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,730
This is...

516
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,160
- I'm sure they opened this. - They tried them on.

517
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,070
- They must've tried them on. - I know, right?

518
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,900
- Exactly. - This is incredibly unpleasant.

519
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,770
(They open the package to determine if they had been worn.)

520
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,200
- Let's see if they're stretched. - Let's take a look.

521
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,710
- The wrapping doesn't look good. - This isn't about the price.

522
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,410
- What's the size? - Jae Seok.

523
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,050
- My gosh. Who would wear these? - Come on.

524
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,380
Haha, please!

525
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,120
(Completely repulsed)

526
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,550
- This is too much. - This is...

527
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,850
- My eyes are sore. - Hey!

528
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,420
- This is really... - Let me see.

529
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,720
(The horrible gift looks even worse when they open the box.)

530
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
- Hey! - My goodness.

531
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,320
- This is really... - Let me see.

532
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,890
- Hey! - My goodness.

533
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,790
Who would wear something this loud?

534
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,060
- This is too much. - What's the size?

535
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,130
Check the size.

536
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,460
- I... - This is quite big.

537
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,460
- It's too big for Haha. - For me...

538
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,530
(It's a large size too.)

539
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,600
It's quite big.

540
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,770
- It's not for Haha. - You can't wear this.

541
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,900
This is too strange.

542
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,270
(Jong Kook's guess: It can't be for Haha due to the size.)

543
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,940
- Give me that. - It's for Haha.

544
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,940
Let me check the size.

545
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,600
- It's not your size. - It's too big for you.

546
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,940
- You wear size small. - It's not for Haha.

547
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,070
(Checking the size)

548
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,510
It's not for Haha. He's out.

549
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,980
- What's the size? - It's too big for you.

550
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,480
- It's too big for you too! - For you...

551
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,680
- But this is... - I'm bigger than you.

552
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,710
- I'm bigger. - Is this more expensive than that?

553
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,580
I think the leopard-print underwear is for me.

554
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,050
The size is quite big.

555
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,390
- Because... - The thing is...

556
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,790
- I'm married, so to get pregnant... - Right.

557
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,960
- So I can seduce my wife. - To show off your charm.

558
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,690
(Jong Kook's guess: It's to set the mood, since he's a newlywed.)

559
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,030
- Hey, this is... - Don't you think that's what it is?

560
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,760
How would you seduce your wife with this?

561
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,730
- This is... - She will burst into laughter.

562
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,030
- She will burst into laughter. - This isn't romantic at all.

563
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,600
- I think it's for you. - This is...

564
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,430
- It must be for you. - Don't you think it's for me?

565
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,140
(Who will get the controversial leopard print underwear?)

566
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
The mood will be...

567
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,840
This is...

568
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,670
This is pricey, but it's too...

569
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,110
(They open gift no. 6.)

570
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,370
- This is the most expensive one. - My goodness.

571
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,740
This is pricey, but it's too...

572
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,340
- This is the most expensive one. - My goodness.

573
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,850
(Yeongdeok snow crab?)

574
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,880
- It's Yeongdeok snow crab. - This is crazy.

575
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,950
- What? - But why is it light?

576
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,520
- Is it a snow crab? - What?

577
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,720
But it's too light.

578
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,120
(For it to be the snow crab)

579
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,150
Is it half-dried saury?

580
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,520
- It's from Ji Hyo. - I think...

581
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,420
- What is this? - I don't think this is a real crab.

582
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,490
This is too light.

583
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,290
It must be Se Chan.

584
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,090
(They suspect that it's fake, because of the light weight.)

585
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,090
- Why would I... - It's from Se Chan.

586
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,560
If it has crab chips in it...

587
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,560
If it has crab chips in it...

588
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,330
(Snacks)

589
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,200
- What? This is real. - It must be crab chips.

590
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,670
Is it a Yeongdeok snow crab?

591
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,870
(No. 6: Yeongdeok snow crab)

592
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,540
- What? - This is real.

593
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,040
It's steamed.

594
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,640
- What? - This is real.

595
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,610
- It's steamed. - Their faces...

596
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,080
- What? - But this is...

597
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,210
(Reluctant)

598
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,540
- But this is... - It's steamed.

599
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,980
- What kind of gift is this? - This is...

600
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,320
- What kind of gift is this? - This is...

601
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,720
They brought leftovers.

602
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,750
Please. Stop giving away useless things.

603
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,490
- One crab leg is missing. - Come on!

604
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,890
- Hey, this is... - I don't want it.

605
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,290
This is really annoying.

606
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,160
(It doesn't look too good.)

607
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,230
- It's not me. - What is this?

608
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,260
Hey.

609
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,030
They brought leftovers.

610
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,800
(Disgusted)

611
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,660
- They brought a snow crab? - Hey.

612
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,330
One piece of the crab body is missing.

613
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,130
(Totally disgusted)

614
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,600
- It stinks. - This is ridiculous.

615
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,840
(Who will get the gift of the crab with missing parts?)

616
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,370
- You... - I can't believe this.

617
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,470
By the way...

618
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,270
I don't think the snow crab is for me.

619
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,370
- Right. - The crab...

620
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,540
- I find eating crabs bothersome. - You don't like it.

621
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,180
Me too. I hate it.

622
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,580
I don't even eat snow crabs...

623
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,780
- at home. - Just once.

624
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,680
- You... - I hate peeling crabs.

625
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,980
I don't eat snow crabs.

626
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,220
(Lazy)

627
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,220
- Peel this for me. - It's bothersome.

628
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,650
- I hate peeling crabs. - I'll do the work.

629
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,990
(The older members don't eat food that requires a lot of work.)

630
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,890
- I hate it. - Right.

631
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,320
Maybe they want to give it to you because you find it bothersome.

632
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,360
(A playful gift for the older members?)

633
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,860
- They want you to peel it. - I don't think it's for me.

634
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,630
I think the crab is for me.

635
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,700
- You? - You?

636
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,760
- I think it's for me. - Why?

637
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,970
- Because you like to eat? - You think it's for you?

638
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,370
Because I like crabs.

639
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,500
- You do? - Really?

640
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,370
Se Chan knows a lot about you.

641
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,570
Is it Se Chan's gift for you?

642
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,440
Why are you giving me such a lousy gift?

643
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,150
(It is ruled as a lousy gift.)

644
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,680
"Such a lousy gift?"

645
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,250
- What did they say? - I don't know.

646
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,120
(Is the crab, the lousy gift, really for Food Fighter?)

647
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,080
What a lousy gift.

648
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,950
Let's open the last one.

649
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,950
(Gift no. 7 is revealed.)

650
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,990
- Let's do that. - The most expensive one.

651
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,060
What's that?

652
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,290
- Is it expensive? - What?

653
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,460
(What is the last gift, which is the most expensive one?)

654
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,820
- Is there something? - Is it expensive?

655
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,230
- This is number seven. - It's a gift certificate.

656
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,530
- No? - No, it's not.

657
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,860
- It says Running Man. - What?

658
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,030
- It's a medal. - What is it?

659
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,330
- Is it gold? - Is it a medal?

660
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,400
What's that? My goodness.

661
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,170
- What? Is it gold? - Why did they bring this?

662
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,200
- Is it gold? - It's gold.

663
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,500
- What? Is it gold? - Why did they bring this?

664
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,570
- Is it gold? - It's gold.

665
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,670
(No. 7: Gold key)

666
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,570
- Is this gold? - Let me see.

667
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,770
- Is this gold? - Let me see.

668
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,010
(A real gift that they didn't expect to see)

669
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,910
Is it gold?

670
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,240
- Is it real gold? - Is it gold?

671
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,880
- It's gold. - Isn't this from Running Man?

672
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,210
(A prop)

673
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,310
- They brought real gold. - No. It's gold.

674
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,320
- Is it gold? - They brought real gold?

675
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,580
- Did someone bring this? - Yes. It's a gift.

676
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,720
One of the members?

677
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,850
- A member? - One of us actually brought this?

678
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,890
- Unbelievable. - How big is it?

679
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,890
- It's 1.875g of gold. - It's 1.875g.

680
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,120
(It is 1.9g of pure gold.)

681
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,090
- It's 1.875g. - Then, it's about 400 dollars.

682
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,400
(The gold key is currently worth 450 dollars.)

683
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,660
- Is it 400 dollars? - It's about 400 dollars.

684
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,730
I think...

685
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,460
- the richest one here... - It's me.

686
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,500
- Really? - Is it from you?

687
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,970
I mean, I think it's for me.

688
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,270
(The gold)

689
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,130
- Hey. - Come on.

690
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,640
For your baby's first birthday?

691
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,140
- That could be it. - For your baby's first birthday.

692
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,170
That could be the case.

693
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,770
(The newlywed counts his chickens before they are hatched.)

694
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,170
For your baby's first birthday?

695
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,810
- That could be it. - For your baby's first birthday.

696
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,380
- It's Jae Seok. - It must be Jae Seok.

697
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,410
(The one who brought gold)

698
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,480
It's Jae Seok.

699
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,980
- It's you. - My goodness.

700
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,150
(Speculations about each gift are swirling.)

701
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,180
Jae Seok, you're so cool.

702
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,450
Not bad!

703
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,080
That's so cool.

704
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,050
(Which gift do you think is for you?)

705
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,050
You have a lot of things like this at home.

706
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,090
Gold.

707
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,990
(No. 7: Gold key)

708
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,360
I think Jae Seok is giving it to me.

709
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,490
To thank me for my hard work.

710
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,790
(The reason being...)

711
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,700
Since I'm the youngest member here,

712
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
he takes good care of me.

713
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,200
And I'm the one with the least money here.

714
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,770
(It's a gift for me, right?)

715
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,840
I'm the one with the least money.

716
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,140
(Do you like the gift?)

717
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,140
I love it.

718
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,310
Thank you.

719
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,940
Thank you.

720
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,380
I think the gold is for me.

721
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:28,120
(No. 7: Gold key)

722
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,480
The person who brought gold today...

723
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,120
knew today was my birthday.

724
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,720
I think it's the gold.

725
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,850
(Since it's his birthday)

726
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,860
I wish the gold were for me.

727
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,020
(The 3 members in a row want the gold.)

728
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,790
It could be for me.

729
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,330
(No. 7: Gold key)

730
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,490
To celebrate my birthday next year in advance.

731
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,700
(For his 60th birthday)

732
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,560
It could be an early birthday gift.

733
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,400
I wish the gold were for me.

734
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,470
(Haha wants gold as well.)

735
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,600
Maybe it's because I have the most children.

736
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,970
(No. 7: Gold key)

737
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,070
Is that why I'm getting it?

738
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,770
That's my guess.

739
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,370
Next year,

740
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,610
Dream is going to middle school.

741
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,610
And my youngest child enters elementary school.

742
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,480
Maybe that's why I'm getting the gold key.

743
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,080
I think the gold is for me.

744
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,380
(They are all convincing themselves that the gold is theirs.)

745
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,420
I'll go for the gold.

746
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,850
I think...

747
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,720
it's the shot glasses...

748
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,390
(The gift for me?)

749
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,850
or the hair-styling tongs.

750
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,520
I guess they are probably for me.

751
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,660
(Do you like the gift that you are expecting?)

752
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,590
I don't like them at all.

753
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,560
I don't like them.

754
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,800
I think the worst gift is...

755
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,400
that thing.

756
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,430
The underwear. That's the worst.

757
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,130
(No. 5: Leopard-print underwear)

758
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,470
(The underwear is the least-wanted.)

759
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,840
I'm sure they brought it because they couldn't wear it.

760
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:26,440
(No. 5: Leopard-print underwear)

761
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,340
I think, surprisingly, the underwear...

762
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,010
is a gift from a female member.

763
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,780
They don't know much...

764
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,910
about men's size.

765
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,550
- What about the crab? - I hope the crab isn't for me.

766
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,510
(The gift that I will get)

767
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,750
There are a few things. First, it's the hair-styling tongs.

768
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,150
(No. 6: Yeongdeok snow crab)

769
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,950
And there's the crab.

770
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,780
(The gift he doesn't want)

771
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,190
I don't want to take the crab home.

772
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,790
(The least-wanted gifts are the underwear and crab.)

773
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,390
There aren't many things I like.

774
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,260
(The members don't really want anything except the gold.)

775
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,260
If it's not the gold key, everything is meaningless.

776
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,490
Who will get the gold?

777
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,930
(Who will the gifts be for?)

778
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,730
I think the gold is for me.

779
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,030
It's not for you.

780
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,960
I just realized something during the interview.

781
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,770
What if no one prepared a gift for me?

782
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,900
- Would you be disappointed? - It would be so...

783
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,970
You could just take back the crab you brought.

784
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,970
Right.

785
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,570
- You can take it back. - He's really...

786
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,640
(They criticize each other for bringing the crab,)

787
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,910
Just take what's left.

788
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,510
(which is the least-wanted gift.)

789
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,110
I think he brought the crab.

790
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,280
No. It's the underwear.

791
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
I think the person who would bring the leftover crab...

792
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,310
Right.

793
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,650
would be either Ssaebssaeb...

794
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,980
- Exactly. - or Haha.

795
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,320
Jae Seok, if my family got a Yeongdeok snow crab,

796
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,350
- His family... - it wouldn't last for 30 minutes.

797
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,790
(Gone in seconds)

798
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,490
- That's true. - I guess he's right.

799
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,490
We'd finish it right away.

800
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,490
- Why did you bring the gold? - I know.

801
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,390
- Why did you bring it? - How bold.

802
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,260
(In order to guess, they interrogate to find the origin first.)

803
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,730
He's in a different league from us.

804
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,660
- Right. - I get that you're well off,

805
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,330
- but gold is as good as cash. - Thank you.

806
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,770
Thank you, anyway.

807
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,370
- It's not for you. - Even if I brought it,

808
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,700
- it wouldn't be for you. - It's not for me?

809
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,170
- Not you. - You'll get the electric foot file.

810
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,640
(The electric foot file is for you!)

811
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,370
- You'll get the electric foot file. - Right.

812
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,580
(They still have no clue about the presents.)

813
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,510
- That's it. - Who would give it to me?

814
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,740
The mission for the hint about the gifts is...

815
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,880
(The mission to get hints for the gifts)

816
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,710
- Don't Spit It Out. - Don't Spit It Out?

817
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,650
(May You Reach the Christmas Gifts, Mission 1, Don't Spit It Out)

818
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,250
From barley tea to soy sauce to sophora root tea,

819
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,820
we have 50 cups of different random drinks.

820
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,120
- There are 50 cups? - You will take turns...

821
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,050
and drink one cup each.

822
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,120
Even if you get the penalty drink,

823
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,160
if you finish the drink without showing it, you succeed.

824
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,160
- Without showing it? - Is it okay if we finish the drink?

825
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,300
- We should just drink it up? - Yes.

826
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,800
- That's new. - The three members...

827
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
who finish all their drinks without giving up...

828
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,770
will get the hint.

829
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,800
So only three of us will receive hints?

830
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,140
(Only the last 3 survivors will receive hints.)

831
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,270
- The last three remaining? - Unbelievable.

832
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,270
This game doesn't feel Christmassy at all.

833
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,940
The drinks are pretty.

834
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,410
(The drinks)

835
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,070
Are they pretty?

836
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,580
Please bring in the drinks.

837
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,510
(The pretty Christmas edition drinks are brought in.)

838
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,980
- What on earth? - Let's see.

839
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,580
- There's Powerade. - Look at this.

840
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,380
- What am I looking at? - It's so colorful.

841
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,250
- That's tomato juice. - Are some of them tasty?

842
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,950
Would that clear one be water?

843
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,150
(They may look ordinary, but...)

844
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,990
Don't smell them.

845
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,590
(Capsaicin juice and salt water)

846
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,090
Seriously.

847
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,060
(On the other hand, even if it looks nasty...)

848
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,720
- I can't stomach sophora root tea. - I don't think...

849
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,760
- that's plain water. - I bet that's vinegar.

850
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,830
(Sports drink with food coloring and juice with food coloring)

851
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
This is so confusing.

852
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,830
What else would that clear drink be if not water?

853
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,430
(There are 50 mystery drinks you can't judge by color alone.)

854
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,830
- Certain agents can absorb color. - No way.

855
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,200
They can still be consumed, right?

856
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,170
They're perfectly safe to drink.

857
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,940
(Of course, they are all safe to drink.)

858
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,770
- That's right. - Then I can just drink it.

859
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,810
We can easily tolerate whatever these are.

860
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,810
- Some drinks are tasty. - Don't smell them.

861
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,180
How can you tell?

862
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,010
These are easy to drink. That has to be tomato juice.

863
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,610
- This is Powerade. - You're not allowed to smell them.

864
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,080
- This will be tricky. - Just like this.

865
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,020
What about these clear ones?

866
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,950
- How can they taste bad? - These are the dangerous ones.

867
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,550
Could it be alcohol?

868
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,220
(No, they are not.)

869
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,490
- These are the dangerous ones. - Could it be alcohol?

870
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,690
(The murky ones)

871
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,620
- These. - It looks like a multigrain shake.

872
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,730
This one's a trap for sure.

873
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,160
(The dark one)

874
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,130
- Isn't this Americano, Jae Seok? - Really?

875
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,760
- The clear one? - Maybe it's soy sauce.

876
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,260
(They all have different opinions about the same drink.)

877
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,330
- Pick it up and drink right away. - That's Powerade.

878
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,470
- Exactly. - Don't drink with your nose held.

879
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,470
- Can't we frown or grimace? - Isn't that allowed?

880
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,340
- Of course you can't. - Okay.

881
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,210
- That's not allowed. - How about making this sound?

882
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,640
(Enjoying)

883
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,180
While doing this, don't forget to make the sound.

884
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,410
(Positive expressions are accepted.)

885
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Nice.

886
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
- But these... - They actually smell nice.

887
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,420
(What will these drinks be?)

888
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,150
- There are a lot of drinks. - There are a lot of them.

889
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,420
- Sand lance sauce... - Let's get on with it.

890
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,190
Some bits have started floating in the drinks.

891
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,790
- Some have begun to foam. - I see bits floating.

892
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,890
(Yuck)

893
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,320
Since the order could affect the outcome,

894
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,930
(It's a relay, so the order is important as well.)

895
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,360
please choose...

896
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
- the order yourselves. - Rock-paper-scissors?

897
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,400
- All right. Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

898
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,430
(They decide the order with rock-paper-scissors.)

899
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,130
- Rock-paper-scissors. - That was valid.

900
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,800
- It wasn't. Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

901
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,000
(Jong Kook, Ye Eun, and Ji Hyo won.)

902
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,640
- Fists win. - Yes, fists.

903
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,610
(The three of them play again.)

904
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,440
- It was scissors versus fists. - Yes, fists.

905
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,770
- We won. - Fists, let's go.

906
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,810
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Didn't she have paper?

907
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,940
- No. - Rock-paper-scissors.

908
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,080
(Ye Eun won.)

909
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,180
Yes, I'm in first place.

910
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,080
(It's not every day Ddochi is in 1st place!)

911
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,080
- I'll go first. - Okay. I'll go second.

912
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,120
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

913
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,120
(Next, Jong Kook chooses no. 2.)

914
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,290
- I'll go first. - Okay. I'll go second.

915
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,750
- I'll go third. - I'll go second.

916
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,360
- I'll go third. - Unbelievable.

917
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,020
(Ji Hyo in 3rd place chooses no. 3.)

918
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,960
Are you kidding me?

919
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,730
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

920
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,760
(The winners chose to pick as early as possible.)

921
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,690
- Sit in the order we're choosing. - Scissors.

922
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,060
- We each choose for ourselves. - You go ahead.

923
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,760
- Is it better to choose early on? - Yes.

924
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,770
They might lose...

925
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,030
- before we get to choose. - Yes, exactly.

926
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,200
- Especially if it's a strong one. - That's possible.

927
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,670
(Even the order of the drinks is a hidden danger.)

928
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,270
We shouldn't take too long to choose.

929
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,670
- Just five seconds. - The first contender...

930
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,040
will drink one.

931
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,240
(Ye Eun is the first to go.)

932
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,310
- Let's go. - It's Ye Eun.

933
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,380
- Sure. - Ye Eun, go ahead.

934
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,480
That's it!

935
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,910
Nice!

936
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,410
(Unlucky Ddochi always picked a dud.)

937
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,450
- Darn. - Okay!

938
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,850
- There you go! - That's wild.

939
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,950
(Will she choose correctly this time?)

940
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,120
- Let's go. - It's Ye Eun.

941
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,750
- Ye Eun, go ahead. - I'm going for the Powerade.

942
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,520
- Three seconds. - No, five. Five...

943
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,990
(She goes for the blue drink without even having to think.)

944
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,690
- Five, four... - This one.

945
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,930
- I choose this one. - Three.

946
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,830
- Good. That's Pocari Sweat. - Nice.

947
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,600
(What is the drink she had her eye on from the beginning?)

948
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,960
- I choose this one. - Four, three...

949
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Good. That's Pocari Sweat.

950
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,560
Is that how we should drink it?

951
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,840
(The Food Fighter's Waterfall Show)

952
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,170
(Ye Eun fails right off the bat.)

953
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,640
- What's the drink? - What is it?

954
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,040
(Throwing up)

955
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,910
What was it?

956
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,980
- What was it? - What did you swallow?

957
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,640
- What is it? You don't know? - I don't know.

958
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,610
(The blue drink is...)

959
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,850
- What is it? - What is that?

960
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,150
It's Powerade mixed with salt.

961
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,120
- Really? - Salt?

962
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,450
- Seriously. Can I get a tissue? - Is that what we can expect?

963
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,290
- I mean... - That's impossible to drink.

964
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,320
(The unlucky Ye Eun chose another dud.)

965
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,150
Serves you right!

966
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,730
(Ye Eun in 1st place is out 1st.)

967
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,030
Did you see her? She took it all in her mouth and...

968
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,860
I know what to expect now.

969
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,960
- The order... - Which turn are you picking on?

970
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,400
- The order... - Ye Eun.

971
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,770
- The order... - No, not there.

972
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,170
- The order... - Spit it out into the bucket.

973
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,200
Spit it into this.

974
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Can't we each choose which turn we pick?

975
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,140
(Now he claims it.)

976
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,640
- You already have. - This...

977
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,810
(The top-ranked members now realize that something is wrong.)

978
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,710
- Just pick second. - Go second.

979
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,970
- Pick second. - Shouldn't I get to choose?

980
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,180
- You're going second. - That's what you decided on.

981
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,140
(A heavy heart)

982
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,910
- Now I know what to expect. - I might win by default.

983
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,380
(The ones in the back)

984
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,980
What did I tell you?

985
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,080
- We're lucky to be... - Exactly!

986
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,350
- the last three to choose. - I love it.

987
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,180
This is clear water, you know.

988
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,150
(Jong Kook tries 2nd.)

989
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,520
- And go. - Don't smell it.

990
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,450
- Five, four, - You can't.

991
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,050
(Contemplating)

992
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,260
- three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

993
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,460
- Here I go. - Okay. The water?

994
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,730
- That can't be plain water. - Number 20.

995
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,190
- You know I'll tolerate this. - Really?

996
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,430
- I'll tolerate it no matter what. - Sure. Go ahead then.

997
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,430
- There you go. - That must be strong.

998
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,430
(Sipjeondaebotang, down in one go)

999
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,470
(Cilantro shake, down in one go)

1000
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,000
Jong Kook, just drink it already.

1001
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,900
- Nice. - Keep it light.

1002
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,400
(With a numb palate, Jong Kook can stomach anything.)

1003
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,300
I'll give myself the penalty if I get another one wrong.

1004
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,270
- Go for it. - Go on.

1005
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,610
(Will he be able to stomach this clear drink without a problem?)

1006
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,770
- Bottoms up. - Let's go!

1007
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,710
- You can't swallow. - I have a bad feeling about this.

1008
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,910
How can you swallow it?

1009
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,080
- Is it plain water? - It must be a good one.

1010
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,550
- Is it plain water? - It's just water.

1011
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
(He picked a cup of plain water.)

1012
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,090
- It's plain water. - Was it really just water?

1013
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,120
Really?

1014
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,590
- Was it really just water? - Yes!

1015
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,960
- How lucky can he be? - Is it really just water?

1016
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,260
Hey, they exist.

1017
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,460
(Jong Kook was lucky enough to pass.)

1018
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,530
Some are plain drinks.

1019
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,760
- All right. - Hey, they exist.

1020
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,400
Only one has been eliminated so far.

1021
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,760
(Ji Hyo tries 3rd.)

1022
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,530
- And go. - There are normal ones.

1023
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,970
- Five, four, three... - Five, four, three...

1024
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,100
- She chose cup number one. - Three...

1025
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,340
She chose Baekseju.

1026
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,100
- It's impossible to tolerate. - Cup number one.

1027
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,640
- Ji Hyo... - That's giving off a bad vibe.

1028
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
- I'm going to tolerate it. - I'm getting a bad feeling.

1029
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,210
Tolerate it. Your life depends on it.

1030
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,140
- I have a bad feeling about this. - What's with her?

1031
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,080
(Bowing)

1032
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,520
(She fails humbly.)

1033
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,380
- What was that? - Seriously?

1034
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
- What was that? - What on earth?

1035
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,950
- Did you even taste it? - Hey.

1036
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,290
It's sand lance sauce.

1037
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,990
- You're out. - Did you spit it right out?

1038
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,560
(She got sand lance sauce.)

1039
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,960
- Jae Seok, wait. - You're out.

1040
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,120
- It ran under her sweater. - You're out!

1041
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,560
It got under my sweater. Hold on.

1042
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,960
What's with her?

1043
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,530
(Trickling down)

1044
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,760
- Where did she put it? - All right.

1045
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,200
- Ji Hyo, it stinks. - Ye Eun, this is no joke.

1046
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,340
(Ji Hyo, who got a sand lance sauce shower, is eliminated.)

1047
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,840
Oh, no.

1048
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,140
You can't tolerate the bad drinks.

1049
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,870
Two have been eliminated already.

1050
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,540
(Ye Eun and Ji Hyo are eliminated.)

1051
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,310
- We're already two down. - If Seok Jin can't tolerate his...

1052
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,480
(Next, it is Seok Sam's turn.)

1053
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,940
- Seok Sam's next. - If he's out...

1054
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,010
- Number ten. - Five, four...

1055
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,850
- Ten. Same as my birthday. - Hold on.

1056
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,080
- All right. - Number ten.

1057
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Number ten?

1058
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,820
- Okay. - That's giving me a bad feeling.

1059
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,150
- Seok Jin chose number ten. - That's giving off a bad vibe.

1060
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,450
- My birthday. - This looks off.

1061
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,960
- This looks weird. - You can't change your mind.

1062
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,520
(What is this drink that everyone thinks is off?)

1063
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,120
- You can't. - Come on!

1064
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,490
- That's giving off a bad vibe. - That looks weird.

1065
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,490
It smells.

1066
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,130
No way.

1067
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,630
You should drink it all.

1068
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,830
- It must be okay. - What was it?

1069
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,630
(Smiling)

1070
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,430
It must be okay. Seriously?

1071
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,570
- You have to swallow. - But the color's off.

1072
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,770
- Drink it all. - You must swallow.

1073
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,970
- Drink it all. - Finish it off.

1074
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,340
(Don't leave any.)

1075
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,400
Drink the last drops left in the cup.

1076
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,970
(Coughing)

1077
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,840
(Smiling again)

1078
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,940
- He made a sound. - He made a sound.

1079
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,580
- You heard that, right? - He made a sound.

1080
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,310
- We'll allow that much. - Exactly.

1081
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,310
(Biological responses are accepted.)

1082
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,580
- What was it? - What?

1083
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,880
- It was vinegar. - Plain regular vinegar.

1084
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,080
(Undiluted)

1085
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,820
Vinegar? That's not so bad.

1086
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,150
- It's good for your health. - Yes, it's good.

1087
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,620
(Coughing)

1088
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,920
- Haha. - Okay, next.

1089
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,760
(Next is Haha.)

1090
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,830
The scary-looking ones might actually be better.

1091
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,190
That's what I was thinking too.

1092
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,600
Haha, like these two.

1093
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,970
- They're green juice. - Go for the scary-looking ones.

1094
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,300
Go for the clear ones.

1095
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,570
- Mine was water, remember? - Go for the scary-looking ones.

1096
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,970
All right. Five, four,

1097
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,140
(What will Haha choose?)

1098
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,270
- three, - He's being bold.

1099
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,680
- two, one. - Are you going for the green one?

1100
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,180
The green one. That's a smart choice.

1101
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,280
- Number 22. - Number 22.

1102
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,350
(He chooses the green drink that has a nasty-looking appearance.)

1103
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,980
That's it.

1104
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,180
- I went for a scary-looking one. - Gosh, it smells.

1105
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,790
- One, two, three. - One!

1106
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,520
(Will his direct approach be the right choice?)

1107
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,390
Merry Christmas!

1108
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,890
I bet that tastes good.

1109
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,460
Wait, is it tasty?

1110
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,030
It must be something good.

1111
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,130
Really? Is it good?

1112
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,800
(Flaring)

1113
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,730
- Is it a good one? - He passed.

1114
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,600
(What is this drink?)

1115
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,030
- Of course, he passed. - He passed. What was it?

1116
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,100
- Is it tasty? - It tastes like celery.

1117
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
- Yes, celery. - It's celery juice.

1118
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,600
(Celery juice)

1119
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,570
- Nice. - Let's go!

1120
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,080
(Haha, who endured the bitter green taste, passed.)

1121
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,370
That one was a bit of a struggle.

1122
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,380
- It's a tasty one. - Let's go!

1123
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,210
Gosh, the vinegar.

1124
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,080
(Side effects)

1125
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,610
Was this regular vinegar I drank?

1126
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,210
- It wasn't watered down? - It was pure vinegar.

1127
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,220
- How did you tolerate it? - How did I manage to drink it?

1128
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,580
(Who knows?)

1129
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,480
- I wasn't able to. - Let's go!

1130
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,750
- All right. - This isn't easy.

1131
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,090
(Next, Jae Seok tries.)

1132
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,420
- You know... - Number 25 is Coke.

1133
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,620
Someone already had sand lance sauce,

1134
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,790
so number 25 is Coke.

1135
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,090
- Let's move it along. - Coke isn't that color.

1136
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,160
- Number 25. - Five,

1137
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,500
- Someone had sand lance sauce. - four,

1138
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
(What will Jae Seok, who is the most squeamish one, get?)

1139
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,430
- three, two, one. - Hold on a second.

1140
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,130
- This one. - Windshield washer fluid?

1141
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,800
- It's usually that color. - Look at that.

1142
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,370
- It's number 15. - That's an odd color.

1143
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,710
- It's windshield washer fluid. - Drink it out in front.

1144
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,140
- Check that out. - You guys...

1145
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,180
You guys are such amateurs. Anyway, this is number 15.

1146
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,950
Okay, here I go.

1147
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,650
(He drinks right away.)

1148
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,550
It must be tasty.

1149
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,720
(What?)

1150
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,190
It must be okay to drink.

1151
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,360
(Professional Jae Seok falls into deep thought.)

1152
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Are you swallowing it or spitting it out?
I bet you're on the fence.

1153
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,620
That's how it was for me.

1154
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,660
Spit it out.

1155
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,790
- Jae Seok's on the fence. - That's how it was for me.

1156
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,430
(The mystery liquid that hovers in his throat)

1157
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,160
(Gulp)

1158
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,800
It must be okay.

1159
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,470
- Nicely done. - How did it tolerate it?

1160
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,230
(What is the drink that he ended up downing?)

1161
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,630
- What was it? - What was that?

1162
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,200
That was citric acid mixed with food coloring.

1163
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,070
- Gosh, citric acid? - Citric acid.

1164
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,370
(Jae Seok passed, as he endured the sour taste.)

1165
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,170
But that...

1166
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,540
- It wasn't so bad. - It's extremely sour.

1167
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,080
- Really? - And go.

1168
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,940
(Next is Ssaebssaeb.)

1169
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,940
Five, four,

1170
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,050
- Number thirty. No, number fifty. - three, two...

1171
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,880
- That is a dangerous color. - All right.

1172
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,420
- That's a dangerous color. - It's orange juice.

1173
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,590
- It's orange juice. - I need to rinse my mouth.

1174
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,750
All right.

1175
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,260
(It'll be a hit or a miss. What's this orange-colored drink?)

1176
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,220
- What is it? - Is it something nice?

1177
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,060
(Gargling)

1178
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,530
- Is it okay? - Is it tasty?

1179
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,060
- Is it a good one? Is it tasty? - Is it okay?

1180
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,860
(Ssaebssaeb even gargled it.)

1181
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,530
- Is it okay? - Is it tasty?

1182
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,800
(Groaning)

1183
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,570
Did you hear that?

1184
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,270
Hold on.

1185
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,400
(Exploding)

1186
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,640
Wait.

1187
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,440
(Groaning)

1188
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,070
- He made a sound. - This is spicy!

1189
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,770
- He's out. - It's spicy!

1190
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,770
(Stamping his feet)

1191
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,170
- It's spicy. - He's out.

1192
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,180
Se Chan's out.

1193
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,940
(Yellow but spicy?)

1194
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,380
- He's out. - What was it?

1195
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,940
That was white capsaicin...

1196
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,210
- mixed with food coloring. - It's too spicy!

1197
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,380
It's so spicy.

1198
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,920
- It was heavily diluted. - Spicy!

1199
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,320
I didn't even know white capsaicin existed.

1200
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,320
- Capsaicin? - It's really spicy.

1201
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,860
(The yellow friend has two faces.)

1202
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,590
Why did you swallow it?

1203
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,990
- You're out. - For real?

1204
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,260
- It's like this. - He's out.

1205
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,230
You can't taste a thing when it's still in your mouth.

1206
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,260
- Really? - I mean...

1207
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,460
(Scared)

1208
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,200
The spiciness hit the second I swallowed it.

1209
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,960
(The blowback)

1210
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,700
- Three of you have been eliminated. - Only one more has to go.

1211
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,730
(Only four people survived.)

1212
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,930
One out of four, right?

1213
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,970
Here we go. Who's next?

1214
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,940
(If one person gets eliminated, the 3 winners will be set.)

1215
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,040
- Jong Kook. - It's Jong Kook's turn.

1216
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
The three of us will win if he's eliminated!

1217
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,970
- Here we go! - The three of us could win.

1218
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,070
I drank cooking vinegar that wasn't watered down.

1219
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,880
(The lucky guy who picked plain water on his first turn)

1220
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,450
(Will he be able to choose a normal drink again?)

1221
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,380
I'm just going to pour it down my throat.

1222
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,880
- Okay. - It'll go straight to my stomach.

1223
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,780
(Jong Kook starts with his second turn.)

1224
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,980
- Sure. - Do what works for you.

1225
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,820
- It'll go straight to my stomach. - That's the best.

1226
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,450
- This time, - He's so good at this.

1227
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,120
I'm going for a scary-looking one.

1228
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,320
- Go for it. - A lot of them look scary.

1229
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
Drink water again.

1230
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,690
- Because... - Drink another clear one.

1231
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,830
I was alarmed when I heard they used white capsaicin.

1232
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,260
(No way)

1233
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,960
So go for it.

1234
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,500
- Let's go! - Hold on a second.

1235
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,430
(Go with the capsaicin!)

1236
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,560
That's why I should drink a clear one?

1237
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,070
- Just go for it. - Try the red one.

1238
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,400
- No. - That could be milk.

1239
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,740
I'm going for one that looks super scary.

1240
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,770
- Yes, drink one with a scary color. - Like this one?

1241
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,310
- No, not that one. - One that looks insane.

1242
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,440
- Take the one with foam on top. - Come on.

1243
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,880
- Seriously. - Hey, mister.

1244
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,110
I wonder what that is.

1245
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,180
What are our chances? That...

1246
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,010
Doesn't this look sad and boring?

1247
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,480
- That looks dangerous. - Right.

1248
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,920
- That looks weird. - Go for it.

1249
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,050
That looks dangerous.

1250
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,150
- Does it? - Yes.

1251
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,420
Number 42 looks better.

1252
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,990
- Which one? This one? - Number 42. Yes.

1253
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,320
(Food Fighter recommends no. 42.)

1254
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,490
- That looks like green juice. - That looks like green juice.

1255
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,490
- Five, four, - No.

1256
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,690
(What will Jong Kook choose?)

1257
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,530
- three, two, - Number 12 is tomato juice.

1258
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,160
- one. Choose! - Here I go!

1259
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
- Okay. - Number 42.

1260
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
- Go for it. - I'm taking a chance here.

1261
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,070
(He chooses no. 42, with the terrifying color.)

1262
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
- I hope you're eliminated. - All right!

1263
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,900
I hope you fail and I don't have to go again.

1264
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,800
(If Jong Kook is eliminated, the others will automatically win.)

1265
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,470
Fail, fail, fail.

1266
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,570
Some drinks are dark for a reason.

1267
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,310
- They're weird. - That's true.

1268
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,380
(You talk a lot.)

1269
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,980
- True. - It could be green vegetable juice.

1270
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,580
- I'll bear with it. - Drink it already.

1271
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,450
(I didn't say anything.)

1272
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,050
- I'll fight it. - Drink it.

1273
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,280
- You're intimidated. - Well...

1274
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,950
- You're scared. - Swallow or not, it's up to you.

1275
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,890
(He's getting ready in front of the bucket.)

1276
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,150
You're intimidated.

1277
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,220
(Will he be lucky again?)

1278
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,350
He's scared. Look at his face.

1279
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,390
See how afraid he is?

1280
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,020
- Gosh, the smell... - What could it be?

1281
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:25,090
- Yes, bear with it. Will you do it? - Oh, gosh.

1282
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,160
(He drank it all!)

1283
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Will you do it?

1284
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,270
(Making a face)

1285
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,570
(What is it?)

1286
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,370
(No)

1287
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,540
He did it, didn't he?

1288
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,010
(Pretending to have a toothache and playing it off cutely,)

1289
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,740
Yes, he passed.

1290
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,440
- What was it? - Coriander juice.

1291
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,680
(he drank coriander juice.)

1292
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,640
- It's coriander. - Coriander?

1293
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,610
It's the thickest one so far.

1294
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,680
(Even Jong Kook, who loves coriander, barely made it.)

1295
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,180
I like coriander.

1296
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,650
Coriander and I...

1297
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,150
- I would've spat it out. - That was too...

1298
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
(Jong Kook, Daniel, Haha, Jae Seok)

1299
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,490
(There are still 4 surviving.)

1300
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,150
Okay!

1301
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,620
Jee Seok... Oh, the coriander smell!

1302
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,720
- Gosh. - It stinks!

1303
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,790
My word.

1304
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,130
- Don't you dare breathe. - So far...

1305
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,190
It was the richest coriander taste I ever had.

1306
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,230
(The lucky guy smells like coriander.)

1307
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,660
What should I drink?

1308
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,660
Okay, then.

1309
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,970
I'll pick the one next to the vinegar.

1310
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,400
- Okay. - Number nine.

1311
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,570
- Okay. - Here goes!

1312
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,270
- Okay. - I drank straight up vinegar.

1313
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,410
- Please fail and drop out. - It looks like cough syrup.

1314
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,780
It looks like cough syrup.

1315
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,650
- Cough syrup? - It looks like cough syrup.

1316
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,550
- Here I go! - It looks like vinegar.

1317
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,050
(Can vinegar-drinking Seok Sam...)

1318
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,420
- Okay. - I can do this.

1319
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,420
(manage this time?)

1320
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,420
Do you think you'll beat me?

1321
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,650
Do you think you'll beat me?

1322
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,690
(If he fails, Jae Seok and Haha win without having to drink.)

1323
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,290
It must be fine. I can tell.

1324
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,500
(Oh, gross.)

1325
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,830
- It's so bitter! - Okay.

1326
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,100
- It's bitter! - What was it?

1327
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,270
- It's sophora root tea! - Sophora root tea...

1328
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,770
(Sophora root tea and food coloring)

1329
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,270
Mixed with what?

1330
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,670
- The color... - You couldn't handle that?

1331
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,170
I'd welcome sophora root tea.

1332
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,780
(He got eliminated after drinking sour and bitter drinks.)

1333
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,780
It was totally...

1334
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,740
- Us three are left. - Yes.

1335
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,150
- Okay! - Okay!

1336
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,510
(Jong Kook, Jae Seok, and Haha survived.)

1337
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,150
- Thanks to sophora roots. - Okay.

1338
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,450
We'll give you three a hint.

1339
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,080
(Only the 3 survivors are given a hint about the gift.)

1340
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Gosh, these...

1341
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,250
Which is Pocari Sweat...

1342
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,520
- Which is the sports drink? - Sophora root tea...

1343
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,860
Number 18 is a mix of Pocari Sweat and tomato juice.

1344
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,630
Oh, really?

1345
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,760
I was most curious about this one.

1346
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,200
- Shall I taste it? - Yes.

1347
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
- What is it? - Number four.

1348
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,170
- I passed anyway. - What is that?

1349
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,900
(He's going to try the juice even though no one made him do it.)

1350
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,700
I couldn't help but wonder what drink would be this color.

1351
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,170
- This is number four. - Number four.

1352
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,010
Let me taste it. I passed already.

1353
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,170
(Do you really have to do that?)

1354
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,170
- I know. - You know, right?

1355
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,680
(Prankster Yu must satisfy his curiosity.)

1356
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,480
- Is it a good one? - It's delicious.

1357
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,850
- It's nice? - What is it?

1358
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,050
It's Powerade.

1359
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,250
(A yellow sports drink)

1360
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,920
How is that Powerade?

1361
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,190
- Taste this. - It's number 31.

1362
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,990
- This is the worst color. - Yes.

1363
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,290
(He refused to drink this thick drink from the start.)

1364
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,360
- What number is it? - Take a sip.

1365
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,460
- Number 31. - Number 31.

1366
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,160
- Number 31. - Is it salted hairtail guts?

1367
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,360
Have a slight taste.

1368
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,900
(Curious)

1369
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,860
- Just a taste? - Just a taste.

1370
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,130
Is it a fishy sauce?

1371
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,670
- It's not fishy. - I don't fear these things.

1372
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,970
Yes, we know that. You can do it.

1373
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,940
- Have a slight taste. - I didn't smell on purpose.

1374
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,510
(They aske a brave guinea pig to try the drink.)

1375
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,200
- We're just curious. - Yes.

1376
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,670
- Try it. - I passed already.

1377
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,540
Keep it in your mouth.

1378
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,640
(Spitting it out)

1379
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,780
- What is it? - Pure lemon juice.

1380
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,980
(Pure lemon juice)

1381
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,910
- Lemon. - Lemon juice?

1382
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,950
It's lemon juice?

1383
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,780
(His curiosity is satisfied.)

1384
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,850
This isn't lemon juice. It's too bitter.

1385
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,250
Try this too. Number six.

1386
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,590
- How many must I drink? - Go on.

1387
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,460
- Hey. - I'm curious.

1388
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,930
Taste it.

1389
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,630
What is it?

1390
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,730
(And he just drinks it.)

1391
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,200
- Oh? - It must be nice.

1392
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,930
Why do you keep going?

1393
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,930
- What is it? - Why?

1394
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
(Spitting it out)

1395
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,730
- It's a no? What is it? - What is it?

1396
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,170
- Sand lance sauce. - Shoot.

1397
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,400
I can smell it.

1398
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,370
(Prankster Yu ruined his own palate.)

1399
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,540
Sand lance sauce is bad.

1400
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,980
- Gosh, the spicy smell. - It's so spicy.

1401
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,510
(It's time to receive the hint they gained...)

1402
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,180
(by losing their sense of taste.)

1403
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,480
The smell stays around.

1404
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,080
The body lotion would be nice.

1405
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,050
(Will they be able to find the gift for themselves?)

1406
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,050
- The shot glasses are yours. - I might get no present.

1407
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:36,050
Jong Kook, Jae Seok, and Haha passed the mission.

1408
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,890
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Haha earned the hint.)

1409
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,890
You can each take one of the presents...

1410
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,760
and go into the Hint Room.

1411
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,860
We'll then tell you if it's yours or not.

1412
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,260
- You tell them? - Good for you.

1413
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,030
- That's great. - They get that big a hint?

1414
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,160
- That's huge. - It's huge.

1415
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,270
It's totally huge.

1416
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,170
(It's their chance to find their present.)

1417
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,970
This is it.

1418
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,770
I want to ask about the gold key.

1419
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,370
Jae Seok, you're first. Take a present to the Hint Room.

1420
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,210
(Jae Seok chooses a gift first.)

1421
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,780
It's best to take what you think is for you.

1422
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,080
- Yes. - That's right.

1423
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,580
(Thinking)

1424
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,310
- Actually. - That's a win.

1425
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,950
The Yeongdeok snow crab is for you.

1426
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,220
Take the snow crab. You're not a fan of it.

1427
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,780
- What you don't need. - It's time to eat some.

1428
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,520
I do like Yeongdeok snow crab,

1429
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,620
- but... - It's a hassle to eat.

1430
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,190
- I can't be bothered to eat it. - It's a hassle.

1431
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,290
Ji Ho and Na Eun like it. That could be why it's for you.

1432
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,490
(His children like it.)

1433
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,200
(As Seok Jin said, are the snow crabs for Jae Seok?)

1434
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,800
- He can afford to buy it. - Yes.

1435
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,430
(He picked up a luxurious body lotion!)

1436
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,960
- Why would you take that? - Not that.

1437
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,400
It's possible that this is for me.

1438
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,070
- It's what you want. - Do you use body lotion?

1439
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,740
- Anyone. - It could be for me.

1440
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,070
Do you use body lotion?

1441
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,070
- I do. - Do you really?

1442
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,280
Isn't that for someone with rough or keratinous skin?

1443
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,780
(Jae Seok trusts his gut.)

1444
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,010
- I don't think it's that. - When it gets dry.

1445
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,950
- I'll take this. - The gold key...

1446
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,780
- Where are you going? - To the basement.

1447
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,380
- The gold key... - Where are you going?

1448
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,480
(A short pantomime)

1449
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,420
To the basement.

1450
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,250
- The basement? - He's pretty good.

1451
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,520
(Playing along)

1452
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,650
- The basement. - This is the ground level.

1453
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,760
- Is it? - Yes.

1454
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,020
- Then I'll go down... - Come back up.

1455
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,560
- and come back up. - He's coming upstairs.

1456
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,730
The stairs were too steep.

1457
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,430
(He goes to the Hint Room after a short skit.)

1458
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,760
That was a dreadful job.

1459
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,200
You don't lean forward for it. You just lower your body.

1460
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,130
(Is the luxurious body lotion a present for Jae Seok?)

1461
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,970
Okay.

1462
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,910
The only person who'd put in...

1463
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,740
this much effort and time is Ye Eun.

1464
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,450
(Jae Seok's deduction: It's what Ye Eun prepared for me.)

1465
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,810
I think Ye Eun brought this for me.

1466
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,280
Is this present for me?

1467
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,650
You asked...

1468
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,620
- if the body lotion was for you. - Yes?

1469
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:22,990
(Santa says)

1470
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,160
- If the body lotion was for you. - Yes?

1471
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,290
It is not.

1472
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:27,930
(The body lotion isn't for Jae Seok.)

1473
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
It's not?

1474
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,530
(Deep sigh)

1475
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,640
(His face gives away the result.)

1476
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,370
It's not yours.

1477
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,140
- Why are you sulking? - Yes.

1478
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,510
It's not yours.

1479
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,580
- Gosh. - It's not for you, is it?

1480
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,310
(He blew the first hint.)

1481
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,140
- I can't tell you. - Okay.

1482
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,110
- I can't tell you. - You're next.

1483
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,720
(Next up is Jong Kook.)

1484
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,410
I'll take the thing that I think is for me.

1485
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:50,050
This is definitely for me. The body lotion.

1486
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,250
(Jong Kook picks the body lotion too.)

1487
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,920
I love body lotion.

1488
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,060
Why you! Body lotion!

1489
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,060
(Why it's for me: 1. Known to love body lotion)

1490
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,460
(2. A must for tanning purposes)

1491
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,200
- I love to get tanned. - A good color. Jong Kook's legs.

1492
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,060
- Because he's a newlywed. - Here's the new groom.

1493
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,060
(3. Perfect gift for a newlywed)

1494
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,770
- I'll test this. - Yes, okay.

1495
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,700
(He chose the body lotion with strong confidence.)

1496
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,770
- Rather than take something vague. - Yes.

1497
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,140
- Not one you're unsure about. - It's best to be sure.

1498
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,970
- It's not the right size for you. - No.

1499
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,710
(He enters the Hint Room without listening.)

1500
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,140
Here I come. The body lotion!

1501
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,650
This is for me. It has to be mine.

1502
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,220
Someone who knows I use a lot of body lotion.

1503
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,920
I think Ye Eun...

1504
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,830
(Jong Kook's deduction: Ye Eun must've gotten it for me.)

1505
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,060
She's the only one who'd buy this.

1506
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,630
I think Ye Eun got this for me.

1507
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,200
You asked...

1508
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,030
(Is Jong Kook right?)

1509
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,370
- If the body lotion is for you. - Yes.

1510
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,400
(Is the body lotion for you?)

1511
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,210
(It's not.)

1512
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,410
- It is not. - Darn it.

1513
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,410
- It's not for me? Shoot. - It's not yours.

1514
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,680
Yes. It doesn't suit me, to be honest. I use cheap stuff.

1515
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,910
(Embarrassed)

1516
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,420
I use cheaper brands like Nivea that come in bulk.

1517
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,020
(Who is the body lotion for?)

1518
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,290
(Holding up the body lotion bag...)

1519
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,820
(is Se Chan?)

1520
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,260
I came to the department store...

1521
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:08,100
And bought a gift for Seok Jin.

1522
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,130
(The luxurious body lotion is for Seok Jin.)

1523
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,570
I want him to stop smelling like an old man.

1524
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,270
That's why I bought this.

1525
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,570
He sometimes smells like an old man.

1526
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,510
(A gift from the heart, wishing he would smell nicer.)

1527
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,740
Use it well, Seok Jin.

1528
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,140
There's even an exchange slip.

1529
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,580
(Bought from a department store for Seok Jin!)

1530
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,280
- They bought it. - Someone bought it.

1531
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,780
- It's not yours, is it? - What?

1532
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,420
(Will Seok Jin be able to find the gift for him?)

1533
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,580
I can't tell you.

1534
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,220
It can't be for you.

1535
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,090
(Haha goes last.)

1536
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,890
- Haha. - The underwear could be for you.

1537
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,660
- Take them if you're sure. - I don't have rough skin.

1538
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,290
- I don't think it's this either. - It's not the underwear.

1539
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,160
It's this or this or this.

1540
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,160
(Hair-styling tongs)

1541
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,260
(Body lotion, underwear)

1542
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,760
- Hey. - The electric foot file.

1543
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,200
Why do you think it's not for you?

1544
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,730
I don't want that kind of gift.

1545
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,930
You don't?

1546
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,400
- The size... - Yes, take that.

1547
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,870
(He chose the L-size underwear out of nowhere.)

1548
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,170
I'll take the underwear.

1549
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,540
- Wait. - That's not yours.

1550
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,110
- It's not for you. - Jeez.

1551
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,310
Go on inside.

1552
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,480
(Pondering)

1553
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,110
Haha. Ask about the gold.

1554
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,380
The gold? No, it's not for me.

1555
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,390
- The gold's not yours. - It's definitely not mine.

1556
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,390
The hair...

1557
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,860
- The tongs could be for you. - The hair-styling tongs?

1558
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,790
- Yes. It's that or this. - No, it's not that.

1559
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,730
- What is it, then? - You get nothing!

1560
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,060
- Are you sure? - You get nothing.

1561
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,530
(Feeling hurt)

1562
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,500
He looks sad.

1563
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,100
It's not your day.

1564
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,970
Laugh a lot and go home with nothing.

1565
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,540
I take part in the games too.

1566
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,840
- Haha, the tongs are yours. - "You get nothing."

1567
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,380
I'll ask about the underwear.

1568
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,780
(Little Ha goes in to ask about the L-size underwear.)

1569
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,080
The leopard-print...

1570
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,490
The underwear. It's my size.

1571
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,220
(Hapley)

1572
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,260
- You asked... - What?

1573
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,890
if the underwear is for you.

1574
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,590
(Is the underwear for you?)

1575
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,630
(It's not.)

1576
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,660
It is not.

1577
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,400
(Embarrassed)

1578
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,870
(Well...)

1579
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,570
- That was quick. - It's not yours.

1580
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,070
It's definitely not his.

1581
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,810
(Who is the large underwear for?)

1582
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,410
- Who is it? - The underwear is for Jong Kook.

1583
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,980
You got your hints and now we'll head to another location...

1584
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,180
(The first hint is gone.)

1585
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,110
for a Christmas meal.

1586
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,750
(No one figured out the gift from the first hint.)

1587
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,520
- Okay! - Let's move!

1588
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,250
(They head to the next location, full of speculation.)

1589
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,980
Let's go.

1590
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,750
It's not yours, is it? It can't be for you.

1591
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,820
Just in case.

1592
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,220
(Sniffing)

1593
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,930
- I stink. - It's fine.

1594
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,300
- Me. I smell bad. - That's why I didn't sit with you.

1595
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,430
You smell.

1596
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,670
No wonder. Ye Eun usually...

1597
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,000
(She fled far away to avoid the foul smell.)

1598
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,870
- sits next to Ji Hyo. - Why not today?

1599
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,940
She smells dreadful.

1600
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,010
Must you say that about me?

1601
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,140
(The sand lance is fermenting in real time.)

1602
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,140
I can smell the sand lance sauce from here.

1603
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,640
- Sorry, Ji Hyo. Don't look at us. - The sand lance is powerful.

1604
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,980
We can't take it.

1605
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,650
- It's because... - It's bad.

1606
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,020
- Gosh, Ji Hyo. It smells farty. - It does smell.

1607
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,780
Ji Hyo. You smell like a bad fart.

1608
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,990
What smell is this?

1609
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,720
- I can smell it too. - Yes.

1610
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,660
- You could get motion sickness. - Ji Hyo.

1611
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,890
She smells of some kind of fishy Korean cuisine.

1612
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,160
It makes me crave western food.

1613
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,760
- I'm sick of food I didn't eat. - Seriously.

1614
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,970
(Everyone is talking about the stink.)

1615
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,570
- It's overpowering. - It's so smelly.

1616
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,200
- I can smell it too. - Right?

1617
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,840
(Ye Eun can't focus.)

1618
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,370
- Don't you feel carsick? - But why...

1619
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,500
- That's... - If you keep smelling it...

1620
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,770
Why did you pour that on your face?

1621
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,810
- Don't you feel carsick? - But why...

1622
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,910
(Uncomfortable)

1623
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,040
- That's... - If you keep smelling it...

1624
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,470
Why did you pour that on your face?

1625
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,540
It went down her shirt.

1626
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,310
- It's confusing. - What is it?

1627
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,310
- Come on. - She's strong.

1628
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,720
- The restroom. - What?

1629
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,080
- I want to use the restroom. - For real. I'm serious.

1630
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,220
Excuse me.

1631
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,550
- Ji Ye Eun has to use the restroom. - What is it?

1632
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,820
- Do you need to use the restroom? - Yes.

1633
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,720
(Stiff)

1634
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,860
- What do we do? - She can't hold it.

1635
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,690
- Are you Song Yi? - You did eat a lot.

1636
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,730
(Haha's daughter)

1637
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,760
Are you Song Yi?

1638
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,060
(She has the bladder of a 6-year-old.)

1639
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,100
- I mean... - Are you a child?

1640
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,460
- I'm sure we'll be there soon. - Hurry.

1641
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,930
(Guardian 1)

1642
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,630
- Hang on. - We'll get there soon.

1643
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,330
Sir, how far away are we?

1644
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,770
(Guardian 2)

1645
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,470
- Two minutes. - Two minutes. How does that sound?

1646
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,640
(They'll arrive in 2 minutes.)

1647
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,500
- Can you wait for two minutes? - I think so.

1648
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,540
What do you do when Song Yi needs to go to the restroom?

1649
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,340
- "Can you wait for five minutes?" - Oh, like that?

1650
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,040
Can you wait for two minutes?

1651
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,740
- Is two minutes okay? - I don't think it's okay.

1652
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,980
Will you try?

1653
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,250
- "Yes!" - If you really can't hold it...

1654
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,580
(I'll try!)

1655
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,380
"I'll try."

1656
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,850
(Little Ye Eun starts holding it for 2 minutes.)

1657
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,350
Yes, you can do it, Song Yi.

1658
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,620
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

1659
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,790
She can't hold it.

1660
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,360
(Surprised)

1661
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,090
- Is it your stomach that hurts? - Well, it's...

1662
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,190
- She can't hold it. - No.

1663
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,360
It's a light one.

1664
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,960
- She's lying. - It's light.

1665
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,200
- That's a lie. - Right now, Ye Eun is...

1666
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,300
- She can hold in a light one. - Earlier, Ye Eun ate...

1667
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,430
- sticky rice cakes this morning. - No.

1668
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,770
- That would send a signal. - I only had sticky rice cakes.

1669
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,770
(The butterfly effect of the sticky rice cakes)

1670
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,840
- Sticky rice cakes would do it. - Sticky rice cakes.

1671
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,600
- Gosh, that would drive you crazy. - Sticky rice cakes.

1672
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,140
(Shaking)

1673
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,040
- Oh, that must've been hard. - Yes.

1674
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,910
(Because of the speed bump)

1675
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,210
- Oh, that must've been hard. - Yes.

1676
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,980
(Groaning)

1677
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,040
Hey, there are several bumps up ahead.

1678
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,350
Oh, dear.

1679
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,180
(Right then, the second crisis approaches.)

1680
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,150
- Oh, dear. - Oh, dear.

1681
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,920
- That drives you mad. - That's tough.

1682
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,050
- Oh, boy. - Something like that.

1683
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,920
Ye Eun, can you wait for one minute?

1684
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,790
(With all her might)

1685
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,720
Is it possible?

1686
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,490
- I think it's been 2 minutes. - It's been 2 minutes?

1687
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,230
We're almost there.

1688
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,530
You can't make a mistake!

1689
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,000
(She's holding it in on TV for the first time.)

1690
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,060
You're a grown-up. You're an adult.

1691
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,760
- Yes, you'd be humiliated. - Don't make me laugh.

1692
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,830
(Holding tightly)

1693
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,570
We're stopping.

1694
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,470
(Her patience is drained.)

1695
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,500
- Okay, watch out for this car. - All right.

1696
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,810
(Will she be able to hold it in?)

1697
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,740
Two minutes is longer than you think, isn't it?

1698
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,310
Oh, they're calling us over. We're here.

1699
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,580
Oh, they're calling us over. We're here.

1700
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,140
(Pale)

1701
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,880
- Is this it? - It's right there.

1702
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,380
- All right. Get off first. - We're here.

1703
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,350
Okay, I bet you're getting chills.

1704
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,420
(They arrived at the destination before she let go of everything.)

1705
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,820
- Okay, go! - Run fast.

1706
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,920
(She can't ease up yet. Will she be able to arrive on time?)

1707
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,150
- Hurry! - Go!

1708
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,520
Where do I go?

1709
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,520
The restroom...

1710
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,590
It's one floor down.

1711
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,530
The restroom is in the basement?

1712
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,570
(Ye Eun barely manages to keep her dignity as an adult.)

1713
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,430
All right.

1714
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,870
What are we doing?

1715
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,870
(The others are already at the set.)

1716
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,600
- What will we do here? - Are we using our strength?

1717
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,870
All right.

1718
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,110
- Okay, kid. Get over here fast. - Okay.

1719
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,380
Please clap for her.

1720
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,710
She held it in.

1721
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,150
- She's an adult. - All right.

1722
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,580
(Feeling proud of her)

1723
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,150
Gosh, that's nice.

1724
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,580
Yes, what a relief.

1725
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,950
(Fortunately, she narrowly avoided a disaster.)

1726
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,250
- I'm glad it feels nice. - Yes.

1727
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,820
So,

1728
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,290
this mission with the present hint and lunch on the line...

1729
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,560
(The mission with a hint and a meal at stake is revealed.)

1730
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,520
is Assassin Mafia.

1731
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:38,330
(Assassin Mafia)

1732
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,790
- What is that? - Assassin Mafia?

1733
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,130
- It sounds fun. - Yes, one random person...

1734
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,200
- will be chosen as the mafia. - Okay.

1735
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,330
(The mafia role will be randomly assigned.)

1736
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,370
Everyone, including the mafia, will wear blindfolds,

1737
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,840
(Mafia)

1738
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,940
- and you will wander the set area. - Okay.

1739
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,870
When the mafia finds a target,

1740
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,270
they will strike that person's neck with the blade of their hand.

1741
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,640
- Like this? - Can we grab them?

1742
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,940
They're doing a neck slice?

1743
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,380
Gosh, that sounds scary.

1744
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,150
So, the citizen who is attacked is eliminated.

1745
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:04,420
(Mafia)

1746
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,680
The eliminated person stops in place,

1747
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,650
crosses their arms across their chest,

1748
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,390
- and stands still. - Without talking?

1749
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,360
- Once you're eliminated? - Right. Then, you can't talk,

1750
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,490
move, or make any noise.

1751
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,790
If the regular citizens find an eliminated corpse...

1752
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,560
while moving around,

1753
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,500
they have to shout out, "Corpse found!"

1754
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,900
(Corpse found)

1755
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Then, everyone takes off their blindfolds immediately...

1756
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,770
and starts deducing who the mafia is.

1757
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,600
This sounds like fun.

1758
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,110
So, if you successfully arrest the mafia,

1759
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,810
the citizens will gain two points.

1760
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,410
If you fail to make an arrest, the mafia gets the basic two points,

1761
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,140
and they will get additional points...

1762
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,050
for each person they eliminated.

1763
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,550
- No! - It's so painful to be the mafia.

1764
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,350
- This sounds fun. - The top four scorers...

1765
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,590
will get the hint for the present and a hearty Western meal.

1766
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,820
- Western cuisine. - Four people?

1767
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,890
- We must find whose present it is. - Nice.

1768
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:46,300
(It's a big game with both a hint and a meal at stake.)

1769
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,860
Gosh, I have to win this, for sure.

1770
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:45,960
Lunch is on the line.

1771
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,500
Lunch is on the line.

1772
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,800
Gosh, should I take this off?

1773
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,470
(They put on safety gear first.)

1774
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,800
- Okay. - The two of us.

1775
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,870
- Like this? - Let's go.

1776
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,040
But if you don't know you were hit...

1777
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,840
- So, you must make it clear... - Make it clear?

1778
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,540
(The writer says)

1779
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,440
- to the other person. - I'll slice your neck very clearly.

1780
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,310
How's that? Can you not tell?

1781
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,080
- I can totally tell... - You can, can't you?

1782
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,580
(My gosh)

1783
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,110
Hey, come and do it to me.

1784
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,450
But people will know if you wear your gloves, Ji Hyo.

1785
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,680
(Ji Hyo also practices.)

1786
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,620
That's right.

1787
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,690
(Do I smell like sand lance sauce?)

1788
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,650
- Do I smell? - I can't smell anything.

1789
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,420
I think I've gotten used to it now.

1790
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,960
- The smell of sand lance sauce. - So, we'll pick the mafia...

1791
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,920
(As they walk in place...)

1792
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,360
(after putting on their blindfolds)

1793
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,930
- Like this? - Santa will come...

1794
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,930
Where is...

1795
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,090
Who? The staff? Where will you tap us?

1796
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,630
(The mafia's name will be chosen at random.)

1797
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,430
- How will the staff tap us? - He'll tap you on the back.

1798
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,460
- A tap on the back, and we start? - Tap us on the head.

1799
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,470
Then, shall we tap you on the head?

1800
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,630
(Santa will poke someone's neck and quietly let them know.)

1801
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,800
You have to make it really clear.

1802
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,140
(The mafia has been chosen.)

1803
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,770
- Okay. - Is it done?

1804
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:28,870
The mafia has been chosen.

1805
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,340
- Really? - For real?

1806
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,510
- Okay, let's start. - My gosh.

1807
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,740
(Round 1 begins.)

1808
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,880
- Start. - Do we walk around?

1809
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,310
Go slowly.

1810
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,210
(Shouting)

1811
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
- Oh, my! - Go.

1812
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,010
- Gosh, that scared me! - What is it?

1813
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,050
(Jong Kook moves around taking big strides.)

1814
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,780
- Man, that scared me. - Who is it?

1815
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,650
We have to talk. Oh, that hurts! Who is it?

1816
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,150
- For real. What? Hey! - Over there.

1817
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,250
Jae Seok, I think it's Jong Kook!

1818
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,890
(Perhaps, is Jong Kook, who's on a rampage, the mafia?)

1819
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,890
Oh, that hurts! Who is it?

1820
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,290
- Oh, wait! - My gosh.

1821
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,730
Gosh, hey. What's this?

1822
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,860
- This is Jong Kook... - Don't do it.

1823
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,500
- Is it Jong Kook? - Is Jong Kook the mafia?

1824
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,570
(Or is the mafia one of these wimps?)

1825
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,870
- Hey! - Don't do it.

1826
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,100
- Who is it? - Oh, gosh.

1827
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,070
- What? - Who isn't talking?

1828
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,470
Find the person who isn't talking.

1829
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,640
(Has Ji Hyo already been eliminated?)

1830
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,140
Find the person who isn't talking.

1831
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,310
Did you do it? Where are you? Quickly.

1832
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,480
- It's me. - Hey, it's me.

1833
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,310
(Frozen in place with her arms crossed)

1834
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,180
- Hang on. Come here. - Who is it?

1835
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,550
- Who? Here... - Who is it?

1836
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,620
(Right then, Se Chan touches Ji Hyo, the corpse.)

1837
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,550
- Who is this? - Who?

1838
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,290
- Oh, I found the corpse! Who is it? - Who is it?

1839
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:19,520
- Who is it? - I found the corpse here.

1840
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,720
- Who is it? - What?

1841
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,960
- Corpse found! - I found the corpse.

1842
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,430
Okay, please stop,

1843
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,390
- and take off your blindfolds. - Who is the corpse?

1844
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,230
(Taking off the blindfold)

1845
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,500
- I think it's Ji Hyo. - What?

1846
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,530
- Take off your blindfolds. - Ji...

1847
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,030
- Ji Hyo. - I think it's Ji Hyo.

1848
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,570
(Now, they need to figure out the mafia who eliminated Ji Hyo.)

1849
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,430
I was over here.

1850
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,130
- I found her! - It's Ji Hyo.

1851
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,500
- Who is it? - Was it just one person?

1852
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:36,370
(Which one is the mafia?)

1853
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,440
- I swear. I was only over here. - What? How many were there?

1854
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
- I was with you. - You too?

1855
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,110
I only stayed here on purpose. Do you know why?

1856
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,210
- I only stayed on the sidelines. - Were you eliminated or not?

1857
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,710
- I found Ji Hyo. - I stayed on the sidelines too.

1858
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,180
- Was there only one corpse? - Who is it?

1859
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,550
I caught her.

1860
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,550
I only stayed on the sidelines.

1861
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,710
- I was with Haha and found her. - I was...

1862
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,020
only walking around over here.

1863
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,420
But there was one person who wasn't talking.

1864
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,520
- Who? - Who?

1865
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,790
- Jong Kook didn't talk. - You fool.

1866
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,890
No, in the middle,

1867
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,490
- he grabbed me once. - Did he grab you?

1868
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,890
- I totally could've sliced you... - You could've.

1869
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,100
- He grabbed me like this, - Right? Of course.

1870
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,300
and I said, "Jong Kook!"

1871
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:06,570
(Se Chan wasn't eliminated after running into Jong Kook.)

1872
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,630
We have to talk. Oh, that hurts! Who is it?

1873
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,600
Hey! Jae Seok, I think it's Jong Kook!

1874
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,770
I said, "Jong Kook!"

1875
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,270
- He must've grabbed you on purpose. - It's not that.

1876
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,140
Jae Seok talked the most.

1877
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,140
- Right. - You know, don't you?

1878
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,380
The most talkative person...

1879
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,580
- is usually the culprit. - Jae Seok, you caught me, right?

1880
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,110
Gosh, that scared me!

1881
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:21,920
(Is Jae Seok, the one who made the most fuss, the mafia?)

1882
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,980
- Man, that scared me. - Who is it?

1883
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,050
Oh, who's catching people?

1884
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,550
- It's Jae Seok. - But I...

1885
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,490
- I was really... - It's Jae Seok.

1886
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,520
If it had been me, I would've eliminated people right away.

1887
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,790
If I caught someone,

1888
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,160
I would've sliced their necks right away.

1889
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,360
- At first... - That's right.

1890
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,130
You know it wasn't me.

1891
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,430
- I was with you the whole time... - How do I know that?

1892
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,470
If I caught someone,

1893
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,830
(Shutting down his plea for help)

1894
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,570
I would've sliced their necks right away.

1895
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,030
- Hey... - At first...

1896
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,340
I think it's Jong Kook, though.

1897
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,840
The culprit? This jerk... No, I mean...

1898
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,710
- What was that? What if... - I'm sorry.

1899
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,410
- Hey, do you know who it is? - It's not me.

1900
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,610
- You can't tell us. - Because...

1901
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,280
(Nodding)

1902
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,680
- I was... - It's him!

1903
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,310
- But basically... - You have to feel it.

1904
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,680
Basically,

1905
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,380
it's not one of the people who are making a fuss.

1906
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,720
You? You made the most fuss.

1907
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,750
(He implies that it's not him.)

1908
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,720
- Right, so I'm not it. - You talked the most.
- You did that on purpose. - It was you.

1909
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,750
The culprit!

1910
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,760
- It's the bed-wetter! - No.

1911
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,890
- No, it's not me. I was over here. - But this is strange.

1912
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,390
- No. - There was so much time.

1913
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,590
- The bed-wetter. - Why did they only catch one?

1914
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,230
- Where were you, Seok Jin? - I know.

1915
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,560
This is what I did.

1916
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:13,970
(They grow suspicious of Seok Sam because he had few kills.)

1917
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,300
- I kept walking on the edge. - Me too.

1918
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,900
- Then, why didn't you say anything? - He didn't scream.

1919
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,100
- What? - No, I heard him.

1920
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,140
- Because it's scary. - But, here's one more thing...

1921
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,310
I'm suspicious about.

1922
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:18,010
- I got Ji Hyo first, right? - Yes.

1923
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,840
I said, "I found the corpse!" But a bit later, Seok Jin said,

1924
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,580
"Corpse found!" I did hear that.

1925
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,410
- Right. - But you said you found Ji Hyo.

1926
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,850
Why didn't you say, "Corpse found?"

1927
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,350
- I said it right away. - I said it first.

1928
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:27,980
- No, I said it first. - I did.

1929
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,950
(They're suspicious of each other.)

1930
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,890
- No, he said he found her. - Seok Jin, I...

1931
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,290
- Oh, I found the corpse! Who is it? - Who is it?

1932
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,690
(Se Chan said "I found the corpse" first,)

1933
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,720
- Who is it? - I found the corpse here.

1934
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,820
- Who is it? - What?

1935
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,620
(and then, Seok Sam said "Corpse found!")

1936
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,660
- Corpse found! - I found the corpse.

1937
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,760
I said it first. So, I was like, "What?"

1938
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,660
(Seok Sam claims it's not him because he found the corpse.)

1939
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,330
- No, but after that, - Why did you...

1940
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,960
I actually said the phrase, "Corpse found."

1941
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,730
- Right, you did say that. - I said the actual phrase.

1942
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,570
(More suspicious)

1943
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,860
Is it Seok Jin?

1944
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,070
It's not me.

1945
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,570
(Scratching)

1946
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,770
- Jae Seok... - Why not?

1947
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,770
- I'm not it! I found her first! - I swear.

1948
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,310
- Why are your hands folded? - This is hard.

1949
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,540
It's not me!

1950
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,380
It's not Jong Kook either.

1951
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,480
- But I think it's Jong Kook. - No, it's not.

1952
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,550
You and me...

1953
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,010
- were here. - Jong Kook is talking a lot.

1954
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,510
Jong Kook was going around touching people on purpose.

1955
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:03,290
(Did Jong Kook keep touching people to pretend he's not the mafia?)

1956
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,080
He did grab me several times.

1957
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,990
- Yes, he did that on purpose. - But he let me go.

1958
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,950
He touched you on purpose, man.

1959
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:05,990
Look.

1960
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,060
- Ji Hyo... - We've decided, mister.

1961
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,160
You were on the left.

1962
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,790
- Ji Hyo might know... - We've decided.

1963
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,830
Hang on.

1964
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,960
- Ji Hyo... - We've decided.

1965
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,030
(Seok Sam's deduction)

1966
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,430
Ji Hyo...

1967
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,730
- Who would she know blindfolded? - Right.

1968
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,030
- It's either Ye Eun or Jae Seok, - That's right.

1969
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:22,000
(If Ji Hyo noticed it even with her eyes covered,)

1970
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,070
since Ye Eun is a girl,

1971
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,070
- she'd be able to feel it. - Right.

1972
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,800
- And Jae Seok is skinny. - Right.

1973
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,310
(it's either Ye Eun or Jae Seok.)

1974
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,070
- So, she'd know. - She would.

1975
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,310
- That's not true! - She'd know.

1976
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,780
- It's not me. Why not? - That's not true.

1977
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,310
- It's not about being skinny. - Well, because...

1978
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,650
She felt muscle.

1979
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,510
- That's how she knew 100 percent. - That's just nonsense.

1980
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,250
- I think it's Jong Kook. - He's overreacting.

1981
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,150
(You can tell by his muscular body.)

1982
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,520
No, it's not Jong Kook!

1983
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,820
- He didn't... - Jong Kook was...

1984
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,320
going around touching people on purpose.

1985
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,590
But why wouldn't I slice your neck after that?

1986
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,860
- It makes no sense. I'd be quick. - Because...

1987
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,030
- you were faking. - That's right.

1988
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,230
- At first... - Come on.

1989
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,660
- All right. Decide. - Why would I be faking?

1990
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,700
(They're suspicious of Jong Kook, who looks wronged.)

1991
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,030
That actually makes sense.

1992
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,330
- See? - It's Jong Kook.

1993
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,770
- Yes, it's Jong Kook. - No, it's Haha.

1994
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,240
(It's time to reach a conclusion.)

1995
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,970
- Let's say it. - It's him.

1996
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,540
(The final choice)

1997
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,340
- It's Haha. - All right.

1998
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,570
- This is confusing. - One,

1999
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,010
- I was with Ye Eun on the side. - two, three.

2000
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,140
- It's Jong Kook. - It's Haha.

2001
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,040
(Everyone chose Jong Kook except Ye Eun.)

2002
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,780
How could you miss his trick, Pissy-pants?

2003
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,710
- No, it's Haha. - Jong Kook touched us on purpose.

2004
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,580
(Is Kim Muscles the mafia?)

2005
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,780
- It's Haha. - He grabbed me a few times.

2006
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,350
- You're a frustrating bunch. - It's not him. Come on!

2007
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,920
- It's Jong Kook for sure. - It's not him.

2008
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,650
(Certain)

2009
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,580
- I was with Ye Eun on the side. - Seriously.

2010
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,220
- It's neither of us. - I agree. It's not him.

2011
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,820
- It could be Jae Seok. - Don't fall for it.

2012
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,890
(Suddenly?)

2013
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,190
- Is it Jae Seok? - No, it's Jong Kook.

2014
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,390
- He reached a quick conclusion. - It's Jae Seok.

2015
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,790
(They already chose Jong Kook, but they're wavering.)

2016
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,430
- It's Jae Seok for sure. - It's Jae Seok!

2017
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,590
- It's Jae Seok. - No, it's Jong Kook.

2018
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,400
(Is Jong Kook the mafia?)

2019
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,590
What if it isn't him?

2020
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,930
- It's Jae Seok for sure. - Jong Kook...

2021
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:20,960
- It's not me. - It's not him.

2022
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,960
is...

2023
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,470
Come on. It isn't me.

2024
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,130
not the mafia.

2025
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,870
(It's not Jong Kook.)

2026
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,540
Jong Kook is not the mafia.

2027
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,700
- It's Jae Seok. - Jae Seok, seriously?

2028
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,600
- I told you it was Jae Seok. - Why did he...

2029
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,310
- He tricked us all. - It must've been Ye Eun.

2030
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,710
- No way! - The mafia...

2031
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,010
- It's either Ye Eun or... - He suddenly counted down.

2032
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,710
- Ji Hyo, what's your take on it? - Who do you think it was?

2033
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,350
(The writer asks.)

2034
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,050
- Who was it? - Who do you think it was?

2035
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,280
- What, Se Chan? - Se Chan?

2036
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,450
(Suddenly accusing Se Chan?)

2037
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,880
- What do you mean? - Is it Se Chan?

2038
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:46,250
(The real mafia is...)

2039
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,490
It must've been Se Chan. Of course.

2040
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,090
- Yang Se Chan. - The mafia...

2041
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,360
was Yang Se Chan.

2042
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,990
(It was Se Chan.)

2043
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,960
- See? - Yang Se Chan.

2044
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,760
(A mocking sound)

2045
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,930
See? What did I tell you?

2046
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:57,030
(His annoying tongue ceremony)

2047
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,570
- I told you it wasn't me. - He sliced Ji Hyo's neck and...

2048
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,100
The mafia for Round One has been selected.

2049
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,100
(Se Chan's name was drawn!)

2050
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,840
(Jong Kook, a citizen, just went around touching everyone.)

2051
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,940
Who's there?

2052
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,580
Don't. That hurts.

2053
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,180
It's not me.

2054
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
(Slice)

2055
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,780
Where are you?

2056
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,750
- Who's this? - I haven't bumped into anyone.

2057
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,990
(He returned to his victim and acted like he had found her.)

2058
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,650
- Who's this? - It's me.

2059
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:18,990
Wait, I found someone!

2060
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,120
- Unbelievable. - He sliced Ji Hyo's neck...

2061
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,020
(Mafia Yang's flawless victory)

2062
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,090
- and acted like he had found her. - You grabbed me...

2063
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,330
- right when he did. - It wasn't me either.

2064
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,600
I didn't want to be attacked, so I grabbed people's arms...

2065
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,060
(Feeling wronged)

2066
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,300
- and moved around. - That's what I said.

2067
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,070
- Meanwhile, Se Chan... - Grabbing people...

2068
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,300
(Simple)

2069
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,330
- made you seem guilty. - Jae Seok.

2070
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,670
- You then accused me. - I didn't want to get attacked,

2071
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,800
- so I grabbed people's arms... - I thought it was either you...

2072
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,940
- or Se Chan. - and moved around.

2073
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,670
Nobody accused Se Chan.

2074
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,810
- I did. - Wait, I said...

2075
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,540
It's a good strategy to eliminate someone early...

2076
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,310
(The mafia's safe strategy of getting just 1 kill worked!)

2077
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,610
- Exactly. - and wander around...

2078
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,640
until another person finds them.

2079
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,480
- That keeps you under the radar. - Darn it!

2080
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,150
Because you failed to arrest the mafia,

2081
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,620
- This game is tough. - Mafia Se Chan gets three points.

2082
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:54,160
(Mafia Se Chan is the only one who earned 3 points.)

2083
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,290
- It's a tough game. - It's not easy.

2084
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,020
- See? - Let's move on to the next round.

2085
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,220
- I'll get the mafia this time. - It wasn't Jong Kook.

2086
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:57,760
(It's followed by Round 2.)

2087
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,320
That's what I said!

2088
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,730
- It wasn't me either. - Okay, let's go.

2089
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,660
- I'm only staying in this area. - Let's catch the mafia.

2090
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:01,230
(Which one will be chosen as the mafia this time?)

2091
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,260
I won't let the mafia touch me.

2092
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,460
- Stomp your feet. - I'm off limits.

2093
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,930
I won't let the mafia touch me.

2094
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,430
(Kim Jong Kook)

2095
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,700
(Jong Kook is chosen.)

2096
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,300
Same here. I'll punch whoever touches me.

2097
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,940
- Stomp your feet. - I'll go around...

2098
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,610
and teach the mafia a lesson if I can.

2099
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,870
(Santa reenters the ring to inform the mafia.)

2100
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,740
(Poke!)

2101
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,750
(Noted)

2102
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,450
I'll push away anyone who comes near me.

2103
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,120
- The mafia has been chosen. - I'll charge forward.

2104
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,690
(Round 2 begins.)

2105
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,220
- Really? - Already?

2106
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,320
- Who's the mafia? - The attack will begin.

2107
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,350
- Go! - Someone grabbed me.

2108
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,760
- Who is it? - It's me.

2109
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,190
- Jong Kook, it's me. - It's just me.

2110
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,720
(He acts cute in the beginning.)

2111
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,690
- Haha, noted. - It's me.

2112
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,460
- Haha, is this you? - Jae Seok?

2113
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,590
- Where is everyone? - All right.

2114
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,960
(The mafia is slowly moving to the right.)

2115
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,460
- Someone's approaching me! - Jae Seok? Get over here.

2116
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,500
- It's not me. - Hey!

2117
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,730
- Stop it. - Hey!

2118
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,570
(Flailing her arms like a windmill)

2119
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,170
- It's just me. - We need to win this round.

2120
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,300
- Ouch. - Who's this?

2121
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,400
- Who is this? - It's not me!

2122
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,500
Corpse found! It's just me.

2123
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,900
(Just then)

2124
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,870
- I'm Ji Hyo. - Corpse found!

2125
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,070
It's just me.

2126
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,240
Someone's got to me. What?

2127
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,340
- It's just me. - Who...

2128
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:49,540
- Someone's got to me. What? - What's going on?

2129
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,210
(Haha and Se Chan get eliminated in an instant.)

2130
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,380
- Who is this? - Who's this? Who are you?

2131
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,480
- Hey, where are you? - Hold on.

2132
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,550
Who's this? Hey, it's just me.

2133
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,350
What?

2134
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,350
(He takes out Jae Seok, making it his 3rd kill.)

2135
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,390
- Who's this? - Hey, it's just me!

2136
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:59,960
- Who's this? Oh, no. - Someone's not talking.

2137
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,860
(Including Ye Eun, he had as many as 4 kills.)

2138
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,720
- Who's this? - Hey, it's just me!

2139
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,690
Someone's not talking. Where is everyone?

2140
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,190
- Where... - Corpse found!

2141
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,060
- Pause. Please stay where you are. - Corpse found!

2142
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,030
(Seok Sam found Corpse Haha.)

2143
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,300
Stay where you are...
- and remove your blindfolds. - Remove your blindfolds.

2144
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,670
(They finally take off their blindfolds after 4 people died.)

2145
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,730
- Corpse found. Hold on. - Where are the corpses?

2146
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,370
- Who is it? - I bet it's Haha. No, Haha's dead.

2147
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,370
I'm a corpse too.

2148
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,470
- Corpse found. Hold on. - Where are the corpses?

2149
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,870
(Those remaining are...)

2150
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,870
- Who is it? - I bet it's Haha. No, Haha's dead.

2151
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:16,870
I'm a corpse too.

2152
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,270
- Let's see. - Were three taken out?

2153
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:20,240
(These three?)

2154
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,840
- Hold on. - Were three of us killed?

2155
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,680
(Though, only Seok Sam and Ji Hyo remain.)

2156
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,580
- Wait. Have you been taken out? - What's going on?

2157
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,620
(He might be exposed!)

2158
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,250
Were four of us killed?

2159
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,650
- The mafia took out four people? - Yes.

2160
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,220
- Jong Kook, I was way over here. - Hang on.

2161
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,620
- Where? - The only person who could...

2162
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,190
eliminate four people this quickly...

2163
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,920
The only person who could eliminate four people this quickly...

2164
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:38,530
(Seok Sam roughly figured it out.)

2165
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,360
- That's why I kept saying... - But...

2166
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,890
- things were getting quieter. - Hey!

2167
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,160
Jong Kook, I'm impressed.

2168
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,230
What are you talking about?

2169
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:43,160
(He tries not to laugh and acts his heart out.)

2170
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,260
- Who are you accusing? - Jong Kook, you...

2171
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,770
- You took out four people so fast! - Hey!

2172
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,170
Here's how it was.

2173
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,440
- I met everyone except Jong Kook. - Yes?

2174
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,040
- Except for Jong Kook... - We bumped into each other!

2175
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,540
(Lying)

2176
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,210
No way. You and I...

2177
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,610
Seok Jin, you and I bumped heads, remember?

2178
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,570
(Gulping)

2179
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,610
We didn't bump into each other.

2180
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,680
- Do you know who it was? - You're wrong.

2181
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,710
(She doesn't know who it is.)

2182
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,540
- Don't you know who it is? - I grabbed her.

2183
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,810
You're the one I never bumped into.

2184
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,410
- We didn't bump into each other. - Exactly.

2185
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,550
- That's why I didn't die. - Haha grabbed me over here.

2186
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,580
Jong Kook,

2187
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,620
- you said something important. - Yes?

2188
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,690
I'm still alive because you never bumped into me.

2189
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,750
(Correct)

2190
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,590
- Come on, no way. - Right?

2191
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,990
(Detective Jee made a sharp deduction.)

2192
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,190
- It's between you two. - I'm right.

2193
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,660
- That's why I'm still alive. - You have it wrong.

2194
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,590
I never bumped into him which is why I'm still alive.

2195
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,830
(Laughing)

2196
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,160
Hold on a second. I know I bumped into you.

2197
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,560
(Mafia Kook is cornered.)

2198
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,230
- I never bumped into you. - Hold on.

2199
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,830
- I definitely grabbed you. - No way.

2200
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,400
- After Jae Seok touched my head, - Do you know who it is?

2201
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,170
- He knows. - I moved back this way.

2202
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,600
- And... - I bumped into Ji Hyo.

2203
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,570
- It's Seok Jin. - Did you bump into her?

2204
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:25,940
- I did. - It's Seok Jin.

2205
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,180
- Exactly. I bumped into Ji Hyo. - It's Seok Jin.

2206
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,280
I remember hearing your voice...

2207
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,980
(It's an easy question, but Ji Hyo guesses wrong.)

2208
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,340
- as I walked by. - Right.

2209
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,580
Did the mafia smell like a seafood market?

2210
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:37,050
(Even Detective Jee is wavering.)

2211
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,750
They can't talk but...

2212
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,180
- Something's not right. - Hold on.

2213
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,690
It's weird that Ye Eun doesn't know who the mafia is.

2214
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,190
(Acting his heart out)

2215
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:39,590
The fact that she doesn't know points to...

2216
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,620
- It has to be Seok Jin. - It could be Ji Hyo.

2217
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,660
(It's time to decide.)

2218
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,130
- It's not me. - I'll trust my own gut on this.

2219
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,360
(Will Mafia Jong Kook be able to avoid arrest?)

2220
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,860
- Point at who you're accusing. - Really?

2221
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,930
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

2222
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:48,930
- It's you. - Seok Jin, it's you.

2223
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,330
- Two, three. - Two, three.

2224
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,370
- It's you. - Seok Jin, it's you.

2225
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,900
(Both Seok Sam and Ji Hyo chose Jong Kook.)

2226
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,440
Kim Jong Kook is the mafia.

2227
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,010
(They managed to arrest the mafia.)

2228
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,710
- See? In this short time... - Darn, these two.

2229
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,580
If only I had found these two sooner.

2230
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:01,010
(That was close.)

2231
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:01,840
Your greed got the best of you.

2232
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,650
He took people out without thinking twice.

2233
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,780
He killed everyone he met.

2234
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,050
- He didn't even hesitate? - He didn't!

2235
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,320
- Really? - He killed me instantly.

2236
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,580
- He took me out like this. - This is how it was.

2237
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,090
A corpse was found,

2238
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,520
and I had still not taken out two people.

2239
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,520
Then I took off my blindfold, only to see...

2240
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,090
that those two were the last ones left.

2241
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,330
Were three taken out?

2242
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:20,230
(It just had to be the two slow ones.)

2243
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,360
- Hold on. - Were three of us killed?

2244
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,000
(A chilling moment of realization)

2245
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,960
- Wait. Have you been taken out? - What's going on?

2246
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,700
Only two remained,

2247
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:27,900
(He failed because he was too greedy.)

2248
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,970
- so taking out so many people... - It's just that...

2249
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,570
- it's physically challenging. - Of course it is.

2250
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,940
- No way. - For this round,

2251
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,370
(They arrested the mafia in Round 2.)

2252
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,410
- I'm impressed. - the two remaining citizens,

2253
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,110
Seok Jin and Ji Hyo, will each receive two points.

2254
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:36,750
- You'll now play the final round. - The final round.

2255
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,710
(It's the last round.)

2256
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,780
- Sounds good. - Okay.

2257
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,480
It's not always a good idea to take out so many people.

2258
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,750
(Se Chan: 3 points, Seok Sam: 2 points)

2259
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,480
- It's not. - Exactly.

2260
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,780
(Ji Hyo: 2 points, The others: 0 points)

2261
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,280
One or two at most. That's the best option.

2262
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,720
(The mafia for the final round has been chosen.)

2263
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,890
- The mafia has been chosen. - Really?

2264
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,090
(The game begins.)

2265
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,430
- I'm right here. - Again?

2266
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,130
- Who's this? - It's me, Haha.

2267
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,700
- I'm Se Chan. - I'm Haha.

2268
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:56,030
(Who is the last mafia?)

2269
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,960
Hold on. Ji Hyo, that's you.

2270
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,730
- Jae Seok? - Yes, hold on.

2271
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:57,870
- Where are you? - I'm right here.

2272
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,370
- Ye Eun, is this you? - I bumped into Jae Seok.

2273
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,170
(What? A corpse?)

2274
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:00,600
- We bumped into each other. - Jae Seok?

2275
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,770
- I bumped into Haha. - Ji Hyo, I'm here.

2276
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,270
(Haha's already been taken out!)

2277
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,310
- Jae Seok? - I bumped into Haha.

2278
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,870
- I bumped into Haha. - Who's this?

2279
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:06,940
- Here's someone suspicious. - Who is it?

2280
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,180
(Seok Sam was near the crime scene!)

2281
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,940
It's Seok Jin!

2282
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,210
- It's not me. - I got it. Seok Jin's the mafia!

2283
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:11,510
- It's not me. - He's acting strange.

2284
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,680
(Flapping)

2285
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:12,610
- It's not me. - Hold on.

2286
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,820
- Who is it? - It's not me. Don't think that.

2287
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,050
- Corpse found! - It's only me.

2288
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,380
- Corpse found! - Hold on.

2289
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,490
(Taking off the blindfold)

2290
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,120
- Corpse found! - Did you find a corpse?

2291
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,120
- Where? - Found one right here.

2292
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,620
- Please take off your blindfolds. - It's Seok Jin.

2293
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,260
- It's Seok Jin for sure. - It's Seok Jin.

2294
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,690
- It's really not me. - Jee Seok Jin!

2295
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,330
- Jee Seok Jin. It's Seok Jin. - No...

2296
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:26,330
- It's Seok Jin. - It's not me.

2297
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,700
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

2298
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,600
- Jee Seok Jin! - No, wait. Try guessing.

2299
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,230
- It's not me. - It's you.

2300
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,470
How can it not be you?

2301
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,470
It's Seok Jin.

2302
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,070
(He throws his blindfold out of nowhere.)

2303
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,270
- Why me? It's not me. - It's Seok Jin.

2304
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,400
- It's Seok Jin. - It's not me!

2305
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,710
- One, two, three. - Jae Seok was with me.

2306
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,740
- It's Seok Jin. - It's Seok Jin.

2307
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,340
What makes you think it's me?

2308
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,640
- Hey. - We bumped into each other,

2309
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,450
- but he kept coming at me. - Hold on.

2310
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,480
- That got me wondering. - I was just locating people.

2311
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,920
(Protesting)

2312
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,680
- He came at me. - I was locating people like this.

2313
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,820
(Is Seok Sam, who was close to the crime scene, the mafia?)

2314
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,620
- It's Seok Jin. - What makes you think it's me?

2315
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,250
It's not me!

2316
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,750
- I saw him just now. - You've got to be kidding me.

2317
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,960
- Guys, please. - Seok Jin...

2318
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,320
- was clearly flustered. - It really isn't me.

2319
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,620
- I swear it's not me. - Aren't I right?

2320
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,030
- It's Seok Jin. - Your palm is sweaty.

2321
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,430
It's not me. My palms are always...

2322
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,500
- All circumstances point to him. - Hear me out.

2323
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,900
- Haha, do you know who it is? - Look at him.

2324
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,470
You can clearly see that his pride was hurt.

2325
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,970
Who could be responsible for making him feel this way?

2326
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:10,870
(Haha's expression suggests that a weakling got to him.)

2327
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,700
- That's why it's you. - It's Ye Eun.

2328
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,970
- It's not me. - Do you know who it is?

2329
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,010
It's Ye Eun.

2330
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,240
- It's not me. - It can't be Ye Eun.

2331
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,610
- It's not me. - She had bumped into me.

2332
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:15,980
- I was over here. - It can't be Ye Eun.

2333
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,250
- I was only over here. - It isn't Ji Hyo or Ye Eun.

2334
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,380
- Hear me out. - Also...

2335
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,480
That's why it's Seok Jin.

2336
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,580
Get him. It's Seok Jin.

2337
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,750
- Everyone's so good... - It's Seok Jin.

2338
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,590
(Even after his explanation, public opinion didn't waver.)

2339
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,220
- at lying now. - Just trust your gut.

2340
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,350
I think Jong Kook's first instinct was right.

2341
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,920
- Right. - Okay, in 1, 2, 3.

2342
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,020
- It's Seok Jin. - Jee Seok Jin.

2343
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,690
(The final decision is the same. Everyone chose Seok Sam.)

2344
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,160
- Jee Seok Jin... - It's him.

2345
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,290
(Is Seok Sam really the mafia?)

2346
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,330
- It's not me. - is...

2347
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,160
- not the mafia. - I told you it wasn't me!

2348
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,100
(He's not.)

2349
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,230
- It's Jae Seok. - Darn.

2350
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
- I told you it wasn't me! - What?

2351
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,870
- It's Jae Seok. - Darn.

2352
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:41,100
(Who is the real culprit who evaded the investigation?)

2353
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:38,930
- It's the locust. - No way!

2354
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:39,970
It's not me.

2355
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,600
- Is it Ji Hyo? - I'll tell you.

2356
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,840
The mafia...

2357
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:44,870
- is Ye Eun. - See?

2358
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:45,940
It was Ye Eun!

2359
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,010
- It's Ye Eun. - See?

2360
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,040
It was Ye Eun!

2361
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,080
(Ddochi tricked them all.)

2362
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,710
- I told you it could be Ye Eun. - No!

2363
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,010
- Okay. - Who's this?

2364
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,220
- It's me, Haha. - Okay, Haha. I got you.

2365
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,820
(Right away, she moves to the center.)

2366
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,720
Careful. Don't touch me!

2367
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,990
- Who's this? - It's Haha.

2368
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,920
- Who is this? - It's me, Haha.

2369
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,860
- Hold on. Take it slow. - Okay, hold on.

2370
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,860
Wait, it's...

2371
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,090
(Haha, Ye Eun)

2372
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,030
- I bumped into Haha. - Ji Hyo, I'm here.

2373
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,090
(After taking out Haha, she moved as far away possible.)

2374
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,400
Here's someone suspicious.

2375
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,230
(Jong Kook, Seok Jin, Haha, Ye Eun)

2376
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:10,970
(The innocent Seok Sam ended up getting caught by Detective Kim.)

2377
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,130
- Who is it? - It's Seok Jin!

2378
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,870
- It's not me. - I got it. Seok Jin's the mafia!

2379
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,770
- She gets three points. - Ye Eun took out one person,

2380
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,500
- so she gets three points. - Nice.

2381
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,600
Was it you?

2382
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,170
- I told you it seemed like her. - I did this.

2383
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,170
- I kept saying my name. - Seok Jin was blamed too soon.

2384
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,540
(Reenacting)

2385
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,310
- He didn't know though. - Ye Eun did great.

2386
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:22,840
Based on the points accumulated in this round,

2387
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,280
- Se Chan, Ye Eun, Seok Jin, - Nice!

2388
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,910
(Se Chan: 3 points, Ye Eun: 3 points)

2389
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,450
- and Ji Hyo will receive... - Ye Eun did great.

2390
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,420
(Seok Sam: 2 points, Ji Hyo: 2 points, The others: 0 points)

2391
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,620
- a hint for the present... - Sounds good.

2392
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,920
(The four of them got both lunch and the hint!)

2393
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,780
- and a hearty Western meal. - Lucky them.

2394
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,420
- What a bummer. - That was fun.

2395
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,990
A hearty Western meal fitting the Christmas spirit...

2396
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,360
- will be served. - Okay!

2397
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:39,660
(Today, they'll have a Christmas brunch.)

2398
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,130
This is classy.

2399
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,290
- Unbelievable. - What a treat.

2400
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,730
I bet this will be good.

2401
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,500
- This will be incredible. - I love it!

2402
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,500
(There's nothing for them.)

2403
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,200
- That looks so good. - Why do we have these on?

2404
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,330
This screams Christmas.

2405
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:50,240
(Dishes that fit the Christmas vibe)

2406
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,570
Seok Sam, why are you over there?

2407
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,740
Why else? I won my seat at the table.

2408
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,910
(Smug)

2409
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:57,480
(All the weakest ones became winners, which is unusual.)

2410
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,540
It doesn't suit you.

2411
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,450
- I'll enjoy. - I'll enjoy.

2412
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,050
- I'll enjoy. - This is tteokbokki.

2413
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,420
Gosh, that looks good.

2414
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:06,120
(Starting with tteokbokki topped with fritters like snow)

2415
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,550
- That screams Christmas. - No way.

2416
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,190
(A big mouthful)

2417
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,330
I bet it's good.

2418
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,370
(Drooling)

2419
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,060
That looks delicious.

2420
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,200
It's nice and warm.

2421
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,200
- Maybe... - This is abalone, Ji Hyo.

2422
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,400
Maybe the three of you could do something over there.

2423
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,140
(Risotto with whole abalones)

2424
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,210
It must be the real deal.

2425
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,280
(Impressed)

2426
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,080
- Is it good? - Yes.

2427
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,610
(Nudging)

2428
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,150
- It's delicious. - It really feels like Christmas.

2429
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,520
(Sharing the food makes it feel more like Christmas.)

2430
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,150
- Lucky you. - Don't they get anything?

2431
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:42,760
(To those watching, it's a Christmas nightmare.)

2432
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,920
It sure feels like Christmas.

2433
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,760
That looks so good.

2434
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,190
This is absolutely delicious.

2435
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:48,460
(It's a bummer, but they feast by themselves.)

2436
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,700
(Exclaiming)

2437
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,770
- The fried rice. - Fried squid!

2438
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,770
(The food lover is making such a big fuss.)

2439
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,340
- The fried rice. - Fried squid!

2440
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,400
Hey.

2441
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,910
- This is... - Sit still and eat, won't you?

2442
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,010
Gosh, why are you walking around so much?

2443
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,010
- Please. - This is tasty too.

2444
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,610
(The old gentleman is moving around a lot.)

2445
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,110
- I like this. - You're so tacky.

2446
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,650
You have to eat this as if you're at a party.

2447
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:07,020
- Old man! - Sir!

2448
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,990
(Old Man embraces Western culture.)

2449
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,250
- This is so good. - It really is.

2450
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,220
- Please sit down, won't you? - Old man.

2451
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,750
- Is it tteokbokki? - Why are you all being so tacky?

2452
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,460
It's all laid out to eat as if it's a party.

2453
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,860
Will you just sit down, old man?

2454
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:22,730
(At the party for 60-somethings, he's eating alone while standing.)

2455
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,660
Hey, is this Western cuisine or snack food?

2456
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:22,830
Western snack food.

2457
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,070
(Taking care of your knees is a must.)

2458
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,100
- Mister! - Like we're at a party.

2459
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,100
(Mumbling)

2460
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,400
You're supposed to eat as you walk around.

2461
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,670
Have you been to a party, Seok Jin?

2462
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,540
Why is he looking at me like that?

2463
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:36,410
(He shuts down his pitiful act just with one word.)

2464
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,840
What? Why?

2465
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:36,780
- What a cute old man. - This is good.

2466
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,110
We should be eating that.

2467
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:42,380
(The feast only half of them could enjoy is over.)

2468
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:40,680
Gosh, what is this around the Christmas holidays?

2469
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,950
So, the four of you who have won the hint.

2470
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:46,890
You will choose two of the presents this time.

2471
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,820
- Two? - You will choose two...

2472
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,860
Two?

2473
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,530
- If you go into the Hint Room, - Oh, really?

2474
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,130
- we'll tell you if it's yours. - You should've told us before.

2475
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:56,500
(This is their decisive chance to find their gifts.)

2476
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,060
- Gosh, no way. - This is seriously...

2477
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,600
But if we bring 2, will you tell us for each 1?

2478
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,930
- Yes, for each one. - You will?

2479
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:02,570
(If they bring 2, they'll get a hint for each.)

2480
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,370
- Gosh, I should've won this time. - That's nice.

2481
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:03,670
For four people?

2482
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,010
(If they use this chance wisely, they can find their gifts!)

2483
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,940
- Gosh, what should I choose? - Isn't that almost everyone?

2484
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,910
First, Seok Jin, please choose two and go to the Hint Room.

2485
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,810
(Seok Jin goes first.)

2486
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,980
Gosh, what would they have given me?

2487
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,220
Well, it's about stuff like health, longevity, and blessings.

2488
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:17,850
(The body lotion brought by Se Chan)

2489
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,850
It's probably not the shot glass. Not this.

2490
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:22,990
(Multiple presents possible, must find them all to avoid penalty)

2491
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,760
- Gosh, is it this one? - I think the shot glass is mine.

2492
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,790
Right, you...

2493
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,590
- The Yeongdeok snow crab... - The crab is mine, for sure.

2494
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,330
- That's what I think. - That was for you?

2495
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,400
(Seok Jin's intuition points to Yeongdeok snow crab.)

2496
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,830
- I'm sure they gave it to me. - Why?

2497
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,960
To invigorate me. What vibe does snow crab have?

2498
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:35,370
(Seok Jin's deduction: Is it a gift for the big brother for his health?)

2499
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,330
An invigorating meal, right?

2500
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,830
- Right. That's also true. - Right?

2501
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,300
- Wouldn't it be for longevity? - Oh, is that so?

2502
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,940
Yeongdeok snow crab.

2503
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,270
Seok Sam, you should take the Yeongdeok snow crab.

2504
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,570
I should take the snow crab and the underpants.

2505
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,340
- Yes. - Oh, that could be right.

2506
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,610
I'd never imagine they'd give me something like this.

2507
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:46,750
(Seok Jin's deduction: Is the underwear an unexpected gift?)

2508
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,050
It might've been to throw me off.

2509
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,110
They could try to throw you off.

2510
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,950
- Jong Kook got it and gave it away. - He got it from someone.

2511
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,350
He got it from someone. You saw when we raided his house.

2512
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:53,860
- Yes, we found stuff like this. - He had gotten so many of these...

2513
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,220
(There were piles of new clothes at Jong Kook's place.)

2514
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,920
Seok Jin, even if I brought them,

2515
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,690
- no one around me wears a Large. - The size is a Large.

2516
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,730
I'm sorry, but it's true.

2517
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,930
- No one here wears that size. - You must not...

2518
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,760
- know about me. - No, I know you well.

2519
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,730
(Laughing)

2520
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,760
I mean...

2521
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,200
We've known you for years, Seok Jin.

2522
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:06,930
(They haven't come to an agreement about Seok Sam's size for 15 years.)

2523
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,430
No one here wears a Large.

2524
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:05,770
It's not about that size, Seok Jin.

2525
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:06,830
I think it's yours.

2526
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,200
I'll take the Yeongdeok snow crab and the underpants.

2527
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,940
(Old Man chose Yeongdeok snow crab and underwear.)

2528
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,200
- All right. - That's right.

2529
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,270
- The underpants. - Because this is...

2530
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,040
- That has to be right. - I will be cool...

2531
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,210
- The spirit of a man in his 40s. - Another baby with my wife.

2532
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,310
- You can fit into it. - Another baby with his wife?

2533
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:20,850
(Are the two health-boosting items for Seok Sam?)

2534
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,820
Those would practically look like shorts on him.

2535
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,880
(Santa is waiting.)

2536
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,780
I don't know. I brought these, but...

2537
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:23,820
This way.

2538
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,450
Gosh, I don't know if this is right.

2539
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,620
(Walking right past without looking)

2540
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,490
The curtains in the middle.

2541
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,920
- Where is it? - The curtains in the middle.

2542
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,420
Why did you make it like this?

2543
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,890
(Befuddled before the new year)

2544
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,790
All right. These two.

2545
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,360
- Okay. Which ones... - I've brought them.

2546
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,800
(Candidate 1: Zebra-print underwear)

2547
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,300
Yes, in international size, I wear a Large.

2548
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,730
- You asked... - Yes?

2549
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:45,240
(A cheeky present hinting at a younger sibling for Hyun Woo?)

2550
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,300
if the underwear is for you.

2551
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,340
If the underwear is for you.

2552
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,840
It's not yours.

2553
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:50,480
(It's not Seok Jin's present.)

2554
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,840
It is not.

2555
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,950
It's not...

2556
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,210
Yeongdeok snow crab.

2557
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,880
I bet Se Chan...

2558
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:59,850
(At his age, he should be eating what's good for his health.)

2559
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:59,590
gave me this as an invigorating meal for my health.

2560
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:04,030
(Is it for the 60-something who wants to become younger?)

2561
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,320
You asked if the snow crab is for you.

2562
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,330
"It is."

2563
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:08,500
(The snow crab isn't his either.)

2564
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,090
It is not.

2565
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,460
I must not have any presents.

2566
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,570
(Seok Jin leaves without finding anything.)

2567
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,810
(Food Fighter carries the Yeongdeok snow crab inside.)

2568
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:17,470
There.

2569
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,140
I think Se Chan got this for me.

2570
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,270
Why do you think so?

2571
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,010
Well, I was sick...

2572
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:26,610
(Ye Eun's deduction: It's for Food Fighter who was sick.)

2573
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:26,510
and I like to eat, so to wish me good health?

2574
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,120
(Is it really a present for the crab lover?)

2575
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,050
You asked if the Yeongdeok snow crab is for you.

2576
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:31,720
It is not.

2577
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,220
(It's not for Food Fighter either.)

2578
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,260
(Then, who could the Yeongdeok snow crab belong to?)

2579
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,620
Isn't it mine?

2580
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,290
(The sea?)

2581
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:43,260
This is Yeongdeok. So...

2582
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,700
(Ji Hyo is standing in front of the sea in Yeongdeok?)

2583
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,600
For Jae Seok's...

2584
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,900
For Jae Seok's health...

2585
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,740
It's good for your body and health. From the sea...

2586
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,570
(The Yeongdeok snow crab was Jae Seok's present!)

2587
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,840
Jae Seok really hates things that are bothersome.

2588
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,910
In order to give him...

2589
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,650
the snow crab, which he has to open to eat...

2590
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:02,020
I don't think the snow crab is mine. I find it bothersome,

2591
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,520
(When they first revealed the presents)

2592
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,480
- having to open crab to eat it. - You don't like it.

2593
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,750
Me too. I hate it so much.

2594
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,050
They might have given it to you because you find it bothersome.

2595
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,920
(A present that contains...)

2596
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,560
(Ji Hyo's prank and love)

2597
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,990
I enjoyed it so much. That's why I'm giving it to you.

2598
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,860
You asked if the Yeongdeok snow crab is for you.

2599
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,560
(Therefore, Ye Eun's first guess was a total miss.)

2600
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,860
It is not.

2601
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,760
This is enough for me.

2602
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,100
This is from Jae Seok, because I...

2603
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,730
(What she's actually curious about is the gold.)

2604
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,700
don't have money.

2605
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,740
I think he gave me this because I don't have money.

2606
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,470
You asked if the gold key is for you.

2607
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:28,140
(Is the gold key for Ye Eun?)

2608
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,410
It must be mine! Is it?

2609
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,110
(Is this present really Ye Eun's household fund?)

2610
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,510
You asked if the gold key is for you.

2611
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,350
It is not.

2612
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,720
Gosh, what is this?

2613
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,150
- Isn't it mine? - No.

2614
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,390
(They fail to find the owner of the gold again.)

2615
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,130
Ye Eun, were you right?

2616
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:51,930
(After Seok Jin, Ye Eun failed in her deduction as well.)

2617
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,600
- Her face says that she wasn't. - Ye Eun, were you right?

2618
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,100
- Put it up here. - No.

2619
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,170
Well, I don't know.

2620
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,030
- Hey, she must've been right. - All right.

2621
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,740
Okay, Ji Hyo, you may choose two...

2622
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,440
(Next up is Ji Hyo.)

2623
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,770
- and go inside. - Right, Ji Hyo.

2624
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,670
I'll take the hair-styling tongs and the shot glass.

2625
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:02,940
(She chose the hair-styling tongs and shot glasses.)

2626
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:01,210
- I think the shot glass is right. - Yes.

2627
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,040
- The tongs and the shot glass. - Oh, dear.

2628
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,210
- Am I wrong? - Oh, dear.

2629
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,310
- Well, it's highly likely. - These two.

2630
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:06,680
(It's highly likely!)

2631
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,320
- These two. - Higher odds...

2632
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:09,220
(Ji Hyo is known to enjoy alcohol, especially beer.)

2633
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,850
It's better to go with something with higher odds.

2634
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,190
- Oh, how cute. - Hey, Ji Hyo!

2635
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,120
(Talking to the beer)

2636
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:15,220
(All of the members know about Ji Hyo's love of beer.)

2637
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,020
- Gosh, really? - This isn't right, is it?

2638
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,090
- For real, Ji Hyo? - What's up with her?

2639
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,430
- Did you bring those? - You opened up an office...

2640
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,360
(Was the shot glass set a present for Ji Hyo?)

2641
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,290
Well, "Drink in a healthy way."

2642
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,260
You asked if the shot glass set is for you.

2643
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,060
(The NMK shot glasses...)

2644
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,330
It is not.

2645
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:26,900
(weren't Ji Hyo's present.)

2646
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,370
- It's not? - No, it's not.

2647
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,100
- It's not? - No.

2648
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,600
- Then... - The hair-styling tongs.

2649
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,170
As for this, Seok Jin...

2650
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:35,780
(Then, are the hair-styling tongs a present for her hair?)

2651
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,570
must've given it to me so I'd take care of myself.

2652
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,450
You asked if the hair-styling tongs are for you.

2653
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,510
They are not.

2654
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,750
(The hair-styling tongs aren't for Ji Hyo either?)

2655
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,320
There must not be any presents for me.

2656
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:43,350
Oh, I must not have gotten any presents.

2657
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,420
(Then, who is this present for?)

2658
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,560
(Haha is shopping online.)

2659
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:49,020
- Haha, what present will you give? - I will...

2660
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,420
give Seok Jin...

2661
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,290
hair-styling tongs.

2662
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:56,230
If he uses hair-styling tongs... You know what I mean?

2663
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:58,970
(The hair-styling tongs are also for Seok Jin, like the body lotion.)

2664
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:59,030
Older women often get perms.

2665
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,140
He grew his hair out a lot, but he can't really...

2666
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,300
hide that his hair is thinning.

2667
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,140
Still, it's better than before,

2668
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,210
but I was hoping he'd leave the hair powder behind.

2669
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,910
Did you take hair from the back to the front?

2670
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:14,780
(Leaving behind his loaned hair from the back to fill the front)

2671
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,280
- I told you, that's not true! - Borrowed hair.

2672
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,680
- Borrowed hair. - Bringing it all forward.

2673
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,580
He called this hairstyle borrowed hair.

2674
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,220
- Borrowed hair. - He pulled every hair he could.

2675
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:20,660
(A present wishing for Seok Jin's return to youth)

2676
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:20,620
I thought hair-styling tongs might be better than hair powder.

2677
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,660
- Did you find yours, Ji Hyo? - What?

2678
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,390
- She did. Her face is... - She did.

2679
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,160
- Pass. - No, I...

2680
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:30,230
(Will Seok Jin figure out his gifts?)

2681
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,860
I can't tell you,

2682
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,700
- but I think my guess is right. - You don't look so happy.

2683
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,900
- Next, Se Chan. - Ssaebssaeb.

2684
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,270
(Se Chan goes last.)

2685
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,040
First of all, the gold. That and...

2686
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,970
(He chooses the gold first.)

2687
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,440
Gosh, what could it be?

2688
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,040
But that foot file... It might be related to my feet.

2689
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,940
- No! - Gosh, his feet stink.

2690
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,880
(Is it for Se Chan, who is known for having smelly feet?)

2691
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,950
- Yes, right. - Since there are two, right?

2692
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,450
(Gold and a foot care device)

2693
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:46,680
- Gosh, this? - This way.

2694
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:49,950
(Is Se Chan's gift among these?)

2695
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,720
Okay. Santa Claus.

2696
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:53,650
(Candidate 1: Electric foot file)

2697
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,990
Because of rumors about the bad state...

2698
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:57,020
of my feet, I think they gave me this.

2699
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:01,200
(Could this be a gift to stop his feet from smelling?)

2700
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:01,930
You asked if the electric foot file is for you.

2701
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,400
- It is not. - It's not?

2702
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,940
Okay. I don't need this.

2703
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:10,710
(Spinning)

2704
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:13,410
Okay, the gold. It's my birthday.

2705
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:14,410
(The real deal is the gold!)

2706
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,140
You know? For my birthday,

2707
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,250
an older friend would feel awkward giving me cash. Right?

2708
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,210
You know, it would be awkward to hand me cash.

2709
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:24,050
You asked if the gold key is for you.

2710
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,650
(Today's highlight is the gold key.)

2711
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:29,120
(Is it Se Chan's birthday gift?)

2712
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:30,090
Knowing that it's my birthday today, I think the gold is mine.

2713
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,030
You asked if the gold key is for you.

2714
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,330
It is not.

2715
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,130
(It's not for him.)

2716
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,200
It is not.

2717
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:40,070
(Bitter)

2718
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,430
This is kind of upsetting.

2719
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,900
(The bigger his expectations, the bigger his disappointment.)

2720
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:43,840
Hey, man... It's upsetting.

2721
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,770
I don't even want them.

2722
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:47,610
(I don't even want to receive any other gifts!)

2723
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:49,480
Gosh, I don't want the Yeongdeok snow crab.

2724
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,450
It's kind of sad, though. Today is my birthday.

2725
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:54,220
(He's about to cry.)

2726
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,480
Happy birthday.

2727
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:58,950
(Se Chan...)

2728
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:02,820
(just kept laughing.)

2729
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,490
- Did you find any? - This is just...

2730
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,130
- Did you find any? - I can't tell you.

2731
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,960
(He's neither laughing nor crying.)

2732
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,830
- He must've found some. - Oh, boy.

2733
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:12,770
You've all checked the hints. We'll move to the next location.

2734
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:14,000
(In the end, none of them could find their gifts.)

2735
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:13,830
- Okay. - Yes.

2736
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,400
- Okay. - No failure.

2737
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:16,640
(They're moving with a heavy heart.)

2738
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,400
- What? - What are you saying?

2739
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,540
- By the way, Seok Jin, - I won't...

2740
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,940
- I don't think you had presents. - be discouraged.

2741
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,310
- I don't think so either. - I think I also...

2742
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:22,140
- didn't have any presents. - I don't think I have any.

2743
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,580
- I don't think I have any either. - Gosh, I'm so disappointed.

2744
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,510
(In the Hint Room, all their guesses were wrong,)

2745
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,850
- I don't have any presents either. - None for me.

2746
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:26,680
- I don't have any. - I'm so disappointed.

2747
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:30,520
(and their Christmas hopes were crushed.)

2748
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,320
I thought I'd get one since today is my birthday.

2749
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,350
- My gosh. - I thought I'd get one too.

2750
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:30,890
- I didn't know about your birthday. - Right.

2751
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,720
Se Chan should've gotten one.

2752
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:33,490
(It's his birthday.)

2753
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,720
I thought there would be something,

2754
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,290
but after seeing I didn't have any, "Gosh, forget it."

2755
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:36,560
- That's what I thought. - Right, Se Chan's birthday present.

2756
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,890
- Se Chan. - I think Ye Eun would have one.

2757
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:41,930
(Instead of cheering them up, it's damaging their friendship.)

2758
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,660
- I think so too. - No, I didn't get any.

2759
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,500
- Gosh, I was totally... - I'm sure Ye Eun has one.

2760
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,760
I was totally disappointed.

2761
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,970
I'm pretty sure today is a party for Seok Jin.

2762
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,600
- They all seem to be Seok Jin's. - No.

2763
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,100
The first one, the foot file, is his.

2764
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,140
- Then, you need lotion after that. - Right.

2765
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,240
(Seok Jin's expected list: Electric foot file)

2766
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,310
(Body lotion)

2767
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,440
- The hair. - Then, the hair thing.

2768
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:58,110
(Hair-styling tongs)

2769
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,010
- From the back of your head... - He has to add volume...

2770
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,510
- to the back of his head. - To add volume.

2771
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:57,750
Then, what else is there?

2772
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,750
- The Yeongdeok snow crab. - The Yeongdeok snow crab...

2773
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,510
(Yeongdeok snow crab)

2774
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,350
- That's for his health. - for his health.

2775
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,120
- Hey, but this... - I don't think I have any.

2776
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:04,390
(Among all the wonderful gifts, the only thing he's curious about...)

2777
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,420
- I probably don't have any. - In the variety show world,

2778
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,920
the fact that someone can bring gold...

2779
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,120
I know. That has to be someone rich.

2780
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:09,590
(is the gold.)

2781
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,020
- A rich person. - That's not an easy feat.

2782
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,260
- Really... - That's Jae Seok, 100 percent.

2783
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,490
(I'm sure Jae Seok brought it!)

2784
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,460
- Here's what I thought. - It is Jae Seok.

2785
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,060
(Did Jae Seok bring the gold?)

2786
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,130
- That gold is... - Yes?

2787
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,900
That gold is a prize from Running Man.

2788
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,570
(In my opinion)

2789
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,470
That's right. I'm sure that's true.

2790
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:21,870
- Still, bringing gold... - So, only Ji Hyo can bring...

2791
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:22,900
that kind of gold.

2792
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,140
Ji Hyo has gotten the most gold.

2793
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,840
- Still, bringing gold... - So...

2794
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,980
- Ye Eun... - The gold is from Jong Kook.

2795
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,180
(Or it could be Jong Kook!)

2796
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,580
Have you thought about who could give someone gold?

2797
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:32,750
(They think Stingy Kook might've brought the gold!)

2798
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,350
- I think it's from Jong Kook. - The gold...

2799
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,510
- Jong Kook or Jae Seok. - I'm sure it's Jong Kook.

2800
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,650
But we don't have to guess who the present is from.

2801
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:36,220
(What matters is who will get the gold.)

2802
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,980
- Just my own... - That doesn't matter.

2803
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,350
- Ye Eun was... - I've checked.

2804
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,250
(Does the gold belong to Ye Eun?)

2805
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:39,320
- a bit sick before. - Do we have a chance to check?

2806
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,160
(It turned out it wasn't hers.)

2807
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,090
- No, I checked. - One last chance.

2808
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,120
I think Jae Seok gave Se Chan gold.

2809
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,130
The gold? I checked earlier.

2810
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,630
(It turned out it wasn't his.)

2811
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,160
No, I don't think that's right.

2812
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,300
(Who is the gold for then?)

2813
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,400
I checked.

2814
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,130
I thought it was for me since it was my birthday.

2815
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,170
- I see. - Seriously.

2816
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,600
- I forgot about your birthday. - Exactly.

2817
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,770
It should've been for Se Chan.

2818
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:56,140
Se Chan. My Se Chan.

2819
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,710
Seriously. It's his birthday.

2820
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:58,810
- You didn't get me one, did you? - What?

2821
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,070
- You didn't get me one, did you? - I bet there's one for Ye Eun.

2822
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,380
- What do you mean? - There are no presents for me.

2823
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,010
- Your nose. - What?

2824
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,350
- What didn't I get you? - I was totally disappointed.

2825
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:08,320
(Why did Se Chan suddenly burst into laughter?)

2826
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,310
- What is it? - There are no presents for me.

2827
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,080
- What is it? - There must be a present for you.

2828
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,080
What?

2829
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,820
- You're wearing so much makeup. - What?

2830
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:13,490
- Are you in a play? - Usually...

2831
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,090
- Why? - On your nose,

2832
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,520
you're wearing so much foundation.

2833
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,830
- What's wrong with him? - What's wrong with you?

2834
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:19,160
(Cakey)

2835
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,160
- He did his own makeup. - Why do you care so much...

2836
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,130
- Hey, Ye Eun! - about your looks?

2837
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,660
- Did Ye Eun do your makeup? - Look at his nose.

2838
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:25,900
(Ye Eun made him look like a 40-something trying to look young.)

2839
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,700
- You said I looked good. - Young Forty.

2840
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,900
Don't believe what Ye Eun says.

2841
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,600
She drew fat pockets under my eyes one time.

2842
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,500
(Do you know Ye Eun drew fat pockets under my eyes one time?)

2843
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:31,370
- I was shocked when I saw them. - Really?

2844
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,810
(The 60-something was a victim as well.)

2845
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,910
Ye Eun is unbelievable.

2846
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:34,910
- These days... - You're a bad girl, aren't you?

2847
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:36,740
- It'll look pretty on TV. - Really?

2848
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,280
- That makeup? - She's a total fox.

2849
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,780
- I'm more like a bear. - She's not a fox.

2850
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,420
She's a bedwetter!

2851
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,050
Ye Eun, did you use the restroom before getting on the bus?

2852
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,050
I mean,

2853
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,620
- the restroom... - We won't stop the bus again.

2854
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,420
- She'll ask for a restroom break. - Say it now.

2855
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,060
- It isn't too late. - I used the restroom.

2856
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,160
- Are you sure? - Yes.

2857
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,230
Okay.

2858
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,860
Seok Jin won't be able to hold it in.

2859
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,000
(He suddenly worries about his older friend.)

2860
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,160
- Seok Jin... - It's urinary incontinence.

2861
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,900
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin has residual urine.

2862
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:00,700
- I don't have residual urine. - Pee and dry your pants.

2863
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,270
- Seok Jin. - I'm in perfect health.

2864
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,240
Maybe that's why underwear is for you.

2865
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,570
Maybe that's why.

2866
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:09,140
(They seriously suspect that he has a urinary problem.)

2867
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,210
- Is that so? - I think it's his.

2868
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:09,780
Everyone,

2869
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,510
- it's a misunderstanding. - Is it a misunderstanding?

2870
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:12,650
- Is that so? - It isn't like that.

2871
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:15,420
You made it sound like I had residual urine.

2872
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:18,020
(The big brother is still fine, and they arrive at the next location.)

2873
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,580
I don't have residual urine.

2874
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,850
- What is it this time? - What will we do?

2875
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:19,920
- What is it? - What will we do?

2876
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,060
The weather is nice.

2877
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,860
(Seven gifts appear again in Dosan Park,)

2878
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,660
- The presents are spread out. - What will we do?

2879
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,690
What is this for?

2880
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:24,790
It has the Christmas vibes.

2881
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,960
(filled with Christmas spirit.)

2882
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:26,830
Christmas is coming.

2883
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,460
- I mean... - Now, I don't even want a present.

2884
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:32,100
(The members are sick of it now.)

2885
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,400
- None of them are mine. - Seriously.

2886
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,130
- Seriously, I don't even want it. - I don't think...

2887
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,070
- I don't think anything is mine. - Nothing is mine.

2888
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:37,100
(The gift set is like a nightmare.)

2889
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:36,600
- Nothing is mine, - Nothing is mine either.

2890
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,810
so I'm not even happy about seeing these presents.

2891
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,510
These crabs will go bad.

2892
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,810
(Yeongdeok snow crab)

2893
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:41,210
- Nothing is mine. - Nothing is mine.

2894
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,580
- I'm 100 percent sure. - It looks like...

2895
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:47,280
- you're struggling to guess. - You need to give us information.

2896
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,950
- I'll give a bonus hint. - What?

2897
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,080
- Okay. - Okay.

2898
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,490
- If you pick a single present, - A single present?

2899
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:56,190
we'll tell you who brought it.

2900
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,520
- Jong Kook! Gold! - This one?

2901
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,560
- Electric foot file. - Gold.

2902
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,790
- Go with gold. - This one?

2903
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:03,230
(The origin of the gold, which is practically the only gift)

2904
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:00,890
- Let's go with gold. - Gold.

2905
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,060
Gold.

2906
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,600
- We'll tell you who brought gold. - Okay.

2907
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,040
- It's Ji Hyo or Jae Seok. - It's Jae Seok.

2908
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:11,340
(Who brought the gold key?)

2909
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,100
- Ji Hyo. - I think it's Ji Hyo.

2910
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,110
- Is it Ji Hyo? - Ji Hyo.

2911
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:13,540
The one who brought the present is...

2912
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:14,580
It's Ji Hyo.

2913
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:18,010
(The one who brought gold!)

2914
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:17,540
The one who brought the present is...

2915
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:21,120
- Jong Kook. - What?

2916
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,280
- What? - My goodness.

2917
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,450
- You? - Why didn't you say anything?

2918
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,650
- "You?" - Why so suddenly?

2919
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,220
- What? - My goodness.

2920
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:31,130
(They're shocked to find that the gold is from Stingy Kook.)

2921
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,260
You?

2922
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,260
- You? - Why didn't you say anything?

2923
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,060
- "You?" - Why did you bring it?

2924
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,890
(Confused)

2925
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,890
- Why? - Well, it's...

2926
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,130
the year-end.

2927
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,130
(Jong Kook, who even reuses wet wipes, brought gold?)

2928
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,100
- You're so... - I brought it as a present.

2929
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:39,570
I'll give...

2930
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:41,440
a lucky key...

2931
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,070
that's 1.875g of gold.

2932
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:45,240
I didn't know how to buy things on the internet.

2933
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:50,440
(He even learned how to buy things on the internet.)

2934
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,640
I asked him to teach me.

2935
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,910
- How to shop on the internet? - Yes.

2936
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,310
- What? - What's this?

2937
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:53,610
(When gold got revealed for the first time,)

2938
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:53,780
- Why did anyone bring it? - Is it gold?

2939
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,780
(he pretended to be the most surprised.)

2940
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,920
- Is it gold? - Let's see it.

2941
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,290
- How many grams is it? - Did a member actually turn it in?

2942
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:00,390
- No way. - How many grams is it?

2943
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,090
- It's 1.875g. - It's still a lot.

2944
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:06,490
(He asked how many grams it was since the members were too shocked.)

2945
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:05,190
- Then it costs about 400 dollars. - It costs about 400 dollars.

2946
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,360
I think it's from the richest member.

2947
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,900
- Jae Seok. - It's from Jae Seok.

2948
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,060
Jae Seok, you don't disappoint.

2949
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,670
(When people thought it was from Jae Seok,)

2950
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,800
- Jae Seok. - Jae Seok, you're cool.

2951
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,400
(he made lighthearted comments.)

2952
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,170
- Okay. - Stop being...

2953
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,170
It isn't from me.

2954
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:19,470
(Jae Seok was 100 percent serious.)

2955
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,870
- His face tells me he got caught. - Come on.

2956
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,110
- It isn't from me. - You're so generous.

2957
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:22,380
- Jae Seok doesn't disappoint. - This is a proper present.

2958
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:24,750
(Jong Kook was the surprise Santa who brought gold.)

2959
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,340
- It's the year-end. - You're so...

2960
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,650
- I brought it as a present. - Jong Kook.

2961
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,720
(Jong Kook brought gold, so...)

2962
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:29,080
- Hold on a second. This one... - Then whose present is it?

2963
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,720
- Then that gold isn't mine. - Hey.

2964
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,090
Then that gold isn't mine.

2965
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:33,520
- It must be mine. - Hold on. It's from Jong Kook.

2966
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,020
- Jong Kook, it must be mine. - No, it isn't Seok Jin's.

2967
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:37,490
(If it's from Jong Kook, is it for Seok Jin?)

2968
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,830
You wanted me to sell it and eat something tasty.

2969
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:39,490
- This is the 60th birthday special. - He gave a present in advance.

2970
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:40,960
- He gave a present in advance. - It's for the 60th birthday.

2971
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,960
- It must be Seok Jin's. - Jong Kook said so.

2972
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,830
(Is it what Jong Kook got for Seok Jin's 60th birthday?)

2973
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,970
- I said, "I'll take this one." - Is this...

2974
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,530
- Seok Jin's present? - It's my present.

2975
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,870
- Seok Jin, don't move too much. - The age of 64.

2976
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,100
- Watch your blood pressure. - Let's go.

2977
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,410
Seok Jin, your calves are like your second heart.

2978
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:54,310
(There's a hint of worry in his snarky jokes.)

2979
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,440
- Is it a blanket? - Will you put it over him?

2980
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,210
- What's this for? - That's sad. Don't do that.

2981
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,810
(He gets sensitive when there's a white blanket over Seok Jin.)

2982
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,910
Don't close your eyes.

2983
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:02,680
(Did Jong Kook prepare gold since he was worried about him?)

2984
01:12:58,910 --> 01:12:59,950
- Okay. - Relax.

2985
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:00,950
Seok Jin.

2986
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:03,580
There's a reason behind everyone's present.

2987
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:07,220
(The writer says)

2988
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,650
- There must be a reason. - Jong Kook's reason was touching.

2989
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:08,090
- Really? - Jong Kook's reason was touching.

2990
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,690
- If it's touching, it's mine. - If it's touching...

2991
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,060
- If it's touching... - That's right.

2992
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:17,230
(The reason is touching? Is it for Haha he both loves and hates?)

2993
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,160
- If it's touching... - It might be for Haha...

2994
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,600
- since they work together. - No.

2995
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,930
If it's touching, it's mine.

2996
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,660
If it's touching, it's Haha's.

2997
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,670
Choose one.

2998
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:19,700
Work with Jong Kook forever...

2999
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,730
- and run an unsuccessful business. - This is hard.

3000
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:22,840
Not see Jong Kook forever and run a successful business.

3001
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,340
(Work with Jong Kook forever and run an unsuccessful business.)

3002
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,170
Isn't it this one?

3003
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,080
- Why? - I mean it.

3004
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,080
(Haha's friendship with Jong Kook is more valuable than money.)

3005
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,240
- It's a cliched answer. - I mean it.

3006
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,910
I can earn money through other means.

3007
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,510
(Did Jong Kook give gold to Haha, his forever brother?)

3008
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,650
Not seeing him...

3009
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,280
If it's touching, it's mine.

3010
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,620
I'm suddenly tearing up.

3011
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,120
Same here.

3012
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,390
- Emotions well up in my heart. - It's mine.

3013
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,020
- It feels hot. - I'm 100 percent sure.

3014
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,890
- I can't give any hints. - Why did you do that?

3015
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,930
(Will one of the two get the gold?)

3016
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:47,160
- I can't give any hints. - For goodness' sake.

3017
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,760
Everyone, do something about him.

3018
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,060
- Why? - Why?

3019
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,870
When I said, "Emotions well up in my heart,"

3020
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,170
he said, "Go to a hospital."

3021
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:54,640
Isn't it ridiculous?

3022
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,170
It feels hot.

3023
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:58,240
(Emotions welled up in his heart because he thought it was his.)

3024
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,370
- I can't give any hints. - Why did you do that?

3025
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:59,270
Seok Jin, go to a hospital.

3026
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:01,180
- Go to a hospital. - You punk.

3027
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,580
- I was talking about my emotions. - It can be dangerous.

3028
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:06,610
(Ruining the heartwarming mood)

3029
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,050
- Emotions were welling up. - Suddenly...

3030
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,350
Perhaps he was worried about you.

3031
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:09,750
- Suddenly, you felt... - That's right.

3032
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,250
Isn't Seok Jin hilarious?

3033
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,250
"Everyone, say something."

3034
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,420
He tells on Jae Seok.

3035
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,860
We'll have a mission...

3036
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,060
for a crucial hint on the presents.

3037
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,290
This is important.

3038
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:22,860
The name of the mission is Pop in One Breath.

3039
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,130
(Mission 3: Pop in One Breath)

3040
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,160
- Pop in One Breath? - Yes.

3041
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,630
You'll put your lips against the hole of the cup...

3042
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,170
that has a glove attached and blow in one breath.

3043
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:31,740
The number of the glove fingers that uncurl completely...

3044
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,910
(5 points)

3045
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,040
will be your score.

3046
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,940
- It'll be hard. - Like this?

3047
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,580
Yes. You can blow only once.

3048
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,180
People with the top three scores will receive a hint.

3049
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:41,550
- You won't ask which one is yours. - Okay.

3050
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,620
(This hint...)

3051
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,550
You'll ask how many presents are yours.

3052
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,820
(reveals the number of gifts.)

3053
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,590
- It's crucial. - It's a very nice hint.

3054
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:49,320
(They can check how many gifts they got.)

3055
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:46,650
I have to win.

3056
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,890
It's very important.

3057
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,190
It's nice.

3058
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:51,690
You blow into this hole.

3059
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:53,630
(The hole for blowing)

3060
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,800
I have amazing lung capacity.

3061
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,700
(The man with amazing lung capacity, Singer Kim goes first.)

3062
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:58,970
All right.

3063
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:00,630
Let's uncurl five fingers for a high-five.

3064
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,540
- Four. - Four.

3065
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,470
(4 fingers)

3066
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:08,080
(He uncurls 4 fingers with his great lung capacity.)

3067
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,770
- Four. - Four.

3068
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,980
It's about to burst.

3069
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,540
Four.

3070
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:11,850
(His lips turn white.)

3071
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:13,950
I feel dizzy.

3072
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,350
(Jae Seok, Haha, and Ye Eun go next...)

3073
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,480
One, two, three. Three.

3074
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,450
(and get 3 fingers.)

3075
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,620
Three.

3076
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,990
- More. - No, don't send it sideways.

3077
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,620
(Popping)

3078
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:22,720
Did I do it wrong?

3079
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,290
(Ji Hyo only got 2.)

3080
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,090
- Two. - Two.

3081
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,190
- Do well. - Make it short and strong.

3082
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:27,330
(How will the oldest member, Seok Jin do?)

3083
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,360
(Full)

3084
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,100
(Mr. Chungju Jee has the main vocalist's lung capacity.)

3085
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:35,740
(How many fingers uncurled?)

3086
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,470
- They didn't pop out. - They didn't pop out.

3087
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,710
(Only the bottom part became big.)

3088
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,170
They didn't pop out.

3089
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:42,040
- One. - One.

3090
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,780
- One. - Is that a pufferfish?

3091
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,780
One.

3092
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,950
What's this?

3093
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:48,920
(Seok Sam, who got 1 finger, is currently in last place.)

3094
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,320
- What's this? - One.

3095
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,520
- One. - One.

3096
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,180
- One breath. - At first...

3097
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:52,490
(The last one is Pouty Mouth who specializes in blowing.)

3098
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,590
Once the fingers are stuck, they don't come out.

3099
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:56,960
(Blowing)

3100
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:58,690
All five fingers uncurled.

3101
01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,690
That's incredible.

3102
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,830
(Did he get all 5 fingers for the 1st time?)

3103
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:00,730
Seriously.

3104
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:01,960
All five fingers uncurled.

3105
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,930
(Shaking)

3106
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,060
- That's incredible. - Seriously.

3107
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,570
That's incredible.

3108
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,730
- That's incredible. - Seriously.

3109
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,500
- Three. - For goodness' sake.

3110
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,170
(Jong Kook takes 1st place with 4 fingers.)

3111
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,410
The ones who got three fingers, Jae Seok, Ye Eun,

3112
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,980
(Out of the 4 tied members,)

3113
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,010
Haha, and Se Chan...

3114
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:20,210
(2 will be chosen through rock-paper-scissors.)

3115
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:17,210
will play rock-paper-scissors.

3116
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:18,350
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - We'll choose...

3117
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,650
two out of the four.

3118
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,750
- This is very important. - This is important.

3119
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:22,980
- Play or lose... - All right.

3120
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,690
- Are we going right away? - Play or lose,

3121
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:25,750
- rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

3122
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,960
Okay! Paper!

3123
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:28,960
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

3124
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,120
- Okay! Paper! - No!

3125
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,460
- He's out. - He's out.

3126
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,560
- I played paper. - No, you're out.

3127
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,060
- I played paper. - You're out.

3128
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:35,500
(The guy who played paper is abandoned right away.)

3129
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,130
- No, you're out. - You're out.

3130
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,500
- You're out. - I played paper.

3131
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:37,360
(They're all on the same side in times like these.)

3132
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,530
- No, Se Chan. - You're out.

3133
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:38,630
- I played paper. - You're out.

3134
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:41,370
- I played paper, okay? - You didn't play.

3135
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:41,000
(Angry)

3136
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,600
- You're out. - I played paper.

3137
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,710
- You should've used your hand. - You're out.

3138
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,610
(Sad)

3139
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:45,770
- It's my birthday today. - You should've used your hand.

3140
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,640
- It's my birthday today. - You're out.

3141
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:48,910
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

3142
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,640
I played paper.

3143
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,640
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors. - Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

3144
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,350
(Scissors, paper, paper)

3145
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,880
Okay!

3146
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,910
(Jae Seok will get a hint.)

3147
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:53,950
Okay!

3148
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,080
One person.

3149
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,750
(One more person will get a hint.)

3150
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,120
Se Chan.

3151
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,420
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

3152
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:00,550
Rock-paper-scissors.

3153
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:01,860
Okay!

3154
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,960
(Haha will get a hint.)

3155
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:04,160
- Okay! - Didn't you play a hand?

3156
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,160
Jae Seok, Haha,

3157
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:09,030
(Jong Kook, Jae Seok, and Haha will get a hint.)

3158
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,900
and Jong Kook will get a hint.

3159
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,160
- Okay. - Let's go.

3160
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,470
Come forward one at a time...

3161
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,400
(They'll check how many gifts they got in total.)

3162
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,730
- and we'll give you the number. - Come forward.

3163
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,330
Other people will turn around.

3164
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:15,800
- I'll go first. - Okay.

3165
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:16,740
(Jong Kook checks the number first.)

3166
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,270
You know,

3167
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:20,110
it'll be easier...

3168
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,240
- if the number is zero. - Seriously.

3169
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,310
But it'll be disappointing if you don't have any presents.

3170
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:27,280
Will you write it down? People will look.

3171
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:30,580
(How many presents belong to Jong Kook?)

3172
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,620
They'll know if you make the number with your hand.

3173
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,690
Will you write it down? People will look.

3174
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:36,920
They'll know if you make the number with your hand.

3175
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:40,060
(No presents)

3176
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,960
(Flustered)

3177
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,900
(He schools his face.)

3178
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,660
It'll be easier if the number is zero.

3179
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:47,500
(He gives double thumbs up as if he's cool about it.)

3180
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,300
Gosh, this is...

3181
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,710
(But he looks disappointed from his back.)

3182
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,300
Did you check the number?

3183
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,070
- This isn't easy. - Do you have many presents?

3184
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,110
Does Jong Kook have one?

3185
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,310
(There's none.)

3186
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,180
What should I do?

3187
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,550
One?

3188
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,050
Is there a red one? It's mine. Hey, it's mine.

3189
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:05,390
- It has to be mine. Body lotion. - For sure.

3190
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,420
(Thinking that every present was for him,)

3191
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,750
I love body lotion. Maybe the shot glasses are...

3192
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:10,120
(Jong Kook got excited like a child.)

3193
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,120
- for my wife and me. - That's right.

3194
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:14,290
- This one... - There are many presents for you.

3195
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:16,460
(He even prepared gold as a present.)

3196
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:16,530
- Doesn't it seem like mine? - There are many presents for you.

3197
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,700
(Disappointed)

3198
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,600
It's confusing if there's one.

3199
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,770
Hello.

3200
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,340
(Haha checks the number next.)

3201
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:23,100
All right.

3202
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,970
- How many presents are for me? - Haha.

3203
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,240
(Expectant)

3204
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,710
Haha.

3205
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,940
- One? - It's confusing if there's one.

3206
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:32,280
(No presents)

3207
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,380
- It's confusing. - Se Chan.

3208
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,580
For goodness' sake.

3209
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,220
(He can't believe it.)

3210
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:35,550
Are you serious?

3211
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,390
- Haha doesn't have any presents. - It's heartwarming.

3212
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,190
- Haha doesn't have any presents. - Really?

3213
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:41,220
Haha doesn't have any presents.

3214
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:44,590
- I'll take the underwear. - Come on.

3215
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,830
(When they checked the presents)

3216
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,330
That's not yours.

3217
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,890
- What is it, then? - You get nothing!

3218
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,130
Just have some fun...

3219
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,230
(Sadly, Jae Seok's prediction came true.)

3220
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:53,270
- and go home with nothing. - I take part in the games too.

3221
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,840
(Doing his best to pretend)

3222
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:54,500
It's heartwarming.

3223
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,440
- He has a present. - He has a present.

3224
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,270
There's a big chance I don't have any presents.

3225
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,010
(How many presents did Jae Seok receive?)

3226
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,780
(2 presents!)

3227
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,350
- Mine? Me? - "Mine?"

3228
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,750
(Flustered)

3229
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,480
I got a healthy present for Jae Seok.

3230
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:13,250
(The snow crabs Ji Hyo got from Yeongdeok)

3231
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,020
To give him snow crabs he'll need to shell...

3232
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,320
(And there's one more gift?)

3233
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,690
I'm in trouble.

3234
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,120
- I'm in trouble. He has a present. - I'm in trouble.

3235
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:19,030
(It's gotten more difficult to find their gifts.)

3236
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,230
You have a present, right?

3237
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:20,130
- That's why you're in trouble. - He has a present.

3238
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,460
(Will Jae Seok be able to find his presents?)

3239
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,600
- He has a present. - I guess I don't have any presents.

3240
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:26,400
Now, only the final selection remains.

3241
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,770
- What should I do? - Please take turns...

3242
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,140
to go into the Present Room...

3243
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,640
- and select... - How will I select my presents?

3244
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,870
- your present. - I have no idea.

3245
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,140
- Okay. - If you have multiple presents,

3246
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,210
select as many presents as you want.

3247
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,710
If you have zero presents,

3248
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:40,150
say that you don't have any presents and come back out.

3249
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,620
Okay.

3250
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,380
If you fail to select your present correctly,

3251
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,850
you'll receive a penalty.

3252
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:47,150
Unbelievable.

3253
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:51,760
(He can't take it if he can't guess his gift correctly.)

3254
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:49,220
- Do we lose the presents then? - Yes.

3255
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:50,890
That's sad.

3256
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:53,960
I'll go first.

3257
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:54,960
(Sad)

3258
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,500
Haha will go first.

3259
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:59,270
- Jong Kook, this is heartwarming. - It's hard.

3260
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:01,500
All right. Okay.

3261
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,470
(He acts like there's a present for him.)

3262
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,340
- Okay. - Seriously, this is heartwarming.

3263
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,970
- I'm nearly in tears. - Okay, punk.

3264
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:06,910
(In a different meaning)

3265
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:08,580
- Maybe he'll cry for real. - The gold can't be his.

3266
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:11,550
(Trudging)

3267
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:12,250
The gold can't be his. Why is he acting that way?

3268
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,350
For goodness' sake.

3269
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,850
(Sighing)

3270
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,750
What kind of Christmas is this?

3271
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:21,220
I'm so annoyed. I'll kill some time here.

3272
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,960
How did no one get me a present?

3273
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,360
(He feels betrayed.)

3274
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:28,500
I'm so disappointed.

3275
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,860
Did you cry this year?

3276
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,830
- What? - Did you cry this year?

3277
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,230
- Did I cry? - Yes.

3278
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:35,870
No. Actually, I cried a lot.

3279
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:37,500
You don't get a present if you cry.

3280
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:41,440
Do you have a death wish?

3281
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:46,610
(Haha uses nice words in front of Santa Claus.)

3282
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,080
(He lingers because he can't let go.)

3283
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,250
This is driving me crazy!

3284
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:55,820
(Haha chooses "No present.")

3285
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,990
I'll get going now.

3286
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:01,660
(There's another man whose feelings are hurt.)

3287
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,500
Thank goodness...

3288
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,670
(He manages to stay calm.)

3289
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:05,700
I got to check out the last hint.

3290
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,470
How did no one get me a present?

3291
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,470
For goodness' sake.

3292
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:12,870
I'm angry.

3293
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,040
Well, I didn't expect a present.

3294
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,810
But I thought someone would prepare something funny.

3295
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,550
(Sulking)

3296
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,250
I'll give you my answer. I have...

3297
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,590
no present.

3298
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,760
(Sulking)

3299
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,930
Okay. At the very least, I won't get the penalty.

3300
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,260
(He tells himself that it's a win.)

3301
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,230
- Okay. - Merry Christmas.

3302
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,530
Be quiet.

3303
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,970
(Jong Kook chooses "No present.")

3304
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,940
(Jae Seok became more confused after receiving a hint.)

3305
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,740
I have two presents.

3306
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:48,840
(Jae Seok has 2 presents.)

3307
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,370
I need to select two, right?

3308
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,710
Yes.

3309
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,180
Hold on. That present wasn't for me.

3310
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,350
(After checking, body lotion wasn't his gift.)

3311
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,110
This present is likely for Seok Jin.

3312
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:56,650
The electric foot file is too...

3313
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,150
(Breathing in)

3314
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,550
I don't think anyone would give it to me.

3315
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:02,220
(Neither present seems like his.)

3316
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,850
The hair-styling tongs too.

3317
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:03,920
Are there two presents for me?

3318
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:08,030
(He needs to select 2 presents to be exempt from the penalty.)

3319
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:12,270
Jong Kook didn't bring this for me, right?

3320
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:14,770
I think it's for Seok Jin.

3321
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
(He's sure gold is from Seok Sam.)

3322
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:17,970
In that case... I should've checked this earlier.

3323
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:23,780
I think someone got me this present to be funny.

3324
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:28,520
- Jae Seok, enjoy it! - Yeongdeok snow crab?

3325
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:31,120
(Jae Seok's present, Yeongdeok snow crab, sits there.)

3326
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:34,850
(Which presents will Jae Seok choose?)

3327
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,220
Yeongdeok snow crab.

3328
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,690
I think my presents are underwear and Yeongdeok snow crab.

3329
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,260
These two.

3330
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,160
(He chooses his present, snow crab.)

3331
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:42,260
I think my presents are underwear and Yeongdeok snow crab.

3332
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,860
(The person who gave him snow crabs)

3333
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,460
I bet it's from Se Chan...

3334
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,700
or Ji Hyo. Yes.

3335
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,930
(Correct)

3336
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:51,040
(Will the underwear be his as well?)

3337
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,140
- Will you choose those two? - Yes. Okay.

3338
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:52,140
None of them are for me.

3339
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,710
I brought that present. I checked that this wasn't for me.

3340
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,610
(What Se Chan brought)

3341
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,870
(Checked with the hint)

3342
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:57,880
The shot glasses have nothing to do with me.

3343
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,650
Does this person want me to get a girlfriend and use them?

3344
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,010
(No way)

3345
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:02,150
It makes no sense. I won't choose that present.

3346
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,620
I don't think I have any presents.

3347
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:06,190
(Se Chan chooses "No present.")

3348
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,790
I don't think any of these presents are for me.

3349
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:12,690
None of these presents suits me.

3350
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,730
(Ji Hyo chooses "No present.")

3351
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,260
I think this one...

3352
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,470
(Ye Eun chooses the body lotion and hair-styling tongs.)

3353
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,370
and that one are mine.

3354
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:24,000
(But both of them are Seok Jin's presents.)

3355
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,570
(Ye Eun will receive the penalty.)

3356
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:27,310
I don't know what to do.

3357
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,940
This is confusing.

3358
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,180
The underwear and snow crab weren't for me.

3359
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,620
Maybe the body lotion is mine.

3360
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,450
(Thinking)

3361
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,820
(Se Chan got the body lotion for Seok Jin.)

3362
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:42,960
Use it well.

3363
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,790
Maybe the body lotion is mine.

3364
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,260
It's 1 or the 2...

3365
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,830
(And the hair-styling tongs that Haha got)

3366
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,290
if there's a present for me.

3367
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,700
I don't think both of them are for me.

3368
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,900
(Torn)

3369
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,660
I don't think both of them are for me.

3370
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:53,630
Should I go ahead and choose?

3371
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:56,270
(Which present will Seok Jin choose?)

3372
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,370
Should I go ahead and choose?

3373
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:59,170
Gold.

3374
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:01,140
(Gold?)

3375
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:01,470
I'll choose gold as my present.

3376
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:02,880
They said his reason was touching.

3377
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,150
I bet Jong Kook thought of me.

3378
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,550
I'm getting emotional for some reason.

3379
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:11,280
(Teary-eyed)

3380
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,990
(The greedy raccoon gets blinded by gold.)

3381
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:13,450
It's touching.

3382
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,920
It's a touching present.

3383
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:19,630
(He didn't choose the 2 gifts that were meant for him.)

3384
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:19,290
It's mine for real.

3385
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:23,000
(He's confirmed to get the penalty.)

3386
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,930
I think it's mine.

3387
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:25,630
And I don't need anything other than this.

3388
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:29,800
- Still... - This is driving me crazy!

3389
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:30,740
(They're exempt from the penalty.)

3390
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,170
This is confusing.

3391
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:33,240
(They'll take the penalty.)

3392
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,370
I don't know what to do.

3393
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:36,480
- Seriously. - I don't think I have any presents.

3394
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,750
(Will the three of them be able to avoid the penalty?)

3395
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,750
It's a bit sad. It's my birthday today.

3396
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,420
If you picked any presents, go to the Present Zone.

3397
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:46,090
(Present Zone, Alone Zone)

3398
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,250
- Okay. - If you picked no present,

3399
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,320
go to the Alone Zone.

3400
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,960
Today's penalty is a cold water bucket.

3401
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:49,290
(Today's penalty)

3402
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,790
- Bucket? - No!

3403
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,460
(A cold shower of water in the middle of winter)

3404
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:52,760
- This is a mess. - It's Christmas.

3405
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,890
On Christmas...

3406
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:56,830
(The Christmas nightmare that'd freeze your bones)

3407
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,400
What should I do?

3408
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:57,600
The presents that didn't go to the intended people...

3409
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,700
will go back to the buyers.

3410
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:03,600
(The gifts that didn't go to the owners were returned.)

3411
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,030
- Good. - The buyers?

3412
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:02,240
- Yes. - Okay. That'll be better.

3413
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,040
Gosh, I'm annoyed.

3414
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:05,570
This is the Alone Zone.

3415
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,340
(They go to their respective zones.)

3416
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,410
- I'm certain of it. - Sit here.

3417
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,680
(Alone Zone)

3418
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:10,540
I'm certain of it too.

3419
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,050
What? Did you hear it?

3420
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,280
I heard it.

3421
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,420
- So many people are there. - Haha heard it too.

3422
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:16,180
(Jong Kook and Haha who found out there were no gifts for them...)

3423
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,450
Haha too? Did Haha hear it too?

3424
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,180
(are at the Alone Zone.)

3425
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,950
I'm so disappointed.

3426
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,060
Did Haha and Jong Kook not get any presents?

3427
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:23,320
(Upset)

3428
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,490
Just be quiet.

3429
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,530
We don't have any presents.

3430
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,960
Why didn't you give me a present?

3431
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,830
You could've gotten me a present.

3432
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,570
(Chuckling)

3433
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:34,700
I didn't get the hint, but none of them are mine.

3434
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,170
None of them are mine either.

3435
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,640
Also, the probability is low.

3436
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:39,710
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo also sit at the Alone Zone.)

3437
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:42,540
They told me that I had 2 presents, not 1.

3438
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:45,040
(Jae Seok chose the snow crabs and underwear.)

3439
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,340
- Two? - That's right.

3440
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:46,610
So it's hard to get them right.

3441
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:47,680
(If he got the underwear right, he'd be exempt from the penalty.)

3442
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:47,710
Really?

3443
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:50,150
What should I do? This is nerve-racking.

3444
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,650
(Meanwhile, Ye Eun with bad hunch is confirmed to get a water splash.)

3445
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,420
What if...

3446
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:54,190
Seok Jin chose the wrong present?

3447
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,960
What if he's here when he doesn't have any presents?

3448
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,860
Seok Jin, that'll be the saddest.

3449
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:01,490
- That's... - No present.

3450
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,630
(A tragedy that can be foreseen)

3451
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,730
- Did he check the number? - I don't want to think about it.

3452
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,000
(Seok Sam threw away his gift, blinded by gold.)

3453
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:07,070
- Then I'd get wet... - Seok Jin.

3454
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:09,500
(Bingo)

3455
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,100
and not receive any presents.

3456
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,500
Seok Jin...

3457
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,470
wants gold from Jong Kook.

3458
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:14,810
(Is gold for Seok Jin?)

3459
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:13,940
People kept telling me that the gold was for me.

3460
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,070
- That's right. - It has to be Seok Jin's.

3461
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:17,310
Now, we'll announce the results.

3462
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,850
(Revealing the results)

3463
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,340
- Okay. - Okay.

3464
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,050
Buckets, standby.

3465
01:26:20,110 --> 01:26:21,210
Please.

3466
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,850
- Are we going at once? - Buckets, standby.

3467
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:23,850
Please.
It doesn't matter for us.

3468
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,790
(The buckets are ready.)

3469
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,650
It doesn't matter for us.

3470
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:28,150
The two of us won't get the penalty.

3471
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,590
(No gift and no penalty for Jong Kook and Haha)

3472
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,460
That's right.

3473
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:30,660
Please.

3474
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,660
(Seok Jin and Ye Eun will get the water.)

3475
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:35,060
Be careful with that.

3476
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,660
You shouldn't drop it.

3477
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,570
(We don't know the result for Se Chan and Ji Hyo.)

3478
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,900
- You have to hold it well. - You have to pour it well.

3479
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:41,730
Mine sounds heavy.

3480
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:42,240
(And...)

3481
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,700
(Jae Seok will succeed if he gets the underwear correct.)

3482
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,970
It sounds heavy up there.

3483
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,970
(Will Jae Seok be able to avoid the water splash?)

3484
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,640
I can hear the water splashing.

3485
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,110
All right.

3486
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,680
One, two,

3487
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:54,210
Three!

3488
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,950
(Ye Eun and Seok Jin get splashed with water.)

3489
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,420
- Only the two of us survived. - It's cold!

3490
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:01,420
(In the Alone Zone...)

3491
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,090
Hey. Jong Kook, we...

3492
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,790
Only the two of us survived. Hey.

3493
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,830
(Even Se Chan and Ji Hyo get splashed with water.)

3494
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:09,260
- Only the two of us survived. - It's so cold.

3495
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,230
- We have gifts? - What gifts?

3496
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,170
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan had gifts.)

3497
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,370
- What is this? - It's cold!

3498
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:16,900
One, two, three!

3499
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,070
(Then what about Jae Seok?)

3500
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:24,410
(He gets splashed with water.)

3501
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,640
It's cold!

3502
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:30,150
(The underwear wasn't for Jae Seok!)

3503
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,050
It's cold.

3504
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:30,350
It's cold.

3505
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:33,750
Hey. Jong Kook, we...

3506
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,460
- Only the two of us survived. - It's cold.

3507
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,490
- We have gifts? - What gifts?

3508
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,790
(Everyone gets the penalty except Haha and Jong Kook.)

3509
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:38,760
- It's cold! - It's cold.

3510
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,290
It's cold.
It feels bad.

3511
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:42,700
- It feels bad. - Those two survived.

3512
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:44,360
(They didn't get gifts. but they're dry.)

3513
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,560
- Okay! - There was a present for you.

3514
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,470
- I had a present. - You had a present.

3515
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,600
- I had a present. - How are we to guess that?

3516
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:49,800
I feel even worse.

3517
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,210
I'm taking back the gold!

3518
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:55,810
Okay! I bragged about it all I wanted as well.

3519
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:56,840
- Right. - There's no present.

3520
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:58,210
It's impossible to guess it.

3521
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:01,380
(What about Jae Seok's gift, who chose underwear?)

3522
01:27:58,210 --> 01:28:00,380
You made it so it's impossible to guess it.

3523
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:02,720
- What is it? - Darn it.

3524
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:05,250
Merry Christmas, Jae Seok.

3525
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:07,420
I prepared a nice present for you.

3526
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:09,320
(Seok Jin brought the gift for Jae Seok!)

3527
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,420
You massaged my face with your foot recently.

3528
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,890
It felt so different from what the therapist did.

3529
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:15,230
(His gift was an electric foot file.)

3530
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:15,190
That's why I prepared this.

3531
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,930
- I received a foot massage. - Yes.

3532
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:19,400
- You massaged me. - Yes.

3533
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,530
It felt totally different from what the therapist did.

3534
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:23,200
- His foot was rough. - Yes.

3535
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:25,470
(Jae Seok's feet were especially rough during the foot massage.)

3536
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,910
It was so rough. The therapist's foot was smooth.

3537
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:28,510
- Is that so? - That's how I knew it was you.

3538
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:29,910
- So, you... - There was a story.

3539
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:31,610
- Of course. There's a reason. - There was a reason.

3540
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:32,780
- So that was the reason. - That was it.

3541
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:36,680
He says he takes care of his feet, but that day, I told him...

3542
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:39,020
(Seok Sam's gift to take care of Jae Seo's feet)

3543
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,290
to take better care of them.

3544
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,660
Goodness. The underwear. Whose was that?

3545
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,860
(Who was the underwear for that Jae Seok chose?)

3546
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,460
- Who brought the underwear? - That was me.

3547
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,120
(The one who gifted the underwear)

3548
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,390
- It was your ex-boyfriend's, right? - No.

3549
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:47,560
- Did you buy it? - Yes.

3550
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,030
I bought it at the department store.

3551
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:50,700
- You bought it? - Who did you buy it for?

3552
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,760
Se Chan.

3553
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:56,900
(The underwear was for Se Chan!)

3554
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,870
- That's not my style. - What is this?

3555
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:58,300
- I mean... - Why would you give me that?

3556
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,410
- Listen. - Why?

3557
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:02,980
Listen to me. I wanted to give him something funny.

3558
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,680
So I bought one that was red and one with a leopard print.

3559
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,080
(She also prepared red underwear, which Se Chan likes.)

3560
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,380
- He wears red underwear. - I like red.

3561
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:08,950
There's a red one as well. I asked them about the size.

3562
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,980
(To the staff)

3563
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:10,850
I told them I was going to give them to Yang Se Chan.

3564
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:13,150
They told me a large size would do.

3565
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:13,050
(The staff said)

3566
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,760
(The staff overrated Se Chan.)

3567
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:15,220
- Large is big. - That's big. I wear a medium size.

3568
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:17,590
- I can't take it anyway. - You can't take it.

3569
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:19,160
- You have to take it. - Right.

3570
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,460
You have to take it.

3571
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:22,300
(Giving it up for Ye Eun's future boyfriend)

3572
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,790
Take it back.

3573
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:24,930
Then the shot glass set.

3574
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:26,170
I brought that.

3575
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:27,330
- Right? - From Gyeongju.

3576
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:28,470
- From Gyeongju. - Yes.

3577
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:30,540
(Who did Jae Seok gift the shot glasses to?)

3578
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,600
- Right. - Who is it for?

3579
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,300
- For Ssaebssaeb. - Why?

3580
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,310
For me?

3581
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,340
It's Ssaebssaeb's birthday.

3582
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,580
- If he gets a girlfriend... - Right.

3583
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:40,050
I said that inside. "If the person is giving this to me..."

3584
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,080
- "so I drink with my girlfriend," - Right.

3585
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,920
"that would be the worst."

3586
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,850
It would have been amazing if you had guessed it right.

3587
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:48,990
(The birthday boy lost both gifts.)

3588
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:47,190
- For your girlfriend. - I had guessed it.

3589
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:49,090
- That's why I brought it. - Then...

3590
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,790
Next is the gold.

3591
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,990
(The long-awaited gold everyone was looking forward too)

3592
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:52,790
I bragged about it all I wanted,

3593
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:54,430
- and I can take it back. - It was for Seok Sam.

3594
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,400
- Thank you. - The gold...

3595
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,360
(Touched)

3596
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,860
- So considerate of you! - Unlikely.

3597
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:00,130
(Jong Kook's gift was even more touching because of the reason.)

3598
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,170
- Is it for me? - It's for me.

3599
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:00,270
Maybe it's for Seok Jin.

3600
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,740
(Was the gold really meant for Seok Jin?)

3601
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,470
- If it's touching, it's for Haha. - I'll be nice to you, Jong Kook.

3602
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:06,010
It's a gold key of luck.

3603
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,940
So, I wanted Ji Hyo...

3604
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,040
(She's startled.)

3605
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:12,710
to meet a man and get married.

3606
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,950
(Ji Hyo, all of a sudden?)

3607
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,050
- I actually... - That was unexpected.

3608
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:17,320
The gift I prepared...

3609
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,150
is a gold key.

3610
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,550
About 1.875g of gold.

3611
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:23,960
So she could find her other half and make it 3.75g of gold.

3612
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:28,090
In hopes that Ji Hyo would find her other half.

3613
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:30,660
(In hopes that Ji Hyo would find her other half)

3614
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:30,600
I don't need it anymore. So, I'll give it to Ji Hyo.

3615
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,100
I'll give her 1.875g of gold.

3616
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:35,870
(Santa Kook gave her a gold key of luck.)

3617
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:37,940
I wanted you to meet a man...

3618
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,610
and get married.

3619
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,510
(Facing down)

3620
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:40,610
- I actually... - That's warm.

3621
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:42,710
- What is this? - But she scolded me so much.

3622
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,910
I gave it to her with a warm heart, but earlier,

3623
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:46,910
- Jong Kook. - she told me...

3624
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,480
- I didn't know. - to mind my business.

3625
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,850
- "Mind your business!" - Jong Kook!

3626
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:53,090
I'll make it clear to you. What do you think? Don't you get it?

3627
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:53,090
(Earlier, during the mafia game)

3628
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,090
(Her expression hardens.)

3629
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:55,120
- I really... - You get it, right?

3630
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,020
You lost some weight, didn't you?

3631
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:56,990
(Just a while ago)

3632
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,420
Are you on a diet?

3633
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,590
Mind your business.

3634
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:04,430
(Ji Hyo was snappy all day without knowing Jong Kook's heart.)

3635
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:04,400
Really? Also...

3636
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,830
Mind...

3637
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,700
I really hoped she wouldn't guess it.

3638
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:09,340
(Getting the gold back)

3639
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,240
- Don't get it. Get it wrong! - Right.

3640
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,400
You're so annoying.

3641
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,070
- What is it for me? - He didn't get anything.

3642
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:14,870
- I didn't get anything as well. - I...

3643
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:17,310
I didn't need anything else. I just wanted the gold.

3644
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:21,280
You took all my loving eyes.

3645
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,750
Goodness.

3646
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:24,950
(The greedy raccoon got ahead of himself.)

3647
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,850
- There's no present for me. - I just wanted the gold.

3648
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:26,690
(Crying)

3649
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:31,360
Haha wasn't mentioned.

3650
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:33,890
- You jerks. - He wasn't mentioned.

3651
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:34,990
(Super upset)

3652
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:35,900
- Fifteen years. - I...

3653
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,560
- "It's been 15 years." - Was I even in your top 3?

3654
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,900
(Clinging)

3655
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,700
He wasn't even mentioned.

3656
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,470
- Seriously. - You have to take the presents...

3657
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:42,770
- you guessed right. - Right.

3658
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:44,800
(Only Jae Seok who got the gift wins the Yeongdeok crab.)

3659
01:31:42,770 --> 01:31:43,770
- The Yeongdeok snow crab? - Yes.

3660
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:45,740
- Take it. - Okay.

3661
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:47,440
Thank you, Ji Hyo.

3662
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,780
Should I take the electric foot file?

3663
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:54,480
This is not nice. Our teamwork is horrible.

3664
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:54,350
(They affirm how deeply they care about each other.)

3665
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,950
(The Christmas Special is over.)

3666
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,880
- Thank you, Jong Kook. - It's Christmas.

3667
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,120
- It's Christmas. - Don't mention it.

3668
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,420
- Thank you so much. - Not at all.

3669
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,590
Thank you, Ji Hyo.

3670
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:01,320
(They enjoyed the crabs that Ji Hyo gave them.)

3671
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:01,690
- It's a hassle, isn't it? - No, it's not.

3672
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,760
I'll enjoy them.

3673
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:06,230
The prizes you earned in 2025...

3674
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:05,730
(All the prizes they earned in 2025 were gathered...)

3675
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:08,460
(as badges of honor!)

3676
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:08,160
- were made into badges. - How many are there?

3677
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:09,460
Why do I have so many?

3678
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,530
You have to pay tax on the prizes.

3679
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:12,930
(The more you received, the more tax you need to pay.)

3680
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:13,100
We have to get rid of them, right?

3681
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,230
Ji Hyo said...

3682
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:14,500
(A touching display of friendship,)

3683
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,670
she'd put five of them.

3684
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,840
(passing the tax bomb off to each other)

3685
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:17,670
I have to stop it.

3686
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:19,570
My pride doesn't allow that.

3687
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:19,640
(The tiger moth's pride is on the line.)

3688
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:21,610
- Isn't this nice? - I don't think it would be this.

3689
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,570
(The great tax settlement battle)

3690
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,510
There's something you often say to Haha.

3691
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,580
- Can I use vulgar language? - That's fine.

3692
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,110
(Their flimsy loyalty...)

3693
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:29,880
(falls apart.)

3694
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:32,650
- Don't avoid it. - What is this?

3695
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,750
(In this place rife with distrust,)

3696
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:34,750
Race, start.

3697
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,960
(someone brings even greater chaos.)

3698
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,060
You believe me, right?

3699
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,590
What?

3700
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:39,490
(Codename Jee-rasoni appears?)

3701
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:39,560
There's a spy?

3702
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,730
Take it off! I'm talking to you.

3703
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,500
(While everyone else is settling their taxes,)

3704
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:42,860
It's so annoying.

3705
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:44,630
- Where did everyone go? - Where is Haha?

3706
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:45,200
(a spy shows up to settle grudges bringing total chaos.)

3707
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:46,270
- What? - Where is it?

3708
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,370
(Who will survive in the chaos of year-end tax season?)

3709
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:47,330
- What? - What?

3710
01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:48,400
- Darn it. - Hurry up.

3711
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:49,570
(Year-end Tax Settlement by Getting Rid of Prizes)

3712
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,570
He's a spy?

3713
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:54,370
(Running Man)
