1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,710
You're here.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,080
- The newlywed husband is here.
- The newlywed husband.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,450
It was the best congratulatory song
I've ever heard at a wedding.

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,020
Now that Jong Kook is married,
he's dressed in white.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,120
- I know.
- In long sleeves, too.

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,490
Jong Kook,
how you dress has changed.

8
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,490
- You're right.
- No. It's not like that.

9
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,690
The newlywed husband is here.

10
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,490
Stop it. Be quiet.

11
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,960
- The newlywed husband is here.
- That's enough.

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,530
- Stop it.
- We have a newlywed husband here.

13
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,600
- Okay. All right.
- Get on.

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
- Hey.
- Go ahead and get on this.

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,900
- You have to go through all this.
- Go ahead.

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,270
- Stop it.
- What do you mean I should stop it?

17
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,800
- Your arms got thicker.
- I know.

18
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,900
Have you been working out?

19
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,640
We should toss Jong Kook
into the air.

20
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,410
Daniel, let's toss Jong Kook
into the air.

21
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,740
- We should do that.
- Hey, guys.

22
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,380
Stop it, you punks!

23
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,480
Why?

24
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,350
(Now that the wedding is over,
they want to tease him.)

25
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,450
Why are you standing in the corner?
You should be in the center.

26
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,150
- Move over.
- In the center.

27
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,390
All right.

28
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,290
You must have a lot to talk
about the current situation.

29
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,630
- We do.
- Before we talk,

30
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,960
- Right.
- we have a special guest for today.

31
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,360
We will have him here
and have a talk together.

32
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,700
- Who is it?
- Hello. You're here.

33
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,100
- Hey.
- Okay.

34
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,300
Yes.

35
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,210
(Jong Kook's friend who gets
on his nerves, Cha Tae Hyun)

36
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,870
- Nice to meet you.
- Tae Hyun.

37
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,740
(I hear Jong Kook's child in LA
is a college student now.)

38
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,750
(Sometimes he says it's a son,
and sometimes a daughter.)

39
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,780
(That's how the rumor became true.)

40
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,490
(He's the one who spread rumors
about Jong Kook's kid in the US.)

41
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,790
(Jong Kook finds it hard
to handle Tae Hyun.)

42
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,890
(It's hard.)

43
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,500
(He doesn't know what he can say
and what he cannot.)

44
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
(His best friend, of all people,
is here 3 days after his wedding.)

45
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,070
- Tae Hyun.
- Tae Hyun.

46
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,000
- He's our family.
- By the way...

47
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,070
- What are you doing here?
- All right.

48
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,240
- What am I doing here?
- Hey, why have you gotten so young?

49
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,010
- You look younger.
- What is he talking about?

50
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,340
- I...
- You've lost a lot of weight.

51
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,740
We met three days ago.
What are you talking about?

52
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,740
- No.
- I know.

53
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,780
How would I get younger
in three days?

54
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,750
The thing is, he quit drinking.

55
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,320
- Hello.
- He caught a cold from Seok Jin.

56
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,350
I'm Cha Tae Hyun, and I'm here
to promote "The Ballad of Us."

57
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,690
- "The Ballad of Us?"
- I see.

58
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,420
"The Ballad of Us."

59
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,160
- I see.
- He's here to promote his show.

60
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,190
We didn't even introduce him
when he got here.

61
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,700
- We've seen him a lot.
- You know what?

62
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,100
I went on "My Little Old Boy..."

63
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,600
and "Invitation from Bachelor-agains"
to promote the drama.

64
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
- You did?
- And?

65
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,610
And they didn't ask me
about the show,

66
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,610
so I couldn't say anything.

67
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,110
You went there to promote your show?

68
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,540
I went there to talk about it.

69
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,910
- And it didn't come up?
- You didn't mention it.

70
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,250
- You didn't mention the show.
- So...

71
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,720
So I went to shoot
"The Ballad of Us..."

72
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,350
- You know Ms. Choi Young In.
- Yes.

73
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,190
She asked
why I didn't mention the show.

74
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,290
- What happened?
- And she put me...

75
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,190
in this show right away.

76
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,460
Ms. Choi is like your manager.

77
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,830
Why am I doing so many SBS shows?

78
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,730
Anyway, it's nice to see you.

79
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,070
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

80
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,340
We just met a few days ago,
but it's still nice to see you.

81
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,100
- So...
- He didn't say the first episode.

82
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,810
You can talk about it a lot today.

83
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,110
- Tae Hyun.
- We just met a few days ago,

84
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,440
- but it's still nice to see you.
- Seriously...

85
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,910
- He didn't say the first episode.
- When you...

86
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,780
- sang at his wedding, we...
- The song?

87
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,480
- You sang at his wedding.
- I sang to congratulate him?

88
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
But he sang at his own wedding.
You also sang there.

89
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,850
- Jong Kook did sing.
- Actually...

90
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,390
- The viewers would be confused.
- Why?

91
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,760
- They would think I sang.
- You did sing.

92
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,460
- You sang.
- You sang at his wedding.

93
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,930
- Actually...
- He was supposed to sing.

94
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,130
He was going to sing with a band
at this wedding.

95
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,570
- Actually...
- He was supposed to sing.

96
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,230
He was going to sing with a band
at this wedding.

97
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,140
- "Loveable."
- "Loveable." That was nice.

98
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,170
Was there a band?

99
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,740
- With a band.
- I performed with a band.

100
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,610
- With a live band.
- I thought it was MR.

101
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,380
It was a live band.

102
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
- And...
- He didn't know.

103
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,650
- It was a live band.
- He didn't know.

104
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,710
- And...
- Wasn't he at the wedding too?

105
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,150
We...

106
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,650
- I got there an hour early.
- Yes.

107
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,550
- He rehearsed it and everything.
- He did?

108
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,350
It was my first time rehearsing it.

109
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,860
We have a lot to talk about.

110
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,360
Anyway, it was the best song
I'd ever heard at a wedding.

111
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,390
- Right.
- It was the best.

112
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,260
- When he sang the song...
- "Loveable." It was really nice.

113
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,260
- It really was.
- Then he...

114
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,130
- suddenly asked me to sing...
- He was being anxious.

115
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,570
He asked me to sing...

116
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,700
- at the last moment.
- All of a sudden.

117
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,710
- He asked me to sing "I Love You."
- Okay.

118
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,170
(After Jong Kook sang, he suddenly
asked Tae Hyun to sing.)

119
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,980
(- Can you sing for us?
- Now?)

120
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,380
(Sing "I Love You" for us.)

121
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,850
- Your song was great that day.
- It was really good.

122
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,820
(He was flustered for a bit,
but he sincerely sang "I Love You.")

123
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,350
It's "I understand your love."

124
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,620
- I cried after hearing your song.
- I cried.

125
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
- Right.
- It was so touching.

126
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,960
- Your live performance...
- Tae Hyun.

127
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,660
- There was a touching moment.
- When you started dancing...

128
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,190
- Right.
- It was so touching.

129
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,030
As he stretched his arms,
Haha and I...

130
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,360
- We burst into tears.
- My gosh.

131
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,100
I could see your friendship.

132
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,470
- It was really beautiful.
- It was touching.

133
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,330
(His impromptu performance showed
their friendship of 30 years.)

134
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,240
You know, they are
the Cha Tae Hyun kids.

135
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,340
- Right.
- Seriously.

136
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,740
- Tears... I'm still touched.
- Seriously...

137
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,940
- It was so touching.
- When I sang...

138
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,450
- What?
- As soon as I picked up the mic,

139
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,780
he went like this. What was that?

140
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,650
(He was afraid Tae Hyun
would say something ridiculous.)

141
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,250
- To make it quick.
- I didn't say a thing.

142
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,220
- You asked him to sing.
- I didn't say anything.

143
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,460
- You did that before you knew it.
- I did that?

144
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,490
- Without realizing it.
- As soon as I picked up the mic...

145
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,930
I wanted you to start singing.

146
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,760
- He was nervous.
- I meant you should make it quick.

147
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,360
- And...
- "Stop talking and sing."

148
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,270
Actually,
when my friends got married,

149
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,000
we always did something together
for them.

150
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,370
At that moment, I realized that
we didn't get to do it this time.

151
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,740
- I thought I had to do something.
- Right.

152
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,610
The only shame is that Jang Hyuk
should've done this next to him.

153
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,810
- Right.
- He should've done this.

154
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,010
(TJ's boxing dance would've been
the finishing touch.)

155
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,450
He should've sung TJ's song.

156
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,820
- He should've performed as TJ.
- Hey. Why was Hyuk wearing...

157
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,390
the hermit-crab-looking hat
at your wedding?

158
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,550
Right.

159
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,720
(Hyuk came to his friend's wedding
in the hermit-crab-looking hat.)

160
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,360
- That's what he likes.
- He thought he'd cry.

161
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,660
He thought he'd cry.

162
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,400
Why was he wearing
the hermit-crab hat?

163
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,130
He should always wear it.

164
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,770
- Jae Seok.
- You know what?

165
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,700
- That's how it's set.
- His hair?

166
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,240
- That's his hairstyle.
- Is it stuck to his head?

167
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,470
It's part of his body.

168
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,210
I have a question to ask.

169
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,880
- What is Jong Kook's mother like...
- Yes.

170
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,810
when she meets Haha or Se Chan?

171
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,920
- Does she look bright or...
- Yes. She looks bright.

172
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
She's like, "You're here."

173
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,920
- "You came."
- But for me...

174
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,550
She keeps...

175
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,690
I said, "Congratulations, ma'am."

176
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,990
And she was like,
"Okay. It's a good thing."

177
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,430
So I thought...

178
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,230
she probably didn't recognize me.

179
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,200
- Did she not recognize you?
- She didn't recognize me?

180
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,500
I even took off my glasses.

181
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,000
I went to see her three times.

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,270
I said, "Congratulations, ma'am."

183
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,940
"Yes, sure."

184
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,170
(Yes, sure.)

185
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,310
- Really?
- So...

186
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,180
I thought
she was probably upset with me...

187
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,410
because I spread
a lot of rumors about him.

188
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,410
No.

189
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,910
- Too many rumors.
- Because you're playful.

190
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,180
I spread too many rumors.

191
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,450
That can't be it.

192
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,090
- Maybe I was too...
- By the way...

193
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,590
- Hey, you know what?
- There must be something.

194
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,020
- When the ceremony began...
- The wedding ceremony.

195
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,860
I said, "Here comes the groom."
He entered, wearing a suit.

196
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,360
He was like this, and...

197
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,330
(Shush!)

198
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,700
(He warned the people
as soon as he entered.)

199
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,900
"Don't say anything."

200
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,940
He warned people.

201
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,640
(The 2 members who got warned)

202
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,110
They were going overboard, so...

203
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,110
He kept...

204
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,140
- As he entered...
- He told us not to shout.

205
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,410
"Hey, don't shout."

206
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,650
He was like this.

207
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,450
(Groom Kim entered
at the signal of Jae Seok.)

208
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,320
(Making a fuss)

209
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,790
(He found the members
going overboard and warned them.)

210
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,990
- As he entered...
- He told us not to shout.

211
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,290
"Hey, don't shout."

212
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,630
(He played the roles of groom
and guard at the same time.)

213
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,790
To keep them under control.

214
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,900
- "Don't go overboard."
- That's hilarious. "Under control?"

215
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,830
He warned people.

216
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,830
(According to the other guests,
they deserved the warning.)

217
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,570
When Jong Kook got here
this morning,

218
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,810
we cheered for him
and gave him a big hand.

219
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,110
He said, "Hey, why did you
give me so much money?"

220
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,610
- To Daniel...
- Hey.

221
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,480
- Seriously, what's with you?
- "What's with you?"

222
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
- How much did you give him?
- Anyway, I will...

223
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,150
do the same for them later, but...

224
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,180
And he said this to me.

225
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,280
"Jae Seok, why did you
give me so much money?"

226
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,290
- And Seok Jin...
- You hosted the ceremony.

227
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,290
You didn't have to give me...

228
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,720
- so much money.
- And to Seok Jin,

229
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,990
"Thanks, Seok Jin."

230
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,860
(And to Seok Jin,
"Thanks, Seok Jin.")

231
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,660
(He simply thanked him.)

232
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,400
(The great MC caught it.)

233
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,870
(The oldest member's heart was
faded by the younger ones' gifts.)

234
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,070
- Hey.
- To Seok Jin...

235
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,110
Come here.

236
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,410
(The oldest member's heart was
faded by the younger ones' gifts.)

237
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,510
- Seok Jin.
- That's not it.

238
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,980
He gave me a lot.

239
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,110
He gave me a big amount.

240
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,550
Seok Jin is blushing.

241
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,550
- Seok Jin is blushing.
- He gave me a lot of money.

242
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,320
- His ears are red.
- He did give me a big amount.

243
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,750
Why did you give me so much money?

244
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,120
That wasn't much.

245
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
- Have you lost your mind?
- Why?

246
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,820
Why did you give me so much money?

247
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,220
That's the least I can do.

248
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,620
Hello, Jong Kook.

249
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,660
Are you crazy?

250
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,830
Why did you give me so much money?

251
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,130
Are you insane?

252
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,730
- That's how much I care for you.
- That's ridiculous.

253
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,470
(Hey, newlywed husband.)

254
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,930
- Thanks, Seok Jin.
- All right.

255
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,100
Everyone said
you were so good-looking.

256
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,700
- Why? Seriously?
- Yes.

257
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,210
- I...
- He gave me a lot of money.

258
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,240
- Jong Kook,
- Yes.

259
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,540
that was the biggest money
I'd ever given to anyone...

260
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,010
- at a wedding ceremony.
- Really?

261
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,250
I know. It was a lot.

262
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,910
- I was surprised when I saw it.
- Why?

263
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,480
But they gave me too much.

264
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,950
I'm serious.

265
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,350
- I was really surprised.
- Hey, you guys overdid it.

266
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,350
How much was that?

267
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,560
This is hilarious.

268
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,690
- It can happen between us.
- This is funny, though.

269
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,690
It's really funny. Everyone.

270
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,260
- It's so funny.
- It's hilarious.

271
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,900
It's really funny.

272
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,370
- Anyway, I'm very grateful.
- All right.

273
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,330
- It was nice to have you there...
- Right. It's touching...

274
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,740
- on such an important day.
- Sure. We should be there.

275
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,940
- It was really nice.
- Right.

276
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,170
Jong Kook, your wedding
wasn't simple at all.

277
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,440
It took 1 hour and 30 minutes.

278
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,880
- It took 1 hour and 30 minutes.
- Hey.

279
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,010
I had to do it.

280
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,950
I paid too much money.

281
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,450
It was 9 p.m. when I got home.

282
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,820
- I paid too much money.
- There was Part Two.

283
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,520
There was Part Two.

284
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,390
Why did you say
your wedding would be simple?

285
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,490
- It was the longest...
- I paid too much money.

286
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,590
wedding ceremony I'd ever been to.

287
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,060
It was the longest one.

288
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,130
Only the main ceremony took an hour.

289
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,560
(Since he waited for a long time,
he did everything others did.)

290
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,060
It was nice that I had enough time.

291
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,160
- I was really happy.
- It was a happy wedding ceremony.

292
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,700
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

293
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,830
If we were going to be like this,
we should've sat down and talked.

294
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,170
- With a table.
- We can go on for over an hour.

295
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,710
I'm glad, though. I thought...

296
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,840
Jong Kook wouldn't let us
talk about it today.

297
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,310
- Is it okay today?
- No.

298
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,610
- We already talked about it.
- We're just talking...

299
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,480
- about what happened.
- Right.

300
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,550
There would be articles about it.

301
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,980
- Hang on.
- What?

302
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,280
We have Tae Hyun here today.

303
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,450
Does that mean...

304
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,090
today's game is about
guessing Jong Kook's wife's job?

305
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,090
(Is today's mission to guess
Jong Kook's wife's job?)

306
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,960
- Hey.
- Today's mission.

307
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
- Dong Hoon.
- Yes.

308
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,630
We can make things up now.

309
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,990
- Tae Hyun.
- What's the problem?

310
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,560
If he doesn't talk about it,

311
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,100
- we can make things up.
- We can make things up.

312
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,970
- Don't do that.
- We can make up her age...

313
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,630
- and her job.
- Don't do that.

314
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,970
Stop it.

315
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,470
From now on, for things
that need to be confidential...

316
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,910
- He kept it secret the whole time.
- You should...

317
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,340
- leave it to Jong Kook.
- Right.

318
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,840
- He's so thorough.
- Leave it to me.

319
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,940
He's a spy.

320
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,380
- I have reasonable doubts.
- What?

321
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,210
Was the whole thing a setup?

322
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,980
(Canard Cha goes into action.)

323
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,320
- Jong Kook.
- Right.

324
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,750
- Jong Kook.
- He's...

325
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,950
I was thinking the same thing.

326
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,090
- I thought he was shooting a show.
- By any chance...

327
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,290
- Right.
- Maybe he is...

328
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,490
- He hired part-timers.
- still living in his old house.

329
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,830
- They were part-timers.
- Right.

330
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,300
- The guests were part-timers.
- Maybe he didn't move out.

331
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,000
- They were part-timers.
- Right.

332
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
- He spent a lot on the setup.
- Anyway,

333
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,440
congratulations, Jong Kook.

334
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,970
- Congratulations.
- This is really nice.

335
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,210
Thank you.

336
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,680
- All right. Today...
- Are we going home now?

337
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
- I want to talk more about it.
- We have a lot to talk about.

338
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,450
- I want to keep talking.
- Right.

339
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,680
Today, we prepared a race
for Cha Tae Hyun,

340
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,580
Kim Jong Kook's best friend.

341
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,320
It's called the Congratulatory
Delegation With Kook's Patience.

342
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,190
Congratulatory Delegation
With Kook's Patience? What's that?

343
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,390
It's to congratulate him
on his wedding.

344
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,890
Jong Kook usually hates it
even when we celebrate his birthday.

345
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,400
- He really hates it.
- I do.

346
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,230
(Even a small birthday party...)

347
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,170
(makes him shudder.)

348
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,670
He's really embarrassed
when we do things like this.

349
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Come here.

350
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,970
I really hate it.

351
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,470
- But you have no choice.
- Seriously.

352
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,810
- We have to celebrate it anyway.
- I hate it.

353
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,110
Get him his birthday meal.

354
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,380
- Don't do that!
- Why...

355
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,180
(Even when he won
the Grand Award...)

356
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,550
- Let's toss him into the air.
- Stop it.

357
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,850
Don't do that!

358
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,020
- We should.
- No.

359
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,990
(He's extremely allergic
to being congratulated.)

360
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,850
- He really hates it.
- Right.

361
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,260
Despite all that,

362
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,390
in order to celebrate
the wonderful occasion,

363
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,090
the production crew prepared
a celebration party...

364
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,560
where we will make a big deal
out of it as much as we can...

365
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,270
- for today's ending.
- There you go!

366
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,300
That's nice.

367
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,830
We should celebrate it together!

368
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,110
(You know that any trend would end
after we tried it on Running Man.)

369
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,980
(This time, we will put an end
to Jong Kook's wedding craze!)

370
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,180
(A splendid celebration party
is ready.)

371
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,750
- Don't do that, seriously.
- Good job.

372
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,250
We should celebrate it together!

373
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,850
If you refuse this again,

374
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,990
- we'll be disappointed.
- He really hates it.

375
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,290
First, get on this.

376
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,660
Move over.

377
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,990
So, before the ending,

378
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,860
we will give Jong Kook
and the members a chance...

379
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,200
to work together
to get rid of the items...

380
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
from the celebration party...

381
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,640
- through the missions.
- We get to remove them.

382
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,940
So we can get rid of items...

383
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,670
- Something corny.
- that are fussy and corny...

384
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,910
through the missions.

385
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,180
- That sounds nice.
- Really?

386
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,210
Jong Kook would love it.

387
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,110
- He will be sure to make it happen.
- Right.

388
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,150
Then, for us...

389
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,680
That doesn't matter to us.

390
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,320
(He's right about that.)

391
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,990
- You should help me.
- Really?

392
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,420
- For my sake.
- Okay.

393
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,660
You brat.

394
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,960
- It doesn't matter to us.
- We don't have to try hard.

395
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,390
- It's not for us.
- Right.

396
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,090
- It's not for us.
- Jong Kook will take care of it.

397
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,390
Jong Kook is the one
who will be embarrassed.

398
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,830
We can do things at ease today.

399
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,060
It will be easy today.

400
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,970
Before you start the first mission,

401
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,640
we asked Jong Kook in advance...

402
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,300
to pick three words he thought
the members would say the most...

403
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,840
- in the opening.
- Okay.

404
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,780
Here are the three words.

405
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,950
- Hello, Jong Kook.
- Hello.

406
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,310
Congratulations on your wedding.

407
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,580
Thank you.

408
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,280
We met that day.

409
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,350
I guess you can predict
what the members would say...

410
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,290
- during the opening.
- Right.

411
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,860
Please pick the three words...

412
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,630
you think
the members will say the most...

413
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,930
during the opening.

414
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,100
- During the opening?
- Yes.

415
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
For your information,
the more often they say...

416
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,700
- the words you have picked,
- Okay.

417
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,770
the more chance cards you will get,
which will help you win.

418
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,010
A wedding and wedding ceremony
are different here, right?

419
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
Yes. They're different.

420
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,210
Now that I'm married,

421
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,240
- I'll choose "wedding."
- Wedding?

422
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,950
They'd talk a lot about my wedding.

423
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,950
And they will mention my wife.

424
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,590
(Jong Kook's pick: Wedding, wife)

425
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,320
I bet they will mention it a lot.

426
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,790
- And I bet they'd mention bride.
- Bride?

427
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,090
Today's game is about
guessing Jong Kook's wife's job?

428
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,260
This is what he said.

429
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,660
"At Jong Kook's wedding,"

430
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,770
"I got really emotional."

431
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,730
- "You had your wedding."
- I'm sorry.

432
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,940
"You had your wedding."

433
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,970
Actually, when articles
about his wedding came out...

434
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,140
He sang at his own wedding.

435
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,880
So, it's to celebrate his wedding.

436
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,780
- Listen to me.
- Before the wedding.

437
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,450
- Before the wedding?
- No.

438
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,780
It was right before the wedding.

439
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,850
- Wedding.
- Right before the wedding.

440
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,950
- It was before the wedding.
- Ye Eun kept asking me.

441
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,690
- It was before the wedding.
- "Am I going to the wedding?"

442
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,990
You didn't mention
a bride even once.

443
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,160
- Bride.
- We wouldn't.

444
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,260
- They didn't.
- Right.

445
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,660
You mentioned his wife once.

446
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,530
And you said wedding 11 times.

447
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,600
- I see.
- Wedding?

448
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,300
We'll give you one chance card...

449
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,640
for every four times
you said the word.

450
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,870
- That's two then.
- Really?

451
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,970
This chance card...

452
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,110
can be used to your advantage
during the missions.

453
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,780
Since you mentioned
the words a total of 12 times,

454
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,020
- we'll give you three chance cards.
- Three cards?

455
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,520
Since the celebration party...

456
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,290
is like a penalty to Jong Kook,

457
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,490
Jong Kook is exempted
from a penalty today.

458
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,120
- Really?
- Oh, no.

459
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,130
- This is a penalty for me.
- That's not fair.

460
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,800
We should hit the soles of his feet.
He's married.

461
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,270
Among the remaining members,

462
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,470
a member to get a penalty
will be added...

463
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,100
every time you use the chance card.

464
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,800
- I see.
- If you use all three cards,

465
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,440
- three members will get a penalty.
- Three members?

466
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,070
- We shouldn't use them then.
- We shouldn't use the cards.

467
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,780
- We shouldn't use them then.
- We shouldn't use the cards.

468
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,940
- Actually...
- Come on.

469
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,380
This is a good day!

470
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,950
(This is a good day!)

471
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,380
Please get changed,

472
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,850
- and we will begin today's race.
- Okay!

473
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,920
(The race will begin
after they get changed.)

474
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,950
I understand your love

475
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,550
Let's go.

476
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,890
(How many party options
will they be able to remove?)

477
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,890
- A dazzlingly beautiful
- Okay.

478
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,030
- Oh, right. I forgot to say that.
- What?

479
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,400
We met Kang Hoon there.

480
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,570
- Right.
- Ye Eun.

481
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,800
I invited Kang Hoon for you.

482
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,070
- She avoided looking at him.
- Ye Eun.

483
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,840
- It was awkward.
- Do you want to marry Kang Hoon?

484
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,040
Do you want to marry Kang Hoon?

485
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,110
Let's talk about it.
If we keep talking, it will work.

486
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,780
- It will take ten years, though.
- Right.

487
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,710
- No.
- The years will make it happen.

488
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,110
She kept stealing glances at him.

489
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,580
- It'll take ten years.
- Is that so?

490
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,420
- She didn't act friendly.
- I know.

491
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,350
When they actually met,

492
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,290
they said hi
and exchanged pleasantries.

493
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,860
But later, while having steak,
she stole glances at him.

494
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,990
(Staring)

495
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,660
I wasn't like that!

496
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,460
- I wasn't like that.
- Hoon looked...

497
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,500
exceptionally handsome that day.

498
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,870
- I agree.
- He looked amazing that day.

499
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,740
I hadn't seen him before
and was surprised by his looks.

500
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,940
- Tell me about it.
- He has broad shoulders too.

501
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,840
Ye Eun was rejected.

502
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,240
- I wasn't.
- Everyone knows that.

503
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,540
I'm not that fond of him.

504
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,310
- I don't like Hoon that much.
- All right.

505
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,280
- What if he asks you out?
- Yes, keep saying that.

506
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,850
- What if Hoon asks?
- What if he asks you out?

507
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,880
He hasn't asked me.

508
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,180
- What if he does?
- What if he does?

509
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,480
- You're thinking about it.
- Answer them already.

510
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,020
- He hasn't asked.
- What if he fell for you...

511
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,150
- at the wedding and asks you out?
- She's thinking about it.

512
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,820
I'll date him, then.

513
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,090
As you should.

514
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,730
(She's not interested in him
but will go out with him.)

515
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,730
She's adorable.

516
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,970
During the opening talk,

517
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,700
Jong Kook received
three chance cards.

518
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
- Sure.
- You'll play a game...

519
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,710
where you can use one of them.

520
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,640
This is Find to Survive.

521
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,280
- Find to Survive?
- We need to find something?

522
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,980
- You will pick one...
- We're playing bingo.

523
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,750
of the nine squares
and reveal what's written.

524
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,820
Your job is to find a non-celebrity
who matches that description.

525
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,220
- That won't be easy.
- Is it a group mission?

526
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,850
If you succeed,

527
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,290
you'll be able to see a portion
of the photo underneath.

528
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,860
- What?
- There's one big photo...

529
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,390
under the numbered squares.

530
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,560
- The location is where the party...
- She's right.

531
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,300
The location is where the party...

532
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,900
- Is it a location?
- A location.

533
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,500
- A location?
- It's a location.

534
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,100
A location?

535
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,340
You have an hour and 30 minutes...

536
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,940
to arrive at the party location
that's indicated on the board.

537
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,080
If you do, you'll get to remove
one of the party ideas.

538
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,750
So that's how it works.

539
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,520
- Okay.
- I see.

540
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,450
For this game, you'll split...

541
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,420
- into 2 teams.
- In 2 teams? Got it.

542
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,190
You'll be grouped based on your age.

543
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,290
Seok Jin, Jae Seok, Jong Kook,
and Tae Hyun will be one team.

544
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,100
- What?
- The older ones.

545
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,530
- Nice.
- This isn't bad.

546
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,170
I don't mind this team.

547
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,500
- It's not a competition.
- Nice.

548
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,770
We're Team YB.

549
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,970
- Team YB.
- Team YB.

550
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,840
- You shouldn't be called young.
- As if you know anything.

551
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,210
You should be Team Flimsy.

552
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,410
- Team Firm and Team Wrinkled.
- Exactly.

553
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,010
We, Team Veteran... Seok Jin.

554
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,380
- That's us.
- Let's show them our wisdom.

555
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,550
Yes, let's show them.

556
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,750
They aren't even married...

557
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,920
- except for Haha.
- I can't believe...

558
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,390
Who knew we'd ever hear that
from you?

559
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,360
- Those unmarried?
- I'm surprised we are...

560
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,790
- hearing you finally say that.
- I know.

561
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,830
Tell me about it.

562
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,930
Until three weeks ago,

563
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,990
I never would've imagined
you saying this.

564
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,960
They haven't even been able
to read the declaration of marriage.

565
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,370
You'll name any square...

566
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,070
- with a number on it.
- Yes.

567
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,410
Find a non-celebrity
that fits the description,

568
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,470
and take a photo with him or her.

569
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,410
They said it was a location.

570
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,140
To identify the building,

571
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,580
should we see the upper half...

572
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,350
or the bottom half? What do you say?

573
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,820
- I say number 4 or 6.
- It's just a matter of luck.

574
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,720
- Right?
- The middle square's too obvious.

575
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,160
I have a feeling the middle square
won't provide any information.

576
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,220
Why bother asking us, then?

577
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,430
- I asked for your opinion.
- You...

578
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,100
This, as with your wedding.
You always do what you want.

579
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,600
That's not it. Hear me out.

580
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,570
The center of the building...

581
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,270
- wouldn't stand out or anything.
- No.

582
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,000
- Number 1 or 3, then?
- Jong Kook.

583
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,970
What's the first digit
of the cash gift he gave you?

584
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,610
- Come on.
- That's not nice.

585
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,580
- Stop it.
- Then, what's the last digit?

586
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,350
- It's 0, right?
- It's 0, of course.

587
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,480
Choose number three, then.

588
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,050
- You obviously want to choose that.
- Really?

589
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,480
- Sure.
- Let's go with number three.

590
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,620
- Go ahead.
- We'll see what's in slot three.

591
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,920
(The newlywed chose number 3.)

592
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,690
(Who will they have to find?)

593
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,030
(A cosplayer)

594
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,530
(Find a cosplayer
in the middle of the Hongdae area?)

595
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,860
- A cosplayer?
- Are you kidding me?

596
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,600
There are cosplayers...

597
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,630
in the Hongdae area,
but it's too early in the day.

598
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,030
Who cosplays in the morning?

599
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,900
- Exactly.
- They do in the Hongdae area.

600
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,770
Isn't it too early in the day
for people to cosplay?

601
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,810
(The silent Hongdae area
on a Monday morning)

602
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,550
No one cosplays at this hour.

603
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,410
It all depends on the degree
of cosplay you'll accept.

604
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,320
- Let's take a look around.
- Let's get searching.

605
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,420
It'll be fun to spot a cosplayer.

606
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,020
It'll be hard to find a cosplayer
at this hour.

607
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,120
There won't be anyone.

608
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,860
Which should we go for?
The one in the middle?

609
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,960
How about slot five?

610
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,290
- I love it.
- Sounds good.

611
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,890
Okay, reveal
what's under number five.

612
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,200
I always start with the middle one.

613
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,600
- One, two, three.
- I don't know about this one.

614
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,230
- Backwards?
- A person walking backwards.

615
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,670
Find someone walking backwards...

616
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,770
and take a photo to succeed.

617
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,670
- A person walking backwards?
- A person walking backwards?

618
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,840
- Hold on.
- Haha.

619
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,240
What about these places?

620
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,440
Older men walk on pebbled streets...

621
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,050
- to massage their feet.
- As a massage.

622
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,080
There are people who walk like this.

623
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,150
- Where would those be?
- Those are rare.

624
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,150
We should get searching.

625
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,480
- Here?
- On walking trails.

626
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,620
- Maybe over there?
- Wouldn't it be up in the woods?

627
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,460
- There's something similar there.
- Let's go over there.

628
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,020
- Let's go there.
- Why don't we head over there?

629
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,060
Sure.

630
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,360
Haha, where's the main street?
Over there?

631
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,290
Hold on. A cosplayer?

632
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,000
I told you we should've gone
with slot number five.

633
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,500
- Well...
- Hey!

634
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,800
I remembered something else...

635
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,140
- that upset me.
- What is it?

636
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,540
Why did you only tell us
on Monday...

637
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,310
but called Joo Woo Jae
the day before?

638
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,280
Exactly. You told Woo Jae and Hoon
the day before you told us.

639
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,740
He told them the day before.

640
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,180
- That upset me.
- It's like this.

641
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,950
Guys, hear me out.

642
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,050
I wanted to film your reactions.

643
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,480
My initial plan was
to film your reactions...

644
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,850
and play the reaction video
at my wedding.

645
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,660
- I see.
- That was my plan.

646
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,090
You made a fuss
out of the whole thing.

647
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,330
- I didn't. Between us...
- He made a huge fuss.

648
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,160
Because the venue was decorated
with hanging plants and flowers,

649
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,030
I couldn't play the video.

650
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,700
- Really?
- I was told it couldn't be done.

651
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,330
- When the video had been edited?
- Yes.

652
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,100
- Really?
- Anyway,

653
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,040
that's why I told you
in the morning...

654
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,270
and called Woo Jae and the others
the day before...

655
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,410
- No wonder.
- to tell them.

656
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,410
It makes sense now.
I heard you told the Dragon Club...

657
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,710
- via video call as well.
- Yes, by video call.

658
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,720
- I see.
- I thought Tae Hyun already knew.

659
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,920
Gosh, hello.

660
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,390
- I'm from Hong Kong.
- I see. Hello.

661
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,020
Isn't she dressed as a sailor?

662
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,490
- She's a cosplayer.
- Isn't she dressed as a sailor?

663
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,860
(Have they already found
a cosplayer?)

664
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,460
(What?)

665
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,730
(American Matroos)

666
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,970
Is she a cosplayer?
Could we talk to you for a bit?

667
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,830
- You see...
- Right.

668
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,840
I see your Korean is good.

669
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,940
Not really.

670
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,410
Can you only speak a little of it?

671
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,370
- Just a little.
- I can barely speak it.

672
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,210
- Are you from Hong Kong?
- Yes, Hong Kong.

673
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,080
- I see.
- I like Hong Kong.

674
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,350
Thank you.

675
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,880
From the way you're dressed,

676
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,090
you look like you're trying
to be someone else.

677
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,720
(Giving her the gaze)

678
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,320
- A cosplay?
- Yes, cosplay.

679
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,460
(Nodding)

680
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,660
- Maybe a member of a girl group.
- Me?

681
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,200
- That's right. A girl group, maybe?
- Are you cosplaying?

682
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I'm not.
I'm just pretty, that's all.

683
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,800
- I see.
- You just have good fashion sense.

684
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,200
(They gave her the eye,
but it didn't work.)

685
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
- I love how you're dressed.
- Thank you, anyway.

686
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

687
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,570
I love you.

688
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,840
We would've believed her
if she said she was cosplaying.

689
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,880
Tell me about it.

690
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,240
She could've been dressed...

691
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,650
- as a girl group member.
- I know.

692
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,280
- A cosplayer...
- Finding a cosplayer?

693
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,950
- A cosplayer?
- No one cosplays this early.

694
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,220
- No one cosplays this early.
- What time is it?

695
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,160
Why don't we cross the street
and take a look?

696
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,290
Would there be cosplayers
across the street?

697
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,090
- Wait.
- What is it?

698
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,190
- Isn't she a cosplayer?
- She must've dressed up.

699
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,900
(They see someone across the street
in clothes that stand out.)

700
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,800
- Ma'am.
- She has to be a cosplayer.

701
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,070
We should ask her.

702
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,300
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am?

703
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,140
I love her clothes.

704
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,610
- Ma'am.
- She must be a cosplayer.

705
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,370
- Hello.
- Hello.

706
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,080
- It's good to see you.
- Do you have a minute to talk?

707
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,610
You must be a cosplayer.

708
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,410
- Are you the owner?
- Actually, I'm not.

709
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,750
I'm a part-timer.

710
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,450
- A part-timer?
- Aren't you the owner?

711
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,750
- Could we talk for a bit?
- Sorry?

712
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,220
Were you getting ready
to open the shop?

713
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,250
I was.

714
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,120
Even from across the street,

715
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,760
- we could tell...
- Exactly.

716
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,290
that you got the idea
from someone else.

717
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,890
- You dressed like someone.
- We thought...

718
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,030
that you were copying the vibe
of someone else.

719
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,430
- Were you inspired by someone?
- Is that right?

720
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,560
(Nodding)

721
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,700
- Who?
- Who was I inspired by?

722
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,100
- That's right.
- Who inspired your outfit today?

723
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,370
What's the vibe
you were aiming for today?

724
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,010
The vibe?

725
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,340
Jang Won Young?

726
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,910
Is that a bit too much?

727
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,610
- I'm afraid so.
- That's a bit too much.

728
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,810
Who, then?

729
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,210
- Urban Zakapa?
- Could it be...

730
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,220
- Gosh, no.
- Urban Zakapa?

731
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,290
Isn't she like the member
from Urban Zakapa?

732
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,720
- Jo Hyun Ah.
- I see.

733
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,520
- My vibe for today? I usually...
- I think...

734
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,030
dress how I want to
rather than copying others.

735
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,060
(They fail yet again.)

736
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,700
You weren't inspired by anyone.

737
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,700
She isn't a cosplayer.

738
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,630
You see, we have to...

739
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,070
- meet a cosplayer today.
- Urban Zakapa.

740
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,270
- Have a good day, then.
- Are we asking and answering?

741
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,070
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

742
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,510
- The Hongdae area...
- The sun is burning hot.

743
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,440
- This is great.
- I haven't been here in a while.

744
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
Check out this place.

745
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,350
- I have no business here now.
- I used to come here a lot.

746
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,150
Seok Sam and I came here sometimes
to buy clothes.

747
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,520
We bought some clothes here.

748
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,650
Let's go to Olive Young and shop.

749
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,760
Shop for what?
Something for your wife?

750
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,120
Of course not.

751
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,190
You've been wanting
to go these places...

752
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,730
- a lot lately.
- That's not it.

753
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,300
Since I moved into a new house,

754
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,130
there are still some things to buy.

755
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,400
- I'm almost out of toothpaste.
- This is what...

756
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,700
- my wife said yesterday.
- What did she say?

757
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,540
"Is Jong Kook waking up..."

758
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,410
- Of course.
- "beside his wife now?"

759
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,580
- Seok Jin.
- Yes?

760
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,180
Why are you so curious
about his married life?

761
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,150
- I'm just sharing an anecdote.
- Hold on.

762
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,680
We need to focus on our task.

763
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,220
I'm looking around as I talk.

764
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,050
- The streets are too silent.
- There aren't any people here.

765
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,890
That's understandable,
since it's Monday morning.

766
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,490
It's 11 a.m. on a Monday.

767
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,460
It's too early for cosplayers.

768
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,430
We could run into them
in the evening because...

769
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,690
they could be off to a party.

770
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,930
- Who'd be cosplaying at this hour?
- I know.

771
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,600
Where do we find a cosplayer?

772
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,230
He's a free-spirited man.

773
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,670
Hold on a second.

774
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,240
The streets are empty...

775
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,270
- with this being a Monday.
- How can we find anyone...

776
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,610
when there aren't
any people out here?

777
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,170
- We...
- Yes?

778
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,710
We walked a great deal
and crossed the entire Hongdae area.

779
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,510
- We walked a lot.
- There aren't any people.

780
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,610
We've covered quite the distance.

781
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,150
This is bad.

782
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,280
We'll have to cash in a chance card
at this rate.

783
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,150
Let's use one. We're out of time.

784
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,620
I have a feeling
we'll run into a cosplayer.

785
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,760
Someone might appear out of nowhere.

786
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,790
Check out the people
over there at that hair salon.

787
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,730
- Doesn't that overwhelm you?
- Wait.

788
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,400
- Doesn't that scream cosplay?
- That's cosplay for sure.

789
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,700
It's like I'm seeing
anime characters.

790
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,370
The one on the left
has to be a cosplayer.

791
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,530
She's a cosplayer for sure.

792
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,600
The one on the left has to be cosplaying.
Check out her skirt.

793
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,770
- Don't you agree?
- She...

794
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,970
- Hello.
- Hi.

795
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,910
She has to be cosplaying. Wait!

796
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,240
You must be cosplaying.

797
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,310
Aren't you dressed
as an anime character?

798
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,410
I saw this character
in an animation.

799
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,510
- Yes. Isn't this cosplay?
- Right?

800
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,410
- You're cosplaying an animation.
- Right?

801
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,180
- What...
- You look so...

802
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,720
- No?
- You look like a character.

803
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,820
- The feel...
- I think so.

804
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,050
Aren't you cosplaying?

805
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,450
- This animation.
- You could be in this animation.

806
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,220
- Isn't this you?
- Aren't you her?

807
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,090
- This looks like you.
- Isn't this you?

808
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,830
(It's a similar look.)

809
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,960
- You look identical.
- You look the same.

810
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,200
- No?
- Isn't this you?

811
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
(Getting excited)

812
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,600
- This looks like you.
- Don't you like animation?

813
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,240
- I do.
- What do you like?

814
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,910
"Evangelion."

815
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,070
- "Evangelion," the lead!
- She could be from that.

816
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,310
- Does she look like them?
- You look like the lead.

817
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,880
- Not really.
- Wouldn't you say...

818
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,180
that character
influenced your sense of fashion?

819
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,580
- Yes, right? A bit. See?
- Yes.

820
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,920
What's your name?

821
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,790
It's Eun Ha.

822
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,790
- Eun Ha.
- Yes.

823
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,560
You look like you're cosplaying
an animation character.

824
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,820
- Right?
- Yes.

825
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,090
Are we wrong?
You look like a cosplayer.

826
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,560
- The character with headphones.
- You look like them.

827
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,430
- What character is your favorite?
- At a glance...

828
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,800
(Shooting her a look)

829
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
She's obviously a cosplayer.

830
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,240
- Pose like one of the characters.
- What?

831
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,670
(Whispering)

832
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
(Begging her to cosplay)

833
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,310
- What the...
- Please.

834
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,480
We've been walking for 40 minutes.
Help us out, Eun Ha.

835
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,350
Please help.

836
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,580
- "Galaxy..."
- No?

837
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,750
(Please...)

838
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,050
- "Galaxy..."
- Your style.

839
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,090
It was influenced
by some animations, right?

840
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,730
Yes. I copied their hairstyle.

841
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,630
- You copied their hair?
- Your hair.

842
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,100
(The begging worked.)

843
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,800
- Whose hairstyle?
- Rei's.

844
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,970
- Rei's!
- Rei's!

845
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,500
- This is a cosplay.
- Not IVE's REI, right?

846
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,070
- No.
- Which Rei?

847
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,040
- From "Evangelion."
- Rei from "Evangelion."

848
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,410
- Look it up.
- That's who she is.

849
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,410
Rei from "Evangelion."

850
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,310
Look it up. Does it work?

851
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,440
It's a bit off, but...

852
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,080
- This is her!
- This is her!

853
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,710
(Insisting...)

854
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,180
(in unison)

855
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,520
"Evangelion!"

856
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,590
- Rei!
- Rei!

857
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,920
We found her.

858
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,620
- We found her.
- This counts.

859
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,060
- After much hard work...
- Yes.

860
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,160
- At a hairdresser in Hongdae.
- A Hongdae hairdresser. Eun Ha.

861
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,360
- Eun Ha whom we nicknamed "Galaxy."
- "Galaxy."

862
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,600
She's cosplaying
Rei from "Evangelion."

863
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,030
- We found her!
- We found her!

864
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,000
- This is incredible.
- We found someone.

865
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,700
I thought
she'd hopped out of an animation.

866
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,100
She looks so much like Rei.

867
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,240
- Thanks, Eun Ha.
- Thank you.

868
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,680
You found someone
that fits slot number three.

869
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,450
- It was hard.
- It was a stretch,

870
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,610
you must admit,
but we're doing this to celebrate,

871
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,080
so we'll give you
the number three slot.

872
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,050
If you peel the instruction
under number three,

873
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,890
- We peel this?
- you'll see part of the photo.

874
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,360
- Really?
- Okay.

875
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
(Isn't the center too obvious?)

876
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,530
(1 or 3?)

877
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:14,060
(What photo is under the number
Jong Kook thought hard to choose?)

878
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,500
- Let's do that here.
- Yes.

879
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,170
(They check the photo
of the location.)

880
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,200
Okay. Number three.

881
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,500
This is rough.

882
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,310
We can't tell from this.

883
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,110
(Branches cover the building.)

884
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,310
- This is rough.
- We can't tell from this.

885
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,220
Let's see. A building...

886
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,150
The shape of the building...

887
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,990
If this corner's here,
it faces this way, so we can't tell.

888
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,720
- It's like this.
- The roof could be connected.

889
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,730
- There could be a structure.
- We can't say.

890
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,030
- We could've gotten it.
- If we're to guess,

891
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,330
- we need number 5 or 2.
- Yes.

892
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,170
The other team just got number five.

893
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,900
- Oh, really? Can we look?
- You can...

894
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,300
- peel that one too.
- Really?

895
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,800
- Someone walking backwards?
- How did they manage?

896
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,470
- How?
- How did they find someone?

897
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,340
(A person walking backwards)

898
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,210
(Go to a crowded place!)

899
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,510
(Then we just...)

900
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,710
(Let's walk backwards!)

901
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,250
(They decide to tempt people
to copy them.)

902
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,620
- Goodness.
- Let's do it.

903
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,620
(And so begins
the backward-walking flash mob.)

904
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,830
(After walking in circles
for a while...)

905
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,900
(A child thinks it looks like fun
and joins in!)

906
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,430
(Backwards!)

907
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,400
(Walking backwards is a success.)

908
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,770
(Team YB scores slot 5
after 30 minutes.)

909
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,380
They found someone...

910
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,910
- walking backwards?
- Yes, they did.

911
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,710
Someone walking backwards...

912
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,780
How did they manage?

913
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,050
What's this?

914
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,050
- What's this?
- See?

915
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,420
- It's weird.
- The center means nothing.

916
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,320
The crew wouldn't make it...

917
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,420
so simple and easy to decipher.

918
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,230
- This is...
- The clue could be in the corners.

919
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,860
- Like number 7 or 9.
- This is frustrating.

920
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,960
- Let's go with six next.
- The center is pointless.

921
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,700
- What is this?
- A building looks like this?

922
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,500
- I think...
- We should go with this.

923
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
I want to go with 1 or 6.

924
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,770
- Six? That's not a bad idea.
- Yes.

925
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,940
- It makes sense.
- I think six would be good too.

926
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,180
- Number 6.
- Number 6.

927
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,680
Let's have a look first.

928
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,910
- There are lots of foreigners.
- A foreigner?

929
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,710
- There are many foreigners.
- I'll explain the rules.

930
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,750
- I guess we have to win.
- What do we have to do?

931
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,920
Without telling the foreigner
you'll play a word game with them,

932
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,720
(Without telling them
it's a word game)

933
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,190
you exchange a brief hello,
then say the word we give you.

934
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,300
You succeed if they say a word
starting with the right syllable.

935
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,400
- I see.
- For example...

936
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,760
That's way too hard.

937
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,100
- In Korean?
- In Korean?

938
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,200
In Korean?

939
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,300
- Let's use a chance card.
- We must use a chance card.

940
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
- Gosh.
- "Where are you from?"

941
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,040
Your keyword is "Gangnam."
Now once you meet a foreigner,

942
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,910
without any explanation,
you say "Gangnam."

943
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,510
If we say "Gangnam,"
they must say...

944
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,580
- "Namja" meaning "man."
- Anything starting with "nam."

945
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,610
- Okay. You got that, right?
- Yes.

946
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,320
- It's hard.
- This is hard.

947
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,720
Lots of language school students
come here.

948
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,250
- But Haha...
- Language school students.

949
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,450
- There are lots.
- If you look,

950
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,360
- you can tell if they're fluent.
- Yes.

951
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,530
Guys. The subway station's that way.

952
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,590
We must go that way.

953
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,630
- Let's go that way.
- We must.

954
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,730
- We must go that way.
- Where there's a crowd.

955
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,300
- We must find a crowd.
- Okay.

956
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,570
Foreigners who know us
will make eye contact.

957
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,770
- Well...
- That's right.

958
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,000
As he said,
make eye contact and smile.

959
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,040
- That's right.
- "Now we'll begin."

960
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,210
"Okay, listen. 'Gangnam.'"

961
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,310
"Namdaemun."

962
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,410
"Gangnam." Say it like this.

963
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,920
Haha. We have to find a foreigner
who stares at us.

964
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,450
It's not summer vacation season.

965
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,420
Anyone can tell
they don't speak Korean.

966
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,790
Let's do this, guys.

967
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,130
How about you two friendly ladies,

968
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,400
- Yes.
- since you're cute...

969
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,930
You're adorable.

970
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,070
Approach with a smile, okay?

971
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,740
Make eye contact and converse
with them as much as you can.

972
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,140
- "What's your name?"
- "What's your name?"

973
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,610
"We are Running Man."

974
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,880
- "We are Running Man. Are you..."
- "Game start."

975
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,980
- Haha.
- Over there. Let's have a go.

976
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,210
Is it a foreigner?

977
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,410
- They don't look fluent.
- She's wearing a hijab.

978
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,820
I doubt she speaks Korean.

979
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,120
- Say the syllables separately.
- She knows us.

980
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,290
Hang on.

981
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,620
Hello.

982
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,720
- They're coming.
- They're coming.

983
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,820
Ask if they speak English.

984
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,360
- Can you speak Korean?
- Hello.

985
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,000
- No, I can't speak Korean.
- Oh, no.

986
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,560
(What a shame...)

987
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,670
- What a pity.
- Where are you from?

988
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,440
- I'm from Malaysia.
- Malaysia.

989
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,710
- What mission are you doing now?
- Oh, yes!

990
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,240
- Yes.
- Okay.

991
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,210
She asked about a mission.

992
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,910
- Okay.
- You're a Running Man kid.

993
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,720
(The fan noticed
they were doing a mission.)

994
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,180
- We can't explain the game.
- Korean, no?

995
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,690
Korean, no.

996
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,690
(Neither of them speaks Korean.)

997
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,360
Use eye contact
to make a connection.

998
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,420
- Yes.
- Use your eyes.

999
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,430
Okay.

1000
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,290
- Eye contact.
- We're a variety show, game show.

1001
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,800
- Eye contact.
- Okay.

1002
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,700
- Eye contact.
- Okay.

1003
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,930
"Gangnam?"

1004
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,540
"Gangnam?"

1005
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,810
"Gangnam?"

1006
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,410
"Namdaemun?"

1007
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,480
(Gangnam-Namdaemun)

1008
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,720
(They got it in one go.)

1009
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,720
- I got chills.
- I have goosebumps.

1010
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,130
- I'm serious.
- Did that just happen?

1011
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,490
- For real? Thank you.
- Look.

1012
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,530
- We got it, right?
- Look.

1013
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,260
- We did it?
- Oh, my gosh.

1014
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,630
Mission clear.

1015
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,930
- Seriously?
- Mission clear.

1016
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,940
Mission success.

1017
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,400
- Oh, my gosh.
- Mission complete.

1018
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,240
That was insane. You did so well.

1019
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,840
- Brilliant.
- Why did you say...

1020
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,210
Why did you say "Namdaemun?"

1021
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,350
Because it's on our trip list.

1022
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,450
- I see.
- We're going to Namdaemun.

1023
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,850
(We're going to Namdaemun!)

1024
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,150
- That's incredible.
- My gosh.

1025
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,750
- Thank you.
- We did it.

1026
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,490
I got actual goosebumps.

1027
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,920
Thank you!

1028
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,760
- I got goosebumps.
- Thank you.

1029
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,560
- That was madness.
- Seriously.

1030
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,290
- My gosh.
- Where's Kim Jong Kook?

1031
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,630
- Kim Jong Kook?
- Kim Jong Kook?

1032
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,300
- A newlywed.
- A newlywed.

1033
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,830
- Wedding.
- Wedding, yes.

1034
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,170
(The whole world
knows about his wedding.)

1035
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,170
Okay, a picture.

1036
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,740
For the 1st time, the 1st attempt.

1037
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,670
- That was awesome.
- As soon as we started.

1038
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,810
You succeeded,
so you can peel that slot too.

1039
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

1040
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,080
Let's have a look. One, two,

1041
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,550
- three.
- Gosh, this one...

1042
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,580
- Hey. Hang on.
- One, two...

1043
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,490
- Hey.
- I think I know where this is.

1044
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,920
(Quite a bit of the building
is exposed.)

1045
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,460
It's a huge building.

1046
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,860
I think this is...
You know intestine alley, right?

1047
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,360
- Intestine alley in Mapo.
- No, Haha.

1048
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,260
There's a clothing store there
that looks like this.

1049
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,470
This place looks familiar.
I saw this place a lot.

1050
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,400
- Shall we pass it by?
- I want to check it out.

1051
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,840
There used to be
a massive clothing store.

1052
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,410
I think this is a clothing store.

1053
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,410
Let's check it out.
We have nothing to lose.

1054
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,810
Haha. Isn't that AK Plaza?

1055
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,010
(AK Plaza is located
across the street.)

1056
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,350
(Is the building right in front
of them their destination?)

1057
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,890
No, it has to have pine trees.

1058
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,390
- I think that's it.
- Wait a minute.

1059
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,460
- This section. This is it.
- The window...

1060
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,120
- It's not!
- The left side.

1061
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,160
- Isn't that it with the lines?
- No, Haha. Then...

1062
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,330
Or CGV?

1063
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,730
- No, I don't think that's it.
- That's not it.

1064
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,760
- Let's go there.
- A gray building.

1065
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,500
- It's a gray building.
- Haha, number one or...

1066
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,330
Hey,
there's a pine tree below there.

1067
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,570
Then, shall we take one more off?

1068
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,370
Haha, I think we can take off
number 1 or number 2.

1069
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,570
We have to do another mission.

1070
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,610
The other team is looking
for number two now.

1071
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:07,340
We'll have the answer if we take off
number two. I think I know this.

1072
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,480
(It seems like they'll be certain
once they take number 2 off too.)

1073
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,550
Got it.

1074
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,450
- It just let go.
- My goodness.

1075
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,120
Hey, this just let it go.

1076
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,590
(They're playing
the claw machine game?)

1077
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,690
I mean, it just let go.

1078
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,790
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

1079
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,660
"A person with 15 keychains."

1080
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,360
There could be someone like this.

1081
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,830
- But 15? That won't be easy.
- I know, right?

1082
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,930
Hang on.

1083
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,630
- Oh, wait.
- That person has a few.

1084
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,060
- How many?
- Two.

1085
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,070
Oh, two.

1086
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,170
That person has some too.

1087
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,270
- A keychain.
- One?

1088
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,640
- She has one, right?
- Yes.

1089
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,740
- One over there.
- Just one.

1090
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,970
Usually, people only have one.

1091
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,340
Honestly, someone with 15...

1092
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,370
- No one does that.
- Right.

1093
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,440
- But for this one,
- We should use the chance.

1094
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,880
we should use the chance, right?

1095
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,280
- You've used a hint.
- Yes.

1096
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,680
As a result...

1097
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,580
- Five of them?
- Five.

1098
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,620
It got better.

1099
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,580
We could just buy five of them...

1100
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,150
and give them to someone
as a present.

1101
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,920
- Well, in that case...
- Let's look for it.

1102
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,860
Shall we go to the claw machine arcade
and get five of them?

1103
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Is that a claw machine arcade?

1104
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,330
I'm already spending ten dollars.

1105
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,490
Already?

1106
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,660
Right now, we are...

1107
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,600
How much are we spending?

1108
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,100
- Hang on. This...
- Shoot!

1109
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,030
I have to move this.

1110
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,100
That's it. Like this.

1111
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,270
That's it!

1112
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,770
(Right then,
Jae Seok wins the first keychain.)

1113
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:09,940
- Did you get it?
- All right.

1114
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,770
- Gosh, what's wrong with me?
- Okay, here's one.

1115
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,880
So, that's how you do it.

1116
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,850
You use money
to move it to the side.

1117
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,080
What? Why can't I win anything?

1118
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,250
Haven't you won any?

1119
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,690
Gosh, this is so annoying.

1120
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,790
(About to go into the machine)

1121
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,890
(Shouting)

1122
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,330
Do I have to grab this one?

1123
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,200
(Looking around)

1124
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,700
But this gives you coins.

1125
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,100
- Aren't you supposed to use coins?
- Coins.

1126
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,230
I don't think it takes coins.

1127
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,540
Let's just win a few...

1128
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,500
and give it to someone
who has a keychain.

1129
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,670
Why is it so...

1130
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,970
Darn it!

1131
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,540
(Losing his self-control
just like his friend)

1132
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,740
Once more. I think this will work.

1133
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,840
- Try it.
- I'll try it.

1134
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,980
Darn it! Why won't it work?

1135
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,320
I got this one. No!

1136
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,090
(Shouting)

1137
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,090
Come here, punk!

1138
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,190
- No!
- It's good. Leave it there.

1139
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,790
(The new groom is soaked
in dopamine.)

1140
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,330
I don't think this works.

1141
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,630
This is so weird.

1142
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,900
- That's not right, don't you think?
- No.

1143
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,300
Hey, I got two.

1144
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,770
- Did you get two?
- Yes.

1145
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,670
- You won two? You're so good.
- So, we just need one more.

1146
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,900
- We have three.
- Yes?

1147
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,840
- Someone who has 3?
- We can find someone with 2.

1148
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,040
Yes, you're right.

1149
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,780
- Oh, you're right.
- Give me a dollar.

1150
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,840
(Give me a dollar.)

1151
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,680
- Hand it over. I have to win this.
- Hey, I...

1152
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,580
- No.
- Hurry up and give me a dollar.

1153
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,850
Do you have a dollar bill?

1154
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,080
I'll pay for it with my card.

1155
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,820
- Okay, pay with your card. Go on.
- Yes.

1156
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,920
- How many rounds do you want?
- Last one!

1157
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,920
- Six rounds.
- I'll pay for six rounds.

1158
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
- Okay.
- My goodness.

1159
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,260
You must be thinking of your wife.

1160
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,990
- Gosh, you'd never play six rounds.
- Well...

1161
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,390
- There you go. You can play.
- Did it go through? It worked.

1162
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,700
- Is that 20 dollars?
- You can play.

1163
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,860
(New Groom Kim even uses
other people's money in the end.)

1164
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,970
The claw just slides by it.

1165
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,900
- Just sliding by.
- Darn it.

1166
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,540
It won't work. Let's just go.

1167
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,670
- Play what we already paid for.
- One more time.

1168
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,370
- Darn it.
- Hey, in life,

1169
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,540
even worse things can happen.

1170
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,980
No, but this is just too mean.

1171
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,210
I had it right
by the entrance earlier.

1172
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,280
I know.

1173
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,380
Go to the side a little.

1174
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,480
- Oh, this one?
- That way. Yes.

1175
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,650
- Like this?
- That's it.

1176
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,750
- There you go.
- Like this?

1177
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,880
- Oh, that's a good idea.
- Yes.

1178
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,990
- Then, it might roll as it falls.
- That's it. You should do that.

1179
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,720
- A bit towards the head.
- Yes.

1180
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,860
You're done after this.

1181
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,760
All right. Let's win!

1182
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,930
(Will he be able to succeed
this time?)

1183
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,230
- Yes!
- You won!

1184
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,070
(He finally won!)

1185
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,570
(The two friends are ecstatic.)

1186
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,400
There, we did it. Let's go.

1187
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,840
- It's so cute!
- Hey.

1188
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,710
- My gosh.
- There are two rounds left.

1189
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,110
It's so adorable.

1190
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,280
Look at this.

1191
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,840
(Bragging to everyone)

1192
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,310
It looks so cute. Look at this.

1193
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,250
- Okay.
- Hey, the tongue is pink.

1194
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,250
(In love)

1195
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,280
- We did it.
- Let's go now.

1196
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,520
My gosh. It's cute.

1197
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Gosh, we did it.

1198
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,990
We should find someone with two.

1199
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,260
There are so many people
who have one.

1200
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,860
(Admiring his win)

1201
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,090
So fluffy.

1202
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:48,600
(Laughing)

1203
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,930
(The dopamine man has returrned
to being an egen boy.)

1204
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,100
- This is so much fun.
- So fluffy.

1205
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,670
Seriously, though.
He has changed so much.

1206
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,970
- He has changed.
- He has changed a lot.

1207
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,410
But it's cute, Seok Jin.

1208
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,640
- Look at this. Look at the face.
- He didn't use to like this stuff.

1209
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,410
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

1210
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,980
(The power of love
sure is surprising.)

1211
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,450
Love has changed a man this much.

1212
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,890
Wait, then we just have to
find someone with a keychain now.

1213
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,120
- Right.
- We have four, right?

1214
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,790
- We can gift it to someone, right?
- It might be...

1215
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,960
- Honestly,
- Right.

1216
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,090
I hope we can find someone
with as many as possible.

1217
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,360
I don't want to give this away.

1218
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,660
- Right.
- Sure.

1219
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,300
- I can see a few keychains on them.
- They have many.

1220
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,000
- They have many.
- They have many keychains.

1221
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,300
- Oh, they have a lot.
- Hey, how many is that?

1222
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,470
- How many? Two?
- Hey, look.

1223
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,870
Oh, they have lots of keychains.

1224
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,100
Hello.

1225
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,670
- Hey, look at their keychains!
- My gosh.

1226
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,170
- Hey, they have a lot.
- How many keychains is that?

1227
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,510
- What?
- Hang on. They have so many.

1228
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,310
They have a lot. How many is that?

1229
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,980
- Hello.
- Is it okay?

1230
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,250
- She has so many keychains.
- Hello.

1231
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,250
How many keychains do you have?

1232
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,480
- Keychains.
- Keychains.

1233
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,880
- How many are there?
- One moment. One.

1234
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,520
- Two. Three.
- My gosh.

1235
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,990
- Four. Five!
- Hey!

1236
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,190
- What? Five!
- Five.

1237
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,360
- We found someone with five?
- For real?

1238
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,820
Could you please show us?

1239
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,090
- Please turn around.
- The keychains. Just a moment.

1240
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,690
- Two.
- Are you okay?

1241
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,060
One, two, three,

1242
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,600
- four, five.
- Five keychains.

1243
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,370
- Hey, but she has exactly 5.
- How does she have exactly 5?

1244
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,670
- My gosh.
- This is awesome.

1245
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,100
Why did we go and spend money here?

1246
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,300
Oh, you're right.

1247
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,770
- That's right.
- Hey, I get to...

1248
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,710
- That's right.
- Hey, I get to take this with me.

1249
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,840
(This guy is happy.)

1250
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,880
- Out of these,
- Is this so cute?

1251
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,510
- you should pick one you want.
- Is there something you'd like?

1252
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,210
(Sliding down)

1253
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,550
- Indeed, that's the cutest, right?
- This one?

1254
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,850
- Yes.
- I'll take this one.

1255
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,250
- Yes, you can have that.
- That one is the cutest.

1256
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,250
- You didn't want to give her yours.
- You didn't want to give it up.

1257
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,020
I guess it's meant for someone.

1258
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,190
(Hiding it)

1259
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,330
Hey, but Hye Jin helped us out.

1260
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,590
Why are you keeping that hidden?

1261
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,400
She didn't seem
very interested in it.

1262
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,830
- Why won't you let her see it?
- I mean...

1263
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,130
- I have to keep one too.
- She helped us out.

1264
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,730
- It looks...
- Anyway, thank you.

1265
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,230
- Hye Jin. Yes.
- Thank you.

1266
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,870
- Okay.
- Thank you, Hye Jin.

1267
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,200
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1268
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,270
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

1269
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,270
Which number should we choose?

1270
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,480
- I...
- Hey, Ji Hyo should pick.

1271
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,880
- I want one from the bottom.
- Okay, the bottom?

1272
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,410
- The bottom?
- Mapo.

1273
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,710
- Gu.
- Sure, if we go with this...

1274
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,320
Or for this top part,

1275
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,780
- We can kind of guess.
- we have a rough idea, yes.

1276
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,790
So, I want to take off
the bottom part and see.

1277
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,950
- Okay.
- It's this one, right?

1278
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,790
"Eat next to someone..."

1279
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,190
- "dining alone."
- Plenty of people do that.

1280
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,230
You must find someone dining alone
at a restaurant, order food,

1281
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,860
and eat next to them to succeed.

1282
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,530
- Hang on. I know this.
- Lots of people dine alone.

1283
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,770
There's a place
where people dine alone over there.

1284
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,230
- Right. Then...
- A barbecue place. You know, right?

1285
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,200
Also, if you go to a ramyeon place,
everyone eats alone.

1286
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,900
- That's it!
- You're right.

1287
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,670
- That makes sense.
- This won't be hard.

1288
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,540
There's a barbecue place
where you eat alone.

1289
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,710
- No, but...
- Rice noodles too.

1290
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,180
- If you go to Soi Yeonnam...
- Soi Yeonnam.

1291
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,610
- There's definitely someone.
- Someone eating alone.

1292
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,880
There has to be...

1293
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,080
- at Soi Yeonnam.
- Soi Yeonnam.

1294
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,320
- Why? No.
- But...

1295
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,720
You just want to eat at Soi Yeonnam,
don't you?

1296
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,590
- Ji Hyo.
- Just be quiet about that.

1297
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,160
- Look around you and keep quiet.
- But...

1298
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,620
Where on earth is Soi Yeonnam?

1299
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,230
Let's not waste time
and start walking, okay?

1300
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,530
All right. Let's go.

1301
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,830
- But there has to be someone...
- Lots of people eat alone there.

1302
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,330
- eating alone there.
- I went and ate there alone.

1303
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,760
Gosh, but I really am hungry.

1304
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,970
I'm hungry too.

1305
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,470
Hey, where do you think
this building is?

1306
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,170
Haha,
that's not in this neighborhood.

1307
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,540
Where do you think it is, then?

1308
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,370
It's somewhere we've been to
at least once.

1309
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,880
Wouldn't it be a meaningful place?

1310
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,180
- Haha.
- It is meaningful too.

1311
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,610
I think...

1312
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,880
it'll be Prism Tower.

1313
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,980
- Where?
- Prism Tower.

1314
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,150
- What? Prism doesn't have that.
- That one time,

1315
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
there were pine trees.

1316
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,850
- We played with water balloons.
- It's not Prism Tower.

1317
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,290
- Hey.
- Prism?

1318
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,620
- It is.
- No, it's not.

1319
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,330
Hey, next to Prism Tower,

1320
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,690
- There are pine trees.
- there's a row of pine trees.

1321
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,460
- We played with water balloons.
- But let me say this, Haha.

1322
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,860
Do you know what year
Prism Tower was built?

1323
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,330
- I don't know.
- That's a new building,

1324
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,670
so it doesn't have any rusty parts.

1325
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,200
(The part Se Chan focused on)

1326
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,870
It was built over ten years ago.

1327
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,910
- It must be Prism Tower.
- But there aren't...

1328
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,110
- Gosh, Haha. Seriously.
- It's definitely right.

1329
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,380
- I think it's right.
- It's not Prism Tower.

1330
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,410
- It's Prism Tower.
- I think so.

1331
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,980
- No, it could never be Prism Tower.
- The glass on Prism Tower...

1332
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
- Yes, it is.
- It is!

1333
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,420
Hey, if it has anything
to do with SBS,

1334
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,880
I'd rather go to Deungchon-dong.

1335
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,150
It'd be better to go...

1336
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,250
- to Deungchon-dong.
- It's Deungchon-dong.

1337
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,950
(The SBS Deungchon-dong
Public Hall?)

1338
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,090
It'd be better to go...

1339
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,160
- to Deungchon-dong.
- It's Deungchon-dong.

1340
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,360
- It's Deungchon-dong.
- If, by chance...

1341
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,890
- Hey, it's Deungchon-dong.
- There are lots of trees there too.

1342
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,930
It's Deungchon-dong.

1343
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,060
- You know, right?
- Are you a genius?

1344
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,300
- Indeed, Se Chan is the best.
- I think it's Deungchon-dong.

1345
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,530
- Because, look.
- Earlier... Hey, look.

1346
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,970
- They have trees there too, right?
- You ignored me until just now.

1347
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,300
- No, but...
- But you sound right.

1348
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,370
- I think you're right.
- Really?

1349
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,440
- It's not the Sangam-dong building.
- Okay, it's Deungchon-dong.

1350
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,340
- It's new.
- Okay, Deungchon-dong.

1351
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,780
The color looks like...

1352
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,080
- the Deungchon-dong building too.
- Right.

1353
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,450
Isn't the Deungchon-dong building
ivory-colored?

1354
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,810
I mean,
we could have ramyeon or something.

1355
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,080
So, this is it.

1356
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,520
Do you want happiness...

1357
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,650
or do you want to crack the mission?

1358
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,720
- Happiness.
- Happiness.

1359
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,220
We should crack the mission
and search for happiness.

1360
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,290
- Then,
- Haha, the mission...

1361
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,460
we're off to find happiness.

1362
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,330
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1363
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,830
- This place is nice.
- We'll crack the mission later.

1364
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,560
- I like this team.
- Also, honestly,

1365
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,700
I don't really care...

1366
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,760
- about the mission today.
- Me either.

1367
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,470
- We want a party for Jong Kook.
- Right.

1368
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,030
- Pork gukbap.
- That's it!

1369
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,440
- Pork gukbap.
- Pork gukbap.

1370
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,070
- Hey, are you a genius?
- That makes sense.

1371
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,740
- Wolgang Pork Soup is so good.
- Let's go there.

1372
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,210
- Let's go.
- There must be lots of people...

1373
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,640
who eat rice soup there.

1374
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,050
- Se Chan, hurry over and check.
- Okay.

1375
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,250
- Let's go.
- This place is so good.

1376
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,580
- We don't have time right now.
- I'll take a look.

1377
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,320
- Are you waiting in line?
- I love rice soup.

1378
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,020
- You're in line, right?
- Yes.

1379
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,850
- Haha.
- Yes?

1380
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,990
- Keep going.
- Keep going?

1381
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,160
- Let's hurry.
- They're full right now.

1382
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,060
Right,
this place is a popular restaurant.

1383
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,630
Haha, that gamjatang place or...

1384
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,460
- Go. Okay, let's hurry.
- Let's just go for now.

1385
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,600
- Isn't the second floor open?
- Something like naengmyeon.

1386
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,900
(Se Chan's 2nd reconnaissance)

1387
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,840
Haha! Come here.

1388
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,870
- Haha!
- There's someone here.

1389
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:56,970
Haha,
someone is eating gamjatang alone.

1390
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,040
- Okay, let's go.
- Ji Hyo. Wait a minute.

1391
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,380
- We have to get permission.
- Right now,

1392
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,080
- we can't all rush in here.
- We need permission.

1393
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,550
- Hey, you guys come in later.
- Don't scare the person.

1394
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,180
- Don't scare the person.
- Come in when we give you the okay.

1395
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,980
Do a good job.
You're a fool if you mess this up.

1396
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,920
(Se Chan enters first to ask
for permission to join the table.)

1397
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,320
- How may I help you?
- One moment.

1398
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,450
- Naengmyeon?
- Se Chan is good at being friendly.

1399
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,490
- Right, Se Chan is good at that.
- He has a good image.

1400
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,760
Hello.

1401
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,130
- Are you dining alone?
- Yes.

1402
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,430
Would it be possible
for us to eat with you?

1403
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,800
- No.
- Oh, okay.

1404
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,070
(A clean failure!)

1405
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,370
One, two.

1406
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,640
Look at her will to eat.

1407
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,180
(In the end, they go
to Ye Eun's favorite rice noodle place.)

1408
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,940
(This time, Ddochi is on recon.)

1409
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,610
(Is anyone eating alone
during weekday lunch hour?)

1410
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,280
There isn't anyone eating alone.

1411
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,420
Ye Eun, what is it?

1412
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,120
No one's eating alone.

1413
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,920
- Let's wait.
- Should we wait?

1414
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,690
Let's find someone...

1415
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,290
- who's going to eat alone.
- I haven't been here before.

1416
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,200
This isn't a place
people come to eat alone.

1417
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,200
- Over there.
- Is she eating alone?

1418
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,330
- Eating alone.
- Are you eating alone?

1419
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,970
Who here is going to eat alone?

1420
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,440
- Me!
- I'm not eating alone.

1421
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,870
- Me.
- Are you going to eat alone?

1422
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,380
- You can head inside.
- Go ahead.

1423
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,540
(They ran into someone
who's going to eat alone!)

1424
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,780
The place serves delicious food.

1425
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,510
- The food here is good.
- It's really good.

1426
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,250
- This is the best place.
- Get yourself a table.

1427
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,450
Grab a table.

1428
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,450
Okay!

1429
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,650
(And following her inside is...)

1430
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,650
(They randomly chose one person,
and Mr. Free Meals was selected.)

1431
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,290
How could you choose Haha
of all people?

1432
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,720
Hello.

1433
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,390
- Hello.
- Are you eating alone?

1434
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,630
- Yes.
- May I sit with you?

1435
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,930
- Of course.
- Hold on.

1436
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

1437
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,200
Weren't you recently in Busan?

1438
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,640
- Right. Are you from Busan?
- Yes, I'm from Busan.

1439
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,110
(While Mr. Free Meals
performs the task)

1440
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,270
This will be on me.

1441
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,640
- You completed the task...
- We're good.

1442
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,740
for slot two...

1443
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,640
- and can now see what's underneath.
- Sure.

1444
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,910
Go ahead...

1445
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,950
- and check the photo.
- Team YB will see it too.

1446
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,650
Wait, what is this place?

1447
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,380
- I know I recognize it.
- We should see one on the bottom.

1448
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,060
(Nothing screams the answer
just yet.)

1449
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,320
Team YB is working on slot nine.

1450
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,630
- Nine?
- We should see slot eight, then.

1451
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,860
- We need to get slot eight.
- Eight or four.

1452
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,730
- No, 7.
- Slot 8...

1453
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,400
- will complete the photo.
- It'll be complete.

1454
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,570
- Which slot will it be?
- Slot eight.

1455
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,830
Slot eight.

1456
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,670
While standing...

1457
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,700
(Someone sleeping while standing)

1458
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,640
(Someone sleeping while standing)

1459
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,810
Who on earth
sleeps while standing on the street?

1460
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,710
- Are you kidding me?
- How can that be done?

1461
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,250
Who sleeps while standing?

1462
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,780
Anyone who keeps
their eyes closed...

1463
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,720
while standing
for at least five seconds...

1464
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,520
- will be allowed.
- You're kidding me.

1465
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,220
This part of the photo
must be worth it.

1466
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,290
- It must be definitive.
- Just so you know,

1467
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,590
you can make a guess...

1468
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,330
- if Team YB gets slot nine.
- Exactly.

1469
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,930
Slot nine's quest seems easy.

1470
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,100
- That's easy.
- That's too easy.

1471
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,530
That's easy for sure.

1472
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,130
- All they have to do is eat.
- That's so easy.

1473
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,500
Maybe we'll find someone
with their eyes closed,

1474
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,770
leaning on a wall, and thinking.

1475
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,840
We'll accept anyone...

1476
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,210
who has their eyes closed
for more than five seconds.

1477
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,440
While standing?

1478
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780
- Let's get out into the sun.
- Sure.

1479
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,980
- So...
- It's too hot.

1480
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,650
Don't look
for someone standing straight...

1481
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,880
- but for someone leaning.
- We might find someone...

1482
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,390
in a shop, and not on a street.

1483
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,890
- Let's go.
- That's possible.

1484
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,490
Look at Jong Kook.

1485
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,060
That put a smile on his face.

1486
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,860
- This is adorable.
- Do you like it?

1487
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,160
- Because you...
- It's so cute.

1488
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,530
You put in the effort.

1489
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,230
- It's cute.
- You worked hard for this.

1490
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,730
This is adorable.

1491
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,630
At this rate,
we won't find anyone sleeping...

1492
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,370
- while standing.
- How can we find anyone?

1493
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,540
- Their eyes will be on us.
- Is this even possible?

1494
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,570
Like that...

1495
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,840
- Someone sleeping while standing?
- How can we find someone...

1496
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,810
- sleeping while standing?
- What about part-timers?

1497
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,050
- Sure.
- When there aren't any customers,

1498
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,580
- Secretly.
- they could take a nap.

1499
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,880
- Maybe they want to rest.
- That's possible.

1500
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,620
Let's go somewhere
with fewer people.

1501
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,750
- Exactly.
- Look inside the store.

1502
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,190
See who's inside.

1503
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,220
No one's here.

1504
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,490
(They see into the store
through the window.)

1505
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,530
- This...
- We should go to stores...

1506
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,960
- without any customers.
- On top of that,

1507
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,530
- it's too hot outside.
- Exactly.

1508
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,470
Where can we find someone
sleeping while standing?

1509
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,640
We saw someone sleeping
on his back earlier.

1510
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,670
I know.

1511
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,970
- He was sleeping on his back.
- It'd be easier to find someone...

1512
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,740
- sleeping on his back.
- That'd be easier.

1513
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,940
The chance card might tell us
to find anyone sleeping.

1514
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,110
Exactly.

1515
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,950
Should we call them?

1516
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,350
(Team OB has already used
one of the chance cards.)

1517
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,280
- I'm sure we'll see someone.
- It seems to me...

1518
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,750
that you can't be bothered
to take out your phones.

1519
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,350
It's better coming from you.

1520
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,660
You should tell them.

1521
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,220
- Hey, Jae Seok.
- Ssaebssaeb.

1522
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,830
- Yes?
- Are you working on your task?

1523
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,830
We are. Our task...

1524
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,430
- Yes?
- Are you working on your task?

1525
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,230
We are. Our task...

1526
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:20,370
is to find someone eating alone
and eat with them.

1527
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,910
You see, the task we got
is too difficult.

1528
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,870
You haven't spent
a chance card, have you?

1529
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:27,510
- Wait.
- Hold on.

1530
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,950
His eyes are closed.
Could he be sleeping?

1531
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,650
We haven't.
Actually, we already used one.

1532
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,850
I think he's asleep.

1533
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,980
(They found an old man napping
at the entrance of a building.)

1534
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,550
Goodness me.

1535
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,790
Hold on a second, sir.
Were you napping just now?

1536
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,090
(He wraps up his sketch.)

1537
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,460
- Mister.
- We found someone.

1538
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,560
- Were you napping?
- Thanks, Jae Seok.

1539
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,590
Sure thing.

1540
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,630
- We found someone.
- Got it.

1541
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,000
We found someone napping.

1542
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,630
Here's our proof.

1543
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,100
- He was napping.
- Watch right here.

1544
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,300
- Is it the same person?
- It's of the same person.

1545
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,070
I recorded myself on my phone.

1546
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,910
- Come on, mister.
- What?

1547
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,340
- Can you tell who it is?
- What's wrong with it?

1548
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,110
- They didn't say it couldn't be us.
- How can this work?

1549
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,410
(Is Jae Seok
not insisting with them?)

1550
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,780
What do you think you're doing?

1551
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,650
- Anyway, the chance card...
- Did they allow it?

1552
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,150
- Se Chan said we could use one.
- Really? Okay.

1553
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,450
- Good.
- We're good, then.

1554
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,590
- We can do it.
- It'll be easier to do.

1555
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,750
- This will be doable.
- I know this for sure.

1556
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:12,950
- You'll use a chance card.
- I bet...

1557
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,660
we'll have to find anyone
who's asleep.

1558
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,220
- A penalty ball will be added.
- This...

1559
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,490
How can we find someone like that?

1560
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,060
They put that there
knowing we'd fail.

1561
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,960
- Exactly.
- Here's your chance card.

1562
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,100
(How will the task become easier?)

1563
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,330
While sitting?

1564
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,000
- I bet we'll now see someone...
- Can't you let us find someone...

1565
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,810
- who's sleeping while standing.
- who's just sleeping?

1566
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,410
It won't be easy to find someone...

1567
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,980
who's sleeping at all.

1568
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,540
- What's worse...
- Where's a good spot to nap?

1569
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,010
is that it's hot outside.

1570
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,010
You'll want to go indoors.

1571
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,750
If you're going to nap,
you'll go indoors.

1572
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,320
(Tae Hyun suddenly takes off
on his own.)

1573
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,390
Let's sit, guys.

1574
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,950
- I can't believe this.
- All right.

1575
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,190
Okay, so to succeed...

1576
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,190
Let's think about this.

1577
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,960
Where will you go to nap in a chair?

1578
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,260
Hold on. Can't we make a guess
with what we have?

1579
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,630
Jae Seok,

1580
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,830
where would be a likely spot
to set up a party?

1581
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,600
A studio in Deungchon-dong
would be cheaper.

1582
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,600
Is that so?

1583
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,870
That'd be easier to rent.

1584
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,510
Where can this be?

1585
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,010
- Doesn't it show up anywhere?
- Wouldn't it be easier...

1586
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,550
to get the necessary items
and set up the party?

1587
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,450
This is the SBS building
in Deungchon-dong.

1588
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,950
- That's not it.
- Isn't it?

1589
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,850
- Not even from the back?
- Could that be it?

1590
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,290
The entrance to the parking lot.

1591
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,690
I'm talking about
that side of the building.

1592
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,760
- That side?
- The rear entrance...

1593
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,860
to the parking lot.

1594
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,830
- Could that be it?
- Jong Kook, why don't you man up...

1595
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,000
and take what's coming?

1596
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,230
Don't be ridiculous, Jae Seok.

1597
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,040
- This...
- Where did Tae Hyun go?

1598
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,770
Hair salons like this.

1599
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:42,240
Don't people take a nap
while getting their hair done?

1600
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,650
(He goes to a hair salon
without telling the others.)

1601
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,480
It'd be nice to find someone...

1602
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,050
getting their hair shampooed
at a salon.

1603
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,650
Let there be a customer.

1604
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:56,790
(Will Guest Cha's lone wolf move
succeed?)

1605
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,230
They're not open yet.

1606
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,730
(His 1st attempt fails
due to the salon being closed.)

1607
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,460
They're not open yet. No way.

1608
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,300
(He arrives at another hair salon.)

1609
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,200
What's this? A crime scene cafe?

1610
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,740
Could someone be playing a dead man?

1611
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,210
(He arrives at the hair salon
on the 3rd floor.)

1612
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,880
What's this?
Am I in the right place?

1613
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,580
Where am I?

1614
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,220
They're not open yet.

1615
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,320
They're still closed at this hour.

1616
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,290
(Wanderer Cha
is walking around alone again.)

1617
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,560
A hair salon.

1618
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,560
Shouldn't you close your eyes
when getting your hair washed?

1619
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:31,860
- I do.
- Could you keep your eyes closed?

1620
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,660
Just let them handle your hair...

1621
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,100
and don't look at us.

1622
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,030
That's great.

1623
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,200
Looking good.

1624
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,170
(Her eyes are closed!)

1625
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,740
This feels weird.

1626
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,310
This feels weird.

1627
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:54,020
- You failed because she talked.
- What a bummer.

1628
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,380
Thanks, though.

1629
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,690
(His 3rd attempt failed
because she talked.)

1630
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,720
I was busted.

1631
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,850
Where is this place?

1632
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,060
I asked the AI app,
and it told me...

1633
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,430
the building is in Kazakhstan.

1634
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,600
(It recommended a country
5,000km away.)

1635
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,060
Is this for real?

1636
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,230
- You have 25 minutes left...
- They must've completed a task.

1637
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,000
until the mission ends.

1638
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,270
Does that include...

1639
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,470
- our time to get there?
- Yes.

1640
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,540
- With Team YB?
- We're short on time.

1641
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,610
Haha needs to succeed
so that we can see the next photo.

1642
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,110
How is that hard?

1643
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,950
Could that punk
be dragging his feet?

1644
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,880
I'm done with my meal.

1645
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,620
I see you don't eat a lot.

1646
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,020
- Okay, got it. Good.
- I'm full.

1647
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,520
- We'll meet someday in Busan.
- Sure.

1648
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,920
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

1649
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,520
- This is tough.
- Come on.

1650
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,060
I can't even find a dog
that's napping.

1651
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,660
- Where...
- Team YB has completed...

1652
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,030
- its task.
- Really?

1653
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,900
- You'll check the photo...
- Sure thing.

1654
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,060
- in this alley.
- Good.

1655
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,700
- Let's check the photo.
- What a relief.

1656
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,530
Let's take a look.

1657
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,500
- I'll peel it off.
- Sure.

1658
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Slot number nine.

1659
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,340
(They check slot nine
while Tae Hyun is busy by himself.)

1660
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,610
- Slot 7 and 8 must be a slam dunk.
- Seems like it.

1661
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,810
- What's this?
- How can we tell from this?

1662
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,280
- What is this?
- I still can't tell.

1663
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,250
- What's this?
- The pine trees must be a clue.

1664
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,320
- What?
- See? I was right.

1665
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,650
- What do you mean you're right?
- It's that building.

1666
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,650
- It's the one in Deungchon-dong.
- Let's go there.

1667
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,250
- That's the ground floor.
- The building in Deungchon-dong.

1668
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,420
- You're right.
- Hold on. That's the Prism Tower.

1669
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,090
No, it's
the Deungchon-dong building.

1670
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,530
The Prism Tower is new...

1671
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,830
and can't have pipes like this.

1672
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,730
Isn't this the entrance
to the Prism Tower?

1673
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,500
The Prism Tower
has pine trees like this.

1674
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,130
Let me be clear.
The Prism Tower, you say?

1675
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,700
For pine trees to be this tall,

1676
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,300
you'd have to wait 30 years.

1677
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,940
- They have to grow for 30 years.
- Right.

1678
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,910
Who grows pine trees...

1679
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,440
- First of all...
- from seeds or from saplings?

1680
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,080
You plant trees
after they have already grown.

1681
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,180
That makes sense.

1682
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,810
- What? I'm right.
- Of course.

1683
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:32,910
- Check this out.
- It's Haha.

1684
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,320
Hey, Haha.

1685
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,480
- Jae Seok.
- Yes?

1686
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:38,050
Is this the building in Sangam-dong
or Deungchon-dong?

1687
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,850
We have no idea.

1688
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,420
What building has this pillar?

1689
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,290
Judging from the rust,

1690
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,630
- It's an older building.
- it might be an older building.

1691
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:49,330
Se Chan says it's in Deungchon-dong,
which makes sense.

1692
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,600
It's at an angle.
It's the one in Deungchon-dong.

1693
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,830
That's the one.

1694
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,740
This part is at an angle.
It's the one in Deungchon-dong.

1695
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,800
- Let's go there.
- Let's go.

1696
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,570
- We need to go with them.
- Meet us in Deungchon-dong.

1697
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,180
- What is it?
- Meet us in Deungchon-dong.

1698
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,510
Is this the building
in Deungchon-dong?

1699
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,210
- Deungchon-dong?
- Jae Seok.

1700
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,250
That's what I also said.

1701
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,810
- I got that feeling too.
- This isn't familiar to me.

1702
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,820
- Hold on a second.
- Let's go there.

1703
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,150
Didn't you see
a photo of it earlier?

1704
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,550
It's the SBS building
in Deungchon-dong.

1705
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,150
- Check out the lines.
- Really?

1706
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,460
- Check the lines.
- They are similar.

1707
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,260
We won't be late
if we head out right now.

1708
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,860
- As if.
- We'll make it on time.

1709
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,930
(They're crunched for time.)

1710
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,200
Was this on purpose?

1711
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,560
The SBS building in Deungchon-dong.

1712
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,400
- What did I tell you?
- Let me see the map.

1713
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,900
- It says you're likely to arrive...
- We have no other choice.

1714
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,240
at 12:59 p.m.

1715
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,840
- Got it.
- Can you step on it?

1716
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,110
I'm still on the fence.
Is this really the place?

1717
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,210
- Is it really Deungchon-dong?
- I don't know.

1718
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,980
- Right.
- Well, I...

1719
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,780
Jong Kook, don't worry.

1720
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,480
- What, Seok Jin?
- People ask a lot,

1721
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,380
but I don't remember
your wife's face.

1722
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,120
- He keeps saying that.
- That's a relief, Seok Jin.

1723
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,750
He has a slight case
of prosopagnosia.

1724
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,020
I remember her vibe, though.
She was kind of graceful,

1725
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,490
and she looked really good
in a hanbok.

1726
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,330
- She didn't wear hanbok.
- What? She didn't wear a hanbok.

1727
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,830
- But seriously...
- That guy is so...

1728
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,900
Aren't you confusing her
with her mother?

1729
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,470
- The only ones wearing a hanbok...
- Did you confuse her with my mom?

1730
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,930
were his mother-in-law and his mom.

1731
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,340
- That's right.
- She looked like...

1732
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,270
she'd be very understanding.

1733
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,310
That's what she seemed like.

1734
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,470
- You get curious, you know?
- What are you so curious about?

1735
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,840
- I still can't ask, though.
- Cha Tae Hyun is drawing a picture.

1736
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,840
- That's funny.
- Hey, you...

1737
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,910
- What do you think?
- She never did her hair like that.

1738
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,380
What are you doing?

1739
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,950
- That's what she looked like.
- She never did her hair that way.

1740
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,750
Like this. With big eyes.
She's pretty.

1741
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,650
- Big eyes.
- Hey, what do you think you're...

1742
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,690
- What do you think you're doing?
- She's pretty.

1743
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,490
- Stop drawing.
- She had monolids.

1744
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,460
- It doesn't even look like her.
- But she doesn't have monolids.

1745
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,260
I remembered her face right away
after I saw this.

1746
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,000
- Apparently, he remembered, though.
- Come on, Seok Jin.

1747
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,800
- That's enough.
- For real.

1748
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,200
Hey, Tae Hyun is
the one drawing pictures.

1749
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,570
Why are you yelling at me?

1750
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,870
- She had double eyelids.
- You're egging him on.

1751
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,570
- You could leave him alone,
- She had double eyelids.

1752
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,010
and he'd still be uncontrollable.

1753
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,080
- Isn't that right?
- Gosh, Tae Hyun.

1754
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,210
- Stop drawing!
- Stop drawing!

1755
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,750
- No, I'm erasing it now.
- Why is he acting like that?

1756
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,580
It doesn't even look like her.
Why do you keep drawing her?

1757
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,090
- I could make her face slimmer.
- Yes, she should look slimmer.

1758
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,590
- No, it's because...
- She has a V-shaped jawline.

1759
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,260
I don't want his wife to be unhappy.

1760
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:56,220
- A V-shaped jawline.
- She will be unhappy with it.

1761
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,590
(Sighing)

1762
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,100
Jong Kook, then is your wife
at home or at work?

1763
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,800
- She's at home.
- Hey.

1764
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,000
- Why are you asking him all that?
- Oh, is she on vacation?

1765
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
- Yes, she's at home.
- You yelled at me.

1766
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,430
- Oh, she's on vacation.
- Yes.

1767
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,570
- She took a vacation.
- Right.

1768
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,770
- Well, I can ask that much.
- Yes, sure.

1769
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,940
- I'm just asking one by one.
- Sure.

1770
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,380
- My goodness.
- My gosh.

1771
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,480
- Oh, here! Wait!
- This is it. I think so.

1772
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,110
I know, Seok Jin.
I saw that red thing.

1773
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,150
- Oh, the entrance?
- But...

1774
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,650
- Hang on a minute.
- Is it right or not?

1775
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,380
Look behind there.
There are pine trees!

1776
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,390
- Are there pine trees?
- Pine trees?

1777
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,450
- It's over there.
- My gosh. You're right.

1778
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,090
We never look back there.
But that's right.

1779
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,490
- Right here.
- I always used that door...

1780
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,990
- when I was younger.
- How would you see that?

1781
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:32,490
- Gosh, this is incredible.
- Right now,

1782
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,260
- it's 12:57 p.m.
- This is it.

1783
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,260
I knew I had a feeling... My gosh.

1784
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,670
I told you. It's here.

1785
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,030
There were pine trees here.

1786
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,200
- Gosh, you remember this?
- This is it.

1787
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,270
- Of course I do. Because...
- This is it. You're right.

1788
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,470
- Gosh, you remember this?
- This is it.

1789
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,540
- Of course I do. Because...
- This is it. You're right.

1790
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,640
- I used this door so much.
- This is it.

1791
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,810
- We're here.
- Gosh, this is it.

1792
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,980
- Yes, I always...
- Oh, it's this part.

1793
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,850
- came here.
- You're right.

1794
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,380
- We never look up this way.
- So, right now,

1795
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,380
- the current time in 12:57 p.m.
- Yes.

1796
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,220
- These guys have to get here.
- The other team has to be here...

1797
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,050
- It's 12:58 p.m. now.
- Okay.

1798
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,990
The other team must get here
within two minutes...

1799
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,860
- to succeed in the mission.
- That's right.

1800
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,660
- They should get here quickly.
- My goodness.

1801
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,130
There it is. The pine trees.
I was right.

1802
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,260
The pine trees.

1803
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,860
- This is it.
- Yes, this place is right.

1804
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,170
It might not be right, though.

1805
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,170
We're cutting it close.

1806
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,670
Gosh, no. I really can't!

1807
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:16,100
Smoothly.

1808
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,070
- The other team must've arrived.
- Se Chan.

1809
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,940
Deungchon-dong and Sangam-dong.
This was a great catch.

1810
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,940
- I know, right?
- You were totally awesome.

1811
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,180
Gosh, you have a great eye.

1812
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,380
No, I was just lucky,
because the Sangam-dong building...

1813
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,110
was so new.

1814
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,750
Because I filmed
"People Looking for a Laugh..."

1815
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,080
Look at the pine trees!
They're already here.

1816
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,520
- Run!
- Guys, run.

1817
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:35,820
(It's 1:01 p.m.)

1818
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,990
- This is it.
- I was right.

1819
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,460
- They just got here.
- This is it, right?

1820
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,460
- Hi.
- Hey.

1821
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,260
No, I kept saying
it wasn't Sangam-dong.

1822
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,000
Hey, I also...
As soon as I saw the picture...

1823
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,370
- Yes. I said it was Deungchon-dong.
- It's this part.

1824
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,940
- Hey, didn't you come here a lot?
- We only thought of the front...

1825
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,540
- of the Deungchon-dong building.
- You're right.

1826
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,010
I even said it was...

1827
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,810
the entrance to the parking lot
of the Deungchon-dong building.

1828
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,210
- You even knew that?
- Who'd look up here like this?

1829
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,950
- I've never looked up here before.
- It was at "SBS Inkigayo..."

1830
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,820
that I won first place with
"Black Cat Nero."

1831
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,480
Indeed, the new groom.

1832
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:04,950
- That's too bad.
- First, let's go into...

1833
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,290
Jong Kook's wedding celebration
party venue.

1834
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,020
- Let's go!
- Okay!

1835
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,660
- Let's call people over now.
- We can go in, right?

1836
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,990
Congratulations!

1837
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,060
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1838
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,860
(What kind of flashy party
will be waiting for them?)

1839
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,800
Gosh, are you serious? What is this?

1840
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,670
He had a secret wedding
because he didn't want this.

1841
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,470
- All right. So, now,
- Let's go.

1842
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,440
in this studio...

1843
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:24,970
Is someone in there?

1844
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:28,610
We have a grand party all set up.

1845
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,680
My goodness.

1846
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,010
(A grand wedding celebration party
will begin soon.)

1847
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,080
Hey, even when the groom enters...

1848
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,880
I told you to stop. Seriously.

1849
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,950
(Feeling sensitive
from failing the first mission)

1850
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:44,130
- All right. Except for Jong Kook,
- Yes.

1851
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,330
- the others will go inside...
- Really?

1852
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,460
to check how things look.

1853
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,930
- Then, you can come back out.
- What will you do in there?

1854
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,630
Jong Kook, you can only guess
what's going on inside...

1855
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,970
- from what you can hear...
- Guess.

1856
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,370
- and participate in the mission.
- That's funny.

1857
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,040
- Oh, really?
- We'll have to work hard.

1858
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,040
- Are people going to run away?
- His wife came in secret, right?

1859
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,940
- Did she come?
- His wife?

1860
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,950
- Oh, really?
- Before you go inside,

1861
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:08,450
please choose one person
to take over Jong Kook's role.

1862
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,450
- His role?
- What's his role?

1863
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:10,690
- Tae Hyun should do it.
- Yes.

1864
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,950
Then, Tae Hyun,
you will play the role of Jong Kook.

1865
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,560
We'll do a simulation
from the entrance itself.

1866
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,360
- I don't get what's going on.
- This sounds like fun.

1867
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:19,760
Oh, this too?

1868
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,930
(The floral palanquin reappears.)

1869
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,830
Be careful.

1870
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,370
There we go.

1871
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,500
That's nice.

1872
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,570
- Yes, I got married.
- Then, let's go.

1873
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,040
- Go into the studio...
- I'm so annoyed.

1874
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,870
through the waiting room
and check things out.

1875
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:32,170
I'll open the door for you.

1876
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,740
- Let's go.
- Gosh, it's so nice to get married.

1877
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,640
- Let's go.
- Hey, this is nice.

1878
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,650
- Are you happy, new groom?
- I'm so happy.

1879
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,120
- This is driving me crazy.
- I'm glad I got married...

1880
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,050
We have two missions left.
You have to succeed...

1881
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,450
- in both missions.
- Gosh, I should take two out.

1882
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,460
But the first mission was so easy.
Darn it.

1883
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,890
- This is where it starts.
- Oh, this is it.

1884
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,230
- Oh, boy.
- Hook it up.

1885
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,230
- Oh, hook it up?
- Hook it up.

1886
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,530
- Let's hook it up.
- Gosh, I love it so much.

1887
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,530
- Come on.
- Do we have to do this?

1888
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,330
Yes, and wear this
around your neck first.

1889
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,640
- "Married Man, Bag Man."
- Nice.

1890
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,540
(Celebration item 1:
A human garland ribbon)

1891
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,070
- Daniel, can you get that?
- That's nice.

1892
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,740
Wait a minute.

1893
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,480
- Hey, wait.
- What is this?

1894
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,880
What did they make?

1895
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,320
- What?
- I'm sure it's something cheesy.

1896
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,580
(With the serious and stern staff,)

1897
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,750
(they even have covers
for tight security.)

1898
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,190
- I'm so curious.
- They wrapped it up this tightly?

1899
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,290
- Gosh, this...
- What is it?

1900
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,960
- Hang on.
- What is it?

1901
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,960
- What is this?
- Why?

1902
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,390
- There's a red carpet.
- Gosh, what is this?

1903
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,900
Hey, what is that? They prepared
everything Jong Kook hates.

1904
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,030
- My gosh.
- For real.

1905
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,000
- Gosh, Jong Kook...
- Jong Kook will flip out...

1906
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,570
- at the sight of this.
- Gosh, what is that?

1907
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,070
(We will reveal the party from the staff
who love Jong Kook to death.)

1908
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,540
- What is this?
- I told you it would be cheesy.

1909
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,940
What did they prepare...

1910
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,110
- They wrapped it up this tightly?
- that it's so...

1911
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,110
(Celebration item 2:
Smoke and a red carpet)

1912
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,480
- I still can't believe it.
- Gosh, what is this?

1913
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,980
- Look at that.
- What is it?

1914
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,310
- What did they do?
- My goodness.

1915
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,450
Why?

1916
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,750
(The entryway is
so overly dramatic.)

1917
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:54,820
(What will Kim Jong Kook's
celebration party look like?)

1918
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:58,290
(They experience the celebration
party without Jong Kook.)

1919
01:00:58,290 --> 01:00:59,430
Jong Kook will flip out
at the sight of this.

1920
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,830
Gosh, what is that?

1921
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,330
(The background music starts playing
as they enter.)

1922
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,070
- What is this?
- What is all this?

1923
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:09,240
- What is this?
- What is all this?

1924
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,610
(The exact song
that Jong Kook detested)

1925
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,310
(As they step
onto the red carpet...)

1926
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,410
No!

1927
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,210
- Hey, seriously.
- What is this?

1928
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,220
What is all this?

1929
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,720
They did everything Jong Kook hates.

1930
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,220
- They set everything up.
- They're even playing "She."

1931
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,990
- Gosh, this is...
- What is this?

1932
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,860
- No way.
- Gosh, what is this?

1933
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,630
Gosh,
I really hope Jong Kook likes it.

1934
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:34,860
- Look here.
- Right.

1935
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,400
My goodness.

1936
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,330
(Celebration item 5: Ice carving)

1937
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:40,230
- It's Jong Kook.
- I think he'll like it.

1938
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,740
That's real ice.

1939
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,800
Gosh, it's real ice.

1940
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,840
No way.

1941
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,040
(At a loss for words)

1942
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,140
(They're cosplaying as Jong Kook!)

1943
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,040
(Celebration item 6:
15 mysterious Kim Jong Kooks)

1944
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,450
There are 15 of them.

1945
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:52,980
They're Jong Kook.

1946
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,220
Jong Kook will...

1947
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,350
- No way!
- My gosh!

1948
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:57,850
(The man of the hour
can only hear the sounds.)

1949
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,860
They're even playing "She."

1950
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,060
- Gosh, this is...
- What is this?

1951
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,860
Gosh, I hate this so much.

1952
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:11,270
(You can tell from behind
that he's getting goosebumps.)

1953
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:14,400
What? Why are they playing music?
What's with the whistle?

1954
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,340
Gosh, this is...

1955
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,240
- Hey, this...
- That looks just like his wife.

1956
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,970
- What is that?
- What is it?

1957
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,410
- Hey, this...
- That looks just like his wife.

1958
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,850
- What is that?
- What is it?

1959
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:26,850
- Oh, my.
- Oh, goodness.

1960
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,650
- What is that?
- What is it?

1961
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,050
- Oh, my.
- Oh, goodness.

1962
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:35,360
(Here comes a marching band.)

1963
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,060
(You can't leave us out
on the day of a party!)

1964
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,960
They're making a huge fuss.

1965
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,930
- Jong Kook will be appalled.
- Look.

1966
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,940
Darn it.

1967
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,340
There's a marching band?

1968
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:56,040
(He can't help but laugh
in exasperation.)

1969
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,680
I hate this so much.

1970
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:01,980
(Celebration item 7:
A live marching band)

1971
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,620
- Get back.
- He'll be appalled.

1972
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,350
Hang on.
They must be coming this way.

1973
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,160
Where? Are they coming this way?

1974
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,420
(They line up
in the middle of the party venue.)

1975
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:16,660
(Enjoying it to the fullest)

1976
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,740
(The march comes to an end.)

1977
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,440
- This is insane.
- My goodness.

1978
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,940
(Playing the trumpet)

1979
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,640
- Oh, dear.
- It's the "Wedding March."

1980
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,880
(Wait, this song is...)

1981
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,380
Jong Kook will run away.

1982
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,710
('Wedding March" doesn't get played
at actual weddings these days.)

1983
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,520
Tae Hyun likes it.

1984
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,080
Tae Hyun likes it.

1985
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,060
(The production crew must've thought
that it was the last chance!)

1986
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,900
That's...

1987
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,160
That's too...

1988
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,360
(The groom laughs
because he can't cry.)

1989
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,030
That's too much.

1990
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,540
(His facial expression shows
that the scale is unexpected.)

1991
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,140
It sounds like
there are a lot of people.

1992
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,770
- All right.
- It's what we do well.

1993
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,940
- Shouldn't we go there?
- Wooly bully!

1994
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,350
- Wooly bully!
- Look over there.

1995
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:06,680
What?

1996
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,680
- Shouldn't we go there?
- Wooly bully!

1997
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:12,220
(15 Jong Kook move.)

1998
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,360
(Card stunt?)

1999
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,390
What?

2000
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,130
It's a card stunt.

2001
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,100
He'll absolutely hate it.

2002
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,930
It's a card stunt.

2003
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,800
He'll absolutely hate it.

2004
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:26,800
(Even the attention seeker,
Seok Jin, shakes his head.)

2005
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,900
He'll hate it so much.

2006
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,570
It's a card stunt.

2007
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,570
("The" is a lesson
for a married man.)

2008
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:34,940
(The spelling of a bit off
due to the lack of practice.)

2009
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,880
"The first lesson."

2010
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,380
- "Say goodbye to plastic bags."
- "Say goodbye to plastic bags."

2011
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,980
(The congratulatory show
gets its meaning across.)

2012
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,950
- "Lift weights once a day."
- "Lift weights once a day."

2013
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,420
"The third lesson."

2014
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,460
"Kiss three times a day."

2015
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,260
Hey.

2016
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,490
- He'll hate it so much.
- This is...

2017
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:52,530
- He'll hate it so much.
- Seriously.

2018
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,730
- It's the best.
- Jong Kook will run away.

2019
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,360
- Jong Kook.
- It isn't for me,

2020
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,460
but I still hate it.

2021
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,630
Is it over?

2022
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,500
Yes, they'll come out now.

2023
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,840
(The ASMR torture is over.)

2024
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,540
Let's omit the music.

2025
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:04,010
I can't stand the music.

2026
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,040
(He's talking about
the marching band.)

2027
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,140
(Laughing)

2028
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,340
It's excessive.

2029
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,880
(After laughing like a maniac,)

2030
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,580
(he becomes serious.)

2031
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,850
I really can't allow
that marching band.

2032
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:17,990
I can't allow it.

2033
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,820
I really can't allow it.

2034
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:20,990
(Jong Kook is still having
a nightmare.)

2035
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:23,520
It isn't for me,
but I still hate it.

2036
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,330
You know exactly
what Jong Kook hates.

2037
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,790
You did everything.

2038
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,530
I'm watching it
because it's someone else's wedding.

2039
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,730
- Had it been mine...
- Seriously,

2040
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,330
- it's a bit...
- Had it been mine...

2041
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,000
I would've been fine.

2042
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,340
- Did you like it?
- Did you like it?

2043
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,000
- What did you think?
- I didn't think it was bad.

2044
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,840
- You're the type to like it.
- I thought it was nice.

2045
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,780
The celebrations we've prepared
come in sets.

2046
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,910
If you choose a set,
multiple items will be omitted.

2047
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,710
Number one is
the Jong Kook's entrance set.

2048
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,980
It includes the background music
that played upon entrance, "She,"

2049
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,180
special effect of smoke,

2050
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,650
and the human garland ribbon
around Jong Kook's neck.

2051
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,750
- It's this.
- This set...

2052
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,020
- I think we can omit it.
- Yes.

2053
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,120
Number two is the decoration set.

2054
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,290
It includes the fancy background,
huge banner,

2055
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,230
ice sculpture, and three-tier cake.

2056
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:03,000
- What's an ice sculpture? That one?
- That one.

2057
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,330
We need it.

2058
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,930
Number three is the event set.

2059
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:07,200
- It includes a marching band...
- It's a must.

2060
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,740
- and the crew's card stunt.
- It's a must.

2061
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,970
- It's the main set.
- Is it what those people did?

2062
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,010
- Yes.
- Number three is the best.

2063
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,410
The card stunt is a part
of the set number three.

2064
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:14,340
- We need it.
- Number three is a must.

2065
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,880
Jong Kook can choose a number
and omit the set...

2066
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,750
without knowing
which items are included.

2067
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,980
You can't tell Jong Kook
what you saw in here.

2068
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:24,150
But you can recommend
which number to omit.

2069
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,850
- Which number should we recommend?
- Number one, of course.

2070
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:27,460
- Number 1.
- Let's omit number 1.

2071
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,260
Let's omit number one.
It's the weakest one.

2072
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,560
- It should be number 1.
- Number 1.

2073
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:34,030
- The human garland isn't much.
- He won't cooperate anyway.

2074
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,030
- It'll be nice to omit number one.
- It's nothing much.

2075
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,170
- Number 3 will drive him insane.
- Number 3.

2076
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:39,730
It's a must.

2077
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,900
- It's the best set.
- It's a must.

2078
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:43,840
Haha, we should say,

2079
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,970
- "From the start..."
- "The beginning was too much."

2080
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,870
"From the start,
we wanted to throw up."

2081
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,780
- "From the start..." Yes.
- Number one.

2082
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,910
That way, Jong Kook will choose it.

2083
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:51,950
Haha.

2084
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:54,820
We should say, "From the start,
we wanted to throw up."

2085
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,480
You need to tell him
that the first one is the worst.

2086
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,690
- The beginning.
- However,

2087
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:59,650
- we should be indirect.
- "From the start..."

2088
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:02,520
Jong Kook, I don't think
I can handle this.

2089
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,620
(They meet up with Jong Kook again.)

2090
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:04,960
Jong Kook.

2091
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,630
Is he measuring his blood pressure?

2092
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,500
- You heard the music.
- Why are you measuring it?

2093
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,970
Gosh, that was...

2094
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:12,600
I can't choose one.

2095
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:14,030
I can't choose one.

2096
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,440
Jong Kook, you might cry.

2097
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,810
Seriously,
I think you'll be touched.

2098
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,570
- You might cry.
- They made many preparations.

2099
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,040
I measured my blood pressure
because I became so angry.

2100
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,250
- Did you become angry?
- Yes.

2101
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,950
You became angry
upon hearing the music.

2102
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,720
- Your blood pressure is good.
- Is it good?

2103
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,120
It's 115 over 60.

2104
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,290
- Is it good?
- No way.

2105
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:32,550
- It's good.
- Is it good?

2106
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,690
- It's normal.
- Is it normal?

2107
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:36,190
- How is it so good?
- What?

2108
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:37,490
- Is it good?
- Yes.

2109
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,030
- The beginning was too much.
- The beginning...

2110
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,460
How did his wife appear?

2111
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,130
The beginning
will drive Jong Kook crazy.

2112
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:45,970
The music was too much.

2113
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,670
Let's omit the marching band.

2114
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:49,470
- Let's omit it.
- To omit it,

2115
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:50,810
you need to omit set number one.

2116
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,640
- Is it number one?
- Yes.

2117
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,540
You've watched...

2118
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,480
some celebration items.

2119
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,810
The celebration items
are made up of three sets.

2120
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:03,120
Jong Kook, if you choose a number
from 1 to 3,

2121
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,690
the corresponding set
will be omitted.

2122
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,690
It won't be a single item.
The entire set will be omitted.

2123
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,320
- Is it number one?
- Yes.

2124
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,130
Since you failed...

2125
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,530
the first opportunity,

2126
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,660
three sets remain.

2127
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,830
Had you succeeded in it,

2128
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:18,400
- you could've omitted one now.
- You could've done it now.

2129
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:20,800
- It's too bad.
- I don't think...

2130
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,440
- I can handle such events.
- I know.

2131
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,940
- We don't like them either.
- They're...

2132
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,140
- too much.
- Seriously.

2133
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,310
- They make you cringe a bit.
- There are...

2134
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,840
- multiple items.
- But Tae Hyun likes them.

2135
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,080
- Tae Hyun likes them so much.
- Yes.

2136
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,610
- I don't think they're so bad.
- The huge banner...

2137
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,650
At the end,

2138
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,380
the bride comes down from a wire.

2139
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:35,920
That's the highlight.

2140
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,080
That's the main event.

2141
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,620
- Does she come down from a rope?
- Listen.

2142
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,050
- She didn't say such a thing.
- But...

2143
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,220
it was a surprise.

2144
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,760
That was why my wife came instead.

2145
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,060
(That was why my wife came instead.)

2146
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,430
Please hurry up and put her down.
She's heavy.

2147
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,660
- Seriously.
- It was a rehearsal.

2148
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:50,530
- They couldn't recruit your wife.
- That sounds fun.

2149
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,970
Which one do you want to omit
the most?

2150
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:53,600
I want to omit the marching band.

2151
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,800
- The marching band?
- We should omit the music.

2152
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,840
- We should omit the music.
- The music is too much.

2153
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,870
The music?

2154
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,170
- Seriously.
- Now, you'll be given a chance...

2155
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:01,010
- to omit a celebration set.
- Right.

2156
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:03,640
- Please go inside and do a mission.
- Okay.

2157
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,350
- Let's go.
- You know,

2158
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,310
- the first one was easy.
- That's right.

2159
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,950
- That's right.
- We should do better.

2160
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:11,950
All right. Let's hurry up
and work together, everyone.

2161
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:13,320
Let's work together...

2162
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,090
- and get rid of the marching band.
- What's the mission?

2163
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:16,860
This mission...

2164
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:19,490
is your second chance
to omit a celebration set.

2165
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,230
It's Follow the Rhythm
and Shout Out the Answer.

2166
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,300
Which words end with "Rhy?"

2167
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,430
- To the children's song rhythm,
- To that rhythm.

2168
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,040
say the names of the items
on the screen...

2169
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,710
in order to succeed in the mission.

2170
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,810
(Say the names of the 5 items
on the screen at once.)

2171
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,340
You'll succeed in the mission...

2172
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,640
- if a total of seven people do it.
- Okay.

2173
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,650
Jae Seok, don't be nervous.

2174
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:38,910
- Let's go.
- Don't be nervous.

2175
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:40,350
- Which words end with "Rhy?"
- Go.

2176
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,420
Kimchi!

2177
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:42,480
(He needs to say the rest.)

2178
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,520
Shouldn't you go next?

2179
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,090
- For goodness' sake.
- Hey!

2180
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:46,120
Kimchi, rainbow...

2181
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,720
(Jae Seok becomes nervous
and fails.)

2182
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,560
- One person says everything.
- Hey.

2183
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,090
Which words end with "Rhy?"

2184
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,630
- Bear!
- Hey!

2185
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,330
They're pandas.

2186
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,600
- Pandas.
- They're pandas.

2187
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,770
You did that on purpose, right?

2188
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:00,300
- You did that on purpose.
- "Bear?"

2189
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:02,240
Are you really going to fail
in such an obvious way?

2190
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,270
(His mischievous side
gets activated.)

2191
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,440
Why did you say "Bear?"

2192
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,840
I'll do the same.

2193
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,910
I'm sorry.

2194
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:08,680
Sweet potato, cherry,
magnifying glass, Wi-Fi,

2195
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,980
and praying mantis!

2196
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:12,780
(Se Chan succeeds in it
with the shouting method.)

2197
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,250
The Eiffel Tower in Paris.

2198
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,720
(Ddochi succeeds in saying
a difficult word.)

2199
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,820
- Well done.
- What a surprise.

2200
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:18,850
Well done.

2201
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:23,090
(Ji Hyo, Haha, Daniel, and Jong Kook
succeed in it.)

2202
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:24,590
(The last one, Tae Hyun,
needs to succeed in it.)

2203
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,690
Should I succeed in it?

2204
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:27,930
- If you fail...
- Give it a go.

2205
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,660
Should I fail on purpose?

2206
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,030
Should I fail in a ridiculous way?

2207
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,130
(He considers failing on purpose
for a grand party.)

2208
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,470
Hey, what are you doing?

2209
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:35,540
(Hey, what are you doing?)

2210
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,040
- I was just thinking about...
- Is it your turn?

2211
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,070
what I should do.

2212
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,170
- I made up my mind.
- Let's omit one.

2213
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,240
- We should omit one.
- Hey,

2214
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,410
- we should lose the marching band.
- Okay.

2215
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:42,910
(Between friendship and entertainment,
what will he choose?)

2216
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,380
- With "Rhy?"
- With "Rhy?"

2217
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,610
Chopsticks, jjajangmyeon,
hanger, Kong Hyo Jin,

2218
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,420
- and cheese.
- Okay!

2219
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,780
(He chooses friendship!)

2220
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,920
Success!

2221
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,620
Except for two members,

2222
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,420
everyone succeeded in it.

2223
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,090
- Yes.
- You can omit one celebration set.

2224
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,260
- Jong Kook, please choose...
- Thank you. Seriously.

2225
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,330
a number from 1 to 3.

2226
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,560
- Then the corresponding set...
- That's right.

2227
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,570
will be omitted.

2228
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:05,630
Is the marching band number one?

2229
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,600
- Yes.
- We can't tell you that.

2230
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,200
- Is it?
- One hundred percent.

2231
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,800
Something isn't right.

2232
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,810
- Earlier...
- It's number one.

2233
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,970
Is it number one?

2234
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:14,980
(It's number 1.)

2235
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,310
(Suspicious)

2236
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,710
When I entered,

2237
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,180
I didn't hear the marching band
from the start.

2238
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,350
- Number 3.
- It's number 2.

2239
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,080
- The numbers were mixed up.
- The numbers were mixed up.

2240
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,050
(It's number 2!)

2241
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:28,690
(Tae Hyun gives him a signal
to choose number 2.)

2242
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:32,230
- I'll choose number 1.
- Number 1?

2243
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,190
Tae Hyun gave you a signal
to choose number two.

2244
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,460
Seriously.

2245
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,860
- You can't trust your friend.
- That was why.

2246
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,770
- That was why I chose number one.
- You can't trust your friend.

2247
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:42,970
At the party venue,
set number one will be omitted.

2248
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:43,970
(The marching band survives!)

2249
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,610
For the last chance to omit a set,

2250
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,440
- you'll move to a new location.
- Okay.

2251
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,310
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2252
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,710
What's this?

2253
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:53,610
- There's water.
- What's this?

2254
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:55,650
- We'll enter the water.
- What's this?

2255
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,750
- What? Tall, tallest,
- What's the tallest?

2256
01:11:57,790 --> 01:11:59,150
- short.
- I see that we'll get wet.

2257
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,790
I didn't bring extra underwear.
This is bad.

2258
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:01,790
You didn't bring extra underwear.

2259
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:03,920
- Then you should go commando.
- I'll go commando.

2260
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,490
You should go home that way.

2261
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:08,530
- This is...
- For the last chance,

2262
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:11,330
you'll play Hold Out to Be
the King of Touches.

2263
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,270
The contender will begin
by kneeling on the yellow mat...

2264
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:17,100
at the edge of the platform.

2265
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,140
Then they will push the kickboard
that's made of white styrofoam,

2266
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:24,210
touch the bar in the water,
and come back.

2267
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,580
It's like that roller wheel.

2268
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,920
You need core muscles.

2269
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,550
We'll succeed in it.
It's okay. We can do it.

2270
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,720
- We can do it.
- Each person...

2271
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,420
- will get two minutes.
- I don't have core muscles.

2272
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,690
If the members...

2273
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:38,290
make a total of 30 round trips,
it'll be a success.

2274
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:39,830
You'll need to do it a lot.

2275
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,260
(Then they'll be able to omit
one more remaining set.)

2276
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,060
Jong Kook, can't you do it 30 times?

2277
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,400
- We can do it.
- I bet you can do it alone.

2278
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,430
Let's see what happens.

2279
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:46,570
- Jong Kook, you do it.
- Thirty.

2280
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:48,040
You should go last.

2281
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,300
We adjusted the distance...

2282
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,070
- in accordance with your height.
- We can do it.

2283
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:55,180
The tallest category is for Daniel.

2284
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,240
The tall category...

2285
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,510
is for Jae Seok, Jong Kook,
Seok Jin, and Se Chan.

2286
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:00,010
- We aren't tall.
- Also, Tae Hyun is...

2287
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:02,120
- in the tall category.
- No way.

2288
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,180
The short category...

2289
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,650
is for Ji Hyo and Ye Eun.

2290
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,950
Haha,

2291
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:09,660
you can choose between
the tall and short categories.

2292
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,890
Haha.

2293
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,290
You're short if you're under 170cm.

2294
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,290
That's right.
- We have it then.
- No.

2295
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,730
- Really?
- Hold on.

2296
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:17,360
- Is Haha under 170cm?
- Yes. I think he's 167cm tall.

2297
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,530
In that case...

2298
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,070
- If you hadn't mentioned 170cm...
- Hey.

2299
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:22,770
- You're under 170cm.
- It's okay.

2300
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,740
Haha, I'm a bit over 171cm tall.

2301
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,240
You're 173cm tall, you punk.

2302
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,810
No, I'm not.

2303
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,340
- You're 173cm tall.
- No, Haha. You're 169cm tall.

2304
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,640
You're 173cm tall.

2305
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,080
No. Tae Hyun is 173cm tall.

2306
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,350
- I'm 173cm tall.
- Let me see.

2307
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:35,320
- He's 173cm tall.
- You're 175cm tall.

2308
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:36,580
Thank you.

2309
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,250
- Ye Eun, what's your height?
- I'm 171.6cm tall.

2310
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,260
- Really? She's 171.6cm tall.
- Yes.

2311
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,590
- Are you 171.6cm tall?
- It's the precise measurement.

2312
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,120
- I'm 171.6cm tall.
- You're wearing flats too.

2313
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,590
- She's much taller.
- You're 180cm tall.

2314
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,560
- Look. This is the difference.
- You're 180cm tall.

2315
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,430
Can't you choose
the short category for me?

2316
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,860
Just choose the short category.

2317
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,930
It won't matter after the shoot.

2318
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,330
- That's right.
- Why would you make a fuss?

2319
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:55,470
(He chooses the short category
for Jong Kook.)

2320
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,910
- All right. Let's go.
- Hold me.

2321
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:59,640
- Seok Jin, go ahead.
- Seok Jin will go first.

2322
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,940
- Really?
- Of course.

2323
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,880
- Seok Jin, let's go.
- If you try...

2324
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,940
(The first contender, Seok Jin)

2325
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:04,950
- Let's go.
- Yes.

2326
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:07,680
If you try to lift up your chin,
you will tilt your back.

2327
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:08,950
Keep your face down.

2328
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,020
- Should I keep my face down?
- Yes.

2329
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,550
- That way, your core will work.
- I see.

2330
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:14,220
Seok Jin, if you do 3 or 4,

2331
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:15,420
we won't have a problem.

2332
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:17,160
Three or four?
How many do you want me to do?

2333
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,330
Try it.

2334
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:19,590
- Do 3 or 4.
- By the way,

2335
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:22,030
who will hold him? Us?

2336
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,430
- The members will.
- I see.

2337
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,500
Jong Kook, hold me.

2338
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,270
- I'll do it.
- Hold me.

2339
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:29,340
- Yes. Jong Kook will do it.
- I need to do it.

2340
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,410
Don't stick out your butt.

2341
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:32,640
- Then you won't use your core.
- Then what?

2342
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,470
Tighten your core
and keep your spine neutral.

2343
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,180
Don't stick out your butt.

2344
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,540
(Seok Jin doesn't look confident.)

2345
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,780
- You can do it.
- Seok Jin, wet the kickboard.

2346
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:42,020
You can do it. It isn't easy.

2347
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,080
- Let's go.
- I shouldn't have eaten.

2348
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,590
- Put your knees on the very edge.
- Seok Jin.

2349
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:45,790
The very edge.

2350
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:46,950
There you go.

2351
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:48,690
- If you're ready,
- Let me stretch.

2352
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:50,460
we'll start the timer.

2353
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:51,960
Good luck.

2354
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,160
- Is this the tall category?
- Hold on.

2355
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,360
- Gosh, this is...
- Two minutes.

2356
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,900
The kickboard is slippery.

2357
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,030
Seok Jin, grab the ends.

2358
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:00,900
- That's right.
- Press it down.

2359
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,900
- Place your torso over it.
- How?

2360
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,610
- Over it.
- Yes, place your torso over it.

2361
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:06,440
Gosh, I don't think I can do it.

2362
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:09,240
Just now, your back was tilted.

2363
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,380
- Don't tilt it.
- What should I do?

2364
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,650
Align your hip bones.

2365
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,650
- Get ready.
- Seok Jin.

2366
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,050
- Seok Jin.
- Let's go.

2367
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,550
- You got the power.
- You got the power.

2368
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:18,390
Touch it.

2369
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:19,490
- You got the power.
- You got the power.

2370
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,120
(He keeps his back straight
per Trainer Kook's instruction.)

2371
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,290
(Will he succeed in it?)

2372
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,630
(Groaning)

2373
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:27,860
- Did you touch it?
- Didn't I touch it?

2374
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,030
- Seok Jin, go further.
- Scoot forward.

2375
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,230
- Shall I scoot forward?
- Scoot forward.

2376
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,870
- That's right.
- It'll be great.

2377
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:33,870
You're great.

2378
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,270
- Among men in their 50s...
- Seok Jin,

2379
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,970
- just a bit more.
- You're the best 60-year-old.

2380
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,370
This is so hard.

2381
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,410
- Let's go, 60-year-old.
- For goodness' sake.

2382
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:43,240
- Just 10cm more.
- You can do it.

2383
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,380
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

2384
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,480
Go. Seok Jin,
believe in Jong Kook and go.

2385
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,120
- You can do it.
- Just do it once.

2386
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,480
- He has 2 minutes, right?
- So far, 50 seconds have passed.

2387
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,890
- Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin, one minute remains.

2388
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:53,350
Push your knees a bit forward.

2389
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,760
Oh, no. Seok Jin can't do it.

2390
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,960
Push your knees.

2391
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:58,860
- A bit more.
- There you go.

2392
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,230
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

2393
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:01,260
Push it.

2394
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,500
- You can do it.
- Push it.

2395
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,800
(Drowning)

2396
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,270
(Laughing)

2397
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,680
(Laughing)

2398
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,210
Seok Jin, are you okay?

2399
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,750
Are you okay?

2400
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,250
- You're cool.
- So far, 1 minute and 10 seconds...

2401
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,850
- have passed.
- You didn't touch it.

2402
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:29,360
- You have to do it.
- Seriously.

2403
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,160
- Then no one can do it.
- Seriously.

2404
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,460
- Did I touch it or not?
- You didn't touch it.

2405
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,600
(He didn't even come close
to touching it.)

2406
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,230
There was a gap this big.

2407
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,900
- I have time, right?
- Yes, you still have time.

2408
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,800
- Hurry up.
- You still have time.

2409
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,070
Seok Jin, that's the attitude.
You still have time.

2410
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:45,070
You should remember today.

2411
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:46,640
I...

2412
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,810
Seok Jin. This mission will be hard.

2413
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,210
- Gosh, this is...
- It'll be hard.

2414
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:53,210
- Try it.
- Seriously.

2415
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:54,950
- How annoying.
- It's okay.

2416
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:56,480
It's a fight against myself.

2417
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,750
- That's right.
- That's right, Seok Jin.

2418
01:16:58,220 --> 01:16:59,590
Let's see if you can do it or not.

2419
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,360
- Hyun Woo is watching.
- Try it.

2420
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,860
Hyun Woo, study hard in the US.

2421
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:04,890
- That's right.
- Try it now.

2422
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:07,460
- His dad...
- Don't watch this.

2423
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:09,130
- His dad...
- Just study hard...

2424
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,070
in the US.

2425
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:16,140
Your friend will send a link
to the clip.

2426
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,800
- His friend...
- Don't click on it.

2427
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,340
"Don't click on it."

2428
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,210
- It's spam.
- Don't click on it.

2429
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,440
You'll lose all your money.

2430
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,080
"You'll lose all your money."

2431
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,880
(This is how your dad makes money.)

2432
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,520
That's so funny.

2433
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,690
(Ye Eun becomes absorbed.)

2434
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,620
- You can do it.
- You're cool.

2435
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:35,860
You can do it.

2436
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,030
(Hyun Woo's dad tries again.)

2437
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:39,030
- Go.
- That's it.

2438
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,430
- Put your torso over it.
- You work out these days.

2439
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,160
Put your torso over it. Go.

2440
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:43,700
Go. Push it.

2441
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,370
- There you go. Push it.
- A bit further.

2442
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,640
(Hyun Woo, I'll succeed in it.)

2443
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:52,610
Let go!

2444
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,180
Let go!

2445
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,080
(Time's up)

2446
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,150
Seok Jin.

2447
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,720
How embarrassing.

2448
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,750
Hyun Woo.

2449
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,050
If you click on the link,
you'll lose your bank information.

2450
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,590
- Hyun Woo, focus on studying.
- You'll lose your bank information.

2451
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,630
- This is how your dad makes money.
- Hyun Woo.

2452
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,430
(They can't watch the dad's attempt
without tears.)

2453
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,200
- Seok Jin.
- Hyun Woo.

2454
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,270
Seok Jin, you still have time.

2455
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,470
Don't lie, you punk.

2456
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,930
(Frigid)

2457
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:22,870
(Seok Jin fails
without touching the bar once.)

2458
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,200
- Oh, no.
- Seok Jin.

2459
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,240
That's so funny.

2460
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,340
- You can do it.
- I'm so annoyed.

2461
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,440
- It's too bad.
- Let's see how well you can do.

2462
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,940
- You laughed at me, right?
- We didn't laugh.

2463
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:31,240
- We didn't laugh.
- Why would we laugh?

2464
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,750
- Let's go.
- We were crying.

2465
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,110
- We cheered you on.
- Who's next?

2466
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,320
- Come on up.
- Jae Seok?

2467
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,520
- Okay.
- Shall I go next?

2468
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,780
- You can do it.
- Do ten.

2469
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,250
I won't know until I try it.

2470
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,860
(Getting up)

2471
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,930
(Jae Seok has strong core muscles.)

2472
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,400
- Put your knees on the very edge.
- Okay.

2473
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,430
- The very edge. Hold on.
- Hold me tight.

2474
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:53,370
- Hold me tight.
- Get ready.

2475
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,040
- Don't make your knees sink.
- Watch your knees.

2476
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,200
(Will he succeed in it
on his first try?)

2477
01:18:58,940 --> 01:18:59,940
One.

2478
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,140
(Sputtering)

2479
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,510
(He looks like a sardine
in the broth.)

2480
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:07,050
He let go of the kickboard.

2481
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,590
Why is the bar so far?

2482
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,220
Why is the bar so far?

2483
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,360
(He's surprised
by the long distance.)

2484
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,460
He let go of the kickboard.

2485
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,860
- Why is the bar so far?
- Jae Seok.

2486
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,260
The distance is longer
than I expected.

2487
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:22,360
(It's a challenge even for a fit man
like Jae Seok.)

2488
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,730
- The distance... Hold on.
- Don't put the knees apart.

2489
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:24,760
Let me go a bit forward.

2490
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,630
I don't think
your knees should stick out.

2491
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,630
Will you be able to do it?

2492
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:28,940
- Is it a bad idea?
- They need to support your weight.

2493
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,440
They shouldn't stick out.
They need to support your weight.

2494
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,670
- Here.
- Okay.

2495
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,370
If Jae Seok can't do it,

2496
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:35,080
- it's impossible.
- Seriously.

2497
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,580
You still have time.

2498
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:37,780
- Pull me in.
- Had the kickboard had...

2499
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:39,380
handles, you would've done well.

2500
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,610
- I know.
- Keep your feet up.

2501
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,820
It's hard to hold him.

2502
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,620
I need to go much further
than I expected.

2503
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,150
- Touch it.
- He did it.

2504
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,390
- Touch it.
- He did it.

2505
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:50,160
He did it. Let's go.

2506
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,360
(He succeeds in it in two tries.)

2507
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,130
- Let's go.
- He succeeded in it.

2508
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,030
- He can do it now.
- Touch it.

2509
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,500
- Good.
- Two.

2510
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,270
- Let's go. One more.
- How does he do that?

2511
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,200
- Three.
- There you go. That's good.

2512
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,600
- Good.
- He got this.

2513
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,940
- How does he do that?
- Let's go.

2514
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:04,540
- He can do it now.
- Seok Jin.

2515
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,710
- That's good.
- Four.

2516
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,770
How does he hold the edges?

2517
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:10,040
- Touch it.
- Five.

2518
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,050
(He touches it 5 times
in an instant.)

2519
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:14,550
- It's hard, right?
- Good. Take a short break.

2520
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,220
- Let me take a short break.
- Breathe.

2521
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,720
I got the hang of it.

2522
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,850
- Good.
- Ten seconds remain.

2523
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,050
- Ten seconds?
- Let's do it once more.

2524
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:22,090
(There is no time to rest.
Only 10 seconds remain.)

2525
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,060
You can do it.

2526
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,460
- Touch it.
- Six.

2527
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,490
Good.

2528
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,060
- There you go.
- Good.

2529
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,160
One more time.

2530
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,300
(Time's up)

2531
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,270
- I got the hang of it.
- You did it seven times.

2532
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:35,600
- Did you get the hang of it?
- Did you get the hang of it?

2533
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:37,100
(Jae Seok did it 7 times.)

2534
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,340
- Did you get the hang of it?
- Did you get the hang of it?

2535
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:39,610
- Give us your know-how.
- I got the hang of it.

2536
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:40,840
Tell us what to do.

2537
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:41,940
Hold the kickboard...

2538
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:43,740
and push...

2539
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,680
- with your abdomen.
- Push in your butt. That's right.

2540
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,680
You did it seven times.

2541
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:50,120
Now, the remaining members
need to do it...

2542
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,590
- only 23 times.
- It's doable.

2543
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:53,390
- Are you ready?
- Here I go.

2544
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,390
Get ready.

2545
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,060
Hey, I...

2546
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,330
- I'll go at once.
- Okay.

2547
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:00,760
- Hold tight.
- Don't worry.

2548
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:02,700
Go.

2549
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,860
- He touched it.
- Go.

2550
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,100
(He falls into the water at once.)

2551
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,800
- He's swimming.
- He's swimming.

2552
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,340
(He shows off his swimming skills
since he's in the water.)

2553
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,570
- Good.
- Why did you come out that way?

2554
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,070
Good.

2555
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,870
(It looked like he'd play around.)

2556
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,110
You can do it.

2557
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,610
- You can do it.
- A bit more.

2558
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,050
- You can do it.
- A bit more.

2559
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:21,580
- You did it.
- Good. You did it.

2560
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,920
- Go back.
- Let's go.

2561
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:25,150
- Good.
- We're set.

2562
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:27,990
(Number of successful touches:
8 out of 30)

2563
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:29,390
- She did it.
- She did it.

2564
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,890
(Power Ji Hyo does it 1 time!)

2565
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,530
- One.
- Ji Hyo.

2566
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,530
- Let go.
- Gosh, I'll let go.

2567
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,100
- Did you get a cramp?
- One time.

2568
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,170
There's a time limit.

2569
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:40,330
(Daniel, Haha, and Ye Eun
fail to do it once.)

2570
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:42,870
How many times remain?

2571
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,870
Now, you need to do it
21 more times.

2572
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:47,140
- You did it nine times.
- We did pretty well.

2573
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,640
It's the same thing.

2574
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,910
All right. Good luck.

2575
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,510
Se Chan, I'm certain
you'll succeed in it.

2576
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:54,010
You can do it ten times.

2577
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,850
- That's right. You can do it.
- There you go.

2578
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:57,650
Hold on. Heave-ho. Did I touch it?

2579
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,820
- One.
- You touched it.

2580
01:21:58,820 --> 01:21:59,920
- Okay.
- You did it.

2581
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,360
- Good.
- You got this. You can do it.

2582
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,360
Here I go.

2583
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,960
- I didn't touch it.
- You touched it.

2584
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,090
- You touched it.
- You touched it.

2585
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,230
- You touched it.
- There you go.

2586
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:13,300
- There you go.
- Keep going.

2587
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:15,170
- We got this.
- If you do it ten times,

2588
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,440
- Jong Kook can do the rest.
- Five.

2589
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,410
(He stirs up the water
with his power.)

2590
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:19,510
- One more time.
- One more time.

2591
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,270
- That's good.
- Let me do it one more time.

2592
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,580
- Go back.
- Go back.

2593
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:24,740
There you go.

2594
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,610
- You did it ten times.
- Ten times.

2595
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,180
- Seriously.
- He did it so many times.

2596
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:30,380
- How did he do so well?
- Jong Kook has a chance.

2597
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,990
- Well done.
- Jong Kook has a chance.

2598
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:34,390
- Well done, Se Chan.
- He did it so many times.

2599
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,690
Everyone else has gone, right?
It's my turn.

2600
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:36,890
- It's your turn.
- Okay. Let's go.

2601
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,960
You just need to do it
over ten times.

2602
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:40,690
It's doable, right?

2603
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:42,460
Jong Kook can do it.

2604
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:43,830
- Jong Kook, you can omit a set.
- Jong Kook can do it.

2605
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:45,470
Let's omit a set. Good.

2606
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,430
Hey, this is about you.

2607
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,540
(It's his last chance to stop
the production crew's noisy party.)

2608
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,870
Jong Kook, this is about you.

2609
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,510
Jong Kook needs to do it 11 times...

2610
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,210
- to omit a set.
- Did you say 11 times?

2611
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:58,910
Please, Jong Kook.
Jong Kook, this is about you.

2612
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,650
- You're right.
- This isn't about someone else.

2613
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:02,150
- This is about you.
- You need to do it in the end.

2614
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,420
- You need to do it.
- Yes. This is about you.

2615
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:06,220
You can do it 11 times.

2616
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,890
Se Chan did it ten times.

2617
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:09,460
- You can do it 11 times.
- Get ready.

2618
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,120
- Se Chan did it ten times.
- Shall I begin?

2619
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,530
Did I do it ten times?

2620
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,430
- Hold on.
- It's impossible.

2621
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,460
- It's a bit further.
- Hold on.

2622
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,830
- He's in trouble.
- This is...

2623
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,170
Jong Kook, this is about you.

2624
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,930
- This...
- Your lower body should follow.

2625
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:21,940
Hold on.

2626
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,900
- This is about you.
- Push your pelvis a bit more.

2627
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,570
- It isn't easy to hold it.
- The kickboard keeps moving.

2628
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:28,410
All of us did it.

2629
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:30,580
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

2630
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,250
We all did it.

2631
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,320
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

2632
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:36,650
What are you doing?

2633
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,590
- Wait. I...
- Hey.

2634
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:39,650
My body...

2635
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:41,550
I stretched my body fully.

2636
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,690
- Se Chan did at least ten.
- I did this!

2637
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:45,530
- My body was fully stretched.
- Hey.

2638
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:46,930
- I also...
- I can't stretch it anymore.

2639
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,430
(His butt is raised,
unlike his advice.)

2640
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,800
- I did it like that.
- You did it like this.

2641
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,670
- Should I do it like this?
- Yes.

2642
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:56,100
- It's because you're scared.
- Should I do it like this?

2643
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,640
- Like this.
- After moving?

2644
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,640
- Right.
- Go.

2645
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,040
- Like this.
- It's much better.

2646
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,080
- Yes.
- You have one minute left.

2647
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,380
- You have one minute left.
- Jong Kook.

2648
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,410
- Okay.
- It's not coming.

2649
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:07,850
- He can't do it.
- What's wrong with you?

2650
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:09,520
Hold on.

2651
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,620
(He has to lower his butt more!)

2652
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,050
- I stretched my body fully.
- His hair is wet.

2653
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,390
Stretch out more. Don't be scared.

2654
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,960
- Right.
- More. You're there.

2655
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,390
Did it not touch?

2656
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:21,660
(His hip joint is still bent.)

2657
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,030
- A little bit.
- It didn't touch.

2658
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,960
- I stretched my whole body.
- It's much farther away.

2659
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,330
(At this rate, he will get
a noisy, chaotic celebration party.)

2660
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,740
It's very far.

2661
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,140
- Hey.
- There you go.

2662
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:33,940
- There you go.
- What are you doing?

2663
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:35,010
(He finally
stretched himself fully.)

2664
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:36,010
- It worked. One...
- It worked.

2665
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:37,140
- Did it touch?
- It did.

2666
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,240
- One.
- Stretch.

2667
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,550
(He finally managed to do it once.)

2668
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,180
- You know how to do it now.
- He knows now.

2669
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:48,190
Your wife might be hanging
on a wire.

2670
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,020
- Good.
- Two.

2671
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,120
- You're doing well.
- Right.

2672
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,890
- Good.
- Three.

2673
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:55,330
- Amazing.
- Go down. Would that be harder?

2674
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,960
- Three.
- Four.

2675
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,260
- Four.
- Good.

2676
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,670
- Right.
- It's tough.

2677
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:00,970
Wouldn't that be harder?

2678
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:04,870
(The person using his strength...)

2679
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:06,840
(and the person holding him
are both struggling.)

2680
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,840
- Well done.
- You're doing well.

2681
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,940
- He knows how to do it.
- He knows now.

2682
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,310
- You have ten seconds left.
- Five!

2683
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:12,350
It's harder holding him.

2684
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:14,450
- He knows now.
- You have ten seconds left.

2685
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:15,880
(He needs to do 6 more to succeed.)

2686
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,250
- Ten,
- He knows now.

2687
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,050
- nine,
- Six. He's getting faster.

2688
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,420
- eight,
- Seven.

2689
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,060
- seven,
- You got it.

2690
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,620
(The last spurt)

2691
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,390
six,

2692
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:27,630
- five,
- One more time.

2693
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:29,360
- four.
- One more time.

2694
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,260
Harder.

2695
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,170
(Whistle blowing)

2696
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:34,970
Harder.

2697
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:38,440
(The time ran out with 2 to go.)

2698
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:40,310
(Smiling)

2699
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:41,440
It broke.

2700
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,540
I should have done a few more.

2701
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:47,450
- We failed in the end.
- We failed.

2702
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,250
Not even Jong Kook could do this.

2703
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,450
I'm sorry, but what's the point
of getting congratulated after this?

2704
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,890
- Let's go.
- Let's go party!

2705
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:55,150
Okay.

2706
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,420
- I'm excited.
- I'll see you later.

2707
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:59,230
- Okay.
- Let's party!

2708
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:00,330
(The members enter first
in wet clothes.)

2709
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:01,960
Let's go, party tonight

2710
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,760
- It's starting.
- They skipped that.

2711
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,860
Right.

2712
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,170
Let's go, party tonight

2713
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:09,070
(Set 1 that had the song "She"
and the smoke disappeared.)

2714
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,640
- Number one disappeared.
- It's gone.

2715
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,370
- That's gone.
- Number one is gone.

2716
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:13,510
- What a shame.
- Jong Kook...

2717
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:15,640
- It would have been nice.
- That comes later.

2718
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,680
(The groom is getting ready.)

2719
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,650
Am I getting handsome?

2720
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,350
(He says he hates it,
but he still does everything.)

2721
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:27,320
- It's time to go in.
- Okay.

2722
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:28,960
The guest of honor. That's funny.

2723
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,020
(They've been waiting for this day
for 15 years.)

2724
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,160
Okay.

2725
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,790
(The production crew's
over-the-top celebration)

2726
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:34,790
- Jong Kook would...
- The guest of honor is coming.

2727
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,960
- The guest of honor is coming.
- How much would he...

2728
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:38,700
How much would he hate this?

2729
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,070
(It begins now.)

2730
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:45,610
(He enters with bold steps
without the song "She.")

2731
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:47,840
(Be silent.)

2732
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,940
(They sing
with their voices instead.)

2733
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,950
He did that
for the groom's entrance too.

2734
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:55,420
(He leaves the red carpet.)

2735
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,050
- You should walk on the red carpet.
- The carpet.

2736
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:00,550
(He gets there
via the shortest route.)

2737
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,390
What is this?

2738
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,790
- The red carpet.
- What did they...

2739
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:08,860
- Why? I want to walk like this.
- Walk on the red carpet.

2740
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:10,530
- The red carpet...
- Enjoy it.

2741
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:12,830
- You're the guest of honor.
- Right.

2742
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:14,870
Stand in front, Jong Kook.

2743
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:16,400
Jong Kook!

2744
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,900
Hold on.

2745
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:19,410
- Why are you doing things...
- Jong Kook!

2746
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:20,410
that aren't supposed to here?

2747
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:22,040
- It's starting.
- Please watch.

2748
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,040
It's coming.

2749
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:24,180
Why are you doing things
that aren't supposed to be here?

2750
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,910
- It's starting.
- Please watch.

2751
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:26,910
It's coming.

2752
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:30,820
You have to go to the front.

2753
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:34,650
- What did I get rid of then?
- Go to the front.

2754
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,720
(Today's highlight)

2755
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:40,460
What did I get rid of?

2756
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,790
(The groom trusted the members
and thought he got rid of it.)

2757
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:44,400
It suits you.

2758
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,100
(They keep coming in
one after another.)

2759
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,940
(Laughing)

2760
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:53,640
It suits him.

2761
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,410
(He looks far away.)

2762
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,010
(They stand around Jong Kook
like a cobra.)

2763
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:01,180
It's nice.

2764
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:05,350
(A fanfare of celebration
blasts all around.)

2765
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,350
(I'm sorry.)

2766
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,020
(But we're having fun.)

2767
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:14,090
(He's alone in the crowd.)

2768
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:18,670
(The fanfare
starts the second verse.)

2769
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:19,870
Look at his expression.

2770
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:21,370
(Happiness and sadness)

2771
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:23,200
Look at them.

2772
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:24,770
- They're leaving.
- It's a good day.

2773
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:26,170
They're leaving.

2774
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,840
Why...

2775
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:31,680
(Whistle blowing)

2776
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,280
(The card stunt begins right away.)

2777
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,550
Look to your left.

2778
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:41,020
(This is a lesson
for the married man.)

2779
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:42,590
"This is a lesson
for the married man."

2780
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,620
(He's more excited than the groom.)

2781
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:44,760
The first one.

2782
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,630
"Lesson One. Say goodbye
to plastic bags."

2783
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,960
- Bye.
- Look at that.

2784
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,730
"Lesson Two."

2785
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:53,770
"Work out once a day."

2786
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,670
"Lesson Three. Kiss three times..."

2787
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:59,170
- "a day."
- Kiss!

2788
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:01,770
(A marriage guide for Groom Kim)

2789
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:04,610
(A shocking relay
of the congratulatory message)

2790
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:06,580
(This is exciting.)

2791
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,450
(Bursting)

2792
01:29:10,450 --> 01:29:11,450
You startled me.

2793
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:12,820
Announce it before doing that.

2794
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:16,820
(He doesn't get surprised
by party poppers.)

2795
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:20,230
(Teasing him)

2796
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:21,760
Are you all right?

2797
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,500
(even the Kim Jong Kook clones
congratulate him.)

2798
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,130
- Don't give him a knife now.
- You should blow it.

2799
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:26,500
- Blow it.
- You can't give him...

2800
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,370
- a knife now.
- You should blow it.

2801
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:29,570
- Blow it.
- Blow it out after saying,

2802
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,770
"I love you, so and so."

2803
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,640
(Blowing)

2804
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:33,740
Blow it.

2805
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:35,410
(It collapsed miserably.)

2806
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:36,440
What should I do now?

2807
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:38,710
You should cut the cake.

2808
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,610
- Cut it?
- No.

2809
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:42,120
- What?
- Get this out,

2810
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,620
and cut it exactly in half.

2811
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:45,220
Or... Hey!

2812
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:47,390
He's really shy.

2813
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:48,590
There. Are you happy?

2814
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,120
- He's scary.
- Is that fine?

2815
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,920
Now, come out!

2816
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,560
- Come out!
- Come!

2817
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,330
Who will come out?

2818
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:58,830
Among the celebration sets
we prepared,

2819
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,930
the first set you eliminated...

2820
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:03,040
was Jong Kook's entrance set.

2821
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:06,140
It had "She" as the background music
with smoke,

2822
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,370
and you had to wear
a human garland ribbon...

2823
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:10,210
- Yes.
- around you. You got rid of that.

2824
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:11,640
- This is better than that.
- It's better, right?

2825
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,650
That was removed well.

2826
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:14,280
I love you.

2827
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,820
This was why...
He was worried you'd do this.

2828
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:17,120
He hid the news as he was worried
you'd do something like this.

2829
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,090
Anyway, thank you.

2830
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:23,120
- Thank you for doing all this.
- Yes.

2831
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,830
- Like this
- I'll enjoy the cake.

2832
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:27,590
Goodness. Enjoy it.

2833
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:29,730
- You used the chance card earlier,
- It's tasty.

2834
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,230
- It's tasty, right?
- so there are...

2835
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:33,000
(The final celebration wraps up
on Running Man.)

2836
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,330
(They used the chance card
3 times in Missions 1 and 2.)

2837
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:36,140
so there are three
penalty receivers.

2838
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

2839
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:40,510
In this container, everyone
has a penalty ball...

2840
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:41,610
- except Kim Jong Kook.
- Yes.

2841
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:44,480
Jong Kook will come forward
and pick...

2842
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,480
- the three people.
- All right.

2843
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,850
Jong Kook will pick
the three people.

2844
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:50,450
The remaining people
will get a penalty.

2845
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,020
- I'll pick.
- Okay.

2846
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,350
(The penalty receiver
chosen by Kim Jong Kook...)

2847
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:56,660
One, two, three!

2848
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,030
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Yu Jae Seok!

2849
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:01,460
Jee Seok Jin!

2850
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:04,030
- It's perfect.
- Let's go.

2851
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:05,500
It's perfect.

2852
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,530
It's really perfect.

2853
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:08,000
He picked...

2854
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,100
- these three members.
- This is the worst.

2855
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,500
- How did he pick those three?
- It's perfect.

2856
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,000
- It's great.
- It's perfect.

2857
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,940
- One, two, three.
- It's Jae Seok.

2858
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:15,510
Seriously.

2859
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,140
Today's penalty mission
is to wish Jong Kook...

2860
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,810
a happy marriage and make...

2861
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:20,910
a dried pollock
that chases away bad luck.

2862
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:21,950
- Make what?
- Dried pollock...

2863
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:22,980
chasing away bad luck.

2864
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:24,320
- Bad luck?
- Out of leather...

2865
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,820
You will make it by stitching
the leather.

2866
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,920
- It's what I'm bad at.
- It's a bothersome one.

2867
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,320
Why am I making so many things
these days?

2868
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:34,830
Please watch "The Ballad of Us."
Thank you.

2869
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,400
- He did it for this.
- Yes.

2870
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,400
For this one line.

2871
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,230
- Right.
- One last time.

2872
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:42,640
- Well done!
- Well done!

2873
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,600
Start!

2874
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,740
- Stop it.
- One, two, three, four!

2875
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:49,310
Go, go!

2876
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:54,580
(Final congratulations
to Jong Kook on his wedding!)

2877
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,850
Nice!

2878
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:01,520
(Jong Kook lived happily ever after
thanks to the protective charm.)

2879
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:02,990
Thank you.

2880
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:04,620
Let's go.

2881
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:06,530
(Thank you, Cha Tae Hyun,
for making us laugh so much,)

2882
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:07,860
(and please look forward to the
first episode on September 23!)

2883
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:09,030
That's enough.

2884
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:10,830
(In the jungle of corporate life,)

2885
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:13,400
(the new employees
are taking their first steps.)

2886
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,300
(The true rookie caught between
the experienced new employees)

2887
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,740
(Joohoney, a new employee
who completed his military service)

2888
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:17,940
(It looks like Sergeant Lee...)

2889
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,440
(isn't that willing to do
the "Kkyu-kkyo-kka-kka.")

2890
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,940
(The master of cuteness
suffers forever.)

2891
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:22,810
(The cuteness of a 30-year-old
new employee who surrendered)

2892
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,210
(He hits burnout immediately.)

2893
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,010
(The new employees
only filled with passion...)

2894
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:28,950
(are welcomed
by the 3 devilish CEOs.)

2895
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:30,250
(The man from the streets is doubted
for his qualities as CEO.)

2896
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,580
(Foul-mouthed Old Fossil, CEO Ha)

2897
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,520
(She disguises herself as a CEO
who cares about her employees.)

2898
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,790
(CEO Song, who commits wrongs
to sustain livelihoods)

2899
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,820
(She easily controls employees
who are about her father's age.)

2900
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,960
(But why does this company...)

2901
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,160
(terrify employees more with things
like this than with work?)

2902
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:42,730
(The young and rich boss
who intimidates others with her spirit)

2903
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:44,230
(Youthful Old Fossil,
CEO Kwon Eun Bi)

2904
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:45,530
(A chance
to bring down the evil CEO)

2905
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:46,630
(Report to the Ministry of Labor?)

2906
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:48,870
(How will the 3 companies,
blinded by selfish desires, end up?)

2907
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:50,140
(Dear CEO, Give Me the Salary)
