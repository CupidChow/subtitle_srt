1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,440
Goodness, the day is so...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,380
- Hey, it's hot.
- It's very hot.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,480
- It's a hot day.
- Summer is usually hot.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,580
My goodness.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,080
Hey, I can't go further
if it's clear down here.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,380
Gosh, the view is great.

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,020
- The view here is amazing.
- Hello.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,850
This is so cool.

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,420
(Where is this place with a green view
that can't be seen in Seoul?)

10
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,420
Look at the view.
(Where is this place with a green view
that can't be seen in Seoul?)

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,460
(Gyeongju)

12
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,990
- Hey, it's Gyeongju!
- Gyeongju!

13
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,060
Gyeongju!

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,100
- You come here for school trips...
- Gosh, how nice.

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,170
- and so on...
- We have so many memories...

16
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,740
- from Gyeongju.
- Of course.

17
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,240
Hey, did you give that tour here...

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,370
- in Gyeongju?
- Gyeongju. Seokguram.

19
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,440
The Great Dharani Sutra.
What a great view.

20
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,670
You know, there's also...

21
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,780
This is so cool.

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,650
- Oh, that's our drone. I thought...
- Look down there.

23
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,780
- Hi.
- Hi.

24
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,880
Hi, Gyeongju. We're here.

25
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm so scared.

26
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,950
(Shouting)

27
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,990
- What's up with him?
- This is amazing.

28
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,290
- Was that too contrived?
- Seok Jin always acts like...

29
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,590
he's in good condition.

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,960
(Once more?)

31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,830
You were so annoyed today.

32
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,900
His mood fluctuates a lot.

33
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,100
I couldn't help myself
after seeing the view.

34
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,700
- I mean, what is he...
- He shouted at the window.

35
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,970
Welcome to Gyeongju, everyone.

36
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,640
- It's been such a long time.
- It really has.

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,280
- Gyeongju.
- Gyeongju.

38
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,810
- It's an incredible place.
- I have so many memories here.

39
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,680
- So many.
- We have lots of memories here.

40
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,850
(They came to Gyeongju 2 years ago
on a history trip.)

41
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,050
(Under the guidance of Teacher Yu,)

42
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,420
(they had fun learning
for the first time in their lives.)

43
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,360
We have a guest
who came all the way...

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,160
to join you in Gyeongju.

45
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,700
- Who is it?
- What?

46
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,870
(A guest who came all the way
to Gyeongju?)

47
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,000
(Giggling)

48
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,370
- Who is it?
- Hello.

49
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,970
- Oh, it's MIYEON.
- MIYEON!

50
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,870
"I don't want to hear it!"

51
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,680
(She knows it herself very well.)

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
(MIYEON is just pretty.)

53
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,380
(I don't want to hear it!)

54
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,980
(She's Seok Sam's greatest enemy...)

55
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,950
(and an idol star
who doesn't like to dance.)

56
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,360
(Looking forward to MIYEON's
bright energy today as well)

57
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,590
(MIYEON came
all the way to Gyeongju.)

58
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,860
- "I don't want to hear it!"
- You came all the way here?

59
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,170
- Goodness, MIYEON.
- Come to the middle.

60
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,830
- You're so pretty.
- Hey, MIYEON.

61
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,240
- MIYEON, come here.
- You came all the way to Gyeongju?

62
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,740
- Yes.
- Come here.

63
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,870
- You're so pretty.
- Hey, MIYEON.

64
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,880
MIYEON, did you stop by the salon?

65
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,640
- Put it here.
- Did you stop by the salon?

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,450
- I did.
- Did you get any sleep?

67
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,710
You're so diligent.

68
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,810
Yes, I slept.

69
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,980
- On the way here?
- Yes.

70
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,880
- What time did you go to the salon?
- At 3 a.m.

71
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,250
- Three in the morning?
- Yes.

72
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,750
- I appreciate your effort.
- On the way here?

73
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,160
- That's impressive.
- Didn't you go to the salon?

74
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,960
- No, I didn't.
- I didn't either.

75
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,060
(As you can see, we look shabby.)

76
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,360
She's so diligent.

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,160
I did my makeup
after we arrived here.

78
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,000
Ye Eun came straight here
from the Waterbomb Festival.

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,730
- She came straight here.
- What time...

80
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,430
- You seriously...
- Look at the state Ye Eun is in.

81
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,600
- Do I look that funny?
- Oh, really?

82
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,640
- By the way, on the train here,
- Yes.

83
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,080
- on the KTX, Se Chan was...
- Yes?

84
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,910
I thought he was a theater actor
before a big play.

85
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,010
- Why?
- Why?

86
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,220
About 30 minutes before we arrived,
he pulled out a small mirror...

87
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,050
(Starting to powder his face)

88
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,050
- Why?
- No, I...

89
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,660
- I was doing my makeup.
- His makeup...

90
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,160
- You didn't have makeup on before?
- I thought...

91
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,990
he had a big performance
after the train ride.

92
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,330
- Like this.
- That's hilarious.

93
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,600
- And his eyebrows.
- But why?

94
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,930
When he does his makeup,
he looks kind of angry.

95
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,670
(Powdering his face with fury)

96
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,240
- My gosh.
- He's a big star.

97
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,870
- I have to put on makeup.
- Right.

98
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,340
- The big star did it himself.
- That's nice.

99
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,640
Today, we're in Gyeongju
to wish for the success...

100
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,180
- of APEC Gyeongju,
- That's right.

101
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,280
which Korea hasn't hosted
in 20 years.

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,450
The APEC summit meeting...

103
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,790
- will be held in October this year.
- Oh, APEC.

104
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,150
The badges you're wearing...

105
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,160
are based on the artifact,
"The Smile of Silla."

106
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,090
It is a souvenir
that welcomes the APEC nations...

107
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,830
- with a smile...
- Right, it's the Smile of Silla.

108
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,860
and aims to foster connections
with them.

109
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,430
Like so, Gyeongju has many artifacts
that we'd like to show the world.

110
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,540
Among them are unique artifacts
made out of seashells...

111
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,740
during the Silla Dynasty
that were discovered in Gyeongju.

112
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,010
So, the race we've prepared today
is Splitting Gamblers.

113
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,910
Splitting Gamblers? What's that?

114
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
- Are we breaking something?
- What's that?

115
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,350
- Or like breaking out into a smile?
- Breaking something?

116
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,620
- That could be it.
- Right.

117
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,980
You will choose
one of the seashells...

118
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,620
- that we've prepared.
- What?

119
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,150
- Seashells?
- Gosh, what's this?

120
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,360
- Seashells?
- In the final competition,

121
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
where you will break
each other's shells,

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,930
- a single member...
- I used to play this a lot.

123
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,330
with the hardest, intact shell
will get a prize.

124
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,500
- So, we have to pick a hard shell.
- Yes.

125
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,170
The other members will get
penalty balls according to rank,

126
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,570
and three people will be chosen
to receive the penalty.

127
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,480
Before the opening,

128
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,840
we held a running mission...

129
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,880
- Running.
- to test your competitive spirit.

130
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,050
Oh, we need to have a fast record.

131
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,620
(There was a mission
before they arrived here?)

132
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,790
- Oh, my. Gyeongju.
- It's Gyeongju!

133
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,860
- Gyeongju!
- Goodness.

134
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,990
If you raise a child,
you definitely have to visit Gyeongju.

135
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,100
Gyeongju is a beautiful place.

136
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,170
- We're so...
- Gyeongju is seriously...

137
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,170
I was so giddy before I came here
for the first time.

138
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,370
You feel so giddy as you get off
that tour bus.

139
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,110
- And when other boys walk by,
- I did too.

140
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,640
- you stare them down.
- That's right.

141
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,810
Gosh,
I thought we were going to eat.

142
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,940
Hey, what are you...

143
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,880
Why would we eat again?

144
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,810
- The Gyeongju Expo.
- Since they had us ride...

145
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,280
in two separate cars...

146
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,820
- What's that?
- What is that, all of a sudden?

147
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,990
(Suddenly,
a starting pistol goes off?)

148
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,120
- What's that?
- What is it?

149
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,060
- Hey, we have to run.
- Run.

150
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,360
(Just run!)

151
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,720
(The two quick-witted guys...)

152
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,960
Hey!

153
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,030
Shoot.

154
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,160
There's something over there.

155
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,730
(Jae Seok is close behind them.)

156
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,200
- Hey!
- You're suddenly making us run?

157
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,340
- Run.
- But it's so hot.

158
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,370
Come on.

159
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,340
(Will it be the nimble locust...)

160
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,570
Almost there.

161
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,980
- Gosh, what is this?
- I'm dying from the heat.

162
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,980
(Se Chan gets 1st place.)

163
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,850
- What is this?
- Hello.

164
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,950
- My gosh.
- You didn't leave anything, right?

165
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,780
- What?
- If you left something behind...

166
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,790
But why...

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,790
(The race isn't over for them yet.)

168
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,160
What did we just do?

169
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,060
- My pants are falling down.
- What?

170
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,430
- Do I get something for winning?
- Let's go up right away.

171
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, let's wait for Jong Kook.

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Hey, Jong Kook can't run.

173
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,670
I hate running the most.

174
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,740
It'll damage my joints.

175
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,640
- That is true.
- It'll damage my joints.

176
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,740
- Trainer Kim, you should still run.
- Yes?

177
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,710
- Hey, Niel, why did you get out?
- What?

178
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,210
- What's going on?
- What?

179
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,450
- What's that?
- That scared me!

180
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,650
Daniel and Ji Hyo have arrived.

181
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Hey!

182
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,990
Daniel is coming.

183
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,550
(They instinctively run
as if they're Pavlov's dogs.)

184
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,760
Hey!

185
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,220
(The finish line for female members
is 30m closer.)

186
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,290
Hey!

187
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,790
Wait up!

188
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,430
- I won!
- Shoot.

189
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,700
- Isn't it so hot?
- I know, right?

190
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,970
Where is everyone?

191
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,370
What was that?

192
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,470
(They start running, but...)

193
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,580
Hey, how have you been?

194
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,350
- Good.
- Your hair looks nice.

195
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,380
I had a late start, though.

196
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,820
- Gosh, my shoes...
- I didn't know...

197
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,980
- I didn't realize what it was.
- I started from too far behind.

198
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,490
In first place,

199
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,960
it's Ji Hyo
with a record of 23.83 seconds.

200
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,060
- Me?
- What?

201
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,090
- You're so fast, Ji Hyo.
- Oh, I guess so.

202
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,260
- What's this?
- What?

203
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,860
In second place...

204
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,160
- is Se Chan.
- It's me?

205
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,260
- Ssaebssaeb.
- Yangsebari.

206
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,830
- Your record was 28.40 seconds.
- That's fast.

207
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,970
I could've run faster.

208
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,770
- I could've run faster too.
- For third place,

209
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,040
- I was too laid back.
- this person's record...

210
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,270
- was 30.13 seconds.
- Jae Seok.

211
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,840
- It's Jae Seok.
- Yes.

212
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,270
- That's not bad.
- I started late.

213
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,880
- I just have to beat Ji Ye Eun.
- In fourth place...

214
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
is Daniel.

215
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,910
- Oh, Daniel.
- In fifth place is Haha.

216
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,680
- Haha.
- In sixth place...

217
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,820
is Seok Jin.

218
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,280
In seventh place is MIYEON.

219
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,150
- Your record was 56 seconds?
- What's that?

220
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,990
- In eighth place is Ye Eun.
- What?

221
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,220
In ninth place is Jong Kook.

222
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,960
- Jong Kook didn't run.
- Right.

223
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,590
- Seriously, Gym Jong Kook.
- Didn't you run?

224
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,990
- Jong Kook didn't run at all.
- I was way far behind.

225
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,230
I saw him from above.

226
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,160
- You thought it was just for us.
- I gave up.

227
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,630
So, according to this rank,

228
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,730
- Me, then Jong Kook.
- you will get to choose...

229
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,970
- your seashells.
- We get to choose?

230
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,170
- Oh, my.
- All right.

231
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,170
Yes, and the staff tried
breaking the seashells.

232
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,610
It's also important which part
you break and how.

233
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,280
- Right. That's true.
- Some seashells have that variable.

234
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,080
- Keep that in mind as you choose.
- I played this a lot as a kid.

235
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,680
- I've never played this.
- As you choose your seashell,

236
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,350
- you can't touch them.
- I know which ones are strong.

237
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,790
- You can only look and choose.
- Just by looking, right?

238
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,820
Some seashells just look weak.

239
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,820
Is that so?

240
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,360
I bet the short-necked clam shell
is really strong.

241
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,660
Gosh, I can't tell.

242
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,590
I'm so ruined.
Gosh, I shouldn't have been in last place.

243
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,160
What's a hen clam?
I've never seen it before.

244
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,960
- The short-necked clam. Hen clam?
- Ungpi clam...

245
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,330
- This looks strong.
- The pen shell...

246
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,630
- You can't touch them.
- How will you break it?

247
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,600
(No one can have it easy
in the world of competition.)

248
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,740
Jong Kook,
isn't the smooth clam good?

249
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,480
- You know already.
- Yes. The smooth clam.

250
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,610
The hard clam is strong too.

251
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,280
- The hard clam, for sure.
- I think the hard clam is good.

252
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,450
The hard clam is the one.

253
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,980
- The hen clam is shining.
- Hey, the hen clam...

254
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,220
I think the hen clam
will be really strong.

255
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,390
But look at the hazelnut ark.

256
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,590
It must be named
after a nut for a reason.

257
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,650
This looks like it could be
unexpectedly strong.

258
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,820
It looks like a nut.

259
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,960
But isn't the pen shell the weakest?

260
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,090
The pen shell is the weakest.

261
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,760
- It will look funny, though.
- Yes, it will.

262
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,160
- That one will get the laughs.
- This will definitely...

263
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,200
- Come here.
- That one...

264
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,970
Hey, the horned turban looks like
belongs to Jae Seok.

265
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,700
- The what?
- Oh, the horned turban.

266
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,040
It looks like it will be strong.

267
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,340
Well, it looks crooked like you.

268
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,170
- I can't tell from just looking.
- It's crooked.

269
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,970
- Ji Hyo, pick one.
- Ji Hyo, go on.

270
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,510
It's over once you grab one.

271
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,840
That's right.

272
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,180
Ji Hyo,
it's over as soon as you grab one.

273
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,180
- I'll take the hard clam.
- Hard clam.

274
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,150
- Hard clam.
- Goodness, kiddo.

275
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,650
- You're done.
- My goodness.

276
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,290
- The hard clam looks strong.
- This one looks strong.

277
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,460
I've tried most of these clams.

278
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,660
- Oh, you have?
- Yes, and I have shells at home.

279
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,960
- A strong one. Is that strong?
- Seok Jin, the abalone...

280
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,630
Nothing can beat this one.

281
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,700
Oh, you can't break it, can you?

282
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,170
- This one looks weak.
- But...

283
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,770
I bet the abalone shell
will shatter easily.

284
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,440
- What?
- That looks weak.

285
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,700
Gosh, but the abalone is strong.
I'll go with the abalone.

286
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,440
- Oh, Se Chan chose...
- Gosh, this is...

287
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
- pretty confusing.
- Really?

288
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,680
- Sure.
- Which should I choose?

289
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,110
- I'll take the abalone.
- Why the abalone?

290
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,410
This is confusing.

291
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,710
You should take the horned turban.

292
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,980
The horned turban is yours.

293
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,080
It has your name written on it.

294
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,580
- The horned turban?
- Yes, that one.

295
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,120
The opening doesn't look hard,

296
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,190
even though it seems that way
from the side.

297
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,790
Choosing this is your destiny.

298
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,850
- Yes.
- The horned turban.

299
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,420
It matches your crooked teeth.

300
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,890
The horned turban looks hard
on the outside.

301
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,130
Ungpi clam or hen clam could be
the better choice.

302
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,830
I've never heard
of ungpi clam before.

303
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,500
- Why was it named ungpi?
- It sounds fun.

304
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,030
- Because it evades capture.
- It's not that.

305
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,500
- The "pi" means "leather."
- Leather?

306
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,870
- What does "ung" mean, then?
- What about "ung?"

307
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,940
- Doesn't it mean "bear?"
- Yes, bear.

308
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,010
- Ung as in bear.
- A bear.

309
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,240
So does it mean a bear's hide?

310
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,670
It was named as such...

311
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,340
- because it's that durable.
- It's that durable.

312
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,380
- There.
- You chose the ungpi clam.

313
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,480
- The ungpi clam.
- You can't change your mind.

314
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,610
What would be better?

315
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,620
There are many good options left.

316
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,050
The pen shell and scallop
are good choices.

317
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,990
- Pen shells crack easily.
- That might not be true.

318
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,490
- To me, the surf clam...
- Don't.

319
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,060
Make him choose it.

320
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,890
- The pen shell might be hard.
- Hold on.

321
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,030
- Wait.
- No, the scallop.

322
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,030
The pen shell...

323
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,960
breaks as easily as a dipper gourd.

324
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,500
The razor clam might surprise you.

325
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,600
That will crack instantly.

326
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,270
- I could crack it like this.
- Choose the razor clam.

327
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,370
I'll choose...

328
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,640
- The short-necked clam?
- Hurry up.

329
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,270
- The hazelnut ark.
- Okay.

330
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,770
- You're done.
- All right.

331
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,340
- The hazelnut ark.
- He chooses how he sees it.

332
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,810
- That doesn't look hard.
- I don't know why I chose it.

333
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,050
(Haha chooses next.)

334
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,850
- The surf clam is small.
- It is.

335
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,280
- Go for it.
- It's just like me.

336
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,420
"Story of a Short Kid."

337
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,850
- I choose the surf clam.
- That's right.

338
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,250
The short kid makes his choice.

339
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,520
Seok Jin, please.

340
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,820
I know which one is better.

341
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,160
I'm going with the horned turban.

342
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,230
The opening seems weak...

343
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,490
compared to the sides.

344
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,800
- MIYEON's next.
- MIYEON.

345
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,400
- I recommend the smooth clam.
- The smooth clam?

346
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,330
- How come no one chose that?
- Is it hard?

347
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,130
The smooth clam is known to have
the hardest shell.

348
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,140
- Really?
- Yes.

349
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,470
- It looks fragile.
- Where's the smooth clam?

350
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,540
Right here.

351
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,140
Seok Jin,
the smooth clam is fragile.

352
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,570
- MIYEON, choose the pen shell.
- The pen shell.

353
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,280
- MIYEON, choose the razor clam.
- She's right.

354
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,310
- No, the scallop.
- This is better.

355
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,340
- Choose the scallop.
- Razor clam isn't so bad.

356
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,150
MIYEON, the others are lying.

357
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,510
The short-necked clam
is the best choice.

358
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,980
- They're all different.
- I mean it.

359
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,150
- Maybe the short-necked clam...
- I want this or this.

360
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,220
That would slip.

361
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,520
- MIYEON.
- I can tell.

362
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,090
- Isn't that shiny?
- That's a good one.

363
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,360
- That's a good one.
- Don't you want to choose it?

364
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
The hen clam's a good choice.

365
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,830
- Done!
- There you go.

366
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,890
You made a wise choice.
The hen clam's a good one.

367
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,760
- Hen or short-necked.
- What are you going to choose?

368
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
The pen shell?

369
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,830
She took the smooth clam.

370
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,500
Unbelievable. No way.

371
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,270
- You must be thrilled.
- That was left for you to take.

372
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,100
That's why you had everyone
focus on this side of the table.

373
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,840
- That's what I wanted.
- I can't believe her.

374
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,640
- She wanted that one.
- Short-necked clam it is.

375
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,710
That was you and me.

376
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,810
- That was clever.
- Short-necked clam it is.

377
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,540
You're right.
You can't choose the scallop.

378
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,780
The smooth clam has a hard shell.

379
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,250
The shiny clam

380
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,120
The last time we were in Gyeongju,

381
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,020
you enjoyed the group T-shirt,

382
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,090
- saying it made it feel...
- That's right.

383
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,120
like a real trip.

384
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,220
That's why we prepared
another one for you.

385
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,590
- Really?
- Is it colorful?

386
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,060
Wasn't it pink the last time around?

387
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,260
- Right?
- Pink with words written on them.

388
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,200
- I wasn't here for that.
- That's right.

389
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
- Both you and Ye Eun.
- What's that?

390
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
- What are these?
- Right here...

391
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,000
Did they have to be so tacky?

392
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,510
- I'm suddenly annoyed.
- Who designed these?

393
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,140
- Come on.
- The design and the font!

394
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,980
- This...
- Unbelievable.

395
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,350
Ye Eun, this one's yours.

396
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,410
Are you kidding me?

397
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,610
Come on.

398
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,720
- Oh, no.
- Here.

399
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,280
Are those flowers? Unbelievable.

400
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,590
These are embarrassing.

401
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,220
- "Wonderful."
- This is my type.

402
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,420
One might think
we entered a running competition.

403
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,260
Did it have to be so tacky?

404
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,590
- Daniel.
- "Gyeongju."

405
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,290
Is that it for the front?

406
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,060
Did it have to be so tacky?

407
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,030
I'm suddenly annoyed.

408
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,100
"Gyeongju Is the Triple Threat?"

409
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,140
Why couldn't there be a photo...

410
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,310
of the Cheomseongdae Observatory
or something?

411
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,810
What is this?

412
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,880
(Wonderful Gyeongju)

413
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,910
It's pretty.

414
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,710
These are embarrassing.

415
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,810
It's pretty.

416
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,180
- It's pretty. I like it.
- This is my type.

417
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
It's pretty.

418
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,820
I don't mind it being pink, but...

419
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,890
You'll change into
the group T-shirts...

420
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,960
- and head to the next location.
- This was designed...

421
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,390
for the elderly.

422
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,690
- You could pull this off someday.
- In a phone,

423
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,830
- it looks like me.
- Yes, it's you.

424
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,400
- In a phone, it's totally me.
- Exactly.

425
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
We look identical.

426
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,430
Ji Se Chan, hurry up.

427
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,770
You're so annoying.

428
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,330
- I'm going to cry!
- Okay, fine.

429
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,600
You choose. Will it be
Ji Se Chan or Ji Haha?

430
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,040
Se Chan's super popular.

431
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,910
I should be the one who's offended.

432
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,640
- You can be Ji Ye Eun.
- Fine by me.

433
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,710
You can be Ji Se Chan.

434
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,140
- Ji Se Chan.
- How so?

435
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,010
You look like Se Chan with that on.

436
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,450
You're me.

437
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,820
Seriously. You guys are annoying.

438
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,350
You're like
the baby octopus brothers.

439
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,550
That doesn't affect us at all.

440
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,360
- It's not news to us.
- Exactly.

441
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,520
You two are so ugly.

442
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
The female baby octopus.

443
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,830
I'm calling you Ji Se Chan today.

444
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,990
(Evil laughter)

445
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,530
You're so annoying.

446
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,060
- Oh, no.
- Exactly.

447
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,600
Jae Seok should sit in the middle.

448
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,970
It's been a while since I sat here.

449
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,100
(The three siblings got into it
again bright and early.)

450
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,470
This could be a dress.
It reaches the knees.

451
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,740
(Glaring)

452
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,840
It reaches the knees.

453
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,070
I like the design.

454
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,410
- Right?
- I love the design...

455
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,780
- and the shade of this pink.
- Right.

456
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,780
I'm really upset.

457
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,250
I'm seriously upset.

458
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
What was that?

459
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,020
- Only I heard that.
- What was that?

460
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,190
- Only I heard it.
- What did she say?

461
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,450
"I'm really upset."

462
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,020
"I'm seriously upset."

463
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,190
She's cute.

464
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,430
- She's cute.
- I know.

465
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,560
Ye Eun, hey.

466
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,990
Ye Eun, you won't stop drinking...

467
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,300
that strawberry smoothie.

468
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,200
- I bought that for her.
- My daughter's like that.

469
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,400
Really?

470
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,270
- Is that how Song Yi is?
- She always finishes her beverage.

471
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
I could buy one for you too.

472
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,140
Why can't I stand the three of you?

473
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,540
(Why can't I stand
the three of you?)

474
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,540
(Her true feelings
came from deep within.)

475
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,150
(Ye Eun bites back
after all the teasing!)

476
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,180
They're alike.

477
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,510
I can't stand the three of them.

478
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,980
Why don't you look ahead...

479
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,920
and look back at Ye Eun
on the count of three?

480
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,250
- From here?
- The three of them?

481
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,450
One, two, three.

482
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,090
Seriously.

483
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,060
- I hate them.
- We're your brothers, though.

484
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,690
- How was that?
- I hate it.

485
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,760
I bet you can't stand them.

486
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,900
To me, you're like
an addictive snack.

487
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,130
I can't stop.

488
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,370
I can't stop.

489
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,400
I mean it. It's insanely fun.

490
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
She gets the snack analogy
right away.

491
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,740
Did that click with you?

492
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,370
- It clicked instantly.
- What's your favorite flavor?

493
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,540
Onion.

494
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,110
- Onion!
- No way!

495
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,610
That's my favorite too.
Cheese-flavored is my second.

496
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,710
I like cheese-flavored too.

497
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,810
Cheese is a good one.

498
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,110
Where are we?

499
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,910
It's a museum.

500
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,050
We came here before on Running Man.

501
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,320
- That's right.
- We were here before.

502
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,550
Right, I remember.

503
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,320
Didn't we see that gold thing?

504
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,060
- In the museum.
- Yes. That's right.

505
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,860
The Divine Bell of King Seongdeok
is here.

506
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,160
- The Emile Bell.
- Right, the Emile Bell.

507
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,390
- You saw the Cheonmachong.
- Oh, it's here.

508
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,530
- Yes, we saw it.
- Isn't this where...

509
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,300
- Museums are so much fun.
- Yes, museums.

510
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,970
When I was young,
I was busy finding exits,

511
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,600
- but now...
- Aren't they interesting?

512
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,140
- They're so much fun.
- That's right.

513
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,670
(What mission awaits them?)

514
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,270
Aren't these the five...

515
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,510
You can find these at Seokguram.

516
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,410
- Aren't they the five deities?
- Of the Silla Dynasty...

517
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,710
Yes, Buddhist saints.

518
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,810
This is so cool.

519
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
- Hold on.
- Manjushri,

520
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,350
- Isn't my T-shirt too big?
- Avalokitasvara...

521
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,050
What size T-shirt did you give me?

522
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,620
- Why is yours...
- What size T-shirt did you give me?

523
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,630
- Isn't yours a dress?
- I'm wearing a skirt.

524
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,290
Tuck the front in your pants.

525
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,100
- I'll tuck it all in.
- You don't have to.

526
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,030
- Are we all wearing the same size?
- What?

527
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,200
- Are these the same size?
- But...

528
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,630
mine is longer than everyone else's.

529
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,170
(They're the same size.
Only their legs differ in length.)

530
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,940
You will now play a game...

531
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,210
for a chance to swap the clam
you picked earlier.

532
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,440
This is Correct Answer Hunters.

533
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,110
This time, unlike other quizzes
on the show,

534
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,550
it'll be multiple choice.

535
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,250
(They will be
multiple choice questions.)

536
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,250
- What?
- Really?

537
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,720
After splitting into 3 teams of 3,

538
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,520
two members from each team...

539
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,320
- will compete.
- Good.

540
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,230
There will be ten possible answers
for each question.

541
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,900
- Ten?
- And there can be...

542
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,560
- multiple correct answers.
- We have to choose.

543
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,730
After you hear the question
and the answers are revealed,

544
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,100
you will run to the board...

545
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,700
and grab your answer...

546
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,340
- when you hear the whistle.
- Really?

547
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,040
Each person can take...

548
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,610
- up to a maximum of two.
- Two?

549
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,610
- Okay.
- If they're both correct answers,

550
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,710
you'll score two points.

551
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,410
If you bring back the wrong answer,

552
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,320
- you'll lose a point.
- Sounds good.

553
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,750
- Okay.
- Not bringing back an answer...

554
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,490
- will also cost you a point.
- We have to bring one back.

555
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,190
Not bringing back an answer
will cost you a point.

556
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,060
Please note that you're not allowed
to steal the answer...

557
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,520
from someone who's seated.

558
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,590
The team with the highest score...

559
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,730
will receive clues about
how solid the clams are...

560
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,700
- and an opportunity to swap them.
- That's huge.

561
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,770
- That's huge.
- You'll get to check your clam...

562
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,940
against any clam of your choice.

563
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,070
(The clue:
Testing your clam against another)

564
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,570
Can we test the clams?

565
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,610
We need that for sure.

566
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,040
It's important to win.

567
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,810
The three ladies...

568
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,080
- will choose the teams.
- They'll choose.

569
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,550
- The teammates?
- They'll choose the teams.

570
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,150
The winner of rock-paper-scissors
should go first.

571
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,450
Go, Ji Ye Eun.

572
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,320
- Go, Ji Ye Eun.
- Go, Ji Ye Eun.

573
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,190
(They cheer her
after all that teasing.)

574
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,460
(Ji Hyo wins.)

575
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,620
- Choose Jae Seok.
- Haha.

576
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,630
(Haha)

577
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,230
- What was that?
- Hold on.

578
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,300
- You're the bomb squad.
- Are you kidding me?

579
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,470
Seriously?

580
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,070
- What's her deal?
- For real?

581
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,540
She's the bomb squad.

582
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,300
- What was that?
- He's upset.

583
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,600
- Don't cry.
- You...

584
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,470
Ji Hyo took on a huge task.

585
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,940
You should've chosen Jae Seok.

586
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,580
- Ji Hyo, you're the best.
- Join her.

587
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,680
- Join her for now.
- Go ahead.

588
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
The bomb squad.

589
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,950
Who was in second place?

590
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,150
MIYEON, go ahead.

591
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,550
(It's MIYEON's turn to choose.)

592
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,550
- Se Chan.
- She clears out another bomb.

593
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,420
MIYEON, this game is a quiz!

594
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,390
- Se Chan.
- She clears out another bomb.

595
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,220
MIYEON, this game is a quiz!

596
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,130
Hey! You should choose Jae Seok,

597
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,660
- Jong Kook, or Seok Jin.
- Hey!

598
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,090
Are you guys kidding me?

599
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,930
- I had no other choice.
- What on earth is this?

600
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,200
- What is this?
- This was for Ye Eun.

601
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,930
- Guys, this is a quiz.
- She's helping out.

602
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,030
MIYEON!

603
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,140
(They both choose
to take a bomb each.)

604
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,600
How heartwarming.

605
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
- It's heartwarming.
- Well done.

606
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,240
- This is so heartwarming.
- It is.

607
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,140
I choose Jae Seok.

608
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,580
(I choose Jae Seok.)

609
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,740
There you go.

610
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,950
Okay, good.

611
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,720
- It's like picking your dad.
- Okay, good.

612
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,150
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Play rock-paper-scissors again.

613
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,150
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

614
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,520
- Jong Kook.
- Seok Jin!

615
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,720
We'll take Daniel.

616
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,890
- This isn't a bad team.
- MIYEON, let's win.

617
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,660
I guess this turned out to be fair.

618
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,760
Please choose the two players
who'll compete first.

619
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,600
- Two?
- How will it be?

620
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,760
You guys have it way better.

621
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,070
I'm stuck with empty heads.

622
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,140
- What are you talking about?
- You have MIYEON.

623
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,340
- See who's on his team.
- You have MIYEON.

624
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,670
- You saw how she was the last time.
- You have MIYEON.

625
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,270
- MIYEON did a good job.
- Last time...

626
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,310
- Last time...
- Wasn't she on your level?

627
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,310
- Really?
- It was bad.

628
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,740
- Remember "renaissance?"
- "Renaissance."

629
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
It was Battle Renaissance.

630
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,150
- Se Chan...
- As for me...

631
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,610
was the best out of the empty heads.

632
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,980
- See? I won.
- That's right.

633
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,080
You guys acknowledged it.

634
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,350
I'm the best out of the empty heads.

635
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,150
- Yes, he won.
- But it's multiple choice.

636
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,550
- I agree he's the smartest.
- It's not so bad.

637
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,420
Se Chan, you and I are...

638
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,920
- on the same level.
- Those who aren't competing...

639
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,390
will sit in the back.

640
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,560
- Who's playing from your team?
- The other six...

641
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,960
- will sit here.
- It'll be Daniel and me.

642
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,400
This is supposed to get physical.

643
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,660
There are multiple correct answers.

644
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,870
- Choose the most certain one.
- The most certain one.

645
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,700
Jae Seok, believe in me.

646
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,140
- Okay.
- I'll sit there instead.

647
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,200
- I'll block them.
- Okay.

648
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,770
You're the only team
without a female member playing.

649
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,710
- That's cowardly.
- How so?

650
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,610
- A team of two guys?
- So what?

651
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,340
Are you all ready?

652
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,050
Here comes the first question.

653
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,380
Out of the following options,

654
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,490
choose figures that appear
in Silla tales or legends.

655
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,620
Tales?

656
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,090
(Which answers are correct?)

657
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,430
(Choose figures that appear
in Silla tales or legends.)

658
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,730
(Cheoyong, Wonhyo, Asadal, Asanyeo,
Park Hyeokgeose, Misil)

659
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,830
During the reign
of Silla's King Heongang,

660
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,500
he defeated the spirit of plague
with song and dance.

661
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,930
A Silla-era Buddhist monk,

662
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,200
he worked
to spread Buddhism to the masses.

663
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,600
The story surrounding Muyeongtap...

664
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,140
- and Asadal and Asanyeo.
- From Silla.

665
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,480
Who established Silla?

666
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,640
- From an egg.
- Pak Hyeokgeose.

667
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,710
- Pak Hyeokgeose born from an egg.
- Pak Hyeokgeose born from an egg.

668
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,550
Silla-era woman of great power...

669
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,220
mentioned in
the Hwarang Segi manuscript.

670
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,520
(Will they be able to snatch
the right answers?)

671
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,750
(Go)

672
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,920
- No!
- Wait.

673
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,920
(Misil, Pak Hyeokgeose,
Asadal and Asanyeo)

674
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,230
(She grabbed
Asadal and Asanyeo first.)

675
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,630
Yes, good.

676
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,630
(Jong Kook got Misil.)

677
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,070
- This one!
- Yes, good.

678
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,730
(Picking up Pak Hyeokgeose)

679
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,640
(MIYEON and Ji Hyo
return right away.)

680
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,010
(Meanwhile, Team Jae Seok)

681
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,310
(Cheoyong, Ondal, Haemosu)

682
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,310
(They got mixed up!)

683
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,980
(Jae Seok grabbed Cheoyong.)

684
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,720
- Get Ondal.
- What?

685
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,090
Commander Haemosu. Hey.

686
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,820
(Daniel happened to pick up
Buddhist Master Wonhyo.)

687
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,790
Hey, is this right? Is Ondal right?

688
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,120
- Ondal. Is this right?
- Wonhyo is right.

689
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,390
Ondal?

690
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,690
- You can steal.
- Watch out.

691
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,300
- Come on back.
- Jong Kook, you can steal them.

692
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,900
(He saunters about, still unsure.)

693
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,070
- Hey.
- Gung Ye?

694
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,840
- Get back here, Daniel!
- Steal it.

695
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,110
(The old wildcat
wants to steal Wonhyo.)

696
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,910
(So does the tiger.)

697
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,410
- What are you doing?
- Get back here, Daniel!

698
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,510
(He goes back to save Daniel.)

699
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,310
Daniel, you're such a fool.

700
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,680
(The tussle
is more like a tickle-match.)

701
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,820
No, wait.

702
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,420
(Slipping up)

703
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,320
Get over here, Seok Jin.

704
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,460
(Seok Sam steals
Buddhist Master Wonhyo.)

705
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,890
- MIYEON, get that!
- MIYEON!

706
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,430
MIYEON!

707
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,630
What's Gung Ye about?

708
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,730
(He sees Jae Seok holding Cheoyong.)

709
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,000
- MIYEON, get that!
- MIYEON!

710
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,940
(He snatches it
and lands in the Answer Zone.)

711
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
MIYEON!

712
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,080
I sat down.

713
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,280
(You can steal
from someone sitting down.)

714
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,780
No.

715
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,510
How could you steal that?

716
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,880
- Hey. Daniel, are you okay?
- How...

717
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,650
I told you to get back.

718
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,390
- You said Gung Ye wasn't right.
- How...

719
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,850
I thought...

720
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,520
You said Gung Ye wasn't right.

721
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,860
My goodness.

722
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,990
- You said Gung Ye wasn't right.
- To save you...

723
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,900
Did you lose a card?

724
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,870
Ji Hyo got the answer
she got wrong last time.

725
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,800
I went straight for this
and nothing else.

726
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,240
I'll tell this team
their scores first.

727
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,570
Neither are right, are they?

728
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,110
Haemosu...

729
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,540
- They stole our card.
- He's from Goguryeo,

730
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,210
- so you lose one point.
- Darn it.

731
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,850
- This is bad.
- Oh, yes.

732
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,180
- Who is Gung Ye?
- Gung Ye...

733
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,720
is from Goryeo,
so you lose another point.

734
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,950
This team is
on minus two points so far.

735
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,350
- Shoot.
- Darn it.

736
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,320
- Sorry.
- I told you to bring it back.

737
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,590
I thought Gung Ye
was the wrong answer,

738
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,090
but I couldn't get rid of it.

739
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,790
(They started strong,
but they lost the fight.)

740
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,160
Ji Hyo got Sindon,
Asadal and Asanyeo.

741
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,860
- Only Asadal and Asanyeo are right.
- Yes.

742
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,100
- Plus 1 and minus 1 is 0.
- Yes.

743
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,370
Cheoyong and Misil.

744
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,440
They're both correct,
so that's two points.

745
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,370
(Team Jong Kook got 2 points
for Cheoyong and Misil.)

746
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,410
- Gosh. That was amazing.
- Come on.

747
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,150
- Okay! Well done.
- Shoot.

748
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,880
Prince Hodong...

749
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,520
- and Princess Nakrang...
- That's correct.

750
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,850
are Goguryeo figures.

751
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,990
Pak Hyeokgeose is from a Silla tale.

752
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,820
- I shouldn't have taken this.
- It's still okay.

753
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,290
Ondal is a figure from Goguryeo.

754
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,030
- Wonhyo is right.
- Master Wonhyo is from Silla.

755
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,860
- Your score is zero.
- That's better.

756
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,430
That's not bad.
They're on minus two.

757
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,770
They're on a minus score,
so it's okay.

758
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,370
It's not too bad
to get just one card.

759
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,670
- One answer you're sure of.
- One you know is right.

760
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,340
Song Ji Hyo.
You look really smart right now.

761
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,210
- I look good, right?
- Seriously.

762
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,210
- Asadal. I like them.
- Asadal and Asanyeo.

763
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,550
You just love the Asadal story.

764
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,510
Ji Hyo revises past episodes.

765
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,020
Here's the next question.

766
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,820
Out of the following options,

767
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,050
pick out what Seok Jin
said to MIYEON.

768
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,220
What I said to you?

769
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,660
(What did Seok Jin
say to MIYEON on Running Man?)

770
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,920
- My gosh.
- This is hard.

771
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,120
This is too hard.

772
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,630
- What?
- What I said to you?

773
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,330
(Seok Jin and MIYEON
have an advantage.)

774
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,400
(Do you think this place is easy?)

775
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,430
(Whose side are you on?)

776
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,670
(Superstar Jee was rude
to almost everyone.)

777
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,200
(Did people say you were pretty
since you were young?)

778
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,300
(Your voice is so annoying.)

779
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,110
(You should be able to eat garlic
if you're over 30.)

780
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,840
(Which of these quotes
did he say to MIYEON?)

781
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,040
It's confusing.

782
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,640
I said all of these.

783
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,080
To MIYEON...
I said that. I remember.

784
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,310
I don't remember.

785
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,520
(Team Seok Jin
could sweep the correct answers.)

786
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,020
We have an advantage.

787
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,420
I know what I said on Running Man.

788
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,690
The easy ones...

789
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,130
(Thinking)

790
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,590
This one. "Since you were young."

791
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,860
(Picking one confidently)

792
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,370
- This one. "Since you were young."
- This one!

793
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,630
"I'll make you a star."

794
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,040
(His 2nd pick)

795
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,500
"I'll make you a star."
I think this is it.

796
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,840
Not that one.

797
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,640
- What is it?
- What is it?

798
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,870
(The 3rd parties are stuck.)

799
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,440
- What is it?
- Wait.

800
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,940
Is that not it?

801
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,510
I really have no idea.

802
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,510
"Do you think this place is easy?"

803
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,680
(Why is MIYEON empty-handed?)

804
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,350
- I don't have one! Wait.
- Why don't you have one?

805
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,620
- Not this one.
- No, that's SOYEON's.

806
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,860
- You can give me one.
- Yes, take this.

807
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,160
(They help each other out.)

808
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,830
Oh, this...

809
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,930
(Most people with that face
can't sing well.)

810
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,860
- This one.
- This is MIYEON.

811
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,330
This is MIYEON.

812
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,100
- I have...
- This is you.

813
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,400
No!

814
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,800
- I sat down.
- You didn't sit.

815
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,110
(He pulled him up before he sat!)

816
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,310
(Bloody revenge for Round 1)

817
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,310
(Screaming)

818
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,580
Wait. MIYEON!

819
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,910
(Standing, ignoring the ruckus)

820
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,650
- I don't know.
- Hang on.

821
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,390
(The subject of the question
has become prey.)

822
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,850
MIYEON!

823
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,890
(Jae Seok intercepted.)

824
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,090
That's mine.

825
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,960
(Most people with that face
can't sing well.)

826
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,030
- That's mine.
- This is it!

827
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,760
(He gave the card
to his teammate...)

828
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,130
(and ended up empty-handed.)

829
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,630
Let's keep this, at least.

830
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,570
- This isn't right.
- The one Ji Hyo took...

831
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,770
- Let's see your answers.
- I think this is wrong.

832
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,210
I don't remember.

833
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,210
- You start with us?
- Yes, show both of them.

834
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,180
"I'll make you a star."

835
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,750
"Didn't things get better
since you came on Running Man?"

836
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,690
(I'll make you a star!)

837
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,120
(That was Dex.)

838
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,420
(Incorrect, minus 1 point)

839
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,460
(Didn't things get better
since you came on Running Man?)

840
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,760
(The other one is also incorrect.)

841
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,790
(Minus 1 point)

842
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,160
- That's minus two points.
- No.

843
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,500
Minus two points.

844
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,500
Minus two points.

845
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,560
What if...

846
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,670
Minus two points?

847
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,330
Shoot.

848
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,170
- You got...
- This is correct.

849
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,800
- Minus two points.
- I said this. I remember.

850
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,340
(The day MIYEON came on with SOYEON)

851
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,310
(Most people with that face
can't sing well.)

852
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,780
- That's correct.
- Is it?

853
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,850
(He was shocked
that MIYEON was the main vocalist!)

854
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,980
I remember.

855
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,350
- Right.
- That was right.

856
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,020
- That was right.
- He said this a lot,

857
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,990
- but to MIYEON?
- "You got a good seat."

858
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,190
That's not right.

859
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,720
He never said that to MIYEON.

860
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,020
"You got a good seat."

861
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,990
"You should be able
to eat garlic..."

862
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,090
- "if you're over 30."
- This is right.

863
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,960
You should be able to eat garlic
if you're over 30.

864
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,530
(He said that to Kang Hoon.)

865
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,930
(Minus 1 point)

866
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,670
(Team Jong Kook got minus 2 points.)

867
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,670
We got both wrong.

868
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,040
- Okay! This is it. This is it!
- These.

869
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,270
- This is it.
- That...

870
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,270
(Jae Seok took
all of Seok Jin's correct answers.)

871
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,040
"Whose side are you on?"

872
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,610
Whose side are you on?

873
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,050
If you do that, I can't...

874
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,850
"Did people say you were pretty
since you were young?"

875
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,220
Did people say you were pretty...

876
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,590
- since you were young?
- All along?

877
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,020
Not for a while in between.

878
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
- When?
- When?

879
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,290
"Did people say you were pretty
since you were young?" That's right.

880
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,730
- Oh, not this?
- Zero points.

881
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,730
These two are correct.

882
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,530
Out of those two cards,

883
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,160
- Both?
- "Your eyes got bigger" is correct.

884
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,470
For real?

885
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,430
(MIYEON's yearbook photo)

886
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,700
(Your eyes got bigger.)

887
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,040
(Memories
of his rude comments return.)

888
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,110
Yes. I said that
when we saw an old photo of her.

889
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,410
When we were at Dosan Park.

890
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,950
He didn't say this?

891
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,720
Didn't Seok Jin say this? He didn't?

892
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,620
- For real?
- But...

893
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,520
He said a lot of terrible things.

894
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,850
- Yes.
- You were rude.

895
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,420
- All this...
- So rude.

896
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,520
He said all that...

897
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,660
- That's right.
- to our other guests.

898
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,690
That's right.

899
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,090
Hey, this. I said this to SOYEON.

900
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,660
- Seok Jin.
- That's right.

901
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
(The next question)

902
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,800
- Who is from Silla?
- I don't know.

903
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,270
Ji Hyo!

904
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,640
(Punching)

905
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,240
(Team Jong Kook
starts to use force.)

906
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,740
- Ye Eun, what's going on?
- What are you doing?

907
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,570
(She clings to his pant legs
to fight back.)

908
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,080
She must be crazy.

909
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,210
That's correct.

910
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,680
(Team Jong Kook continues to score.)

911
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,710
- Pass!
- Ji Hyo!

912
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,980
- Give it to me.
- MIYEON!

913
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,520
Ji Hyo! Get back and sit down!

914
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,390
We got three points. That's huge.

915
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,690
- That's both correct.
- Yes!

916
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,160
Oh, shoot.

917
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,920
(Team Seok Jin 6,
Team Jong Kook 8, Team Jae Seok 6)

918
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,630
We're sitting in a bad spot.

919
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,490
Yes, it's bad. The center is better.

920
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,900
- The middle is too... Director.
- The center...

921
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,560
- The center team has an advantage.
- Yes.

922
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,570
- I think so.
- Yes.

923
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,930
- I went for the Mona Lisa.
- Right?

924
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,700
We didn't win
because of our position.

925
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,070
Do you want to swap places?

926
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,140
Yes, let's swap.

927
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,040
There were instances
when the answers were on either end.

928
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,210
It's hard when you're at the end.

929
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,640
Let's mix up the seating.

930
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,910
- Yes, mix things up.
- Separate the teammates.

931
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,780
- Some should sit in the middle.
- Let's do this.

932
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,880
Gosh. Blaming the seating...

933
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,550
It was too unfair.

934
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,520
That's right.

935
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Here's the last question.

936
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,720
- The last question.
- This is it.

937
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,260
Hey. It's the last fight.

938
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,190
- We must win here.
- We must win here.

939
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,290
Hey, Ye Eun.

940
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,060
- Yes.
- Let's do this.

941
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,100
- It's pretty close.
- Ye Eun.

942
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,300
- Let's go.
- Get two.

943
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,600
It's okay to be wrong.

944
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,570
Pick the card with the name
that corresponds with the photo.

945
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,970
- Name and person.
- Name and person?

946
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,640
- Are you ready?
- Name and person.

947
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,140
One, two, three.

948
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,510
(Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise,
Harry Potter, Margaret Thatcher,)

949
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,040
(Elon Musk,
Robert Downey Jr., Tang Wei,)

950
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,910
(Tim Cook,
Timothee Chalamet, Emma Stone)

951
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,780
One, two, three.

952
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,880
- Ye Eun.
- The first one!

953
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,950
Ye Eun, get that one. That's it.

954
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,090
The first one!

955
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,860
(Harry Potter and Tom Cruise)

956
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,590
(Brad Pitt)

957
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,460
(Se Chan got three cards.)

958
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,660
Hurry back!

959
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,000
(Brad Pitt,
Tom Cruise, Harry Potter)

960
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,630
- Give me one.
- Take this one.

961
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,970
(Brad Pitt)

962
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,070
This is correct.

963
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,670
- Is that one right?
- I don't know.

964
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Let me see.

965
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,840
No, Haha.

966
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,540
- No. Not Robert Downey Jr.
- Is this one wrong?

967
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,210
(6. Robert Downey Jr.)

968
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,210
This is wrong.

969
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,350
(6. Robert Downey Jr.)

970
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,650
- No.
- Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man.

971
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,950
- Timothée Chalamet and Emma Stone.
- Iron Man.

972
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,020
- Timothée Chalamet. Right.
- Emma Stone, right?

973
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,850
She's Tang Wei.

974
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,020
- I think this one is right?
- No.

975
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,690
- He's that person.
- Right.

976
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,130
Apple's CEO.

977
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,490
(The Mapo Siblings are a good team.)

978
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,630
- Wait.
- Why did you bring Tim Cook?

979
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,100
But no.

980
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,200
He's not Tim Cook.

981
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,200
No. That's wrong.

982
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,240
- Isn't he Brad Pitt?
- No.

983
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,870
- He's not.
- He's not it.

984
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,110
(3. Harry Potter)

985
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,510
- That one is wrong.
- Wrong.

986
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,040
He's not Brad Pitt.

987
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,910
But he is Harry Potter.

988
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,650
But he is Harry Potter.

989
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,820
- That's not his real name, though.
- That's not his real name.

990
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,350
- He's not Harry Potter.
- Wait.

991
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,660
- Let me see.
- Who's Tim Cook?

992
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,760
- No.
- Tim Cook has a better chance.

993
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,590
- He's not Brad Pitt.
- He's not Brad Pitt.

994
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,930
Just pick up Tim Cook.

995
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,630
He's not Robert Downey Jr.

996
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,930
(Se Chan's team chooses Tim Cook.)

997
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,200
- No.
- Just pick up Tim Cook.

998
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,370
(8. Tim Cook)

999
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,770
Grab Tim Cook!

1000
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,940
(Ye Eun steals it.)

1001
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,440
(Panting)

1002
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,510
Why can't you get it? Why?

1003
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,840
- Why aren't you playing?
- I don't think it's him.

1004
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,650
Where is your confidence, MIYEON?

1005
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,250
- Wait.
- Those three are all wrong.

1006
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,250
Go with Harry Potter.
They are all wrong anyway.

1007
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,750
- Harry Potter.
- Okay.

1008
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,620
Let's check the answers.

1009
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,120
(Result announcement)

1010
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,820
Haha chose Emma Stone.
She's Emma Watson.

1011
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,130
- She's not Emma Stone!
- Emma Stone?

1012
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,460
She's not Emma Stone, man!

1013
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,130
- She's Emma Watson.
- Timothée is right.

1014
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,530
- That is Timothée Chalamet.
- That's correct.

1015
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,500
- And she's Tang Wei.
- Ji Hyo's card is Tang Wei.

1016
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,870
It's okay.

1017
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,640
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

1018
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,310
- This is really hard.
- He's not Harry Potter.

1019
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,470
- I never imagined it.
- And...

1020
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,110
- he's not Tim Cook.
- He stars in "Harry Potter."

1021
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,840
- He's Steve Jobs.
- It was Steve Jobs.

1022
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,150
(They lose 1 point.)

1023
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,350
(He looks away.)

1024
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,880
- Tom Cruise.
- He is Tom Cruise.

1025
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,750
- Elon Musk.
- Elon Musk and Margaret Thatcher.

1026
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,520
- It's okay.
- They are both correct.

1027
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,560
(Final result)

1028
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,760
- I run too slowly.
- It's okay.

1029
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,860
- Position is one thing.
- Okay.

1030
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,330
But Team Blue is just stronger.

1031
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,830
They are strong.

1032
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,930
- Ji Hyo is strong.
- She's strong.

1033
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,300
- She's the strongest girl.
- She's...

1034
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,500
- She's all over the place.
- They got lucky too.

1035
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,740
The winning team gets a clam hint
and a swap pass.

1036
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,510
The winning team is Team Jong Kook,
and they won nine points.

1037
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,110
Thank goodness.

1038
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,450
- We were at the bottom.
- It's important to win this one.

1039
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,750
We were at the bottom.

1040
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,620
The three of you should decide
who will go in first...

1041
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,550
and swap the clams.

1042
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,860
- Okay.
- The clam that gets swapped...

1043
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,990
cannot be swapped again.

1044
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,290
- So that's how it works.
- We can play rock, paper, scissors.

1045
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,000
- In the front...
- Let's play rock, paper, scissors.

1046
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,230
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

1047
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,100
- Yes!
- Rock, paper, scissors.

1048
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,630
- Scissors.
- Haha will go first.

1049
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,640
This is so great.

1050
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,340
This is a precious chance.

1051
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,770
I get to swap mine
with another person's, right?

1052
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,610
This is it.

1053
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,210
But this one looks strong too.

1054
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,420
This one looks the strongest.

1055
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,860
Gosh, I will go with the hard clam.

1056
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,930
(Hard clam)

1057
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,160
Gosh, it's really hard.

1058
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,860
I have to crush it with this, right?

1059
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,700
(Which one will get crushed?)

1060
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,370
(Haha: Surf clam,
Ji Hyo: Hard clam)

1061
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,170
(The surf clam got crushed.)

1062
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,940
(Hard clam for the win!)

1063
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,180
This is super hard.

1064
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,250
I'll go with the hard clam then.

1065
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,650
(Hard clam, surf clam)

1066
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,790
I got the hard clam. That was close.

1067
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,860
That soft little surf clam.

1068
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,790
(Ji Hyo walks in after her hard clam
got swapped with a soft surf clam.)

1069
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,060
That looks amazing.

1070
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,330
The hard clam is mine, right?

1071
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,670
Haha swapped it with the surf clam.

1072
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,370
He swapped with mine?

1073
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,070
(Once a clam has been swapped,
it can't be swapped again.)

1074
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,780
This is hard to choose.

1075
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,110
(So she can't pick the hard clam.)

1076
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,350
Horned turban. Can I give it a go?

1077
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,550
(Ji Hyo: Surf clam,
Seok Jin: Horned turban)

1078
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,890
(The surf clam gets crushed.)

1079
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,360
(The horned turban wins.)

1080
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,890
This is really bad.

1081
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,560
I will trade it
for the horned turban.

1082
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,200
(Horned turban, surf clam)

1083
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,040
Let's see now. Which ones are taken?

1084
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,040
- Those two.
- She took this one?

1085
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,310
Haha took this one? Goodness.

1086
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,410
This ark shell-looking clam
is really hard too.

1087
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,150
From what I know.

1088
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,020
The smooth clam is really hard.

1089
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,890
I will try to crush
the smooth clam...

1090
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,020
with mine.

1091
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,890
(Thinking)

1092
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,560
I will try crushing the surf clam.

1093
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,300
Then I can choose to
trade it for this one, right?

1094
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,970
All right. I will try crushing
the surf clam with mine.

1095
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,140
I've done this many times
as a child.

1096
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,800
I've done it a lot, in fact.

1097
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,810
(When he had no toys,
this is what he did to play.)

1098
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,910
We had nothing to play with
when we were young.

1099
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,710
So we played a lot with shells.

1100
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,980
In the school yard,

1101
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,550
there were shells like this.

1102
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,580
They didn't sift those out
when bringing in the sand.

1103
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,120
Back in the days,
there were cheaters.

1104
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,960
They crushed the shell
using the teeth part. Can I do that?

1105
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,760
Really?

1106
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,060
You use this part.

1107
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,530
You use the teeth part
to crush the other shell.

1108
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:57,470
(Jong Kook: Short-necked clam,
Seok Jin: Surf clam)

1109
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,370
(The surf clam got crushed again.)

1110
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,140
They both got crushed.

1111
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,340
They both got crushed.

1112
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
(The short-necked clam
got crushed too.)

1113
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,480
Wait. Gosh.

1114
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,710
There's no other option, then.

1115
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,580
I will go with the smooth clam.

1116
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,620
It had to be the smooth clam.

1117
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,550
It was the strongest shell
when we played as children.

1118
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,590
Or perhaps
it was the only shell we had.

1119
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,530
Now you've swapped the shells.

1120
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,000
Seok Jin's horned turban...

1121
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,370
- Yes.
- went to Ji Hyo.

1122
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,530
You're telling us right away?

1123
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,300
- Went to Ji Hyo.
- You're telling us right away?

1124
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,070
- She's telling us right away.
- So Seok Jin now has...

1125
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,740
- the surf clam.
- What?

1126
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,740
- The surf clam?
- Yes.

1127
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,010
- It crushed? It must be soft.
- That was Haha's.

1128
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,940
Ji Ye Eun's smooth clam...

1129
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,880
- Smooth clam.
- was taken by Jong Kook.

1130
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,850
Ye Eun is left
with the short-necked clam.

1131
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,120
Short-necked clam?

1132
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,550
- Come on, Jong Kook.
- The short-necked clam is soft.

1133
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,620
- The short-necked clam is soft.
- The short-necked clam is better.

1134
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,260
- Haha took Ji Hyo's hard clam.
- I didn't choose that...

1135
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,460
Haha has the hard clam now.

1136
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,260
Nobody took the abalone?

1137
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,560
The hard clam must be really hard.

1138
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,830
(Clam Trade Round 1 Status)

1139
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,000
The three ones they chose...
The horned turban is hard.

1140
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,640
- The horned turban is hard.
- The horned turban.

1141
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,200
The hard clam must be hard too.

1142
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,570
We will move to another place now.

1143
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,840
- Okay.
- Yes.

1144
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,480
- Where is this place?
- It's a restaurant.

1145
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,810
We were right.

1146
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,650
- It's really a restaurant.
- It's a restaurant?

1147
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,020
My goodness.

1148
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,990
(What surprised Ji Hyo?)

1149
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,990
That must be so good.

1150
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,890
- That must be the prize.
- I smell meat.

1151
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,220
I smell meat.

1152
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,990
That's incredible.

1153
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,830
- Crispy bulgogi.
- Galbijjim.

1154
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,460
- Bibimbap.
- I smell meat.

1155
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,000
- It's incredible.
- There's beef tartare.

1156
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,430
- Is it bibimbap?
- It's beef tartare bibimbap.

1157
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,670
- That looks so good.
- Look at this.

1158
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,240
- It must be so good.
- That looks so good.

1159
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,970
- I really want to eat it.
- Look.

1160
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,870
(There's sweet tteokgalbi
and even spicy back ribs.)

1161
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,710
- Tteokgalbi.
- Galbijjim.

1162
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,910
That looks so good.

1163
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
That looks really good, doesn't it?

1164
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,450
We'll be doing
a team match again this time.

1165
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,550
- Is that right?
- The winning team...

1166
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,550
will get to eat
everything on the table.

1167
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,820
Please!

1168
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,430
The team that finishes second
will get the beef tartare bibimbap.

1169
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,630
- The team that finishes third...
- Only the side dishes.

1170
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,060
will be given a Gyeongju Bread,
one piece per person.

1171
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,200
- We've come a long way.
- Great.

1172
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,400
- Seriously.
- We will get only the bread?

1173
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,170
How should we form
the teams this time?

1174
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,570
You guys choose your teams.

1175
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,840
- That sounds great.
- Should we do it?

1176
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,540
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

1177
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,840
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- You have to pick Ye Eun.

1178
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,580
- That's it.
- Ssabssab.

1179
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

1180
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,150
Ji Hyo.

1181
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,180
- Let's eat.
- What?

1182
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
What's the game?

1183
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,390
The mission is called
My Useless Superpower.

1184
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,790
We will start the mission.

1185
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,760
- What is it?
- Three teams will debate some...

1186
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,330
of the most hilariously
useless superpowers trending online.

1187
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,630
Each team will choose
two superpowers...

1188
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,370
and try to convince us
why they're actually useful.

1189
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,640
The team that earns the most votes
from the production crew wins.

1190
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,000
The winning team
will first choose...

1191
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,570
the two superpowers.

1192
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,480
We have to convince them.

1193
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,710
We have to convince the crew.

1194
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,580
You have to choose two.

1195
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,210
We have to say
that we need those superpowers?

1196
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,950
We have to argue
that this superpower is useful?

1197
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,180
This is good, isn't it?

1198
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,820
- This is good.
- This is good.

1199
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,590
- This is easy.
- This is the best.

1200
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,990
- This is great.
- This is the best.

1201
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,060
Two.

1202
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,620
This is the worst.

1203
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,830
(Team Seok Jin got
the leftover superpowers.)

1204
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,660
Your meal depends on this mission.

1205
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,170
It will also determine
the clam hint and the swap chance.

1206
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,530
- We need the clam hint too.
- Right.

1207
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,570
We need to win.

1208
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,340
Since Team Jae Seok picked first,

1209
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,510
you'll reveal
one of the superpowers first...

1210
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,380
and appeal it.

1211
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,640
We...

1212
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,010
have a superpower where we can
talk with fruits.

1213
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,480
(A superpower where they can
talk with fruits?)

1214
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,650
Then how can you eat them?
You'd feel so bad for them.

1215
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,620
- Poor fruits.
- Come on!

1216
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,530
(Critizing him
as soon as the debate begins)

1217
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,500
- You're not even human.
- Poor fruits.

1218
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,160
How cruel!

1219
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,470
- All right. Let's...
- All right.

1220
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,770
- Listen to us first.
- Listen.

1221
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,370
(I don't want to hear
the rebuttals!)

1222
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,770
There are so many things you get
if you can talk to fruits.

1223
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,070
- There are many.
- There are so many.

1224
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,440
The fruits you forgot existed
in the fridge...

1225
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,540
- "Please eat me."
- would tell us to eat them.

1226
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,680
They'll keep complaining
how cold they are.

1227
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,950
"Gosh, it's so cold!"

1228
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,280
- "It's so cold."
- They'll keep complaining.

1229
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,390
They don't want to be cold!

1230
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,650
- They're too pitiful to eat.
- If you can talk with fruits...

1231
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,120
If you can talk with fruits...

1232
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,160
As you know,

1233
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,760
- you don't have to knock on them...
- That's right.

1234
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,960
or ask if they're ripe or not.

1235
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,060
- There's no need.
- That's right.

1236
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,300
(Talking with fruits)

1237
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,870
(You can know how the fruits feel.)

1238
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,200
If you can talk to them,
they can tell you honestly.

1239
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,370
There used to be...

1240
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,040
a girl who was out of her mind
in my neighborhood.

1241
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,610
She used to talk with fruits
all the time at the fruit market.

1242
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,670
Gosh, that punk...

1243
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,280
They couldn't fix her in the end
because she got possessed.

1244
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,810
- Maybe she had this superpower.
- Listen.

1245
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,210
It's the watermelon season soon.

1246
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,050
- That's right.
- You don't have to knock on them...

1247
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,550
- or check their stalks.
- There's no need.

1248
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,020
- Also, you don't need friends!
- Since you can talk to them...

1249
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,620
- Buy all the fruits...
- Hey.

1250
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,420
- and become friends with them.
- Will you eat them as you talk?

1251
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,620
- Will you?
- "Gosh!"

1252
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,990
(Hey, friend.)

1253
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,330
- Gosh.
- That could happen.

1254
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,630
For example,

1255
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,500
if you ask them if they're ripe
and they say yes,

1256
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,000
will you cut them in half?

1257
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,730
- Seriously.
- We should.

1258
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,470
"Korean melon, are you ripe?"

1259
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,170
Will you peel it if it says yes?

1260
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,640
- Gosh.
- No way.

1261
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,840
(Screaming)

1262
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,980
The Korean melon will scream.

1263
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,310
- Otherwise,
- Then you should eat it.

1264
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,610
- it'll rot and die.
- They'd prefer that.

1265
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,810
It'll rot and die

1266
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,750
If you have fruits,
you should eat them.

1267
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,780
How cruel of you.

1268
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,120
Guys, what do you think will happen
if you can talk to fruits?

1269
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,820
- You can make money.
- That's right.

1270
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,190
- Everyone.
- You can talk to fruits.

1271
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,290
If you can talk to fruits,

1272
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,360
- You can do anything.
- you'll travel the whole world...

1273
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,130
Seriously, guys.

1274
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,560
It's creates
an incredible economic value.

1275
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,800
I think you'll be able...

1276
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,900
- to appear on a news show.
- Yes, you can.

1277
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,540
- And make international headlines.
- Yes.

1278
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,210
You'll be able to travel
all over the world...

1279
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,810
by talking to fruits...

1280
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,340
- and create incredible values.
- That's right.

1281
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,180
You can make hundreds more...

1282
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,750
- than what you make now.
- It could be thousands.

1283
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,550
Hold on. You said
you could make money from it.

1284
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,250
How will you prove
that you can talk to fruits?

1285
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,650
- But...
- How will you prove it?

1286
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,590
- How ripe it is, how many seeds...
- That's right.

1287
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,790
- it has inside...
- You can prove it.

1288
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,020
I can prove how many seeds
there are.

1289
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,560
Then you'll count every seed?

1290
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,960
- No.
- Hey!

1291
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,730
Stop it already!

1292
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,800
It's so cruel!

1293
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,130
(The invincible logic returns.)

1294
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,470
You'll dig them up and...

1295
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,030
"How many seeds do you have?"
"I have seven."

1296
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,900
- "Come here."
- Stop it!

1297
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,470
- Like I said earlier,
- It's impossible to talk with them.

1298
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,510
- it'll be of great help...
- It's scary.

1299
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,910
- to new farmers.
- It'll be really helpful.

1300
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,540
If you can really talk
with fruits...

1301
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,380
Let's say you're done
growing the crops.

1302
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,680
- That's right.
- Then you can ask...

1303
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,850
- how sweet they are.
- Exactly.

1304
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,650
- You can collect all the data...
- That's right.

1305
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,450
and sell the best ones
at a better price.

1306
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,520
Then...

1307
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,460
- what if the fruit lies?
- Who?

1308
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,490
Because...

1309
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,390
- What if it lies to survive?
- If it lies...

1310
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,490
- That it's not ripe?
- When it's not ripe at all.

1311
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,890
- That it's not ripe.
- It's super unripe.

1312
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,860
- That it's not ripe.
- What if it lies that it's ripe?

1313
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,500
(Knocked out
by the plausible counterattack)

1314
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,870
You're sharp.

1315
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,870
- You're sharp.
- Right?

1316
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,640
- It could lie.
- Gosh, he's good with debates.

1317
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
- Why?
- How low of him.

1318
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,810
- Because it'll be eaten.
- Their standard is low.

1319
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,040
- Their standard is low,
- Yes?

1320
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,010
but let's say
there are Korean melons.

1321
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,180
Out of 100, we can tell around 2...

1322
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,580
that we'll keep them alive.

1323
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,480
That's right! So they can...

1324
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,680
"We'll keep you alive."

1325
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,650
- Then they'll tell the truth?
- Yes, they will.

1326
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,220
- You're right.
- Oh, like a broker?

1327
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,920
Among the fruits,

1328
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,720
- you need to pick a captain.
- That's right.

1329
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,560
- Among the fruits.
- Like, "If you tell the truth,"

1330
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,860
- "I'll keep you alive?"
- Yes.

1331
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,030
Between Korean melons...

1332
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,330
- It'll be better environmentally.
- Of course.

1333
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,400
Since you can talk to them.

1334
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,970
I really want
to have this superpower.

1335
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,370
They can talk.

1336
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,470
For us...

1337
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,000
- Actually,
- It's really needed.

1338
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,870
I don't even think
we need to explain this superpower.

1339
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,340
You'd be curious.

1340
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,280
You become invisible
only in the dark.

1341
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,280
(An invisible person
only in the dark?)

1342
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,250
Then you'll die
after getting hit by a car!

1343
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,420
You'll die
after getting hit by a car.

1344
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,120
Then you'll die
after getting hit by a car!

1345
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,220
You'll die
after getting hit by a car.

1346
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,590
Because it's too dark,
you'll get hit by a car.

1347
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,820
- That'll be the end.
- You're right.

1348
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,020
You're invisible in the dark?

1349
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,760
- You'll be hit by a car.
- Why would you walk on the road...

1350
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,360
- You'll die.
- when it's dark?

1351
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,730
- It's really bad.
- You wouldn't walk on the road.

1352
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,000
- Because... Listen.
- Why would you walk on the road?

1353
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
If you have to go out at night...

1354
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,400
Many will realize...

1355
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,800
- that their argument is groundless.
- Yes. That's right.

1356
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,170
When you become invisible,

1357
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,000
- you can see things.
- You can see things.

1358
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,340
There's no way you'll get hit
by a car after going out.

1359
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,070
- Others can't see you.
- In the dark,

1360
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,910
you can claim certain things.

1361
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,080
You can claim things.

1362
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,310
- You'd steal things?
- Even if it's unethical,

1363
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,680
I think it's a good thing.

1364
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,320
- That's not right!
- You'd steal things?

1365
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
- You'd steal things?
- Why not?

1366
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,050
- Don't you think you would?
- You'd steal things?

1367
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,220
- Be careful.
- If you become invisible...

1368
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,820
In a world like today,

1369
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,560
a superpower like that
is the most harmful.

1370
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,120
- Even if it's harmful,
- But...

1371
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,490
- it's...
- I think everyone will agree.

1372
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,230
It could be used for a good cause.

1373
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,360
- How so?
- Yes.

1374
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,000
How can it be used for a good cause?

1375
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,670
Let's say a criminal...

1376
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,870
is holding someone hostage
in the dark.

1377
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,200
If there's a crime,

1378
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,970
- you can approach secretly...
- That's right.

1379
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,370
- Excuse me.
- You can report to the police.

1380
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,210
If the criminal turns on the light
all of a sudden,

1381
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,510
- then you'll be seen.
- Yes, you'll be.

1382
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,740
- You'll be seen, then.
- Wait a minute.

1383
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,610
You can be seen
if the criminal turns on the light.

1384
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,210
You can be seen
if they turn on the light.

1385
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,520
- You have to be careful.
- If the criminal...

1386
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,650
You need to turn off the light.
You should cut the power off.

1387
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,690
You see? Come on.

1388
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,190
You should cut the power off.

1389
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,290
- That was a good argument.
- Listen.

1390
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,490
- It's not that. Listen.
- That was a good argument.

1391
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,190
- Let's say you cut off the power.
- Yes?

1392
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,190
But suddenly,

1393
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,330
if the criminal turns on
the flashlight on their phone,

1394
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,360
then you can be seen.

1395
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,400
They wouldn't do that, though.

1396
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,530
- If the criminal...
- You must get rid of them at once.

1397
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,970
- They wouldn't know where you are.
- At once.

1398
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,370
You can actually catch the criminal.

1399
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,240
- Ye Eun, go ahead.
- Listen. Okay.

1400
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,940
- You can catch criminals.
- That's right.

1401
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,610
Let's say you want to go out...

1402
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,110
without your parents knowing.

1403
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,940
- You can go out and come back.
- That's right.

1404
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,240
- That's right.
- You're using it in bad ways only.

1405
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,780
- Maybe you aren't supposed to.
- Why would you go out in secret?

1406
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,880
- That's right.
- You're using it in bad ways only.

1407
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,280
- Maybe you aren't supposed to.
- Why would you go out in secret?

1408
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,820
- What about the good ways?
- What's wrong with that?

1409
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,450
I never said
it was used in a bad way.

1410
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,590
- What about the good ways?
- What's wrong with that?

1411
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,420
I never said
it was used in a bad way.

1412
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,560
Why is it bad to go out
without my mom knowing?

1413
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
- I mean...
- Tell them more.

1414
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,560
Ye Eun.

1415
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,330
- You call this a debate?
- Good job.

1416
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,930
- Good.
- Good job.

1417
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,000
- That's right.
- What's wrong with going out...

1418
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,030
- without your mom knowing?
- Why?

1419
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,870
You can only go out in secret
when you become invisible?

1420
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:24,870
Why would you go out
without your mom knowing?

1421
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,140
You don't have to go out
without your mom knowing.

1422
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,200
- To do a good deed.
- That's right.

1423
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,240
Also,

1424
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,870
- you can do volunteer works.
- That's right.

1425
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,210
- You can pick up trash at night.
- Without anyone knowing.

1426
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,980
- That's right.
- Things like that.

1427
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,080
You can only pick up trash
if you become invisible?

1428
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,410
- No.
- No, but...

1429
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,650
You want to do it
without others knowing.

1430
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,480
- I'm a celeb, that's why.
- Without anyone knowing.

1431
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,050
- Because you're a celeb.
- You can make money through it.

1432
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,190
A good deed.

1433
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,650
Let's say something goes missing...

1434
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,760
all of a sudden.

1435
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,220
- Who would you doubt first?
- Of course.

1436
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,430
- You guys.
- No.

1437
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:50,430
- You don't know we're invisible.
- You wouldn't know.

1438
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,460
You wouldn't know we're invisible.

1439
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,630
- You can't catch us anyway.
- You wouldn't know we're invisible.

1440
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,660
If you doubt me,

1441
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,200
- I'll go look for you at night.
- We can go look for you...

1442
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,070
- and hit you.
- Then I'll tell on fruits.

1443
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,940
If you use this superpower,

1444
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,870
- there ought to be confusion...
- That's right.

1445
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:03,970
- in our society.
- There'll be confusion.

1446
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:07,780
I don't care
if there'll be confusion or not.

1447
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,710
- You don't care?
- Anyway, if you have this...

1448
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,150
- Hey. You don't care?
- You don't care?

1449
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,510
This is a debate,
and he doesn't care?

1450
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,950
- What's our reasoning?
- Hey.

1451
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,450
- What's our logic?
- Hey, mister.

1452
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,820
- You say that in a debate?
- This was the topic, to begin with.

1453
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,420
- The superpower.
- Sure.

1454
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,990
- That's what I'm trying to say.
- Exactly.

1455
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,290
- When we were younger...
- When we were younger,

1456
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,560
many wanted to become invisible.

1457
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,630
- I did too.
- Honestly,

1458
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,560
- I wanted that superpower too.
- But not this kind.

1459
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,260
- We'll go this time.
- Sure, go ahead.

1460
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,970
Why would anyone need
such superpowers?

1461
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,130
Seok Jin, end it at once.

1462
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,440
- Go ahead.
- Being invisible is the best.

1463
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,940
It helps make my dream come true.

1464
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,240
Becoming bald once a day.

1465
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,940
(Become bald once a day)

1466
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,410
(What?)

1467
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,680
- We...
- Go ahead.

1468
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,850
Why? What about it?

1469
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,310
- Go ahead.
- What about it?

1470
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,250
- I...
- Yes?

1471
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,180
- love soccer.
- Okay.

1472
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,820
When I was young, I dreamed
of becoming a soccer player...

1473
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,150
- through one pro player.
- Zinedine Zidane.

1474
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,460
- Zinedine Zidane.
- Zidane isn't bald.

1475
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,420
- He lacks hair only here.
- He has hair.

1476
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,290
- You call that bald.
- That's not true.

1477
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,390
Being bald is having no hair at all.

1478
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,460
That's not true.

1479
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,100
There are different types. So...

1480
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,870
I really liked Zidane.

1481
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,100
I wanted to live like him.

1482
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,400
I'm sorry, but do you become bald...

1483
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,940
at a random time? All of a sudden?

1484
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,840
- That's the downside.
- That's...

1485
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,010
(The downside is that you don't know
when you'll change.)

1486
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,170
All of a sudden?

1487
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,910
No! What do you do, then?

1488
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,310
- While you're on a date...
- You can get ready for it...

1489
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,480
- because it gets itchy here.
- All right.

1490
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,380
- You get a signal?
- Yes.

1491
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,720
Let's say you're filming a movie.

1492
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,820
And the scenes are connected.

1493
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,490
There are 200 staff members...

1494
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,390
- waiting for you under the sun.
- That's right.

1495
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,890
Ji Hyo. Let's say
you suddenly turn bald.

1496
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,930
- We'd have a wig ready.
- Then you wouldn't be cast.

1497
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,960
- No.
- Then you'll starve to death.

1498
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,630
And you'll be sad.

1499
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,660
That's not right.

1500
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,830
And you'll be surrounded
by people who talk to fruits.

1501
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,830
- No.
- What are you talking about?

1502
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,570
- Hey, mister.
- Also...

1503
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,100
You've obviously never had debates.

1504
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,340
- Why not?
- I'm sorry, but...

1505
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,700
- I'm right, aren't I?
- This is...

1506
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,840
- I don't even want to argue...
- I'm right.

1507
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,410
about that superpower.

1508
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:46,440
- I mean,
- Then what about this?

1509
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,710
it's easier to wash hair too.

1510
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,610
- This is the only superpower left.
- Hey, this is...

1511
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,650
- You left us with this.
- Then...

1512
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,580
you can change to the next one.

1513
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,480
I've been living
to achieve this dream.

1514
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,920
- This?
- What is it?

1515
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,320
- What is it?
- We all know what it is.

1516
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,790
Reviving bugs.

1517
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,860
- Goodness.
- No!

1518
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,690
- Tell us.
- It's incredible, isn't it?

1519
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,200
You'll revive lovebugs?

1520
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,700
Yes, I'll revive them.

1521
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,730
The lovebug issue
is huge these days.

1522
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,500
- We can revive them.
- He's done for.

1523
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
- We'll lack food in the future.
- That's right.

1524
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,270
- That's right.
- You're done for.

1525
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,710
They're a source of protein.

1526
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,840
Like cockroaches?

1527
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,910
Not just cockroaches.

1528
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,080
(Lacks reasons)

1529
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,110
We have this superpower.

1530
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,340
- This is incredible.
- I think this is also...

1531
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,510
- Seriously.
- an amazing superpower.

1532
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,180
It's funny for a variety show.

1533
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,480
It's growing lots of arm hair.

1534
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,580
It's only for your arms.

1535
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,150
Lots of arm hair.

1536
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,350
There are a few benefits.

1537
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,960
- What is it?
- If you have lots of arm hair,

1538
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,490
- Wigs.
- you can make wigs.

1539
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,230
- Wigs.
- You can keep making wigs.

1540
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,760
- You can make them.
- You can keep making them.

1541
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,300
You can keep making wigs.

1542
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,000
- Then we...
- Tell them.

1543
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,130
- I'm sorry,
- Yes?

1544
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,240
but can you exchange it with this?

1545
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,200
Ours is better than yours, right?

1546
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,210
- Having more hair is better, right?
- Being bald...

1547
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,540
- Exchange it with ours.
- Ours is really nice.

1548
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,940
- Ours is nice.
- I like ours.

1549
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,340
- Having lots of arm hair.
- This is driving me crazy.

1550
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,940
- This is...
- Anyway...

1551
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,710
- We have our ace.
- It's over.

1552
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:58,910
They have an ace.

1553
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,080
This is...

1554
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,880
what our staff members need.

1555
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,450
It's really needed. All right.

1556
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,560
Float 15cm in the air.

1557
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,960
- It's possible.
- It's possible.

1558
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,890
(Only 15cm?)

1559
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,060
- It's possible.
- It's possible.

1560
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,860
(Scratching)

1561
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,970
- You can be in the air.
- See how far up 15cm is.

1562
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,130
- It's only this much.
- Listen...

1563
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,240
- Hold on.
- It's about this much.

1564
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,270
While levitating...

1565
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,440
- You can float around.
- You can carry heavy things.

1566
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,110
- For how long? As long as you want?
- You can levitate.

1567
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,170
- It's your choice.
- Can we choose?

1568
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,410
- Yes, you can choose freely.
- When you want to come down...

1569
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,510
- It's about this high. Cameramen!
- Hold on.

1570
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,310
You don't have
to move around like this anymore.

1571
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,510
- Exactly.
- Do this instead.

1572
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,920
- What else?
- Just levitate around.

1573
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,220
- It'll look eerie.
- You don't need...

1574
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,750
- any expensive equipment.
- You don't need it.

1575
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,520
All you need is your camera.

1576
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,020
(Levitating 15cm:
Film without special equipment)

1577
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,490
- That's right.
- Especially, the lights.

1578
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,090
Why float around when you can walk?

1579
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,130
Why would you walk
when you can float around?

1580
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,790
- It's only this high.
- There's no need to walk.

1581
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,100
- It's not tiring.
- It's not tiring at all.

1582
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,100
It won't drain your energy.

1583
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,460
- Exactly.
- But you'll lose muscle mass...

1584
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,570
in your lower body,

1585
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,930
- which will cause problems.
- That's it.

1586
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,940
- You might develop atrophy.
- You can still work out.

1587
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,870
- You'll develop atrophy.
- You can always stop levitating.

1588
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,840
- Your legs will be too slim.
- That's right.

1589
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,910
- I'll show you with a camera.
- If that happens,

1590
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,840
- you'll trip easily.
- Let me show you.

1591
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,940
- That's not healthy.
- See how easy it'll be.

1592
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,680
- It'll be like this.
- Jae Seok.

1593
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,580
- Jae Seok.
- It'll be like this.

1594
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,550
(Levitating)

1595
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,220
Like this. It's not tiring at all.

1596
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,420
- Jae Seok.
- Like this.

1597
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,720
(The cameramen are beaming.)

1598
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,560
(They're satisfied
with the sweet feature.)

1599
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,500
We'll show you from left to right.

1600
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,970
This is hilarious for some reason.

1601
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,300
(Absolutely smooth)

1602
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,870
- Just push the camera.
- How is this a superpower?

1603
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,170
- It's like this.
- You don't have to do much.

1604
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,740
- Cameramen.
- Don't you worry.

1605
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,940
You're not moving around.
You're floating around.

1606
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,950
Besides, think about the benefits
of being able to float 15cm.

1607
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,510
You could make
a lot of money with it.

1608
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,150
- Think simply.
- Is money all you care about?

1609
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,590
- That's all you've been saying.
- They're crazy about money.

1610
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,890
- Money is all they care about.
- That can't be useful.

1611
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,060
Like that, the debate has ended.

1612
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,790
Members of the staff
will raise their hands...

1613
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,600
to vote for the superpower
they liked.

1614
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,330
- Starting with us?
- Yes.

1615
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:00,940
If you'd like
Team Seok Jin's superpowers,

1616
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,340
raise your hand.

1617
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,840
- One, two, three.
- Reviving bugs is a good one.

1618
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,480
(Team Seok Jin's superpowers)

1619
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,810
(Going bald once a day,
Reviving bugs)

1620
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,150
- Can't one of you raise your hand?
- At least one.

1621
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,510
- Come on.
- Really?

1622
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,080
- Nice.
- This shouldn't be a pity vote.

1623
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,580
- Which one do you want?
- Liar!

1624
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,120
- Which one?
- Which one?

1625
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,920
- The bug.
- The bug?

1626
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,520
- It's nice to revive bugs.
- That's a good one.

1627
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,790
- It's a good power.
- One vote? Sure.

1628
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,860
They got one vote.

1629
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,390
- Unbelievable.
- That was sweet of him.

1630
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,290
- We're at a huge disadvantage.
- We got the worst ones.

1631
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,000
- Also...
- The invisible man is the best.

1632
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,160
- It's the best.
- Here we go.

1633
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,500
- Think about being invisible.
- If you want...

1634
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,770
- Team Jong Kook's superpowers,
- Honestly...

1635
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,240
- please raise your hand.
- Think about it.

1636
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,700
- Be honest with yourself.
- Be honest.

1637
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,240
- He raised his hand.
- Here we go.

1638
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,670
- That's it.
- That's two.

1639
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,040
- Yes, that's two.
- You want it too, don't you?

1640
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,610
- These are good powers.
- Being invisible at night.

1641
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,910
- Don't pressure them.
- I only saw two.

1642
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,580
- Don't pressure them.
- That's three.

1643
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,150
- Seriously?
- Don't you want to be invisible?

1644
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,220
- Nice.
- Don't you want to be invisible?

1645
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,390
- All right.
- It'd be nice to be invisible.

1646
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,390
- Of course.
- Don't you want to be invisible?

1647
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,120
Don't married men
want to be invisible?

1648
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,360
- Be honest.
- They're all bad.

1649
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,560
- Be honest.
- You'll get caught.

1650
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,960
- You'll get caught!
- How great is this?

1651
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,230
- I see 3.
- No, there's 4.

1652
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,830
- Exactly.
- Four.

1653
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:01,460
- Be honest.
- There's five!

1654
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,500
- Exactly.
- That's it.

1655
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,200
(Will more people be honest?)

1656
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,770
- That's it.
- Be honest.

1657
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,240
- Be honest.
- You can be invisible.

1658
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,700
- It'd be sick to be invisible.
- In the dark.

1659
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,210
- Okay. You can lower your hands.
- We got five votes.

1660
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,010
- Last up is Team Jae Seok.
- There's no need to even bother.

1661
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,780
- Raise your hand...
- What's there to talk about?

1662
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,310
- if you want...
- What's there to choose?

1663
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,380
- their superpowers.
- Come on.

1664
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,780
What's there to choose?

1665
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,650
- All right!
- Isn't this the obvious choice?

1666
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,650
- You can levitate.
- You'll levitate.

1667
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,020
You can levitate 15cm
above the ground.

1668
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,620
- You can talk to fruits.
- You can talk to fruits.

1669
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,360
(They managed to convince
the cameramen.)

1670
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,960
(Team Jae Seok gets 9 votes.)

1671
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,330
- You can talk to fruits.
- You can talk to fruits.

1672
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,930
- Exactly.
- This isn't up for debate.

1673
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,900
- You'll never be bored.
- Thank you.

1674
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,070
(Team Jae Seok wins the debate.)

1675
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,670
Good. We did it.
Not only will we eat...

1676
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,200
Good job, MIYEON.

1677
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,540
Before you eat,

1678
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,940
the winning team
will get the chance...

1679
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,410
to check your clams
and make a switch.

1680
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,250
Please decide on the order
among you three.

1681
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,810
You can't swap clams
with the person...

1682
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,820
- who went before you.
- Really?

1683
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,320
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1684
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,490
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1685
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,550
Darn, I have to go last.

1686
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,160
- You have to go last.
- MIYEON,

1687
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,120
go ahead and make the switch.

1688
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,330
I'm curious.

1689
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,330
Hold on.

1690
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,100
This is mine, right?

1691
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,630
- Can I touch it?
- No, you can't.

1692
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,830
- I can't?
- No.

1693
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,200
You can only touch it
when you conduct the test.

1694
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,870
You can only look.
After you've made your choice,

1695
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,440
you can bump yours
against another one.

1696
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,470
Can I switch to any one of them?

1697
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,940
You can bump it against one of them.

1698
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,040
I want to bump it against this one.

1699
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,380
- Would you like to test it?
- Yes.

1700
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,180
Doesn't this one look solid?

1701
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,650
(Hen clam, Horned turban)

1702
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,720
Like this?

1703
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,050
(Will the horned turban
break the hen clam?)

1704
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,390
One, two, three.

1705
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,420
(The hen clam gets smashed.)

1706
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,760
(Hen clam, Horned turban)

1707
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:37,890
Will you switch?

1708
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,000
Absolutely. I'm switching.

1709
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,100
- This one.
- Will you swap the hen clam...

1710
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,330
for the horned turban?

1711
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,270
- Yes.
- Got it.

1712
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,640
(The hen clam will automatically
go to Ji Hyo.)

1713
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,670
It looked hard,
but I guess I was wrong.

1714
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,540
(Meanwhile,
Se Chan has the abalone.)

1715
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,280
I'll be smashing clams like so.

1716
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,280
(From the beginning, he believed
the abalone was the hardest.)

1717
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,310
Can I check the ungpi clam?

1718
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,020
- That one?
- Yes. This one.

1719
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,220
(Grabbing)

1720
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,950
- Go ahead.
- This is quite solid.

1721
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,050
You can test the two.

1722
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,420
(Jae Seok chose the bear hide clam
from the start.)

1723
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,060
This has a hard shell.

1724
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,460
(Abalone, Ungpi clam)

1725
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,530
No way.

1726
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,330
(The abalone was crushed.)

1727
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,170
- Will you switch?
- Yes, I'll switch.

1728
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,540
- That's Jae Seok's.
- Mine got crushed.

1729
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,010
(Se Chan switches
from the abalone to the ungpi clam.)

1730
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,910
(Next up is Jae Seok,
who had his ungpi clam stolen.)

1731
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,540
I knew there was something
to the ungpi clam.

1732
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,580
- Then I...
- You can't choose...

1733
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,180
what was switched,
but you can test yours...

1734
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,510
with one of the others.

1735
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,720
Can I test mine
against the hard clam?

1736
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,650
- Yes.
- There's no way...

1737
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,850
(Earlier, Haha tested the surf clam
against the hard clam.)

1738
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,830
(The hard clam
easily crushed the surf clam.)

1739
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,730
(Is the shell harder
than an abalone's?)

1740
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,800
(Abalone, Hard clam)

1741
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,640
(The abalone got crushed.)

1742
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,740
- I'll take the hard clam.
- Sure.

1743
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,140
The hard clam has a hard shell.

1744
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,240
You don't know
until you've tested them.

1745
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,710
- I'd like to test mine out.
- Me too.

1746
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,080
You need to test them
to know for sure.

1747
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,820
- I want the chance.
- Unless you do...

1748
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,280
- Is it not as expected?
- It's not.

1749
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,120
The switches have been made.

1750
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,660
- Tell us the result.
- MIYEON had the hen clam,

1751
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,790
but she took Ji Hyo's horned turban.

1752
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,490
- The horned turban?
- That's what she took.

1753
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,360
Then, Se Chan...

1754
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,260
- took Jae Seok's ungpi clam.
- Darn.

1755
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,070
- Is that so?
- Meanwhile, Jae Seok...

1756
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,870
- was given the abalone.
- I see.

1757
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,970
He switched his
with Haha's hard clam,

1758
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,170
which means Haha...

1759
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,880
- now has the abalone.
- That was close.

1760
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,580
- The hard clam is a decent size.
- The hard clam must've crushed...

1761
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,910
the abalone.

1762
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,080
Now, you'll be served your meal...

1763
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,490
- according to your team's ranking.
- Goodness.

1764
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,390
- Okay!
- Nice!

1765
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,590
- No way.
- That smells incredible.

1766
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,960
- It looks amazing.
- Check out the galbijjim.

1767
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,090
Look at that galbijjim.

1768
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,390
I'm hungry.

1769
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,630
I'm so jealous.

1770
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,660
- Is this ours? One per person?
- Yes, one per person.

1771
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,800
Do we each get...

1772
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,930
- a bowl of beef tartare bibimbap?
- Yes.

1773
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,040
Look, it's crispy bulgogi.

1774
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,540
Everything looks so good.

1775
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,370
- I'm happy just to have this.
- Thank you.

1776
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:04,770
This is good enough!

1777
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,740
Is this Gyeongju Bread?

1778
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,240
It's not what I pictured.

1779
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,580
(The winning team will receive
its feast first.)

1780
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,050
That looks so good!

1781
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,280
(Ta-da!)

1782
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,420
- My gosh.
- Do they even get a soup?

1783
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,620
Do they even get a stew?

1784
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,650
(The locust makes a sound
in his head voice.)

1785
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,920
(Exclaiming!)

1786
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,590
Ye Eun.

1787
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,860
(Me too)

1788
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,960
Don't pick up things like that.

1789
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,560
(MIYEON quickly picks up
things like that.)

1790
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,560
(Mixing
the beef tartare bibimbap first)

1791
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,730
That looks so good.

1792
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,470
- Gosh, the tofu.
- That must be so good.

1793
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,400
- It smells incredible.
- No way.

1794
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,710
It's so good.

1795
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,880
(Slurping the beef tartare)

1796
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,910
(She connects with beef
instead of fruit.)

1797
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,550
(A huge spoonful)

1798
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,850
He eats like he's enjoying it.

1799
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:51,550
(Hunting beef tartare
like he means it.)

1800
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,750
Look at his front teeth.

1801
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,990
- That galbijjim looks insane.
- The galbijjim?

1802
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:56,890
- Right, the galbijjim.
- That's...

1803
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,360
I'd love some of that galbijjim.

1804
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,430
Check out that galbijjim.

1805
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,030
The galbijjim is insane.

1806
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,670
Look at the size of that meat.

1807
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,630
No way. Look at this.

1808
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,770
(My gosh!)

1809
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,170
- It's so good.
- Isn't it good?

1810
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,410
(The meat falls off the bone.)

1811
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,040
Would you look at that?
That was cooked well.

1812
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,940
(It's torture.)

1813
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,850
- That just melts in your mouth.
- Really?

1814
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,620
- The galbijjim looks so good.
- Is it good?

1815
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,250
- This...
- It's so good. My gosh.

1816
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:26,590
The galbijjim melts in your mouth.

1817
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,090
This is crispy bulgogi.

1818
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,660
(Jae Seok tries the tteokgalbi.)

1819
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,690
(Exclaiming!)

1820
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,090
(Exclaiming!)

1821
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,960
I'm starving.

1822
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,730
(Mouth-watering)

1823
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,830
They're so annoying.

1824
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,270
I'm happy just to have this.

1825
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,070
Thank you. I'm thrilled.

1826
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,070
This is good enough! Right?

1827
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,340
(Gobbling)

1828
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,210
- Is it good?
- It's good.

1829
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,610
It's delicious.

1830
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,480
(Yummy!)

1831
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,450
The bitterness of the vegetables...

1832
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,520
awakens the palate.

1833
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,260
He's right. Each ingredient shines
with its own flavor.

1834
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,560
- What's that?
- Gyeongju Bread.

1835
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,560
(Team Seok Jin only gets
one Gyeongju Bread per person.)

1836
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,830
Does anyone want to swap a bite
with this Gyeongju Bread?

1837
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,260
Who wants Gyeongju Bread
for dessert?

1838
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,470
I don't want that right now.

1839
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,130
- Not me.
- I'd actually like some.

1840
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,370
(I'd actually like some!)

1841
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,310
MIYEON, smell this.

1842
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,440
(He finds his target.)

1843
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,910
No, I don't want it!

1844
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,750
(Laughing)

1845
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,750
Unless you want to be told off,
give me some galbijjim.

1846
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,050
(Whispering)

1847
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,950
He threatened to tell me off.

1848
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,520
(She tells on him immediately.)

1849
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,160
(Fleeing)

1850
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,490
Should I give him some?

1851
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:36,890
What was that?

1852
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,430
(Drinking from an empty bowl.)

1853
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,900
"Should I be asking you
for a bite to eat..."

1854
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,630
"at this age?"

1855
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,770
(He's begging for food
when he'll turn 60 soon.)

1856
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,840
Give me some...

1857
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,970
if you want a cushy career
as a member of i-dle.

1858
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,110
I'm to give him some
if I want a cushy career...

1859
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,770
- as a member of i-dle.
- That looks so good.

1860
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,240
Seok Jin has been
in the industry for a while,

1861
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,380
but he doesn't have the power
to affect anyone's career.

1862
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,350
(Chuckling)

1863
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:01,420
My gosh.

1864
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,520
The beef tartare bibimbap
is incredible.

1865
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,850
- It's so good.
- I know.

1866
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,360
Haha, moments like these
always give me a reality check.

1867
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,360
- I wouldn't mind more vegetables.
- I can afford this myself.

1868
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,390
What?

1869
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,530
My friends...

1870
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,500
- They're chairmen.
- Yes, chairmen.

1871
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,300
- Seok Jin.
- Hold on.

1872
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,030
Isn't it all right
if I ate one of those?

1873
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,100
- Which one?
- You can't.

1874
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,140
- It's a rule.
- Seok Jin.

1875
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,200
(Eat this.)

1876
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,210
- Seok Jin.
- Well...

1877
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,470
Gosh, thank you.

1878
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,740
(Gosh, thank you.)

1879
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,410
I am supposed to eat this
with joy, aren't I?

1880
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,510
(The chairman's buddy is satisfied
with a spoonful of bibimbap.)

1881
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,510
Let's share it.

1882
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,550
Hey, did you eat mine?

1883
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,150
- Was it yours?
- You're unbelievable.

1884
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,020
I wasn't done with it.
I was just saving it.

1885
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,790
I thought you were done with it.

1886
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,990
(While Seok Sam
was begging next door,)

1887
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:51,130
(Daniel ate Seok Sam's bread.)

1888
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,170
I thought you didn't like it.

1889
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,140
- Hey!
- I'm sorry, Seok Jin.

1890
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,140
- Split that in half.
- Give me half of that.

1891
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,510
- Let's share it.
- Okay.

1892
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,410
I got this from them.

1893
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,510
Let's share it. Eat.

1894
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,010
- You eat first.
- I... You eat first.

1895
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,580
- You eat first.
- I can't eat beef tartare.

1896
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,480
- Gosh.
- You can't eat beef tartare?

1897
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,420
- The sesame oil is so aromatic.
- It's so refreshing.

1898
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,450
I'm full.

1899
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,490
That was good.

1900
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,090
What's this?

1901
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,460
(They arrive at a tranquil campsite
nestled in a scenic landscape.)

1902
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,630
This is incredible.

1903
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,930
All right.

1904
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,660
It's scorching hot.

1905
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,400
The pool is amazing.

1906
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,530
Today is...

1907
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:27,040
It's blazing hot today.

1908
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,740
This is...

1909
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,210
It's a perfect day to swim.

1910
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,880
Why would you put the chair here?

1911
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,510
Seok Jin, why would you
put the chair here?

1912
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,510
(Laughing awkwardly)

1913
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:38,780
Who wants water?

1914
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,420
The heat is no joke.

1915
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,520
Gosh.

1916
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,990
This has to be one of my top five
hottest days of my life.

1917
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:50,160
All right, then! Let's start
the countdown from number four.

1918
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,360
All right.

1919
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,130
- When was number four?
- How can I remember that?

1920
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,260
Then why would you say that?

1921
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,270
I just meant it's that hot.

1922
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,930
- It's not a lie, is it?
- Here's the rule...

1923
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,130
for the mission.

1924
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,570
This is the final mission,

1925
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,270
and the last chance
to win a benefit...

1926
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,740
- This is important.
- for the shell-crushing challenge.

1927
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,040
- Yes.
- It's Hold It for Greatness.

1928
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,680
- What is it?
- The drawing player...

1929
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,680
will dive underwater...

1930
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,410
and draw the given word
while holding his or her breath.

1931
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:14,650
Underwater!

1932
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:17,150
He or she can keep drawing
as long as they stay submerged.

1933
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,590
- You have to hold your breath.
- Each team's answer runner...

1934
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,620
will start at the same time...

1935
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,920
- We have to run.
- from the starting line.

1936
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,130
- It's a war.
- The person who manages...

1937
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,090
to sit on the tube...

1938
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,730
- will get a chance to answer.
- More than anything, you need...

1939
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,570
- to get on that tube.
- You get two points for guessing...

1940
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,930
your own team's drawing,

1941
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,900
You get just one point
for guessing another team's.

1942
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,140
- Two points.
- The team that earns...

1943
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,510
the highest points will win.

1944
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,480
This is the most important one.

1945
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,480
We have to win this one.

1946
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,010
You will split into teams of three.

1947
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,020
- The three ladies will split up...
- You have to swim and tussle well.

1948
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,220
- and form teams.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

1949
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,590
Rock, paper, scissors.

1950
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,750
I want Kim Jong Kook.

1951
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,750
- Yes!
- MIYEON is good.

1952
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,220
- Jae Seok.
- Okay!

1953
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,520
I can draw really well.

1954
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,190
Should I draw?

1955
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,730
- You draw.
- Should I do this?

1956
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,860
- Let's go!
- Under the scorching sun!

1957
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,730
I trust your instincts, brother!

1958
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,770
- Let's go!
- Yes!

1959
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,070
Trust my instincts!

1960
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,040
Jong Kook, I will give you the word.

1961
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,440
- Is that it?
- Yes. Ready and go.

1962
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,840
How do you draw that?

1963
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,910
(The sky is high
and horses grow fat.)

1964
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:17,780
It's a problem
whether you draw well or not.

1965
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,650
- Right.
- This is hard.

1966
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,280
- It's not easy.
- Look.

1967
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,150
Just hit the key point.

1968
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,720
(The horse is...)

1969
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,030
(fat!)

1970
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,030
(As expected,
Master Kim nailed the point.)

1971
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,030
Jong Kook, don't overdo it.
Use your head!

1972
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,470
Let's get moving.

1973
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,240
He can really hold his breath.

1974
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,040
He's been down there
for a long time.

1975
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,140
(Singer-turned-sportsman Mr. Kim)

1976
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:48,140
(Finally, he's done.)

1977
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,310
- He's out.
- Look carefully.

1978
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,380
- He's out.
- Okay.

1979
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,580
- If I get it, we get two points.
- He says it's easy.

1980
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,020
If I get it, we get two points.

1981
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,750
(He reveals the word,
Cheon-go-ma-bi.)

1982
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,560
- Isn't it "Cheon-go-ma-bi?"
- Look.

1983
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,160
- It's a horse.
- That's a horse. Right.

1984
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,530
You're right. It's cheon-go-ma-bi.

1985
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:05,630
What is it?

1986
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,260
- I can't see. Let's go.
- I can't see.

1987
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,800
It's cold.

1988
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,130
(They move
towards the answer chair.)

1989
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,400
It's easy.

1990
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,210
Hey!

1991
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,340
(While Jae Seok puts
his head down and swims...)

1992
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,580
- What's that?
- What's that?

1993
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,740
- Horse.
- Hey.

1994
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,950
(Se Chan and Seok Jin
check the drawing.)

1995
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,620
- Horse.
- Horse.

1996
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,750
That's it!

1997
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,590
Hurry and stop him! That's it.

1998
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,360
That's it. Great. Sit on it.

1999
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,860
You have to sit on it. Sit.

2000
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,030
- He didn't sit.
- Sit.

2001
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:45,070
Sit. I think you got the answer.

2002
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,770
- Okay.
- Hurry.

2003
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:47,840
I got it.

2004
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,840
- You are too close.
- Put it down. I got it.

2005
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,040
I know. So get on the chair.
Did you say I should put it down?

2006
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,010
(Grasshopper wearing goggles
starts attacking him.)

2007
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,880
- I can't see.
- Move.

2008
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,150
- You need the goggles.
- Move!

2009
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,750
- You need the goggles.
- Just move!

2010
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,180
Se Chan!

2011
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:04,490
- Se Chan!
- Got it.

2012
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,350
- Get up, Se Chan.
- Seok Jin, here!

2013
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,090
Se Chan, get up.

2014
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,890
You have to move.

2015
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:12,030
(Jee-rasoni getting
totally ganged up on)

2016
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,260
- Get up, Jae Seok.
- He will lose it.

2017
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,830
(He gets a facial massage too.)

2018
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,130
- Go up.
- Gosh.

2019
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,200
One, two, three.

2020
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,640
Go up at one, two.

2021
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,740
- One, two.
- In two.

2022
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,010
Wait.

2023
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,510
Throw me the goggles.

2024
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,780
(She didn't understand him.)

2025
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,850
(Communication fails)

2026
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:34,950
The goggles.

2027
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,050
I can't open my eyes.

2028
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:38,850
- That's your problem.
- I sat on it.

2029
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,320
- No.
- He will answer.

2030
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,320
No.

2031
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,360
- I'm on it.
- No.

2032
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,760
You think you sat on it?

2033
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,630
(Stern)

2034
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:47,430
Jae Seok!

2035
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,230
He's on it.

2036
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I'm on it!

2037
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,100
(Jae Seok beats Jee-rasoni
and sits on the tube.)

2038
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,300
(Jae Seok gets a chance.)

2039
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,000
- I sat!
- He will answer.

2040
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,840
(Did Jae Seok get Cheon-go-ma-bi?)

2041
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:59,470
Cheon-go-ma-bi.

2042
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:01,580
(He got the answer.)

2043
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,680
(As Jae Seok gets the answer,
Team Ye Eun earns points first.)

2044
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,650
- I knew the answer.
- Nice one!

2045
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:09,150
I thought it was, "Birds hear
the words spoken by day,"

2046
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,280
"and mice hear the words
spoken at night."

2047
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,620
There was a fat horse
and the sky... Gosh.

2048
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,820
Jong Kook drew well.

2049
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,190
You just have to know
the key points.

2050
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,960
I can see the key points.

2051
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,030
One of the ladies
should draw this time.

2052
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,560
- Right.
- Do you want to draw?

2053
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,570
- MIYEON?
- MIYEON?

2054
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,670
Should I draw?

2055
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,570
Okay. Do you draw well, MIYEON?

2056
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,040
I will try.

2057
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,670
- Who's going to get the answer?
- Who wants to go?

2058
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:33,040
- Wait. You two.
- Ji Hyo and Ye Eun.

2059
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,880
(Ji Hyo and Ye Eun
will get the answer.)

2060
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,640
- Should I do it?
- And Seok Sam.

2061
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,510
- How can I beat Seok Jin?
- I will go easy.

2062
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:41,980
- Seok Jin, give your all.
- Yes?

2063
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,290
- Of course I will.
- Don't go easy on them...

2064
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:46,120
- just because they are girls.
- I won't go easy on them.

2065
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,020
(MIYEON enters the pool.)

2066
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,530
MIYEON, do you draw well?

2067
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,730
I will try to draw well.

2068
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,660
- Get the nuances.
- The hat will float.

2069
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,660
- Will you be okay?
- I know.

2070
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:58,230
Lose the hat.
You're pretty without it.

2071
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:01,740
Just close that button and dive in.

2072
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Like that. Yes.

2073
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,970
MIYEON, I will show you the word.

2074
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,540
Wait.

2075
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,910
(It must be a difficult one.)

2076
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,420
Draw one at a time.

2077
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,390
Draw.

2078
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,250
(She dives underwater.)

2079
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,660
MIYEON can dive.

2080
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,000
(She draws something.)

2081
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,710
Gosh, MIYEON is pretty
even when she's underwater.

2082
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,540
I know. She's pretty
even when her face isn't showing.

2083
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,110
- She's different.
- You can hold it up now.

2084
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,380
- Are you done?
- I didn't get to finish.

2085
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,180
- It's okay.
- Hold it up.

2086
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,450
What is she doing?

2087
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,020
One, two, three.

2088
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:52,750
- What is that?
- Let us see.

2089
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,890
- What is that?
- You're unbelievable.

2090
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:56,660
(What?)

2091
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,630
What is that?

2092
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:02,100
MIYEON, you said you drew well.

2093
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,530
My mind went blank.

2094
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:07,670
What is that?

2095
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:09,570
(Nobody can read
Chocasso's drawing.)

2096
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,140
- What is that?
- I need to get up close and see it.

2097
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:13,940
What is it?

2098
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,240
(The three start walking.)

2099
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,150
(Seok Sam gets attacked.)

2100
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,780
(Screaming underwater)

2101
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,290
- What are they doing?
- Where is Seok Jin?

2102
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:26,990
(Popping out of the water)

2103
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,720
- Gosh.
- Go, Ye Eun.

2104
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,760
Go, Ye Eun.

2105
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,130
(Ye Eun holds Ji Hyo
with her right hand...)

2106
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,460
(and stops Seok Sam
with her left hand.)

2107
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,460
Let go!

2108
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,130
Come on, Ye Eun!

2109
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,360
(Move!)

2110
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,800
Daddy's playing with the kids.

2111
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,370
(They approach the drawing.)

2112
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:41,370
What is that?

2113
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:46,640
- Dragon.
- The drawing...

2114
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,340
(That animal is a dragon?)

2115
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,250
- Dragon.
- The drawing...

2116
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,480
I get it. It's this.

2117
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,920
It's "A dragon rises
from a small stream."

2118
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,720
Right.

2119
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,620
It's...

2120
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,190
Will she know that?

2121
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:05,360
(Dragon? Stream?)

2122
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,200
(Haha made a good guess.)

2123
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,430
Ji Hyo, you have to get on it.

2124
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:10,500
Turn it around.

2125
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,830
Ye Eun, sit on it.

2126
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:15,470
(Ye Eun stops the desperate
Seok Sam with her back.)

2127
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:16,540
- Ye Eun.
- Yes?

2128
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,840
(Ye Eun uses her long legs...)

2129
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,940
(and gets on the tube.)

2130
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,750
If you're not sure, don't do that...
Wait. Ye Eun's on the tube.

2131
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,050
- Wait.
- Ji Ye Eun gets the chance.

2132
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:27,350
(Is the answer what Haha predicted?)

2133
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:28,380
Let me answer.

2134
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,420
(Is it "A dragon rises
from a small stream?")

2135
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:35,520
- What is she doing?
- "Bad news travels fast?"

2136
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,260
- What?
- What?

2137
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,830
- What?
- What is it?

2138
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:39,830
- What?
- What did she say?

2139
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,230
- What is it?
- "Bad news travels fast."

2140
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,900
- That's what it is?
- "Bad news travels fast."

2141
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:44,430
- That's what it is?
- How?

2142
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:45,730
- What is it?
- That's what it is?

2143
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:46,730
(They are dumbfounded
by the answer.)

2144
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:47,900
How is that "Bad news travels fast?"

2145
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,770
It's a horse without feet.

2146
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,870
How is that a horse?

2147
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,340
How is that a horse? It's a chicken.

2148
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,740
How is that a foot?

2149
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,440
How is this a foot?

2150
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,050
(Bad news travels fast.)

2151
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,850
(Ye Eun got the answer.)

2152
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,520
(Wow!)

2153
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,750
(No way!)

2154
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:07,090
(Even she can't believe
that one-shot, one-kill success.)

2155
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,720
What happened?

2156
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,930
What happened?

2157
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,290
- How did I do it?
- You're my team.

2158
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,730
Well done, Ye Eun.

2159
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:14,900
- How did you do it?
- Well done.

2160
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,130
- You got that?
- How did you get that?

2161
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,160
- Well done.
- How did I do it?

2162
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,200
How did you know?

2163
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,470
How did I do that?

2164
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,870
- Gosh, I did so well!
- What was it?

2165
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,800
Word travels fast
even without any feet?

2166
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,140
Then, Se Chan will draw.

2167
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,840
Three people who will guess,

2168
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,780
- please come on out.
- Jong Kook and Haha should go.

2169
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,580
- Gosh, no way.
- And Daniel.

2170
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,980
Only Jae Seok's team has
two points now.

2171
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,750
The other teams have zero points.

2172
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,650
- We have to win.
- Be sure to get it right this time.

2173
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:38,820
- Let's win.
- Honestly, Jae Seok...

2174
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,920
- Hey, Daniel, you have to do this.
- Yes, I'll go.

2175
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,660
- You have to do well, okay?
- All right.

2176
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,660
- Give me a word that I know.
- Okay.

2177
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,090
- It's a word you know.
- Okay, Se Chan.

2178
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:48,130
- I'll show you the keyword.
- Okay.

2179
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,500
What's this?

2180
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,510
Oh, hang on.

2181
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:01,140
(Already facing an obstacle)

2182
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,250
(The monkfish goes in
for the dive first.)

2183
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:11,750
(Of course,
he starts with a stick figure.)

2184
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,860
(Flailing)

2185
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,590
Hey, come up if it's too hard.

2186
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:26,570
(Artist Yang continues his artwork
in harsh conditions.)

2187
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,970
That's like...

2188
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:30,300
what I used back when I was a kid
in elementary school.

2189
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,810
- I think it's going to be hard.
- Are you done?

2190
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,110
- I wonder how he did.
- It looks like he drew something.

2191
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,680
Hey,
did you manage to draw something?

2192
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,710
Here.

2193
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,040
(He reveals his drawing.)

2194
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,150
Okay.

2195
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,510
Is that a compass?

2196
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,980
It looks like north, south,
east, and west.

2197
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:43,680
A person is smiling.

2198
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:47,390
(The players set off.)

2199
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,500
(Kim Jong Kook strides ahead
with breaststroke.)

2200
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,670
He's so fast.

2201
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:01,700
(Right behind him is the man
doing the butterfly.)

2202
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,900
Look at Haha's butterfly.

2203
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,110
(A novel swimming stroke that can
only be done in shallow water)

2204
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,310
He's hopping on one foot.

2205
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:07,440
(A novel swimming stroke that can
only be done in shallow water)

2206
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,440
(Daniel chooses to stay submerged.)

2207
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:13,610
(The master of breaststroke
arrives first.)

2208
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,150
What is this?

2209
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,220
Okay!

2210
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,420
He got up.

2211
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,460
(Jong Kook gets on the tube.)

2212
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,490
- All right.
- How far is he going?

2213
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,530
All right. Jong Kook.

2214
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:26,690
- Three...
- The walls...

2215
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,160
- What's this?
- The walls have ears...

2216
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,460
- What's that supposed to be?
- and the bushes have eyes?

2217
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,460
(Incorrect)

2218
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,470
What's that?

2219
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:32,730
What is that?

2220
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,200
I don't get it.

2221
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,370
(It seems to be the sun.)

2222
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,040
Jong Kook, this question is...

2223
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,010
- This question is hard.
- Oh, it is?

2224
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,210
Jong Kook, just throw them aside.

2225
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,380
(Right then, Haha tries to attack
from under the water.)

2226
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,440
What is it?

2227
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,150
Come on, Haha!

2228
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,280
I'm not wearing underwear!

2229
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,120
- Haha!
- Haha, I'm not wearing underwear!

2230
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,450
(Screaming)

2231
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,650
He's not wearing underwear!

2232
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:52,790
(About to cry)

2233
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:54,490
(His hand actually touched
bare skin.)

2234
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:55,960
Why did you do that?

2235
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,320
Oh, did he touch something?

2236
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,330
Okay!

2237
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,260
Cut off your nose
to spite your face?

2238
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,830
- No!
- No.

2239
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,330
No!

2240
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,600
What is that?

2241
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,000
Is that a compass or the sun?

2242
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,970
- Oh, it's the sun, right?
- Is that the sun?

2243
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,340
- It's not the sun.
- Then, what is it?

2244
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,470
It's not the sun?

2245
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:14,810
It's not the sun?

2246
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,140
Look at it in a different way.

2247
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,450
- What?
- The sun in a different way.

2248
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,210
Right now.

2249
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,020
The sun in a different way.

2250
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,520
Right now.

2251
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,550
(Buzzing)

2252
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,390
- This is right, isn't it?
- Se Chan,

2253
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,520
you understood what this means,
right?

2254
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,520
This is right. Look.

2255
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,390
- What did you draw?
- What did you draw?

2256
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,090
I think you misunderstood it.

2257
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,300
- What?
- Hey.

2258
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,730
- Why?
- What did you say?

2259
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,330
Why? This is right.

2260
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:39,330
- What is this?
- What did you say?

2261
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,200
- I'll show you the keyword.
- Okay.

2262
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,940
(You cannot spit on a smiling face.)

2263
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,070
What's this?

2264
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:48,580
Doesn't it mean the daytime?

2265
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,580
- This isn't it?
- So,

2266
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,480
whatever he drew,
we can still get it right, can't we?

2267
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,780
- Oh, let me answer!
- Jong Kook.

2268
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,950
You can't go right away.

2269
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,020
- Come down first.
- I think I got it.

2270
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,420
Here's the order. One, two, three.

2271
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,520
Okay, got it. I know this.

2272
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,620
I know exactly what this is.

2273
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,060
- I know it!
- Okay.

2274
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,760
- I know it.
- One, two.

2275
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,460
(Roaring)

2276
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,100
(Exerting force)

2277
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,930
(Thug Kim starts using force.)

2278
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:14,300
- Please, Choi Daniel!
- Let's get some points!

2279
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,740
Choi Daniel!

2280
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:16,840
Show us!

2281
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,570
Show us what you're good at.

2282
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:21,410
(He's good at getting beaten up.)

2283
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:22,940
- Show us what you're good at.
- Hey, you can't just...

2284
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,710
He won't let us go.

2285
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:26,750
- I got it. Okay!
- He got up.

2286
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,450
Yes, please shout out the answer.

2287
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:29,920
You cannot spit on a smiling face.

2288
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,520
- Darn it.
- Okay.

2289
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,920
(Team Ye Eun: 2 points,
Team MIYEON: 1 point)

2290
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,320
- Nice.
- Nice try.

2291
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,130
Good job.

2292
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,860
Se Chan misunderstood
the word for face...

2293
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,530
- as the word for daytime.
- I know.

2294
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:43,560
Gosh, that fool.

2295
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,930
Is that what it is?

2296
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,300
- It says "face."
- A smiling face.

2297
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,000
- Gosh, what's wrong with him?
- I thought it meant daytime.

2298
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,540
That's why I drew the sun.

2299
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,510
I drew the sun
because I thought it meant daytime.

2300
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:54,010
Oh, it meant face.

2301
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,610
- Should I draw this time?
- Okay.

2302
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,510
Jae Seok will draw.

2303
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:59,150
Then, who will go from our team?

2304
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,910
- I'll go.
- MIYEON, you should give it a go.

2305
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,080
- It's okay. MIYEON can go.
- Why am I so...

2306
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,390
- MIYEON, slap them in the face.
- Yes, MIYEON.

2307
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,220
Hey, come here, MIYEON.

2308
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,390
(Come here, MIYEON.)

2309
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,990
I'll justify it for you.

2310
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,990
If you can't win in strength,
hold him like this...

2311
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,760
- and slap him...
- Slap him in the face.

2312
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:14,860
Oh, no.

2313
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:15,960
- It's okay.
- Try it. Pretend that...

2314
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,000
this is someone's check and slap it.

2315
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,030
Hold my hand.

2316
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:19,330
There you go.

2317
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,470
That's too hard.

2318
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,140
(Laughing)

2319
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,640
Yes, that's it. About that hard.

2320
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,970
- Is it MIYEON?
- Let's go.

2321
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,670
Tie the towel around your face.

2322
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:29,710
I'll show you the keyword.

2323
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,080
Gosh, that's hard to express.

2324
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:34,880
This is pretty difficult.

2325
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,150
(Obiirak: a Chinese idiom meaning
"A pear falls when a crow flies.")

2326
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,850
Shouldn't Jae Seok's question
count for about five points?

2327
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,150
It's hard to guess.

2328
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,320
Ready, set, go.

2329
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,990
(Taking deep breaths)

2330
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,990
Let's try to guess it.

2331
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:47,730
Let's try to guess it.
I didn't see what it said.

2332
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:54,400
(Obiirak)

2333
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,910
(He draws the crow first.)

2334
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,010
It has to be snug.

2335
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,280
What are you doing?

2336
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,850
Hey, don't do that.

2337
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,050
He's done.

2338
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,450
I'm sure it'll be hard to recognize.

2339
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,690
Can I make some final corrections?

2340
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:14,860
- No.
- Just show the drawing.

2341
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,590
Hey, but you could guess this.

2342
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:17,790
What is it?

2343
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,060
- Oh, I get it.
- What is it?

2344
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,190
Oh, I think I know this.

2345
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,330
Hey, hang on.

2346
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,200
Your drawing skills
have gotten much better.

2347
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,870
- You drew it well. I get it too.
- The drawing...

2348
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:27,170
Hey, you drew this well.

2349
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:28,740
You can get this right.

2350
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,940
Hurry up!

2351
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:31,370
- Go.
- I can't see.

2352
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:32,440
(They set off.)

2353
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,540
Hurry up!

2354
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:35,980
Let go.

2355
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,480
(MIYEON's ultrasonic attack)

2356
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:44,150
(After getting rid of Daniel,)

2357
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:47,090
(he advances while dancing
the tango with MIYEON.)

2358
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,290
He has improved a lot.

2359
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,660
(Will they be able to recognize
the crow and the pear tree?)

2360
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,790
What's that? A bird.

2361
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,130
That's it.
You know what it is, right?

2362
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,630
You can't say anything.

2363
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,600
There you go.

2364
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,440
(She uses the skill
she was taught right away.)

2365
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,470
Here it comes.

2366
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:04,040
MIYEON, slap him.

2367
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,470
- Now is your chance.
- Hey.

2368
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,840
Daniel, you have to guess.

2369
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,840
(But the Dongducheon Monkfish
is not an easy opponent.)

2370
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,910
Slap him in the face.

2371
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,110
- It's okay. Hurry.
- Yes, it's fine.

2372
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:13,310
- She got up.
- Go!

2373
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:15,180
- What's your answer?
- Look at the picture.

2374
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,850
- You can answer now.
- Three,

2375
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,450
two,

2376
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:20,050
- one.
- The magpie that repaid its debt.

2377
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:21,920
(Incorrect)

2378
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,090
Please move aside.

2379
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,320
- Move aside, please.
- That's right.

2380
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:25,860
It was a nice try.

2381
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,460
- Move aside, please.
- Nice try.

2382
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,600
- What is this?
- Get up.

2383
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,230
- Is this from "Heungbu and Nolbu?"
- Go, Se Chan.

2384
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,930
- Se Chan, you know this, right?
- I know it.

2385
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:33,030
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2386
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:34,170
Se Chan.

2387
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,070
So, a crow flies...

2388
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:41,380
(A crow flies...)

2389
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:42,510
A crow flies...

2390
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:43,640
and a bird falls or something,
right?

2391
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,050
- A bird falls or something, right?
- Darn it.

2392
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:48,620
(He got it wrong,
but he was so close!)

2393
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,220
That's pretty much it.

2394
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,290
Here, let me.

2395
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,520
- No, it is the crow!
- It's not a crow.

2396
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,190
It's a pumpkin. The pumpkin seed.

2397
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:57,220
(It's a pumpkin. The pumpkin seed.)

2398
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,290
- All right.
- Let me answer.

2399
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,090
The early bird...

2400
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,230
Gosh, seriously?

2401
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,660
Seriously. That punk.

2402
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,030
The early bird?

2403
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,770
- The early...
- Gosh, Ye Eun should've been here.

2404
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,240
A pear falls when a crow flies.

2405
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,570
But he's not sitting on the tube.

2406
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,710
(He isn't sitting
on the tube properly,)

2407
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:14,210
(and he has to answer
with the Chinese idiom.)

2408
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:16,340
- He's not sitting on the tube.
- He's not.

2409
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,410
- MIYEON, hurry up and get on!
- Daniel!

2410
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:19,880
- What is this?
- He just said the answer!

2411
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,820
- You just heard it.
- You heard the answer!

2412
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,880
- The Chinese idiom.
- Say the Chinese idiom.

2413
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,250
- Say the Chinese idiom.
- How would she know that?

2414
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,350
- It's a Chinese idiom?
- Just try it.

2415
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:26,590
A Chinese idiom?

2416
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:28,160
The Chinese idiom that means
"A pear falls when a crow flies?"

2417
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,260
The Chinese idiom.

2418
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:30,720
How would he know that?
I don't think he knows it.

2419
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,790
- Let me answer!
- Yes?

2420
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,530
- Move aside. You don't know it.
- What is it?

2421
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:36,000
Okay, let me answer.

2422
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,600
- Let me answer!
- Yes?

2423
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,630
- Move aside. You don't know it.
- What is it?

2424
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,970
Okay, let me answer.

2425
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,900
- Josammosa?
- Darn it.

2426
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,070
(Josammosa?)

2427
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:46,840
(He gives an original
but incorrect answer.)

2428
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,980
- Josam...
- Wait!

2429
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,410
That fool.

2430
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:51,850
- Let me answer!
- It's something like that, right?

2431
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,280
Howoosijeol?

2432
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:55,350
- Is that not it either?
- Hey.

2433
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,850
- MIYEON, just try anything.
- A crow, what?

2434
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,750
Say that phrase exactly as it is!

2435
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,650
A pear falls when a crow flies.

2436
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:01,990
Say that phrase exactly as it is!

2437
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,060
A pear falls...

2438
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,190
- when a crow flies.
- Kkanal...

2439
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:05,230
baetteol.

2440
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:08,460
(Kkanalbaetteol)

2441
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,300
Hey, kkanalbaetteol? Is that...

2442
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,500
- Kkanalbaetteol.
- Hey.

2443
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:13,730
Here's a hint.

2444
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,000
- All three of you, listen up.
- Okay.

2445
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,170
Don't tell them.

2446
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,010
It ends with "rak."

2447
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,640
(Did they finally get the answer?)

2448
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,940
Let me answer!

2449
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:26,650
- Be quiet.
- Okay.

2450
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:27,950
(MIYEON gets an unexpected chance.)

2451
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,550
You know it. You've heard of it.

2452
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,690
(Laughing)

2453
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:32,990
Heeheenakrak!

2454
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,120
What?

2455
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:35,560
Heeheenakrak!

2456
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:38,330
(The Wrong Answer Fairy
adds another failed answer.)

2457
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,430
How cute.

2458
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:41,430
(Laughing)

2459
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,500
Yang Se Chan.

2460
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,970
- Me?
- Rak?

2461
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,330
Obiirak!

2462
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:47,970
(Correct.)

2463
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,770
(Se Chan gets it correct!)

2464
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:52,970
Yang Se Chan. He's the first.

2465
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,410
- He's not an empty head.
- He's the first out of them.

2466
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:55,640
Well done, Se Chan!

2467
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,310
Daniel. Seriously.

2468
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:00,080
This is my first time hearing it.

2469
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,480
How could you not know obiirak?

2470
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,820
Obiilhak?

2471
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:05,090
Obiirak!

2472
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:07,450
- Obiirak.
- Obiirak? What's that?

2473
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:10,490
The score is 2:1:1.

2474
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,760
- We have one last round.
- We have two.

2475
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,560
- Ji Hyo can't draw.
- I can't draw.

2476
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,730
- Ji Hyo can go.
- Go and draw.

2477
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:16,730
Ji Hyo hasn't drawn yet.

2478
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:18,570
You can do it.
You're also a haenyeo.

2479
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:20,230
- Draw it since you're a haenyeo.
- I'll go.

2480
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,270
I can do it.

2481
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,570
You were funny, MIYEON.
That's enough.

2482
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,040
- Ye Eun!
- Yes!

2483
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,340
You have to win this time
for us to win first place.

2484
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,640
Yes! First place for real!

2485
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:30,310
I'm really... I'm determined.

2486
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:31,910
We have a chance too, Haha.

2487
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:32,950
(It's a big round with
the critical benefits at stake.)

2488
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:34,280
Let's go, MIYEON!

2489
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,080
Let's go, Ye Eun!

2490
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,890
This is the last question,
and the rank will be decided here..

2491
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,390
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2492
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,290
I'll show you the keyword.

2493
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,160
Hold on.

2494
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:47,460
That's really difficult.

2495
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:49,530
- Did you understand it?
- Ready...

2496
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:51,160
- Yes.
- Start.

2497
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,630
The haenyeo is going under.

2498
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,240
(Would she be able to draw
what she understood?)

2499
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,810
She's stable.

2500
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,910
- Her legs are floating.
- She's stable.

2501
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,980
- She's amazing.
- She's amazing.

2502
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,180
- Amazing!
- You're doing well!

2503
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,780
She's different.

2504
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,150
Amazing.

2505
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:13,790
The haenyeo is different.
She really is.

2506
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:15,790
She's in there
for a really long time.

2507
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,220
You're still fine?

2508
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,460
- Did she finish drawing?
- I think she's done.

2509
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:21,800
But...

2510
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:23,500
This is a bit hard.

2511
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,600
- Goodness.
- How did she draw it?

2512
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:26,830
That's really hard.

2513
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:29,440
- Hold on.
- What's that?

2514
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,200
(They first set off.)

2515
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:36,580
No!

2516
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,350
(The maverick of
the butterfly stroke world goes ahead.)

2517
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,880
Nice butterfly stroke.

2518
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,220
Nice butterfly stroke!

2519
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,420
It's a systematic butterfly stroke.

2520
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,590
He learned it properly.

2521
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,890
- When did he learn it?
- The butterfly stroke...

2522
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,160
He learned it properly.

2523
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,730
- Butterfly stroke.
- Butterfly stroke.

2524
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,330
Just get on top.

2525
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:56,300
What's that?

2526
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,300
What?

2527
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,200
That would be hard to guess.

2528
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:01,370
That's...

2529
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,400
- What is that?
- What's this?

2530
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:05,910
What's this?

2531
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:07,870
What is that?

2532
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:08,940
(They both seem clueless.)

2533
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,210
What is this?

2534
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,250
Good. Good going, MIYEON.

2535
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,280
Good, MIYEON. Yes.

2536
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,550
- MIYEON got on it.
- I can't see.

2537
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,050
- Three, two...
- There.

2538
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:22,090
- I can't do an expression, right?
- Say it.

2539
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,090
One.

2540
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,190
What is it?

2541
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:27,260
- Jaringobi.
- Five, four...

2542
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:28,730
- Get out.
- Eating fish.

2543
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:29,800
Get out.

2544
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:34,300
Is this a squid, a bird, or what?

2545
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,470
I really can't tell.

2546
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:38,370
- It's so hard.
- I can't tell.

2547
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:42,540
To give you a hint,
the category is proverb.

2548
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,210
- It's a proverb, Ye Eun.
- A proverb.

2549
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,950
- A proverb.
- Just say any proverb you know.

2550
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,380
Look carefully. It's a proverb.

2551
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:53,420
(Ye Eun got the previous proverb
correct in one go.)

2552
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:56,160
(Will she guess it correctly
on the first attempt?)

2553
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,190
- Can you tell?
- What's the answer, Ye Eun?

2554
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:00,060
The birthday party of the kings?

2555
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,730
"The birthday party of the kings?"

2556
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,330
(The birthday party of the kings)

2557
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:07,300
There is no such proverb.

2558
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,070
- The birthday party of the kings?
- Hey, Ye Eun.

2559
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:13,040
- There is no such proverb.
- Such a proverb doesn't exist.

2560
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,110
(MIYEON climbs up again.)

2561
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:16,710
Let's do it, MIYEON!

2562
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,150
- Get on top.
- Do you know the answer?

2563
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,250
- No.
- Why do you keep going there?

2564
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,480
(Laughing)

2565
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,490
Share even a single bean.

2566
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:27,620
(Share even a single bean.)

2567
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:28,620
What is it?

2568
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:30,060
- That's...
- What is it?

2569
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,830
- Should I tell you?
- Yes.

2570
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,530
- You're doing well, MIYEON.
- Drinking the kimchi stew...

2571
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:35,730
when it's not certain the person
with rice cakes will give it.

2572
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,230
It's difficult.

2573
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,730
It's really hard.

2574
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:39,970
(Answer)

2575
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:41,700
You have to match it
with the drawing.

2576
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,140
For your information,
it includes food.

2577
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,610
(This is the rice cake.)

2578
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:46,810
(This is the kimchi.)

2579
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:47,840
What is it?

2580
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,610
(This is the kimchi.)

2581
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:50,880
But...

2582
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:54,150
(Haha seems to have noticed.
He goes to the tube.)

2583
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,880
(Would he have noticed
the rice cake and the kimchi soup?)

2584
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,120
- Giving...
- I don't think they'll get it.

2585
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,290
What is it?

2586
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:02,590
- What's the answer?
- Okay.

2587
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,660
Giving one more rice cake
to the one you hate.

2588
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:05,690
Haha.

2589
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:07,560
(Incorrect)

2590
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,430
(His answer is wrong, but he noticed
this was a rice cake!)

2591
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,760
- You're almost there.
- Ye Eun.

2592
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:13,100
Think of the ones with that.

2593
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,200
What?

2594
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,900
I think you're the only person
who knows, Haha.

2595
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,940
- Let's go, Ye Eun.
- Match it with the drawing.

2596
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,810
- Say the proverb you remember.
- Match it with the drawing.

2597
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,010
Right!

2598
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:26,610
(MIYEON gets on the tube again!)

2599
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:28,720
- MIYEON is there!
- One with rice cake.

2600
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,080
- What about the rice cake?
- Two...

2601
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,750
Eating rice cakes together.

2602
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:34,320
(Empty Head Cho's new proverb:
Eating rice cakes together)

2603
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,690
- Eating rice cakes together.
- Eating rice cakes together.

2604
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,990
MIYEON.

2605
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:42,330
You're making many proverbs
and Chinese idioms today.

2606
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,400
- Here...
- Listen to Ji Hyo's...

2607
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,870
- explanation.
- These are here.

2608
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,870
(The great artist
explains her work.)

2609
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:50,640
- And this and this.
- What?

2610
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,140
- What is this?
- Even if you tell them,

2611
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,140
they wouldn't know. It's so hard.

2612
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,740
Something about giving rice cake...

2613
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,280
(Haha came up with the answer
after hearing the poor explanation.)

2614
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,980
- Haha!
- Ye Eun!

2615
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,010
- That's it.
- It's here.

2616
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,450
- Ye Eun.
- Go.

2617
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:03,280
MIYEON! We have "giving rice cake."

2618
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,380
- Go, MIYEON!
- But...

2619
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,020
MIYEON keeps going there.

2620
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,220
Ye Eun. Let me answer.

2621
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,360
I sat here. Let me answer.

2622
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,590
- She'll answer.
- Yes.

2623
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,230
You think of getting
the seaweed soup...

2624
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:14,430
when it's not certain the person
with rice cakes will give it.

2625
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:15,700
That's wrong!

2626
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,700
(Ye Eun's answer is wrong!)

2627
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,070
It's not seaweed soup!

2628
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,870
Don't say what you want to eat now.

2629
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:23,140
- Ye Eun...
- But why is MIYEON laughing?

2630
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:25,740
MIYEON.

2631
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,110
Why are you laughing?

2632
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:30,680
- It's funny if you know the answer.
- Go.

2633
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,550
(Laughing)

2634
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:36,220
The food here is a certain soup.

2635
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,350
- It's soup.
- Isn't it seaweed soup?

2636
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,350
It's not.

2637
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,050
It's another soup!

2638
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,350
I...

2639
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,590
Wait.

2640
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,530
(They have almost everything!)

2641
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:46,790
- Haha said something now.
- He knows.

2642
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:47,830
Stop him.

2643
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,230
Haha...

2644
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:51,000
(Laughing)

2645
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,030
We're doing something here.
They're using their power.

2646
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:55,370
(The weak three are battling.)

2647
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:56,900
Haha. Give it to MIYEON, Ye Eun.

2648
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,470
- Give it to MIYEON.
- MIYEON.

2649
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:00,710
- Give it to MIYEON.
- Give it to MIYEON.

2650
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:02,410
Give it to MIYEON, please.

2651
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:03,880
- I'm her fan.
- Give it to her.

2652
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,110
- Let's give it to MIYEON.
- Okay. Get on top.

2653
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,480
Let's give it to MIYEON.

2654
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:09,120
- Go on, MIYEON.
- What soup would it be?

2655
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,220
Let's go!

2656
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,720
- It's not Kim Jong Kook.
- You think of drinking water...

2657
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,920
when it's not certain the person
with rice cakes will give it.

2658
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,490
No.

2659
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:16,520
(Incorrect)

2660
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,960
(Ms. Cho Mi Yeon
goes her way and ignores the hint.)

2661
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,090
- Nice.
- Nice!

2662
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:20,990
You've come a long way.

2663
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,660
- Ye Eun.
- You're almost there.

2664
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,360
- You're almost there.
- Drinking the kimchi stew...

2665
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,570
when it's not certain the person
with rice cakes will give it.

2666
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:27,630
That's right.

2667
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,940
(Ji Ye Eun is correct.)

2668
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,540
(Right!)

2669
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:34,140
- Haha.
- Good!

2670
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,940
(Captain Ji did a great job
by getting two answers right.)

2671
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:39,010
MIYEON. Look at MIYEON.

2672
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,980
(Laughing)

2673
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:44,750
(The beautiful smile of the loser
who did her best)

2674
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,320
- What did you do, MIYEON?
- But...

2675
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,920
- She's happy.
- She's a nice person.

2676
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,220
- MIYEON.
- You're cheerful.

2677
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:52,490
- You're cheerful.
- Come out.

2678
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:54,560
- MIYEON is cheerful.
- Come out.

2679
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,730
Very cheerful.

2680
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,660
We won.

2681
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,170
It's done.

2682
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,230
You were cheerful.

2683
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:02,000
(Team Ye Eun won 1st place
thanks to Ye Eun.)

2684
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,040
- As long as you were cheerful.
- MIYEON is so funny.

2685
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,570
- She was so funny.
- You were funny.

2686
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,270
I told you that the first team...

2687
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,780
- will get a benefit.
- Right.

2688
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:12,350
This time, 2 of the 3 members...

2689
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:14,950
can check and swap their clams.

2690
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,680
- Really?
- The other person...

2691
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,620
can decide the order
of breaking the clams.

2692
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,590
You can decide the matchups.

2693
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:23,320
You can place them at the bottom
so they'll climb up.

2694
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,830
For example,
if you place Jong Kook at the end,

2695
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:27,990
- he has to fight...
- He has to climb up.

2696
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,600
- more and more people.
- His clam would also break.

2697
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,560
Right. So one person...

2698
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,900
- can decide that.
- Then...

2699
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,400
- The other two can swap clams.
- Okay.

2700
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,400
You can decide between yourselves.

2701
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:39,270
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?
- The first and second...

2702
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:40,540
(They'll decide
through rock-paper-scissors.)

2703
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:42,640
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2704
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,040
- I won.
- Yes.

2705
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,080
- Let's say I won.
- Okay.

2706
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:47,650
Go ahead.

2707
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,550
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2708
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:50,750
I lost again.

2709
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,250
Then Jae Seok will decide
the matchups.

2710
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,790
The rest will check...

2711
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:56,720
- I'll swap.
- and swap.

2712
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,490
Ye Eun will check first.

2713
01:25:58,490 --> 01:25:59,560
Okay.

2714
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:01,690
I didn't swap mine even once.

2715
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,660
I haven't been there.

2716
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,270
Have you been there?

2717
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:07,470
- I have. I swapped mine.
- You've been there, right?

2718
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,200
Who here hasn't been there at all?

2719
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,270
You, Ye Eun, and I.

2720
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:12,740
It's only you and I
who haven't been there.

2721
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:13,810
But I'll be going later.

2722
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,580
- It's only you.
- It's only me?

2723
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,510
- I'm the only one?
- Yes.

2724
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:20,180
(Seok Sam hasn't seen
any other clam since the opening.)

2725
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:21,710
What will you choose?

2726
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,620
Can I only test one?

2727
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,350
You can choose one.

2728
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:27,650
(It's the last chance
to swap the clams.)

2729
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,090
(What clam will they choose?)

2730
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,120
I'll...

2731
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,760
Daniel or Ye Eun
would have taken mine.

2732
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,060
We'll break with these now.

2733
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,900
The ungpi clam looks good.

2734
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,600
- Ji Ye Eun.
- Ye Eun...

2735
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,800
- Right.
- She took mine.

2736
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,200
(Jong Kook's smooth clam
swapped with her short-necked clam)

2737
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,540
- She took Jong Kook's.
- Yes.

2738
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,810
Daniel took MIYEON's horned turban.

2739
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:47,810
- Really?
- Really?

2740
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:49,680
- No.
- She gave me the short-necked clam.

2741
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,740
The last person is the best.

2742
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,380
Smooth clam.

2743
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:55,450
(Ye Eun tested the smooth clam.)

2744
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,150
(Short-necked clam
versus smooth clam)

2745
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:58,750
It broke.

2746
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,590
I'll take the smooth clam.

2747
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,820
(She got back her smooth clam
that Jong Kook took!)

2748
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,790
The horned turban.

2749
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:07,690
Sharp things definitely
penetrate flat things.

2750
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:09,430
I'll take the horned turban.

2751
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:11,200
(He chooses the horned turban
with a great logic.)

2752
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:14,270
Clam Champion Match in Gyeongju.

2753
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,710
- Do I decide the matchups?
- Yes.

2754
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:19,940
- To add, penalty balls...
- Yes?

2755
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:22,610
will be added in the order
of when they're broken,

2756
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:27,210
- from 9, 8, 7, and so on.
- Yes.

2757
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,880
I didn't touch yours.

2758
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,480
- All right. I'll put our members...
- Yes.

2759
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,620
- in the later spots.
- Yes.

2760
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,920
Okay.

2761
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,920
- Then those...
- The weak ones.

2762
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,520
The weak ones should start first.

2763
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,360
- Hen clam?
- Surf clam...

2764
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:41,090
- and short-necked clam.
- Short-necked clam?

2765
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:43,100
- Who will attack?
- Who will attack?

2766
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,300
- Who will hit it?
- I should do it.

2767
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,370
You should start with the weakest.

2768
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:46,430
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2769
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,640
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors. Rock.

2770
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:49,900
(Surf Clam Seok Jin attacks.)

2771
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:50,940
What's that?

2772
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:54,040
I wanted to show you my skills.

2773
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:56,340
Place it below, hold it, and hit it.

2774
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:57,880
Do it however you want.

2775
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:58,880
Place the surf clam.

2776
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,150
There are skills.

2777
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,380
- The surf clam would just break.
- Really?

2778
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:06,290
(Jong Kook compared the surf clam
and the short-necked clam earlier.)

2779
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:11,490
(They both break.)

2780
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:14,830
(The surf clam
and the short-necked clam both broke.)

2781
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:18,260
(How will it go this time?)

2782
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,300
(The surf clam attacks.)

2783
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:24,400
(The short-necked clam was crushed.)

2784
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,570
- What?
- It survived.

2785
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,410
The short-necked clam broke.

2786
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:28,540
- It survived.
- Good.

2787
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:31,080
The short-necked clam broke.

2788
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,410
- It survived.
- Jong Kook with the surf clam...

2789
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:34,780
- Then the next...
- will get nine penalty balls.

2790
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,220
(The next opponent
of the surf clam...)

2791
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,850
is the hazelnut ark.

2792
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:40,790
- It's MIYEON's.
- It's mine.

2793
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:41,790
- That one.
- This one?

2794
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:42,820
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- You should do rock-paper-scissors.

2795
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:44,790
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2796
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,390
- Okay.
- MIYEON.

2797
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:47,730
- That attacks better.
- If it doesn't...

2798
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:50,400
If it doesn't break at one go,
the other person will attack.

2799
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:52,430
Hit it here.

2800
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:54,370
- Don't hit it with this.
- Okay.

2801
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,070
- Hit it hard.
- Right there.

2802
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:57,540
Use that part.

2803
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,170
- I don't think it will break.
- It won't.

2804
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,640
- Just hit it.
- Hit it.

2805
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,440
- Wait.
- No.

2806
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,010
- Hit it.
- It's my turn.

2807
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,910
- No.
- He said, "It's my turn."

2808
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:07,510
Seok Jin is cold.

2809
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:09,450
Isn't it my turn? You did it once.
How many times will you do it?

2810
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:10,450
Hold on!

2811
01:29:10,450 --> 01:29:12,520
- Hit it here.
- Seok Jin.

2812
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,550
- Hit it here.
- He's merciless.

2813
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,790
- Goodness.
- She crushed it.

2814
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,260
(The surf clam was crushed.)

2815
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,190
The hazelnut ark won.

2816
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:20,430
It got crushed.

2817
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:21,690
- We'll add...
- It got crushed.

2818
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,430
eight penalty balls for Seok Jin.

2819
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:25,400
- Too bad.
- Next...

2820
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,770
The smooth clam should go.

2821
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:27,800
(Hazelnut Ark MIYEON's
next opponent)

2822
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,140
- Why?
- It will be abalone.

2823
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,400
- The abalone is really weak.
- Abalone.

2824
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,670
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2825
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:35,810
- No!
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

2826
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:36,880
- They did.
- We did.

2827
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,180
- I think the abalone would break.
- The abalone is really weak.

2828
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:40,680
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- It's weak. It gets crushed.

2829
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:44,550
(It got crushed
even by an ungpi clam.)

2830
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,450
(It got crushed
by a hard clam as well.)

2831
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:50,560
- Haha's will break.
- It depends on how you hit it.

2832
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,560
- Haha's will break.
- Right.

2833
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,990
I think the abalone will break.

2834
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,130
(Will the abalone be crushed
by the hazelnut ark as well?)

2835
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,900
Right. It depends
on how you break it.

2836
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:58,430
The abalone...

2837
01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:00,100
(Abalone versus hazelnut ark)

2838
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:02,140
(The hazelnut ark lost.)

2839
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:06,410
(Against everyone's expectations,
the abalone won!)

2840
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:07,410
When you hit it...

2841
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:08,810
- Attacking is better.
- Next...

2842
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:10,410
- Nice.
- MIYEON...

2843
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,710
- gets seven penalty balls.
- Okay.

2844
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:12,710
(MIYEON gets 7 penalty balls.)

2845
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,810
Next will be the hen clam.

2846
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:16,220
- Hen clam.
- Hen clam.

2847
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,280
(Ji Hyo's hen clam enters.)

2848
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,550
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
Rock-paper-scissors.

2849
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,660
- Okay.
- It's better to hit first.

2850
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,290
You have to win
the rock-paper-scissors.

2851
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,930
You have to hit the weak spot.

2852
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:28,660
Hitting is better.

2853
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,530
- Hitting is definitely better.
- Seriously.

2854
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:34,200
(Will he succeed in the attack
this time as well?)

2855
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:37,770
(The hen clam was defeated as well.)

2856
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:39,910
- Right.
- He won.

2857
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:41,510
- Haha's is strong.
- Okay.

2858
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,310
- Awesome.
- That's nice.

2859
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:45,580
Bring it.

2860
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,680
Next...

2861
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,880
- Send the smooth clam.
- is the ungpi clam.

2862
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,950
- It's strong.
- The ungpi clam will go.

2863
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:53,520
- This...
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2864
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,690
- Se Chan.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2865
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,260
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2866
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,390
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2867
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,390
Bring it here.
(Ungpi clam versus abalone)

2868
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,990
- "Bring it here?"
- "Bring it here."

2869
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,130
I think it will be strong.

2870
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,430
Mine is strong.

2871
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:05,700
Se Chan swapped
the abalone for this.

2872
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,500
(Ssaebssaeb already crushed
the abalone with the ungpi clam.)

2873
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:11,640
I'm getting curious.

2874
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,410
(The abalone didn't break.)

2875
01:31:15,410 --> 01:31:17,880
(The ungpi clam survived too.)

2876
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:20,510
Okay. It's my turn.

2877
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:21,710
(It's Haha's turn to attack.)

2878
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:22,820
Why did you do that?

2879
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:24,150
I thought it would break.

2880
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:27,190
(Will the abalone get
3 consecutive wins?)

2881
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:28,390
You have to hit it hard.

2882
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,660
- You hit the weak spot.
- Goodness.

2883
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,730
- You hit the weak spot.
- Goodness.

2884
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:35,160
(The abalone lost.)

2885
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,500
(The underdog lost
because of the accumulated damage.)

2886
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,370
That broke.

2887
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:40,700
- Nice.
- This is funny.

2888
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,700
This is so funny.

2889
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,200
- No way.
- Yes.

2890
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,210
- You swapped them.
- The smooth clam.

2891
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,410
Move.

2892
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:49,980
- The smooth clam.
- Move out of the way.

2893
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,310
- Let's go.
- The smooth clam is strong too.

2894
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:52,350
- It's strong.
- It's strong.

2895
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,910
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2896
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:55,510
(Ungpi clam versus smooth clam)

2897
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,150
Attacking is better.

2898
01:31:57,150 --> 01:32:00,820
(Will Ye Eun's smooth clam
endure the attack?)

2899
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:03,320
Hit it there.

2900
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,420
- Both broke.
- Both broke.

2901
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,430
(Both broke.)

2902
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:08,130
We'll give you new ones.

2903
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:09,500
Amazing.

2904
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:11,330
You can win this time.

2905
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:12,370
It's me.

2906
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,300
I think yours is stronger.

2907
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,140
- I think so too.
- He hit it.

2908
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,970
The ungpi clam would have been
crushed by the smooth clam.

2909
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:18,970
It would have been crushed.

2910
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:21,410
- The smooth clam is really strong.
- Really?

2911
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:22,410
Be careful of your hands.

2912
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:23,540
Hit the front part.

2913
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:24,910
- Okay. The front.
- Yes.

2914
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:25,910
The front...

2915
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:27,880
(Smooth clam versus ungpi clam)

2916
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,920
(The ungpi clam endured the attack!)

2917
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,490
I won!

2918
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,150
- The horned turban.
- The horned turban? Okay.

2919
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,990
- The ungpi clam is strong.
- The ungpi clam is strong.

2920
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:39,290
- I told you it was strong.
- It's strong.

2921
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,430
(The ungpi clam with a bear's skin
reached the semi-finals.)

2922
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:42,400
How far will you go, Se Chan?

2923
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,800
- You're almost there.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2924
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,070
The hard clam really looks hard.

2925
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:47,400
- You're almost there.
- Right.

2926
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,500
- The hard clam is yours?
- Yes.

2927
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,900
You'd win.

2928
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:50,970
The hard clam is strong too.

2929
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:53,110
He came quite far.

2930
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:55,340
- The horned turban.
- The horned turban? Okay.

2931
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,410
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2932
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,540
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2933
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,010
- Okay. I won.
- Goodness.

2934
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:00,610
- I said the ungpi clam was hard.
- But...

2935
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:03,180
- Hold on. I'll set...
- Right.

2936
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:04,420
- the stage.
- This is serious.

2937
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,350
I don't think this would break.

2938
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:07,550
- It won't break.
- It won't.

2939
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:09,520
- You should aim for the weak point.
- Is that the strongest?

2940
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,090
- It won't break.
- I don't think it will break.

2941
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:12,160
Aim for the weak spot.

2942
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,560
(Who will win at the semi-finals?)

2943
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,630
Right next to it.

2944
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,600
(Who will win at the semi-finals?)

2945
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,130
Goodness.

2946
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,470
It's strong.

2947
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,700
Goodness.

2948
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:23,800
(Daniel's horned turban
went to the finals.)

2949
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:26,270
- The horned turban...
- The horned turban is really hard.

2950
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:28,310
The horned turban is strong.

2951
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:30,180
- It's that strong?
- The horned turban...

2952
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,980
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- is the best.

2953
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:33,280
You never know.
The horned turban is strong.

2954
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,750
The horned turban is amazing.

2955
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:35,880
(He rose to the 2nd place
after swapping his at the end.)

2956
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,120
The last one. This is the finals.

2957
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,780
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Is it your turn, Jae Seok?

2958
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,290
(Jae Seok's hard clam
versus Daniel's horned turban)

2959
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:45,560
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

2960
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:47,190
- Okay.
- The horned turban...

2961
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:48,290
is the strongest..

2962
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,430
Is it the small one?

2963
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:52,230
The horned turban is the best.

2964
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:54,500
Okay. Use the powerful point.

2965
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,870
- Use the hard point.
- If he can't break it, I'll...

2966
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,740
You can do it.

2967
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:01,440
- You'll do it like that?
- Yes. That's better.

2968
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,610
- Right there. On the front.
- The thin part.

2969
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:05,610
- Right.
- It worked.

2970
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:06,610
This broke too.
- Have a rematch.
- It broke too.

2971
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:09,250
But it's still alive.

2972
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,620
It's broken, though.

2973
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:12,080
- If it broke, that's not counted.
- It's broken.

2974
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,650
- We should do it again.
- Then Jae Seok will attack.

2975
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:15,250
- I'll attack now.
- Yes.

2976
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:16,420
- Okay.
- Good.

2977
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,620
Jae Seok.
That horned turban is strong.

2978
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:20,130
- Seriously.
- The horned turban is strong.

2979
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,730
- It's just as it looks.
- To this side...

2980
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:23,130
It's just as it looks.

2981
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,300
- This part is strong.
- Yes.

2982
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,270
This part is strong.

2983
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:29,170
But this hard clam
looks really strong.

2984
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,400
It really looks strong.

2985
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:33,270
I think it would break
if I hit it like this.

2986
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,870
- Okay.
- If it doesn't break...

2987
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:36,310
The hard clam is thick.

2988
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:37,710
At the end...

2989
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:38,810
- Okay.
- If it doesn't break,

2990
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:40,180
you can hit the thin part.

2991
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,210
(If Jae Seok succeeds, he wins.
But if he loses, it's a rematch.)

2992
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:43,820
(What will the result be?)

2993
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:47,390
(The horned turban lost.)

2994
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:51,320
(Jae Seok's hard clam
takes the final victory.)

2995
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,360
- Congratulations.
- Amazing.

2996
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:54,390
Jae Seok's clam...

2997
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,230
- That was mine.
- survived until the end...

2998
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:57,800
- and became the champion.
- That was mine.

2999
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,830
(The clam champion
is the hard clam.)

3000
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:01,530
- It was the hard clam.
- It was the hard clam.

3001
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,340
(Jae Seok takes 1st place.)

3002
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:08,240
The Splitting Fighter Race
in Gyeongju ended.

3003
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,810
We'll first give Jae Seok,
the winner,

3004
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:12,410
- his prize.
- Really? What is it?

3005
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:14,110
He's the man of Gyeongju.

3006
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:17,550
Gyeongju and I get along well.

3007
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:18,550
- What is it?
- Bread?

3008
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:19,890
- The Cheomseongdae Observatory.
- The Cheomseongdae Observatory.

3009
01:35:19,890 --> 01:35:21,420
- What is this?
- It's pretty.

3010
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,620
- The Cheomseongdae Observatory.
- The prize...

3011
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,790
is a limited edition
Cheomseongi doll for APEC...

3012
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:26,660
- and Gyeongju's souvenirs.
- I'm jealous.

3013
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,430
- That's amazing.
- Jae Seok.

3014
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:30,030
- This is nice, but...
- I'm so jealous.

3015
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:32,430
- I'm jealous.
- I'm so jealous.

3016
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:34,200
- Is this...
- Jae Seok.

3017
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,430
You'd sleep well if you hugged this.

3018
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:38,170
- Right.
- Hug this...

3019
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:39,510
- It's so cute.
- when you go home.

3020
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:41,040
- Okay.
- Your wife would love this.

3021
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,140
Silla's smile.

3022
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:46,880
Now, we'll choose three members
who will get the penalty.

3023
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,880
- I'd get it. I have nine.
- What's the penalty?

3024
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,750
Nine, eight, seven, six.

3025
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:54,620
- The penalty.
- The penalty also existed in Silla.

3026
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,990
Getting a finger flick on your nose.

3027
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:57,460
- What?
- On the nose?

3028
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,790
Jae Seok who won...

3029
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:00,860
- will flick the noses of the three.
- Goodness.

3030
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:02,460
- I'm an expert.
- Flick them well.

3031
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:04,230
- The first person.
- It hurts a lot.

3032
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:05,430
People without...

3033
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:08,400
You know that my nose trembled
because of someone before, right?

3034
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,270
- So, the first one.
- Goodness, it's MIYEON.

3035
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:11,440
- MIYEON.
- Oh, dear.

3036
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,710
- MIYEON.
- MIYEON.

3037
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:13,870
- I can't believe it.
- It's you.

3038
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:15,670
MIYEON is giving us everything
before she goes.

3039
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:17,680
But is it okay for you
to get flicked in the nose?

3040
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:19,610
- This is my real nose.
- This is really strong.

3041
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:20,710
MIYEON, is that your real nose?

3042
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:21,980
- It is!
- Oh, really?

3043
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,080
You're proving it here.

3044
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,650
- Don't worry.
- I'll flick you with this finger.

3045
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,090
- Will you go easy on her?
- Okay. In 1, 2...

3046
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:27,790
(Flicking her on the nose
that her parents gave her)

3047
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:29,860
- That must hurt.
- It must hurt.

3048
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:30,920
- All right.
- I trust you.

3049
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:31,990
- Okay.
- That was funny.

3050
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,160
Oh, dear. It's Jee Seok Jin.

3051
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:34,430
(Big Nose is chosen.)

3052
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:36,600
Come on. You're lying.

3053
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,760
- No, for real.
- Don't lie.

3054
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:41,170
(It stings.)

3055
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,970
- Gosh, that was spicy.
- It looks like it hurts.

3056
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:44,300
Song Ji Hyo.

3057
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,770
Why me?

3058
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:46,870
In 1, 2...

3059
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:49,010
Gosh, you scratched her.

3060
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,540
- Okay.
- That's it.

3061
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:51,910
Good job.

3062
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:53,280
Well,

3063
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:56,080
- I had fun in Gyeongju today.
- It was great.

3064
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,620
Every time we come to Gyeongju...

3065
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:58,950
- Yes.
- Right, we make memories here.

3066
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,250
- We make great memories.
- Right.

3067
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:03,120
We hope that the APEC summit meeting
that will be held in Gyeongju...

3068
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:05,520
- is a great success.
- Yes.

3069
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,390
Once again, thank you to everyone
who joined us for the show.

3070
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:09,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3071
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,800
- Thank you.
- Good job, everyone.

3072
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,030
(Let's meet again, cheerful MIYEON,
who came all the way to Gyeongju!)

3073
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,670
(Running Man visits
the main character of the day.)

3074
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:15,870
(We meet Ms. Ji Ye Eun,
who has just entered society...)

3075
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:16,940
(and has moved into her new home.)

3076
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,500
(Everyone says my house looks
like a cozy Airbnb.)

3077
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:20,240
(A house that trapped
in an unidentifiable concept)

3078
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,310
(To teach the mood-obsessed
youngest member a lesson,)

3079
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:23,040
(her seniors in life swoop in
with their hands full.)

3080
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:24,210
(At the sudden crowd of visitors,)

3081
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:25,210
(Ddochi is taken aback.)

3082
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:26,980
- Hey, turn on the lights.
- I can't turn on the lights.

3083
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,610
- The mood...
- Hey, seriously?

3084
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:30,020
(No fluorescent lights allowed!
But welcome drinks are provided.)

3085
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,120
This is kombucha.

3086
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,180
(Her hospitality is all about mood
with no substance whatsoever.)

3087
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:33,690
You won't save up any money.

3088
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:34,820
(Starting to nag)

3089
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,890
It's not that. I only rest at home.

3090
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,890
(The staff's present for Ye Eun
who let them shoot at her house)

3091
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:39,960
(Ears perking up)

3092
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,890
(But she can't get it so easily.)

3093
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,060
(Even if they get past
the 1st stage,)

3094
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:45,430
(she can only keep the gifts
with the syllable she picks in the name.)

3095
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,500
A recorder.

3096
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,530
(Their skills can't keep up
with their will.)

3097
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:48,630
(Canolulu?)

3098
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,740
It's ca...

3099
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,240
(This housewarming is one thing
after another. How will it end?)

3100
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,240
Lee Seok Sam.

3101
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,470
(Happy Ye Eun Day)
